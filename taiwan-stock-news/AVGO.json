      "Content": "6 under-the-radar stocks to play the AI boom in 2026: BofA\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 7:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRDO\n\nALAB\n\nMTSI\n\nTER\n\nWhile players like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) are at the forefront of investors’ minds, smaller specialized players are grabbing a slice of the AI spending behind the scenes.\nIn a recent report, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya named a handful of small- to mid-cap companies as the unsung heroes of the semiconductor surge.\n\n\"We mentioned a few companies on the smid-cap side, Credo, MKS, Advanced Energy, MACOM, and Teradyne,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call.\nWhile these companies lack the massive margins of Nvidia, Arya suggests they are currently benefitting from being the primary providers of essential technologies.\nThe scale of the unsung opportunity is staggering. BofA predicts the total addressable market for AI data center systems will exceed $1.2 trillion by 2030, fueled by a 38% compound annual growth rate. Within that, AI accelerators will grab around $900 billion, but that leaves a massive $300 billion slice — one that depends on secondary technologies like networking, cables, and power systems.\nArya breaks down how the pie is divided. For every $100 spent on AI hardware, $15 to $20 goes into networking. A third flows directly into interconnects — the wires and optical components that let GPUs talk to each other. As AI clusters expand, these bits and bolts of the trillion-dollar build-out are seeing a direct benefit.\n\nArya highlights Credo ( CRDO ) for its leadership in active electrical cables. As data centers prioritize \"performance per watt,\" Credo's niche technology is critical. \"They want to make sure that all these GPUs talk to each other, very effectively,\" he said.\nHe also pointed to Astera Labs ( ALAB ) and its robust high-speed connectivity efforts via PCIe 6.0, the standard for moving data between a computer's motherboard and its hardware.\n\"They were the ones who invested in specific technologies ... nobody cared about these categories,\" he said. \"So now, they are benefitting from being the only people standing in those specific niche technologies.\"\nOther key players, such as MKS Instruments ( MKSI ) and Advanced Energy ( AEIS ), provide the precision power and vacuum systems needed to actually build chips. If Nvidia is the architect, these companies provide the machinery and high-voltage power to keep the site running.\nMeanwhile, MACOM ( MTSI ) provides high-speed analog and optical components that let these \"brains\" interact, while Teradyne ( TER ) serves as a final checkpoint. The company's automated testing equipment ensures these expensive components actually work before they are shipped.\n\nStory Continues\nStill, a healthy dose of skepticism is required. Unlike Nvidia, which can sell a single GPU for $30,000, the interconnect players like Credo and Astera face a brutal reality: pricing compression.\n\"Of course, they are not going to get these multiples forever,\" Arya said.\nArya warns that transceiver prices often fall from $1 per gigabit to $0.50 in just a few months.\n\n\"They can never hold pricing right, so you will never see them quite grow as fast as the accelerator or the logic companies,\" he explained. While their gross margins are currently 35%-40%, they are nowhere near Nvidia's \"different galaxy\" levels of 70% plus.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy that Could Soar As Much as 40%, 35%, and 640%, According to Wall Street\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:35 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: NFLX\n\nWSFX.BO\n\nAVGO\n\nNOW\n\nKey Points Netflix is the indomitable leader in streaming, and its advertising segment is gaining steam.\nBroadcom supplies infrastructure to hyperscalers, and it backlog of AI revenue is growing.\nServiceNow's cloud business is robust and its AI solutions serve major customers.\n10 stocks we like better than Netflix ›\n\nA stock split is a corporate action where a company divides its existing shares into multiple new shares, which increases the total share count while proportionally decreasing the price per share. This can make the stock more affordable and liquid for investors without changing the total market value of the company or an investor's stake.\nPlenty of stocks have initiated splits over the last several years, and some of those are quality businesses that could be poised to soar significantly in the coming years. If you have cash to put to work in stocks right now, here are three stock-split stocks to buy and hold for the long run that look to have significant upside potential.\n1. Netflix Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) enacted a 10-for-1 stock split that went into effect on Nov. 17, 2025. At the time of this writing, shares are trading around $94. Currently, the median 12-month price target from analysts on Wall Street is around $133, which would represent upside of about 40% from its current price. The high end of the available price estimate anticipates as much as 62% upside in the next 12 months.\n\nNetflix is increasingly benefiting from the growth engine of the ad-supported tier it launched in late 2022. The company is on pace to double its advertising business revenue in 2025 and its ads now reach 190 million monthly active viewers. This high- margin revenue stream provides a significant new path to profitability beyond traditional subscriptions.\nNetflix's expansion into live programming, featuring the NFL and WWE, has proven highly successful in driving both subscriber acquisition and retention, as well as breaking viewership records. These events also command premium advertising rates, helping the company gain market share in areas where it previously lagged. Regions such as the Asia-Pacific and Latin America are also experiencing faster subscriber growth, offering a large, unsaturated addressable market.\n\nIn Q3 2025, Netflix's growth and engagement reached record highs, thanks to a diversified content slate including breakout original films, returning series, and massive live sports events. The animated film KPop Demon Hunters was the primary growth driver of the quarter and became Netflix's most-watched film ever with 325 million views. The second season of Wednesday was a major tentpole that recorded over 1 billion viewing minutes in Q3. Black Rabbit was also a top-performing original series for the quarter that generated over 1.2 billion minutes of viewing.\n\nStory Continues\nThese hits contributed to a 17% year-over-year revenue increase (reaching $11.5 billion) and record viewing shares of 8.6% in the U.S. and 9.4% in the U.K. The content strength also fueled a record-breaking quarter for Netflix's advertising tier, with U.S. upfront commitments doubling from last year. Netflix continues to invest heavily in a diverse content pipeline and leverages its in-house adtech and data-driven recommendation algorithms to enhance user engagement and loyalty. The company is in the process of acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery in a massive $82.7 billion deal announced in early December 2025.\n\nAlthough regulatory scrutiny and industry concerns about monopolies are significant hurdles, this acquisition would bring HBO, Warner Bros. Discovery's film/TV studios, and streaming service under Netflix's umbrella. As Netflix transitions into a mature, cash-generating business model, it remains the undisputed leader in streaming, with its scale and brand power providing a significant competitive advantage over rivals. Long-term investors would do well to capitalize on that growth trajectory.\n2. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) executed a 10-for-1 stock split on July 15, 2024. At the time of this writing, shares trade for approximately $350 each, but some Wall Street analysts think the stock could realize an upside of 35% over the next 12 months, or even 58% on the high end. Since we're talking about stock splits, as a a side note, Broadcom's Canadian Depositary Receipts (CDRs), enacted a 6-for-1 stock split that took effect for trading on Nov. 14, 2025.\n\nBroadcom is a leading supplier of custom AI accelerators (ASICs) and Ethernet switches for hyperscale data centers. Its customers include the likes of Alphabet 's Google, Meta Platforms , Anthropic, and OpenAI. Broadcom reported a record revenue of $64 billion for fiscal year 2025. This represented a 24% increase compared to fiscal year 2024 revenue of $51.6 billion.\nAI semiconductor revenue for fiscal year 2025 was $20 billion, representing a 65% year-over-year growth, and management expects this figure to double in Q1 of its fiscal year 2026. Meanwhile, semiconductor solutions generated $37 billion in revenue during the fiscal year, representing a 58% increase from the previous year. Infrastructure software revenue increased 26% year over year to $27 billion, primarily driven by the adoption of VMware Cloud Foundation.\n\nThe acquisition of VMware in November 2023 positioned Broadcom as a full-stack AI infrastructure vendor with a significant presence in enterprise software. This segment provides stable, high-margin, recurring revenue that helps offset potential margin pressures from AI hardware.\nThe company ended fiscal 2025 with a robust backlog of $73 billion in AI-related hardware orders. Profitability also soared in fiscal 2025, with adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) hitting $43 billion (up 35%) and Broadcom reported significant free cash flow of $26.9 billion.\nBroadcom's dominant position in AI networking hardware, strong cash flow, high-margin software, and persistent AI demand are all positive indicators of where this business currently stands and where it's headed. This could be a compelling stock for long-term investors seeking to capitalize on a 'pick-and-shovel' play in the AI space.\n\n3. ServiceNow ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) executed a 5-for-1 stock split on Dec. 18, 2025, with shares trading on a split-adjusted basis starting that day. This means that shares trade now for roughly $155 each. Wall Street analysts seem to be particularly enthusiastic about ServiceNow's growth prospects, with the median 12-month price target coming in at 640% above its current share price. The high 12-month stock price forecast is approximately 735%.\n\nServiceNow is a cloud-based enterprise platform that helps businesses automate and manage their digital workflows across IT, HR, customer service, security, and other departments. Essentially, the business acts as a central control tower, connecting people, processes, and systems and replacing manual tasks with streamlined, AI-powered processes. The company is strategically positioned to capitalize on the generative AI boom with its Now Assist suite of products.\nThese AI solutions are gaining strong traction and are targeted to reach $1 billion in annual contract value by the end of 2026. ServiceNow's platform is used by over 85% of Fortune 500 companies. This deep integration creates high switching costs and it boasts a high renewal rate of around 96% or higher.\n\nServiceNow's customers are large enterprises and organizations across nearly every major industry, including Walmart , Amazon , Microsoft , Apple , JPMorgan Chase , and the U.S. Department of Defense. ServiceNow has recently made major acquisition moves, buying AI firm Moveworks for $2.85 billion in March 2025. The company is also reportedly nearing a potential $7 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Armis, which would add critical device security and asset intelligence to its offerings and address the growing need for AI governance.\nIn Q3 2025, ServiceNow reported subscription revenue of $3.3 billion, up 22% from one year ago. The current remaining performance obligations stood at $11.4 billion as of Q3 2025, representing a 21% year-over-year growth. ServiceNow also delivered adjusted EPS of $4.82 and adjusted free cash flow of $592 million with a 17.5% margin.\n\nAn analyst downgrade and news of ServiceNow's acquisition ambitions for Armis, which would be its largest-ever deal, have weighed on the stock recently. There has also been generally more volatility among tech stocks lately. However, investors who believe in the company's future as a key player in AI workflow automation may want to take a second look.\nShould you buy stock in Netflix right now?

      "Content": "3 Leading AI Stocks Investors Can Buy for 2026 (NVDA, AVGO, VRT)\n\nEthan Feller\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 10:58 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: VRT\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nThe market, and many leading AI stocks, are at an inflection point. In the near term, further volatility or even a pullback is possible. However, the longer-term opportunity remains compelling, with upside potential that extends well into 2026 and beyond.\nAI capital spending is projected to reach an estimated $571 billion in 2026, and Nvidia ( NVDA ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Vertiv ( VRT ) sit at the center of this historic infrastructure buildout. These companies are among the most critical enablers of the AI expansion.\n\nAfter running multiple screens focused on growth, valuation, and margin strength, these three names consistently rose to the top. Collectively, they represent exceptional businesses with durable competitive advantages and strong earnings power.\nDespite their leadership positions, these stocks are not stretched on valuation and in recent weeks have experienced earnings upgrades, giving two of them top Zacks Ranks.\nRecent months have been choppy in these stocks, with prices moving sideways to lower, leaving shares near technically important levels. Whether those levels hold or break in the short term is uncertain, but the risk-reward profile remains attractive at current prices regardless.\nEven if further downside materializes and bearish narratives resurface, any weakness is unlikely to persist given the scale and durability of AI-driven demand. If support holds, these stocks may already be positioning for their next leg higher.\nBelow, I will break down the recent developments, fundamental strength of these businesses and highlight a tactical trading plan using the technical charts.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia Stocks Breaks Out on Bullish Developments Nvidia continues to anchor the AI boom as the critical infrastructure provider through its leadership in GPU technology. While 2025 was comparatively subdued for the now roughly $4.5 trillion semiconductor giant, with shares delivering a tidy 42% return, the company has remained firmly on offense.\nOver the past week, Nvidia advanced its largest acquisition to date, agreeing to acquire assets from AI chip startup Groq in a deal valued at approximately $20 billion. Groq, founded by former Google TPU architects, develops high-performance inference-focused silicon that competes in certain AI workloads. While Groq described the transaction as a “non-exclusive licensing agreement,” the deal includes the integration of Groq’s CEO and senior leadership into Nvidia, signaling deeper strategic alignment.\nFrom a competitive standpoint, the acquisition strengthens Nvidia’s already formidable moat at the leading edge of AI semiconductors.\n\nStory Continues\nFundamentals also continue to move in the right direction. Analysts have resumed raising earnings estimates, earning Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) . Consensus forecasts for next year’s earnings have climbed nearly 16% over the past two months, and longer-term projections call for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years. At roughly 40.6x forward earnings, the valuation remains reasonable given Nvidia’s growth profile and its central role in the most powerful technology cycle in more than a decade.\n\nThe technical picture has also improved meaningfully. After months of choppy, volatile trading marked by sharp rallies and pullbacks, NVDA has made a decisive bullish turn. During the low-volume holiday period, the stock broke out from a clear descending bullish wedge, marking its most constructive advance in several months. As long as shares hold above the breakout level, the setup points to further upside as 2026 begins.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nBroadcom Shares Consolidate at Key Price Level Broadcom has been a core beneficiary of the AI boom since the trend began, but its importance has become even more apparent in recent months. After being viewed as a relative laggard for several years, Alphabet ( GOOGL ) has reasserted itself as a leader in AI and large language models. A major driver of that shift has been renewed appreciation for Alphabet’s proprietary hardware stack, most notably its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which Google has deployed internally for nearly a decade.\n\nBroadcom plays a critical role in that ecosystem. While TPUs are branded as Google-designed chips, Broadcom provides the underlying expertise in ASIC design, networking, and high-speed I/O, effectively enabling Google to scale these systems reliably at hyperscale. As Alphabet rapidly expands AI infrastructure across Search, cloud services, and generative AI models, custom silicon becomes economically unavoidable. Broadcom sits squarely at the center of that transition, helping design chips optimized for inference, training, and internal workloads, areas where generic GPUs are often less cost-efficient. As Alphabet’s AI leadership has become clearer, Broadcom’s strategic importance has risen alongside it.\nFrom a fundamentals perspective, Broadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) , reflecting a pause in earnings revisions rather than any deterioration in outlook. Consensus estimates still call for 35.7% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, and the stock trades at roughly 36x one-year forward earnings. Given that growth profile and Broadcom’s deep entrenchment in the AI infrastructure stack, valuation remains reasonable relative to peers.\n\nTechnically, Broadcom had been outperforming much of the AI complex in recent months as investors increasingly recognized its role within the Alphabet AI ecosystem. The sharp selloff following its most recent earnings report was less about weakening fundamentals and more about positioning and nuanced guidance, a classic “sell-the-news” event after a strong run. Importantly, shares found support at a level that has held up the stock since late summer. As long as that support holds, the consolidation looks constructive, and the near-term technical outlook remains encouraging.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nVertiv Stock Sits Within Trading Range Vertiv remains one of the purest plays on the physical backbone of the AI buildout, supplying critical power, cooling, and thermal-management solutions to hyperscale and enterprise data centers. Recent developments continue to reinforce that positioning. Over the past several months, Vertiv has announced expanded partnerships with large data center operators and hyperscalers, while management has highlighted strong backlog growth and improving visibility tied directly to AI-driven capacity expansion. Demand for high-density cooling solutions continues to exceed expectations as next-generation AI workloads push power and thermal limits higher.\n\nFundamentally, the story remains compelling. Vertiv currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as earnings estimates continue to trend higher. Consensus forecasts call for 30.2% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, reflecting operating leverage, improving margins, and sustained AI-related demand. While the stock trades at a 40.6x forward earnings multiple, that valuation appears justified given Vertiv’s growth rate, expanding addressable market, and increasingly important role in AI infrastructure.\nThe technical setup adds another layer of appeal. After a sharp advance earlier in the cycle, VRT has spent recent months consolidating within a well-defined trading range. Importantly, the stock recently bounced cleanly off support within its rising channel. The key level to watch on the upside is the ~$180 area, which marks the top of the current range. A decisive breakout above that level would likely signal the next leg higher, while continued support near the lower end of the channel keeps the risk-reward profile attractive.\n\nTaken together, Vertiv offers a differentiated way to participate in the AI boom—not through chips or software, but through the indispensable infrastructure that makes large-scale AI deployment possible. With fundamentals strengthening and the technical picture improving, VRT remains well positioned as investors look ahead to 2026.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy Shares in VRT, NVDA and AVGO? Taken together, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Vertiv offer complementary exposure to the core layers of the AI buildout—compute, custom silicon and networking, and physical infrastructure. While near-term volatility is always possible, fundamentals, earnings momentum, and long-term demand visibility remain firmly intact. With each stock positioned at a critical point in the AI value chain and trading near technically important levels, the current setup favors accumulation opportunistically as the AI investment cycle extends into 2026 and beyond.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "QCOM Rides on Strength in Premium Handset Market: Will it Sustain?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n2454.TW\n\nAAPL\n\nSSNLF\n\nQualcomm Incorporated ( QCOM ) generated about $6.96 billion in handset revenues in the latest quarter, with a year-over-year increase of 14% and an estimated $27.8 billion in fiscal 2025, contributing roughly 63% of the total company’s revenues. Qualcomm’s strong handset revenues are driven by its increased customer demand for Snapdragon-powered premium Android smartphones.\n\nQualcomm faces strong competition from rivals like MediaTek, especially in mid-range and budget smartphones, which puts pressure on its market share and pricing. U.S.-China trade tensions have reduced companies' handset demand to a great extent. Qualcomm's handset business experienced ongoing challenges as global smartphone demand slowed down day by day. Moreover, major handset manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, are moving toward in-house chip development. This is a major challenge for Qualcomm.\nTo overcome challenges in the smartphone business, Qualcomm is focusing on premium Snapdragon chips to stay competitive in flagship devices. Qualcomm recently launched the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, offering high-speed performance, advanced AI, improved graphics, and enhanced camera capabilities for flagship smartphones from global brands like iQOO , Honor, ASUS, OnePlus, and Vivo.\n\nPer a report from Precedence Research, the global 5G chipset market is expected to reach $126.4 billion by 2030 from $18.7 billion in 2022, with a CAGR of 27%, indicating strong underlying growth potential for Qualcomm’s handset segment in the near future. QCOM’s continuous innovation in powering flagship devices with cutting-edge features helps to boost its handset revenues, maintain leadership in the premium segment, and drive future revenue growth.\nOther Tech Companies Focused on Handset Chip Development Qualcomm faces competition from Apple, Inc. ( AAPL ) and Broadcom, Inc. ( AVGO ). Apple recently launched the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and upgraded Vision Pro, all powered by their M5 chip. Apple’s iPhone 17 series uses the A19 chip, and the iPhone Air features the A19 Pro chip, both offering faster performance, better graphics, and advanced AI capabilities. These recent chips strengthen Apple’s position in the smartphone market and reduce its reliance on third-party suppliers.\n\nBroadcom recently launched Wi Fi 8 chips for smartphones and connected devices, improving speed, reliability, and efficiency. Broadcom, by providing essential smartphone components like Wi Fi, Bluetooth, and RF chips for major brands, remains important in the handset market. The company also focuses on affordable LTE chips for emerging markets, helping OEMs bring affordable smartphones to countries like India.\n\nStory Continues\nQCOM’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Qualcomm shares have gained 11.1% over the past year compared with the industry ’s growth of 35.3%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/earnings ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 14.26 forward earnings, lower than 34.54 for the industry.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 2% to $12.15 over the past 60 days, while those for 2026 have risen 3.4% to $12.60.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQualcomm stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Broadcom Inc. is expected to post earnings of $2.01 per share, indicating a change of +25.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.6% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.69 points to a change of +42.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +6.3%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.68 indicates a change of +41.2% from what Broadcom Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +17.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Broadcom Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Broadcom Inc., the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.23 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +28.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $92.57 billion and $130.01 billion estimates indicate +44.9% and +40.4% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Broadcom Inc. reported revenues of $18.02 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.2%. EPS of $1.95 for the same period compares with $1.42 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.94%. The EPS surprise was +4.28%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBroadcom Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Broadcom Inc.. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) five-year earnings growth trails the 55% YoY shareholder returns\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nBuying shares in the best businesses can build meaningful wealth for you and your family. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. For example, the Broadcom Inc. ( NASDAQ:AVGO ) share price is up a whopping 705% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. And in the last week the share price has popped 7.4%. But this could be related to the buoyant market which is up about 3.1% in a week. It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.\n\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for Broadcom investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nOver half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 49% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 52% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here. .\n\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Broadcom the TSR over the last 5 years was 795%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nStory Continues\nA Different Perspective It's nice to see that Broadcom shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 47% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 55% per year, is even more impressive. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

If it doesn't, you know, the market's going to come off its wheels. But having said that, I mean, recently, you can look at, you know, some poster childs of the AI trade. You know, I think of an AI heavy name like an Nvidia. It's well off its 52-week high, Joseph, but this market has continued to grind higher. I'm just curious what you make of that.\n00:23 Joseph\nWell, I think that it it it bolsters the the thesis that the 493 certainly have legs. And I think that I think more broadly, the economy is stronger than people thought it would be when we started the year. Uh, rates are probably lower than uh, lower today than where where we thought they would be. Inflation is probably a tick lower uh, than we thought it would be. So the underlying conditions are somewhat better for the broad market and the broad market has been able to weather as you talked about, the bumps in the road that are inevitable uh uh with regard to the Mag 7 and and the AI trade. So, I think it's positive for the index as we enter 2026 that we've seen some level of broadening. And obviously, we see opportunities uh in the defense sector, uh in in healthcare and selectively in technology as well as as this rally continues to broaden.\n01:21 Speaker A\nYeah, let's get to some of those specific names and picks, Joseph. Uh you like Broadcom here for example. How come? What do you like about C.O. Hock Tan's company specifically? Is it the business model, margins, his AI story?\n01:40 Joseph\nWell, you know, our strategy is to invest in recurring revenue businesses and Broadcom has one of the great uh technology recurring revenue businesses. When you think about how they're positioned with regard to AI, they're really very, very well positioned uh in a category where the product, the GPU is 90% of the cost of the solution. And Broadcom with their XPUs is dramatically reducing the cost of effectuating the outcome that AI provides. And so we think that they'll continue to take market share among the hyperscalers, which is going to drive fantastic revenue growth in the AI business. We see the AI business doubling uh in 2026 for Broadcom and we see it growing very, very rapidly uh after 2026. So long-term, they're very, very well positioned with a product that is that is highly efficient for their customers.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Subscribe today!\n\nThe semiconductor giant's stock has experienced unusual volatility despite posting impressive numbers. Broadcom delivered fourth-quarter earnings of $1.95 per share on revenue of $18.02 billion, both exceeding Wall Street forecasts.\nCEO Hock Tan projected AI chip sales would double year-over-year (YoY) to $8.2 billion in the current quarter, driven by custom chips and AI networking semiconductors. The company also disclosed a massive $73 billion backlog for custom chips and data center components over the next 18 months.\nYet shares initially climbed in after-hours trading before reversing course during the earnings call, ultimately plunging around 17% over two trading sessions. Valued at a market cap of $1.65 trillion, AVGO stock is down 18% below all-time highs.\nInvestors are concerned about potential margin compression as Broadcom scales production. In the recent earnings call, company CFO Kirsten Spears warned that gross margins could decline for some AI chip systems.\n\nLet’s see if you should buy, sell, or hold AVGO stock at the current multiples.\nBroadcom Stock Benefits From a Widening AI Moat Broadcom CEO Hock Tan dropped a bombshell during a recent investor presentation, disclosing that his 2030 compensation incentives are tied to growing AI revenue to more than $120 billion. Comparatively, in fiscal 2025, Broadcom’s AI sales were around $20 billion.\nManagement expects explosive growth despite recent stock weakness and insider selling activity. Tan clarified that Broadcom is laser-focused on just seven customers creating large language models and dismissed the broader enterprise market as irrelevant to the company's core AI strategy.\nThese hyperscalers and AI labs are engaged in a race toward super intelligence, which requires massive investments in compute infrastructure that Broadcom supplies through custom accelerator chips and advanced networking equipment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe CEO emphasized that custom ASICs and networking infrastructure represent Broadcom's competitive moat rather than merchant GPUs sold to thousands of smaller enterprises. He highlighted that networking becomes the critical bottleneck as AI clusters scale from 100,000 to potentially 1 million GPUs working simultaneously.\n\nBroadcom's intellectual property in orchestrating these massive parallel workloads through Ethernet-based networks provides differentiation that competitors struggle to match.\nTan revealed that fiscal 2026 AI revenue growth would accelerate materially beyond the previously guided 60% rate, driven by a recently converted customer focused on inference workloads.\nHe confirmed Anthropic as the mystery customer who placed a $10 billion order for Google's (GOOG) (GOOGL) tensor processing units during the quarter. Broadcom now has five customers for custom chips, with two additional prospects in the pipeline.\nThe networking business stands to benefit as customers transition from copper-based connections to optical networking capable of 100 terabits per second bandwidth. This shift enables memory sharing across 512 or even 1,024 accelerator chips within a single rack, which improves training convergence times. Tan expects this optical transition to accelerate in 2027 as cluster sizes expand.\n\nDespite a bullish long-term vision, Broadcom acknowledged near-term margin pressure as it scales production of AI chip systems.\nIs AVGO Stock Overvalued Right Now? Analysts tracking AVGO stock forecast revenue to increase from $64 billion in fiscal 2025 (ended in October) to $227 billion in fiscal 2030. In this period, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from $6.82 per share to $23.37 per share.\nIf Broadcom stock is priced at 27x forward earnings, which is similar to its three-year average, the stock should trade around $630 in late 2028, indicating an upside potential of 70% from current levels.\nOut of the 40 analysts covering AVGO stock, 34 recommend “Strong Buy,” three recommend “Moderate Buy,” and three recommend “Hold.” The average AVGO stock price target is $456.20, above the current price of $351.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Did Nvidia Just Signal Problems with Intel’s Comeback?\n\nRich Duprey\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nTSM\n\nQuick Read Intel ( INTC ) secured $8.9B from the U.S. government and $5B from Nvidia ( NVDA ) to revive its foundry business.\nNvidia halted testing of Intel’s 18A chip manufacturing process and stopped moving forward with production plans.\nIntel’s foundry turnaround depends on 18A attracting major customers beyond smaller deals with Microsoft and Amazon .\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIntel ( NASDAQ: INTC ) has experienced a dramatic shift in fortunes over the past year. Once viewed as a failing chipmaker losing ground to competitors like Broadcom ( NASDAQ: AVGO ), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( NYSE: TSM ), and Nvidia ( NASDAQ: NVDA ), Intel faced speculation that rivals were circling its foundry business and other assets.\nBy the middle of the year, however, Intel regained momentum through significant backing from the Trump administration, which converted CHIPS Act grants into an equity stake worth approximately $8.9 billion, or 10% of the company, making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. This was followed by a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, giving it roughly a 4% stake, as well as partnerships aimed at joint product development in data centers and PCs.\n\nThese moves indicated renewed confidence, positioning Intel as a key player in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing once again. Yet, a Reuters report today suggests a big potential setback, raising questions about whether Intel's revival is beginning to falter.\nA Promising Rebound Built on Execution Intel's recent progress has been notable, driven by strategic investments and a focus on revitalizing its core businesses. The Trump administration's equity stake provided essential capital and aligned Intel with national priorities for domestic chip production.\nWeeks later, Nvidia's $5 billion commitment further supported Intel's turnaround, with the two firms agreeing to collaborate on custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms and integrated system-on-chips for PCs. An Intel spokesperson emphasized that 18A technologies are \"progressing well.\"\n\nDespite these positive developments, the rebound has always hinged on Intel's ability to execute, particularly in its foundry business. The 18A process node has been central to its plans for regaining manufacturing leadership, as it is intended to enable high-volume production of advanced chips and attract customers.\nNvidia's Decision Raises Questions About 18A According to the Reuters article, Nvidia recently evaluated whether to manufacture its next-generation chips using Intel's 18A process but halted the testing and stopped moving forward. Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed this to Reuters, though Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nStory Continues\nThis development comes despite Nvidia's earlier investment and ongoing product collaborations, which explicitly did not include commitments to use Intel's foundry. Intel has previously noted strong interest in 18A, and the company continues to highlight progress on the node, with products like Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest ramping up toward production.\n\nThe reasons for Nvidia's decision remain unclear, but earlier reports indicated both Nvidia and Broadcom conducted tests on 18A. While testing is a standard step, not all evaluations lead to production commitments.\nIf technical or yield issues contributed to the halt, it could signal challenges for Intel in convincing major designers to shift volume from established leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel's foundry has faced scrutiny over quality and scalability before, though the company maintains that 18A is on track and sees interest shifting to the subsequent 14A node for even more advanced applications.\nBroader Implications for Intel's Foundry Strategy Winning high-profile customers has been a key goal for Intel Foundry, which has invested heavily to compete as a contract manufacturer. Deals with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) for custom chips on 18A have been announced, and Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) might go with Intel for its entry-level M-series chips in 2027, but volumes from such clients are relatively small compared to demands from AI leaders like Nvidia.\n\nNvidia halting the testing -- while not a definitive rejection -- underscores the high bar set for advanced nodes. Competitors continue to dominate high-end production, and Intel must demonstrate reliable yields and performance to secure larger commitments.\nKey Takeaway Investors should not read too much into Nvidia's decision to pause 18A testing at this stage, as qualification processes are lengthy and multifaceted. However, greater caution is warranted moving forward.\nMuch of Intel's turnaround depends on the success of the 18A process in delivering competitive manufacturing capabilities. If the node falls short of expectations in attracting major business from customers, it could complicate the company's path to foundry profitability and an overall recovery.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, AI revenues surged 74% year over year to $6.5 billion. XPU adoption accelerated in the reported quarter as enterprises continue to use these to train their large language models and monetize their platforms through inference APIs and applications. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are major users of these XPUs.\n\nAVGO’s expanding clientele, which now includes Anthropic, is driving growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received a $10 billion order to sell Alphabet’s latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received an additional order worth $11 billion from the same customer. The company’s current order backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion as AVGO’s latest 102-terabit per second Tomahawk 6 switch continues to gain traction. AVGO now expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 AI revenues to double year over year to $8.2 billion.\n\nAVGO’s networking portfolio is gaining from strong demand for Tomahawk 6 products, as well as the Jericho 4 Ethernet fabric router. Broadcom also has a rich partner base that includes the likes of OpenAI, Walmart, NVIDIA, Canonical, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies, Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, among others. AVGO expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 Semiconductor revenues of $12.3 billion, suggesting 50% year-over-year growth. Infrastructure Software revenues are expected to grow 2% year over year to $6.8 billion.\n\nAVGO Faces Tough Competition in the Semiconductor Market Broadcom is a major player in the semiconductor market, but is facing stiff competition from NVIDIA NVDA and Marvell Technology MRVL.\n\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of AI and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for Gen AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues from Data Center (accounted for 89.8% of NVDA revenues) jumped 66% year over year and 25% sequentially to $51.22 billion.\n\nMarvell Technology is benefiting from the strong demand environment across the data center end market. MRVL’s data center end-market revenues jumped 39% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, propelled by strong growth across AI-driven demand for custom XPU silicon and electro-optics interconnect products. Marvell Technology’s AI-driven custom silicon business has secured more than 20 multi-generational XPU and XPU-attach socket wins. MRVL’s design pipeline has expanded to more than 50 opportunities worth $75 billion, underscoring hyperscalers’ growing reliance on Marvell’s differentiated capabilities.\n\nStory Continues\nAVGO’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Broadcom shares have appreciated 45.7% in a year, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nAVGO Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe AVGO stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/earnings of 33.89X compared with the broader sector’s 27.78X.

      "Content": "MRVL's Data Center Revenues Hit $1.5B: Can the Momentum Continue?\n\nOm Jaiswal\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:17 AM PST 3 min read\n\nMarvell Technology MRVL posted strong results in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, which was led by its data center business. Revenues from the data center business reached $1.52 billion, up 38% from a year ago. This segment made up about 73% of total revenues, showing that data centers are now becoming the main growth engine for the company.\n\nThe main growth driver for the data center business is rapidly rising artificial intelligence (AI) spending by large cloud customers. As these customers add more AI servers, they need faster and more reliable networking. This is helping demand for Marvell Technology’s interconnect products, such as optical digital signal processors, drivers and Transimpedance Amplifiers. Management said revenues from optical interconnect products grew at a double-digit rate from the previous quarter, pointing to healthy demand.\nMarvell Technology is also seeing solid growth in its data center switching and storage business. Demand for 12.8T switches remains strong, and the company has started shipping newer 51.2T switches. As a result, Marvell Technology now expects data center switch revenues to exceed $500 million in fiscal 2027.\n\nThe custom silicon business is another key growth area. Marvell Technology already has purchase orders covering the full fiscal-year forecast for a major next-generation XPU program at a large customer. While custom revenues can move up and down each quarter, Marvell technology expects this business to grow at least 20% in fiscal 2027.\n\nLooking ahead, Marvell Technology expects data center revenues to grow more than 25% in fiscal 2027. This outlook is supported by continued AI investments, higher product use inside AI systems and strong customer demand. Overall, MRVL’s wide data center product lineup puts it in a good position to benefit if AI infrastructure spending continues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRVL's fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 41.9% and 22.4%, respectively.\n\nHow Competitors Fare Against MRVL Marvell Technology competes with Broadcom AVGO and NVIDIA NVDA in the data center market.\nBroadcom benefits from AI through its networking chips and custom silicon used by large cloud customers. AVGO’s AI revenues grew 65% year over year to $20 billion in fiscal 2025 and 74% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Furthermore, Broadcom expects its AI revenues to double year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 to around $8.2 billion.\n\nNVIDIA sits at the center of AI data centers with its graphics processing units (GPUs), which power most AI workloads today. The company reported $51 billion in data center revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, up 66% year over year. NVIDIA also benefits indirectly from higher spending on networking and connectivity around AI clusters, which raises demand for GPUs.\n\nStory Continues\nMRVL's Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Marvell Technology have gained 16.6% in the past six months compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s growth of 25.8%.\nMRVL 6-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Marvell Technology trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 7.33X, higher than the industry’s average of 6.42X.\nMRVL Forward 12-Month (P/S) Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 80.9% and 26.1%, respectively. The estimates for fiscal 2026 have been revised upward by a penny over the past 30 days, while the estimates for fiscal 2027 have been revised upward by a cent over the past seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMarvell Technology currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Just take all your companies, sort them by gross margins, and buy the top five, and you're not going to be that wrong.\"\nBofA estimates that the total addressable market for AI data center systems will reach over $1.2 trillion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion opportunity.\nDespite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious because AI data centers are expensive. A typical 1 gigawatt facility requires upwards of $60 billion in capital expenditures, with roughly half of that going directly to hardware, per Bank of America.\n\nThat raises the question: Will the return on investment ever materialize?",

Finance and YCharts. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio . EPS = earnings per share. Data as of Dec. 23, 2025.\nNvidia: The dominant maker of AI chips and related tech Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), its flagship semiconductors, are considered the gold standard for training artificial intelligence (AI) models and deploying AI applications.\nThe company's data center platform had been performing well for quite some time. But demand began skyrocketing for its AI-enabling products -- its GPUs and high-performance networking products -- soon after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. This event demonstrated to company leaders and the general public the phenomenal capabilities of generative AI.\n\nIn late October at the company's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, D.C., CEO Jensen Huang said that management has \"visibility\" into $500 billion of demand for its key data center technology over the next five quarters . This demand of $100 billion per quarter, on average, is truly mind-blowing. As context, in its fiscal third quarter (ended late October), Nvidia's total revenue was $57.0 billion, of which $51.2 billion was from the data center platform.\nBroadcom: The leading maker of custom AI chips Broadcom develops semiconductors for various end markets and also develops infrastructure software.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's robust growth is being drven by strong demand for its custom AI-enabling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and Ethernet networking products, both for data centers. Its acquisition of software maker VMware in late 2023 is proving to be a shrewd move, as this business is also growing nicely.\n\nBroadcom is the top partner for big tech companies seeking custom ASICs. As the name suggests, these chips are designed for specific applications. These include internal uses and, in some cases, for availability in their cloud computing services. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs can be considered more general-purpose AI chips. There is a need for both GPUs and ASICs, so investors shouldn't be concerned that one of these types of chips will fully win out over the other.\nTSM: The world's largest chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest chip foundry. That means it produces chips of various types for companies that contract out all or some of the manufacturing of chips they design.\nTSM is the largest producer of AI chips worldwide, which has led to significant financial growth in recent years, driven by surging demand for these chips.\n\nTSM's customers include nearly every major chip company, such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which is Nvidia's main rival in the AI-enabling GPU market. Moreover, it also manufactures chips, including AI chips, for major tech companies that have designed their own chips. This includes Apple , widely considered the company's largest customer, though some Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to soon overtake Apple as TSM's top customer.\nAn added benefit for some investors is that TSM pays a decent dividend for a tech company. The dividend yield was 1.13%, as of the close of the market on Dec. 23.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

At the same time, U.S. durable goods orders fell -2.2% m/m in October, weaker than expectations of -1.5% m/m, and core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation, rose +0.2% m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.3% m/m. In addition, the U.S. Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell to 89.1 in December, weaker than expectations of 91.7.\n“The strongest pace of economic growth in two years is bolstering confidence that corporate earnings will continue to expand robustly in 2026,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. At the same time, U.S. money markets continue to price in at least two Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026.\nMeanwhile, the much-anticipated Santa Claus Rally period officially kicks off today. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has delivered an average return of 1.3%, posting gains 78% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.\n\nStory continues\nToday, investors will focus on U.S. Initial Jobless Claims data, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists estimate this figure will come in at 224K, the same as last week.\nU.S. rate futures have priced in an 86.7% chance of no rate change and a 13.3% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the January FOMC meeting.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.160%, down -0.22%.\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.03% this morning, struggling for direction in quiet pre-holiday trading, with major markets like Germany shut and others, including London and Paris, set for early closures. Energy stocks advanced on Wednesday, as oil prices climbed for a sixth straight session. Luxury stocks also gained ground. Meanwhile, the regional Stoxx 600 index hit a new record high on Tuesday and is on track for its best annual performance since 2021, underpinned by lower interest rates, Germany’s fiscal spending push, and investor rotation away from expensive U.S. technology stocks. In other news, the Bank of Spain raised its economic growth forecast to 2.9% from 2.6% for this year and to 2.2% from 1.8% for 2026. In corporate news, BP Plc (BP-.LN) rose as much as +1.4% before paring gains after agreeing to sell a 65% stake in its Castrol unit to investment firm Stonepeak for about $8 billion.\n\nThe European economic data slate is empty on Wednesday.\nAsian stock markets today settled mixed. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.53%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -0.14%.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index closed higher today, extending its gains for a sixth consecutive session. The benchmark index notched its longest winning streak since July. Technology stocks gained ground on Wednesday. Global investors are ramping up bets on Chinese AI-related companies, wagering on the next DeepSeek and looking to diversify. Earlier this week, Moore Threads Technology, often referred to by analysts as “China’s Nvidia,” introduced a range of new products, including its next-generation chip architecture and AI chips. Meanwhile, the yuan extended its gains on Wednesday, moving closer to the key 7-per-dollar level after the People’s Bank of China set a firmer fixing.

Hong Kong’s market will be closed on Thursday and Friday for the Christmas holidays, while mainland China’s financial markets will remain open as usual.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index gave up earlier gains and closed slightly lower today, marking its first decline in four sessions. Japanese equities were pressured by a stronger yen. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas sales for the country’s heavyweight exporters, with automakers among the notable underperformers on the day. The Japanese currency rose for a third day as traders stayed alert for signs of intervention following Tokyo’s warning against excessive moves. Financial stocks also slumped, paring some of the sharp gains that followed the Bank of Japan’s interest-rate hike last Friday. Limiting losses, some chip stocks climbed, tracking overnight gains in their U.S. peers. Data from the Cabinet Office released on Wednesday showed that Japan’s October leading economic indicators index, which gauges the economic outlook for a few months ahead based on data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, was revised slightly lower. Meanwhile, minutes from the Bank of Japan’s October meeting released on Wednesday showed that policymakers debated the need to keep raising interest rates toward levels seen as neutral for the economy. A few members of the nine-member board also said recent yen declines could risk an inflation overshoot by driving up import costs. In other news, a draft seen by Reuters showed that Japan plans to issue new government bonds worth about $189 billion to finance a record-sized budget for the next fiscal year. Investor focus is now squarely on a raft of Japan’s economic data, scheduled for release on Friday, including Tokyo core CPI, industrial production, retail sales, and employment figures. Investors also await BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda’s speech on Thursday, as they seek guidance on the central bank’s policy path.

The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

      "Content": "Quantum Enablers Poised for 40% Plus Growth in 2026: INTC, AVGO & TER\n\nUrmimala Biswas\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QBTS\n\nLMT\n\nINTC\n\nAVGO\n\nIONQ\n\nThe pure quantum hardware sector, featuring companies like IonQ and D-Wave, has garnered significant attention. These firms have made tangible progress, securing government contracts, enterprise pilots and cloud integrations. Analysts characterize these pure plays as long-term prospects with growth potential but not guaranteed near-term earnings drivers for 2026.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that quantum offers no near-term investment opportunity. Instead, the more compelling path lies in quantum enablers - companies already generating revenues today by supplying the infrastructure, semiconductors, testing tools, cloud platforms and security frameworks required for quantum adoption at scale.\nSo, if the goal is to participate in quantum’s growth story with measurable financial outcomes in 2026, it makes sense to look beyond the flagship hardware makers and toward the ecosystem enabling quantum adoption today.\nHere in this article, we have discussed three such quantum computing enablers, Intel INTC, Broadcom AVGO and Teradyne TER, which are projected to report more than 40% earnings growth in 2026.\nThe Enabler Advantage: Real Revenues, Not Future Promises At present, several established semiconductor and enterprise technology companies are positioned to benefit from quantum development while being simultaneously projected to report solid earnings growth in 2026.\nAdvanced Micro Devices AMD, for example, is collaborating with IBM on hybrid high-performance computing and quantum workloads, leveraging its CPUs and accelerators within quantum-adjacent systems. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD suggests roughly 58% earnings growth in 2026, driven primarily by data center demand rather than speculative quantum revenues.\n\nPost-Quantum Cryptography: Demand is Already Here Perhaps the most immediate quantum-linked opportunity lies in post-quantum cryptography. Governments and enterprises are racing to secure data against future quantum decryption risks, often referred to as “Q-Day.” Industry research and regulatory guidance increasingly emphasize early migration to quantum-resilient encryption standards.\n\nSEALSQ Corp. illustrates this trend. The company has commercialized secure chips with embedded post-quantum cryptography and expanded partnerships in defense and critical infrastructure, demonstrating real-world adoption rather than experimental pilots. The stock is projected to report 66.7% earnings growth in 2026.\nIn 2025, Lockheed Martin LMT advanced its role as a quantum enabler by moving quantum technologies closer to real defense applications, including a U.S. Department of Defense Innovation Unit contract to prototype a quantum-enabled inertial navigation system (QuINS) that can operate without GPS, in partnership with Q-CTRL and AOSense. The stock is projected to report 34.8% earnings growth in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\n2025 Stock Comparison of Quantum Enablers\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n3 Quantum Computing Enablers With Strong Growth Potential Intel : Its positioning as a quantum enabler rests on continued progress in scaling qubit counts and improving device performance using its legacy CMOS manufacturing infrastructure. By applying its 300 mm fabrication techniques to silicon spin qubits, Intel expects to incrementally increase qubit connectivity and fidelity, essential steps toward larger, more uniform qubit arrays while refining control and interconnect technologies. Continued collaboration with research institutions in 2026 should further accelerate collective understanding of qubit behavior and materials interface challenges, helping Intel contribute to the broader quantum ecosystem even as commercial fault-tolerant systems remain on a multi-year horizon.\n\nIntel, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, is expected to report earnings growth of 83.4% in 2026 on revenue growth of 3.3%. The stock has skyrocketed 81.4% in 2025.\nBroadcom : In 2025, Broadcom strengthened its position as a quantum enabler by embedding post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into enterprise networking and storage products, turning future quantum security risks into near-term demand. The company rolled out quantum-safe Fibre Channel and SAN solutions, including Emulex secure host bus adapters and Brocade Gen 8 Fibre Channel platforms, which integrate PQC and 256-bit encryption to protect data in motion across mission-critical infrastructure.\nIn 2026, Broadcom is positioned to benefit from rising demand for quantum-resilient infrastructure, driven by regulatory mandates such as CNSA 2.0, NIS2 and DORA and growing AI-led data center workloads, enabling quantum-linked growth without dependence on commercial quantum computers.\n\nBroadcom, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, is expected to report earnings growth of 42.5% in fiscal 2026 (ending October 2026) on revenue growth of 44.8%. The stock has gained 47.3% in 2025.\nTeradyne : In 2025, Teradyne strengthened its role as a quantum enabler by expanding its photonics and semiconductor test capabilities, highlighted by its acquisition of Quantifi Photonics, a specialist in photonic integrated circuit (PIC) testing.\nThe deal enhances Teradyne’s ability to deliver scalable PIC test solutions essential for optical interconnects used in high-performance and hybrid computing systems. Teradyne also introduced a high-volume, double-sided wafer probe test cell for silicon photonics with ficonTEC, supporting advanced electro-optical testing. These investments position Teradyne to benefit from rising demand for photonics, AI infrastructure, and high-performance computing test solutions, which underpin future quantum-adjacent ecosystems.\n\nTeradyne, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, is expected to report earnings growth of nearly 45% in 2026 on revenue growth of 22%. The stock has gained 56.7% in 2025. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They all require significant power to operate. AI models and innovations require gigawatts to operate, and traditional data centers aren't cutting it. Those buildings aren't optimized for AI workloads, and that's where AI data center providers like Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) come in.\nApplied Digital has roughly 4 gigawatts worth of data center capacity at the moment, and that could translate into billions of dollars in annual recurring revenue once it's all set up and deals have been established. Applied Digital has already entered three lease agreements with CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) , with the total revenue coming to approximately $11 billion over 15 years.\nThe leases cover 400 megawatts, and Applied Digital's 4 gigawatt pipeline suggests the company could support nine additional deals like the CoreWeave contract. Here's why Applied Digital could expand beyond CoreWeave and continue to win over tech giants.\nThe AI race is intense The key players in the AI race have all committed to spending more money on this technology. Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , and Meta Platforms are some of the top players in the industry. These companies generate billions of dollars in quarterly profits and view AI as the next internet boom.\nAI models, autonomous vehicles , and humanoid robots have the potential to change how people shop and interact with the world. Companies know the potential of AI and have already thrown a lot of money at Nvidia. Now, they are increasingly looking at the energy bottleneck that companies like Applied Digital solve.\n\nRight now, Applied Digital makes almost all of its AI revenue from CoreWeave. Other AI data center providers like Iren (NASDAQ: IREN) and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) have made deals with Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and other tech companies. It's fair to assume Applied Digital will land deals like that in the future, especially since it has proven to be a trustworthy option for CoreWeave.\n\nStory Continues\nApplied Digital is a leading data center builder Timelines are critical for maintaining a lead in the AI race, and Applied Digital is doing its part. The AI data center provider told investors that its 100 MW building at Polaris Forge 1 is nearing completion while remaining on time and on budget.\nFulfilling project benchmarks will help Applied Digital build more trust with tech giants. Applied Digital Chairman and CEO Wes Cummins also views it that way.\n\n\"We feel this third lease validates our platform and execution, positioning Applied Digital as a trusted strategic partner to the world's largest technology companies,\" Cummins said in the Q3 press release. \"With hyperscalers expected to invest approximately $350 billion into AI deployment this year, we believe we are in a prime position to serve as the modern-day picks and shovels of the intelligence era.\"\nApplied Digital's 4-gigawatt pipeline also puts it ahead of most AI data center stocks. Iren has approximately 3 gigawatts in its pipeline, while Cipher Mining has 3.2 gigawatts in its pipeline. Applied Digital has the lead, which will come in handy once data centers are built and tech companies scramble to sign big deals.\n\nNew deals can happen quickly and suddenly change the long-term view Applied Digital has a 15-year contract with CoreWeave for $11 billion that covers 400 megawatts. It's a big contract, but it's not the only one in the industry. Iren signed a five-year, $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft for 200 megawatts. Cipher Mining also signed a 15-year deal with Amazon Web Services for $5.5 billion, and that contract covers 300 megawatts.\n\nA single deal adds billions of dollars to an AI data center provider's revenue. These are long-term agreements that result in steady recurring revenue. When Applied Digital has all 4 gigawatts ready to go, it can support enough deals to make billions of dollars each year. The company may have only made $64 million in Q1 FY26, but revenue growth should compound quickly based on the CoreWeave leases and future deals. That development sets the stage for Applied Digital stock to continue its rally.\nShould you buy stock in Applied Digital right now?

      "Content": "3 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:38 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: CRSP\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points CRISPR Therapeutics has figured out a way to successfully repair genetic code. Monetizing this know-how is the next step.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) data center interconnectivity powerhouse Broadcom hasn’t had much competition … until now.\nChina’s AI industry is mostly developing in its own silo. One company is positioned to dominate it.\n10 stocks we like better than CRISPR Therapeutics ›\n\nAll investors would love to get rich overnight. As anyone who's been in the market for a while can attest, however, that's just not how things work. Growing wealth takes time. And, the more time you're willing and able to give your picks, the better your returns tend to be.\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three stocks that are not only solid long-term prospects. Granted, they will require lengthy holding periods to reach their full potential and pay off in full. This, of course, means taking the risk of stepping into a name with a future that's still a bit fuzzy and far from guaranteed. If things pan out the way they appear to, though, this risk will be well worth it.\n1. CRISPR Therapeutics The premise of repairing damaged or faulty DNA has long been on the healthcare industry's mind. It didn't become a commercial reality, however, until late 2023, when CRISPR Therapeutics ' (NASDAQ: CRSP) Casgevy became the first-ever FDA-approved gene therapy. Although it's only approved to treat sickle cell disease, it's a tacit but important validation of the underlying science.\n\nThat science is the use of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -- or CRISPR -- found in human DNA to cut out damaged genetic code and then replace it with the correct one. Or, more specifically, removing a segment of faulty DNA forces the body to use its own self-repair process to create a permanent, healthy fix.\nThe idea has near-term promise as the basis for treating diabetes and autoimmune diseases, as well as for cardiovascular diseases -- all of which CRISPR Therapeutics is working on in clinical trials now underway. Further down the road, though, this approach could conceivably be refined to treat cancer, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, and more. That's why Precedence Research believes the global CRISPR therapy market is poised to grow at an average annualized pace of nearly 17% through 2034.\n\nGiven that one of the company's co-founders (Emmanuelle Charpentier, Ph.D.) won a Nobel Prize in 2020 for her discovery and creation of this CRISPR-based approach to gene editing, it's not a stretch to suggest CRISPR Therapeutics itself is very well positioned to capture at least its fair share of the medical science's future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nJust understand that medical science moves incredibly slowly, requiring a long-term mindset from investors.\nThis might put things in perspective, as well as help you stick with it in the meantime: Although Casgevy was approved as a treatment for sickle cell a little over two years ago, its revenue isn't expected to truly explode until next year, ramping up from this year's projection of just a few million dollars to a little over $100 million next year to nearly $300 million after that. By then, progress on fronts other than sickle cell disease should start driving the stock on a more consistent basis.\n\n2. Astera Labs To date, Broadcom has been one of the big names other than Nvidia to soar thanks to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia makes the computing processors used in most AI data centers. Broadcom then provides the technology that connects them to turn them into a true neural network.\nAs is so often the case, though, smaller and newer competitors watched what Broadcom did to become the dominant name in this sliver of the AI business, and then figured out a way to do it better.\n\nAstera Labs (NASDAQ: ALAB) is one of those smaller and newer competitors. It makes a range of interconnectivity solutions purpose-built for artificial intelligence data centers. For instance, its Aries line of PCIe Smart Gearboxes allows data center owners/operators to connect next-generation processors with previous-generation motherboards, extending the useful life of the latter while allowing the utilization of the former.\nAt the same time, Astera's Leo CXL Smart Memory Controllers are \"the industry's first purpose-built solution that supports both memory expansion and memory pooling,\" according to the company's website, offering access to memory in a way that gets the most out of an artificial intelligence platform, and inference platforms in particular.\n\nPriced at nearly 90 times this year's projected profits of $1.78 per share, Astera Labs stock isn't cheap. That's the chief reason the stock's peeled back so much from its September peak, outpacing the overall market's weakness for this time frame.\nJust take a step back and see the bigger picture. After more than doubling this year, analysts are calling for revenue growth of more than 40% next year, driving per-share profits up from $1.78 to $2.37 as a result. This is likely just a glimpse of the kind of demand we're going to see for specialized AI interconnectivity solutions for a long, long while.\n3. Alibaba Finally, add Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) to your list of brilliant growth stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.\nIt's an addition that might surprise some investors who have kept loose tabs on the company. Although no one denies it dominates China's e-commerce market, it's a market that's as saturated as it is mature. It's also running into an economic headwind.\n\nFor perspective, the country's retail sales only grew 1.3% in November, slowing from October's pace of 2.9%, as well as falling short of estimates for growth of 2.8%. Concern isn't entirely unmerited.\nExcept that e-commerce isn't going to be Alibaba's big growth engine for the foreseeable future. It's going to be artificial intelligence. In August, the company unveiled an AI processor chip that's surprisingly competitive with Nvidia's powerful H2O processors designed for overseas customers. Less than a month later, it had already lined up its first customer: telecom giant China Unicom. More are sure to be in the works, too.\nIt's not just powerful AI processors, though. Unlike many of the Western Hemisphere's hardware makers and software companies, Alibaba jointly brings both to the table, with a deep lineup of open-source software offerings that work well with its conventional cloud computing service and its home-grown artificial intelligence model called Qwen. Indeed, just last month, the company introduced its consumer-oriented chat-based AI assistant Qwen App. It's yet another way Alibaba is widening its digital ecosystem's net, even if it doesn't yet know exactly how it's going to monetize every aspect of this deep reach.\n\nIt matters simply because China's artificial intelligence industry is apt to grow there, like other AI platforms are growing elsewhere. Morgan Stanley expects the country's AI industry will be worth $140 billion by 2030, while Goldman Sachs believes more than 30% of China's corporations will be utilizing some sort of artificial intelligence tech by the end of the same time frame. Alibaba is readier than any other to help make that happen.\nShould you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?

      "Content": "Broadcom (AVGO) Stock Options Are Signaling Pensiveness. Here’s Why the Fear Might Be Unwarranted.\n\nJosh Enomoto\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 10:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nWith fears of a bubble brewing in artificial intelligence consistently wreaking havoc on tech players in the fourth (calendar) quarter, semiconductor and software giant Broadcom (AVGO) has been put through the ringer. True, on a year-to-date basis, AVGO stock is doing well, gaining over 47%. However, in the trailing month, the security is down almost 10%.\n\nWhat has regular, everyday investors freaked out is that even the smart money appears pensive. Take a look at Barchart’s options flow screener, which focuses exclusively on big block transactions likely placed by major institutions. On Dec. 8, a few days before its fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings disclosure, net trade sentiment stood at over $151.16 million. However, just 10 days later, net trade sentiment slipped to $148.84 million below parity.\nMore News from Barchart This Michael Burry Stock Spiked on a $1B Activist Stake.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nEven though Broadcom beat on both the top and bottom lines, disappointments over a less-than-expected AI backlog, combined with concerns about operating margins, weighed heavily on AVGO stock. Basically, the central anxiety is that, with the low-hanging AI fruit being plucked, Broadcom and its ilk need to prove viability.\nBecause of this great overhang, it’s not terribly surprising that AVGO’s unusual options activity screener also shows structural pensiveness. While it’s important not to read too deeply into any one metric, here’s what we can largely infer. Due to very long-dated out-the-money (OTM) calls being paired with long-dated, deep in-the-money (ITM) puts, the smart money is effectively hedged for kinetic uncertainty.\nIf the transactions symbolized directional bets, you would expect the bulk of the transactions to feature more realistic call and put strike prices. Instead, what’s happening here is that most of these strikes are positioned to respond only at the tails of the underlying outcome distribution.\n\nWhile I’m not going to sit here and pretend that I know what the smart money is thinking about, the unusual options activity points to net protection against unusual behaviors. Otherwise, the structure of activity points to a lack of confidence in where AVGO stock may go.\nUsing Risk Geometry to Narrow Down the Possibilities for AVGO Stock Another clue regarding the hedging activity that’s occurring right now is the relatively heightened implied volatility (IV). If we look at Barchart’s Expected Move calculator, you’ll notice that for the options chain expiring Feb. 20, 2026, the expected range of outcomes goes from $302.85 to $380.05, thus representing an 11.3% move in either direction relative to Monday’s close.\n\nStory Continues\nThat’s a very wide dispersion, which stems in large part from IV, which is a residual value based on actual order flows. Therefore, we have a situation where AVGO stock could shoot quite high over the next two months or it could sharply correct.\nFor traders, you have two basic paths: you can either play the volatility game or you can take a directional wager. Personally, I prefer the latter because betting on volatility is a tricky business when IV is already heightened due to substantial hedging activities.\n\nTo make an informed decision, we must calculate the risk geometry of AVGO stock. This can be accomplished through a hierarchical distribution. If we took a single 10-week strand of AVGO’s price data, the return during this period won’t tell us much about the probability of performance for the other weeks in the dataset.\nBut what if we took hundreds of rolling 10-week trials and stacked them in a fixed-time distribution? Under this framework, the most consistent behaviors would create a bulge in probability mass. This bulge represents risk geometry, which tells us how buyers become more aggressive in their speculative fervor.\nMore importantly, risk geometry also shows us where buyers are tempted to become sellers. In this manner, we can identify both upside profit opportunities and help curtail opportunity costs.\nUsing this hierarchical approach, we note that the typical 10-week distribution would land AVGO stock somewhere between $330 and $380, assuming an anchor price of $341.48, Monday’s close. However, the current quantitative signal is the 4-6-D sequence; that is, in the trailing 10 weeks, AVGO printed only four up weeks, leading to an overall downward slope.\n\nUnder this setup, the forward 10-week returns would typically range between $322 and $404. Further, probability mass would be thickest between $350 and $380.\nTwo Enticing Wagers Available to Consider Given the market intelligence above, perhaps the most obvious trade is the 350/360 bull call spread expiring Feb. 20, 2026. With the strike price sitting right on the center of probability mass, there would seem to be a solid chance for this trade to be fully profitable.\nPlus, if AVGO stock rises through the second-leg strike ($360) at expiration, the maximum payout would be roughly 133%. That’s an awfully nice reward. However, one thing to keep in mind is probability decay (or lack thereof).\nBetween $350 and $380, probability density only drops by 7.48%. Based on the statistical evidence, there’s a good chance that if AVGO stock is going to hit $360, it can reasonably hit $380. Therefore, capping the reward at $360 may risk absorbing a hefty opportunity cost.\n\nNow, the thing is, from $380 to $390, probability density drops by 64.14%. In other words, if we cap our reward at the $380 strike, the chance of us absorbing an opportunity cost is exponentially less than at $360, assuming that the same sentiment regime assumption holds.\nIf it does hold, you could be leaving money on the table with the 350/360 spread. Instead, the boldest idea is the 370/380 bull spread, also expiring Feb. 20.\nRisky? Extremely. But you’re also looking at a payout of nearly 228%.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Yet, it's a mistake for technology investors to overlook Broadcom and AVGO stock.\nAlong with the potential for a Broadcom stock split, there may be a value proposition for investors here. In five years, unless there's a catastrophic event, Broadcom shares could trade much higher than they do today.\nIf that happens, you'll wish you had gotten in before the rocket ride started. When all is said and done, value investors should open their minds and consider AVGO stock a bargain even if it's not immediately obvious.\nNot an Obviously Attractive Stock At first glance, some investors might not be immediately find Broadcom stock attractive. For one thing, the share price recently pulled back from nearly $415 to $340, representing a scary 18% drawdown.\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing, though, if you're a value investor looking to hold AVGO stock for five years. Maybe the 18% share-price correction was needed in order to bring Broadcom down to a low valuation.\n\nThis theory is difficult to support with old-school metrics, however. For example, Broadcom has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 71x to 72x , which doesn't look like a bargain.\nFurthermore, Broadcom's forward annual dividend yield of 0.76% probably won't impress many income investors. Sometimes a share-price pullback will set the stage for a high dividend yield, but this apparently hasn't happened with AVGO stock.\nBroadcom's Knockout Quarter In order to justify a five-year buy-and-hold with Broadcom stock, the company really needs to demonstrate its growth potential. From a financial standpoint at least, Broadcom definitely checked the right boxes with its fourth-quarter fiscal year 2025 results.\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan had every right to brag when he announced the company's record quarterly revenue of $18 billion, up 28% year over year. Tan further clarified that Broadcom's revenue growth was \"driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74%\" year over year.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's difficult to extrapolate five years out, but clearly Broadcom's growth trajectory is on a powerful uptrend. If you can believe it, Broadcom's Q4 FY2025 GAAP-measured net income nearly doubled year over year, increasing 97% to $8.518 billion.\nAlso on a year-over-year basis, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) grew 36% to $7.466 billion while the company's adjusted EBITDA expanded 34% to $12.218 billion. Given these figures, it's surprising that Broadcom isn't a darling of the financial market.\n\nSo maybe value investors ought to be willing to overlook Broadcom's seemingly high P/E ratio. Given AVGO stock's five-year trajectory and the company's growth pathway, a $500 share price in a couple of years and $800 in five years is entirely possible.\nGreat Expectations Besides, even if the company doesn't get all of the attention on Wall Street, Broadcom is a power player among AI hardware producers. To cite one example, Broadcom recently introduced the Brocade X8 Directors and Brocade G820 storage network products.\nThe company describes these products as the \"industry’s first 128G Fibre Channel platforms designed for today’s mission-critical workloads and enterprise AI applications.\" Only time will tell, but these could prove to be major revenue generators as Broadcom expands its array of enterprise AI hardware offerings.\n\nLooking ahead, Broadcom anticipates $73 billion worth of AI product backlog over the next year and a half. Deliveries of these products, moreover, should drive 150% year-on-year AI revenue growth for Broadcom in fiscal year 2026.\nGranted, these are only expectations and not all predictions work out as planned. Ultimately, Broadcom will only succeed and thrive over the next five years if enterprise AI product demand remains robust.\nCould AVGO Stock Hit $800 in Five Years? The point is that if you see an AI bubble and expect it to burst, then you probably shouldn't buy and hold Broadcom stock. As the old saying goes, scared money doesn't make money.\nHowever, without an AI hardware market collapse, the runway is clear for AVGO stock to hit $800 in five years. Broadcom knocked it out of the part in Q4 FY2025, and the company's AI product backlog prediction should boost investors' confidence.\n\nTherefore, it's fine to keep track of Broadcom's seemingly high P/E ratio and small dividend, but there's no need to obsess over these figures. Instead, consider owning AVGO stock after the recent 18% dip and holding your Broadcom shares for five years or longer.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

CLS reported quarterly revenues of $3.19 billion, up 27.8% year over year. The figure exceeded management’s guidance of $2.875 billion to $3.125 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $170 million. The growth was driven by multiple factors.\n\nThe company boasts a robust portfolio of enterprise-level data communications and information processing infrastructure products, such as routers, switches, data center interconnects, edge solutions and servers. Such a comprehensive product suite, combined with a strong focus on innovation, is allowing Celestica to tap into the expanding AI infrastructure market. The company is actively collaborating with other industry leaders such as AMD and Broadcom to further augment its portfolio offerings.\n\nDuring the third quarter, net sales from the company’s Connectivity and Cable Solution portfolio surged 43.2% year over year to $2.41 billion. The growth was primarily driven by healthy demand for 800G and 400G switching products in the data center networking vertical.\n\nPer a report from Grand View Research, the global data center networking market is valued at $38.49 billion in 2024. The market is projected to witness a 17.2% compound annual growth rate from 2025 to 2033. This presents a solid growth opportunity for Celestica. Management is bullish about its revenue growth outlook. The company expects to generate revenue between $3.325-$3.575 billion, indicating 36% year over year growth backed by continuous momentum in the data center market.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring? Celestica faces competition from Jabil, Inc. JBL and Flex Ltd . FLEX in the Electronics Manufacturing Services industry. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Jabil reported revenues of $8.3 billion, up from $6.96 billion a year ago, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $227 million. The uptick was driven by healthy demand in the Capital Equipment and AI-related Cloud and Data Center Infrastructure verticals. Jabil is steadily expanding its portfolio offering to gain a competitive edge in the AI data center vertical.\n\nIn the September quarter, Flex generated $6.8 billion in revenues, up 4% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $142 million. The uptick was driven by strong data center growth in both the cloud and power end markets. Flex’s diversified portfolio, spanning multiple industries — from cloud infrastructure and AI data centers to automotive and healthcare — continues to be a key strength.\n\nCelestica's Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Celestica’s shares have soared 215.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 93.7%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Celestica trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 37.68, up from the industry average of 24.13.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 6.3% to $5.90 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 have also increased 20.9% to $8.20.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCelestica currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

TSMC stood out again, growing revenue 41% from a year earlier and lifting its market share to 39%.

Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "ChatGPT Super Micro Computer Stock Will Close At This Price In The Next 60 Days\n\nRyan Peterson\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 11:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SMCI\n\nSOFI\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nORCL\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nAnalysts are saying that Super Micro Computer could hit $176 by 2030.

Plus, get a 1% bonus if you transfer your investments and keep them there until December 31, 2025.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) traded significantly lower over the past month as the former high-flying AI server maker faces intense scrutiny regarding its accounting practices and delayed financial filings. The company is fighting to regain investor trust after a tumultuous period that saw its valuation severely reset amid fears of a potential delisting.\nAgainst that backdrop, we ran Super Micro Computer through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI’s GPT. The goal was not to chase a sensational long-term target, but to see how a data-driven model handicaps the next 60 days for a stock that has become shorthand for the entire AI trade.\nWhat the AI model is actually predicting The agent was asked to generate a near-term outlook for Super Micro Computer, using recent price action and a focused set of technical indicators. At the time of the run, SMCI traded at $30.13. For the period from Dec. 17 through Dec 31, the model’s base-case projection came out to:\nAverage predicted price: $30.75\nImplied move: slightly lower over the next month\nSignal snapshot: The technical indicators (MACD and RSI) both skewed negative\n\nThe model is saying that, given current momentum and volatility, the most likely path is a modest grind lower from current levels rather than a dramatic reset. Still, broader AI price prediction says that Super Micro Computer could hit $176 by 2030, which illustrates the massive long-term upside baked into the current valuation if it continues its AI server dominance.\nThe key driver behind the AI model’s bearish short-term view is the recent cooling in the AI infrastructure trade, often triggered by tempered outlooks from key players like Oracle and Broadcom. Super Micro Computer is a critical supplier of specialized, high-performance servers, particularly those optimized for NVIDIA’s latest GPUs.\nWhile demand remains massive, the company has a record order backlog, the market has recently focused on short-term challenges. Namely, a temporary dip in revenue growth and significant gross margin compression were reported in the recent quarter, which has intensified concerns about pricing power amid rising competition.\n\nStory Continues\nThe single biggest factor weighing on the stock is the shrinking gross margin, which recently went down. This signals the high cost of scaling production rapidly and the intensifying competition from larger, established server makers and rising Asian rivals. The model’s negative forecast for the next 14 days is a technical reflection of this fundamental pressure. The market is effectively demanding proof that Super Micro can maintain its design advantage and market share in specialized server and liquid cooling solutions without continually sacrificing profitability. Until management can demonstrate a clearer path to margin recovery, the stock is likely to remain under pressure.\n\nThe negative skew in both the MACD and RSI confirms the short-term downward bias. A declining MACD suggests the selling momentum is strengthening, with the short-term average falling below the long-term one.\nThe RSI, currently near the low 30s, is approaching “oversold” territory, which suggests the stock is suffering from strong selling pressure. This dual negative signal implies that the stock’s recent four-day losing streak could continue into the new year, aligning with the model’s predicted decline.\nDespite the near-term technical weakness, Super Micro's long-term bullish case rests on its deep strategic integration with NVIDIA and its leadership in advanced thermal management, particularly Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC). AI data centers generate immense heat, and SMCI’s liquid cooling solutions are critical for managing the power and thermal demands of next-generation chips like the NVIDIA Blackwell.\n\nBy selling full, rack-scale solutions, its Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) strategy, rather than just individual servers, Super Micro aims to capture more value per customer, a strategy that is expected to drive margin recovery as production scales.\nWall Street, for now, is still leaning into that growth. Across major platforms, analysts maintain a Hold consensus with 12-month price targets clustering in the mid-$40s to mid-$50s. Some of the more aggressive firms see upside into the low-$60s if Super Micro Computer maintains its dominant share in AI rack-scale and liquid-cooled servers. Even the median targets imply a 45% to 55% upside from current levels, a bullish outlook that starkly contrasts with the AI model’s cautious 14-day prediction.\nThe AI forecast can be viewed as a short-term temperature check on how quickly the market might be willing to reopen the multiple after a shakeout, not a verdict on whether Super Micro Computer's run is over.\nImage: Shutterstock\nThis article ChatGPT Super Micro Computer Stock Will Close At This Price In The Next 60 Days originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ: AVGO ) is included among the 13 Top Tech Stocks Paying Consistent Dividends .\nPhoto by Annie Spratt on Unsplash\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has consistently beaten the broader market and is on pace to do it again in 2025, which would mark its sixth straight year of outperformance. The last time the stock lagged the S&P 500 was back in 2019. Even then, the gap was narrow. The index climbed 29% that year, while Broadcom shares rose 24%. Overall, long-term investors have been well rewarded. The stock is already up more than 42% so far in 2025.\n\nOn December 11, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) posted its full-year results for fiscal 2025. Revenue reached $63.9 billion, up 24% from the prior year. The bigger surprise came from earnings. Net income jumped to $23.1 billion, nearly four times the $5.9 billion reported a year earlier.\nArtificial intelligence was the clear growth driver. Broadcom said AI-related semiconductor revenue surged 74% in the most recent quarter. CEO Hock Tan added that demand remains strong into the first quarter, with AI chip revenue expected to roughly double compared with the same period last year.\nMuch of this strength comes from Broadcom’s custom chips designed for hyperscale customers. In late November, reports surfaced that Meta Platforms may look to buy Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Unit chips. Broadcom has worked closely with Alphabet for years on TPU development.\n\nThe company’s AI accelerators are built for highly specific workloads, especially where patterns are well defined. That contrasts with Nvidia’s GPUs, which offer more flexibility across training, inference, and high-performance computing tasks.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology company that designs and supplies semiconductors, enterprise software, and security solutions to customers around the world.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The gains followed higher output of its 3-nanometer process and solid utilization of 4- and 5-nanometer capacity, used heavily by AI accelerator customers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), and Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ).\nWarning!

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTSMC's foundry revenue grew more than 40% from a year earlier, outpacing the broader market. Counterpoint said most rival foundries posted slower growth, with non-TSMC players collectively expanding revenue by about 6%, reflecting softer orders after earlier tariff-related demand but some support from China's subsidy programs.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts said capacity limits at advanced nodes and constraints in advanced chip packaging, known as CoWoS, may cap sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Full-year 2025 foundry revenue growth is estimated at around 15%.\nCounterpoint expects the pure-play foundry segment to grow at a faster pace, helped by continued shipments of AI GPUs and custom AI chips.

With the S&P 500 up more than 16% year to date at 6,834 and the Dow Jones hovering near record highs above 48,000, fund managers are loading up on winners while shedding underperformers before Dec. 31 statements go to clients, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data.\n\nPortfolio Repositioning Drives Late-Year Activity Window dressing — the practice of buying top-performing stocks to display in quarterly holdings reports — is creating predictable patterns this December. Institutional investors are actively positioning select AI-infrastructure stocks for 2026. The phenomenon particularly benefits stocks, including Micron Technology MU, Western Digital WDC and Palantir Technologies PLTR, which returned 196.4%, 194.2% and 139.7%, respectively, over the past year, all outperforming the S&P 500’s 16.4% growth in the same time frame.\n\nWestern Digital gained Nasdaq-100 inclusion effective Dec. 22, prompting index-tracking funds to add shares, while Morgan Stanley and Cantor Fitzgerald designated it a top 2026 pick given storage supply constraints extending through calendar year-end. Micron Technology, upgraded to Buy by Bank of America following Dec. 17 earnings, has HBM memory sold out through 2026 with multiyear customer agreements. Major holders Vanguard Group and BlackRock increased their Palantir Technologies stakes in the third quarter of 2025 by 4% and 6.4%, respectively, reflecting continued institutional confidence in AI-software positioning.\n\n1-Year Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFed Signals Slower 2026 Pace While AI Momentum Accelerates The Federal Reserve delivered its third consecutive rate cut on Dec. 10, reducing the benchmark rate to 3.50-3.75% in a divided 9-3 vote. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that officials are \"well positioned to wait and see how the economy performs,\" with projections indicating just one additional cut expected in 2026, per official Federal Reserve statements. The cautious stance reflects concerns about persistent inflation despite a moderating labor market.\n\nDespite monetary caution, AI infrastructure spending continues powering market momentum heading into 2026. Nvidia NVDA reported third-quarter revenues of $57 billion in November, up 62% year over year, with CEO Jensen Huang noting \"Blackwell sales are off the charts\" and cloud GPUs remaining sold out. Similarly, Broadcom AVGO announced in December that AI semiconductor revenues surged 74% year over year, with first-quarter 2026 AI chip sales expected to double to $8.2 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nWall Street Sees Continued Gains Ahead Major financial institutions project significant upside for 2026. JPMorgan set a baseline S&P 500 target of 7,500 with potential to exceed 8,000 if the Fed continues cutting rates, citing 13-15% expected earnings growth. Goldman Sachs projects 12% earnings growth to $305 per share in 2026, while Morgan Stanley forecasts 17% earnings expansion driven by AI productivity gains and accommodative policy.\n\nThe convergence of year-end positioning, resilient corporate earnings, and substantial AI infrastructure investment suggests favorable conditions for equity markets entering 2026, despite elevated valuations and monetary policy uncertainties.\n\nTop 2025 Performers to Bid Up for 2026 Micron Technology offers exceptional growth potential for 2026 investors following fiscal first-quarter 2026 results announced on Dec. 17, 2025.

This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company secured agreements for its entire calendar 2026 high-bandwidth memory supply, including industry-leading HBM4 ramping in second-quarter 2026. With the HBM market expanding from $35 billion (2025) to $100 billion (2028) — accelerated two years — and supply constraints persisting beyond 2026, Micron's $20 billion fiscal 2026 capital investment positions it to capture surging AI data center demand while maintaining pricing power across tight DRAM and NAND markets.

The analyst said Intel’s lower exposure to the AI demand cycle “could insulate it from broader AI investment overheating concerns,” even as market share pressures persist.\nHe flagged a marked improvement in credit metrics in the third quarter, supported by asset sale proceeds and equity investments, alongside a return to positive free cash flow for the first time since 2023.\n\nBofA raised its fiscal 2025 (FY25) and FY26 EBITDA estimates by 20% and 18%, respectively, and expects leverage to continue improving into 2026.\nMicron was also upgraded, to Marketweight from Underweight, as supply shortages and strong AI-driven demand extend the current memory upcycle.\nCurcuruto said robust pricing across HBM and traditional DRAM is driving a sharp improvement in free cash flow, noting that Micron estimates it can meet only “1/2 to 2/3 of demand from key customers.”\nWhile near-term fundamentals are strong, he warned that capital intensity and cyclicality present medium-term risks. Still, Micron’s recent results, higher forward guidance and debt repayments underpin expectations for significantly higher free cash flow in FY26, even after an increase in planned capital spending.\nBofA also reiterated an Overweight stance on Broadcom, citing continued AI-driven growth, disciplined capital allocation and ongoing deleveraging. In terms of relative value, Broadcom and Intel remain the most compelling names within the group, Curcuruto said.\nRelated articles\nBofA upgrades credit ratings of Intel and Micron\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\n3 Strategies to Make the Most of Dow's Record-Breaking Run\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "International Markets and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): A Deep Dive for Investors\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:15 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nHave you evaluated the performance of Broadcom Inc.'s (AVGO) international operations during the quarter that concluded in October 2025? Considering the extensive worldwide presence of this chipmaker, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial resilience and potential for growth.\n\nIn today's increasingly interconnected global economy, a company's ability to tap into international markets can be a pivotal factor in shaping its overall financial health and growth trajectory. For investors, understanding a company's reliance on overseas markets has become increasingly crucial, as it offers insights into the company's sustainability of earnings, ability to tap into diverse economic cycles and overall growth potential.\nParticipation in global economies acts as a defense against economic difficulties at home and a pathway to more rapidly developing economies. However, it also comes with the complexities of dealing with fluctuating currencies, geopolitical risks and different market dynamics.\nIn our recent assessment of AVGO's quarterly performance, we discovered notable trends in its overseas revenue sections, which are typically modeled and scrutinized by Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $18.02 billion, showing rise of 28.2%. We will now explore the breakdown of AVGO's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\nA Closer Look at AVGO's Revenue Streams Abroad During the quarter, Asia Pacific contributed $10.8 billion in revenue, making up 60% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $9.61 billion, this meant a surprise of +12.46%. Looking back, Asia Pacific contributed $8.96 billion, or 56.2%, in the previous quarter, and $7.93 billion, or 56.4%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nOf the total revenue, $2.33 billion came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 13%. This represented a surprise of -9.14% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $2.57 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $2.27 billion, or 14.2%, and $2.1 billion, or 15%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nAnticipated Revenues in Overseas Markets Wall Street analysts expect Broadcom Inc. to report $19.23 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 28.9% from the year-ago quarter. Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa are expected to contribute 49.3% (translating to $9.48 billion), and 13.2% ($2.54 billion) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $92.51 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 44.8% from the year before. The revenues from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa are expected to make up 44.5%, and 11.8% of this total, corresponding to $41.17 billion, and $10.93 billion, respectively.\n\nFinal Thoughts The dependency of Broadcom Inc. on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\nIn a world where international interdependencies and geopolitical conflicts are ever-increasing, Wall Street analysts closely monitor these trends for companies having international presence to adjust their earnings forecasts. Of course, there are several other factors, including a company's standing within its home borders, that influence analysts' earnings forecasts.\n\nEmphasizing a company's shifting earnings prospects is a key aspect of our approach at Zacks, especially since research has proven its substantial influence on a stock's price in the short run. This correlation is positively aligned, meaning that improved earnings projections tend to boost the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool, comes with an externally validated impressive track record. It effectively utilizes shifts in earnings projections to act as a dependable barometer for forecasting short-term stock price trends.\nAt present, Broadcom Inc. holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This ranking implies that its near-term performance might mirror the overall market movement.

      "Content": "These AI Stocks Could Still Deliver Big Upside in December and Beyond\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Nvidia still can't keep up with demand for its data center GPUs.\nAfter a tepid stock performance in 2025, Amazon is looking to bounce back in 2026.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator chips are growing in popularity with hyperscalers.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nAlthough we're nearly at the end of a year during which the S&P 500 gained a strong 16%, there are still plenty of stocks that look like top-tier buys. Some of the biggest names in the market have retreated from their recent highs, and I think investors should consider scooping them up before 2026 arrives. At the top of my last-minute shopping list are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) .\nNvidia Nvidia has been the poster child for the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout since it began. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the computing power for the vast majority of AI workloads today, but investors are worried about two things.\nFirst, they are concerned that there is a general bubble in the AI space. However, with all of the hyperscalers having announced that 2026 will be another year of record-setting capital expenditures, I don't see that thesis as valid. Second, some are worried that Nvidia's dominance in the AI accelerator chip niche is slipping. While there have been several promising product launches from its competitors, Nvidia's GPUs are still the top option. In its earnings release for its fiscal 2026 third quarter, which ended Oct. 26, CEO Jensen Huang stated that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs.\n\nThis is a company that brought in $57 billion in revenue during Q3, and it's clear that it could have made more if it had more chips to sell, so it's hard to say Nvidia's dominance is slipping with a straight face.\nWith Nvidia's stock price down nearly 20% from its all-time high and Wall Street analysts expecting the chipmaker's revenue to grow by 48% next year, I can think of few better buys heading into 2026.\nAmazon Amazon stock is essentially flat for the year. However, some recent events have me bullish about it as we prepare to enter 2026.\nFirst, its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, delivered 20% revenue growth rate in Q3 -- its best rate in years -- showing that it's resurging as the go-to place to bring workloads online. Second, growth in Amazon's advertising service business is also reaccelerating. This segment has become a major part of the company's business over the past few years.\nI think Amazon's stock will come roaring back in 2026, and it will be on the backs of these two important business units.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Broadcom is up by an incredible 40% or so year to date. However, it was previously even higher: The stock sold off heavily after a poorly received earnings report.\nIn its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ended Nov. 2, revenues grew by 28% as diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose 37%. Its AI semiconductor business was a bright spot, with revenue rising 74% year over year. Management expects this trend to continue into Q1, forecasting that its AI semiconductor revenue will more than double. That all sounds impressive, but the stock sold off in part due to revenue timing.\n\nBroadcom told investors that some of its customers wouldn't be purchasing some of their custom AI chips until 2027 and beyond. That was a letdown for investors, and many headed for the exit. As a result, Broadcom's stock is down by more than 20% from its all-time high.\nFollowing the sell-off, Broadcom's stock now trades for about 32 times expected forward earnings.\nConsidering the monster AI-related growth the company expects over the next few years, I think this is a great price to pay for Broadcom's stock. Its AI semiconductor revenue will continue to rise throughout 2026, which will eventually get the market excited about the stock again. But until it does, the stock looks like a great value.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

In Q3 2025, net sales rose 2.8% to $1.47 billion and comparable-store sales climbed 3%. EPS beat consensus, at $8.31, helped by a wider gross margin of 45.3%.\nThe retailer generated $505.8 million in operating cash in the first nine months and finished the quarter with $1.15 billion in cash versus $96 million in short-term debt. Management repurchased $107.8 million of stock and the board lifted dividends for the 14th straight year; the yield sits near 4.8%.\n\nStill, revenue growth remains tepid. Dillard's needs stronger top-line momentum to justify current multiples. For now, it looks like a capital-return story that may appeal to income-minded, cautious investors.\nIs DDS Stock a Buy? Based on the one year price targets offered by 3 analysts, the average target price for Dillard's Inc is $561.33 with a high estimate of $700.00 and a low estimate of $460.00. The average target implies a downside of -15.41% from the current price of $663.63.\nBased on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Dillard's Inc in one year is $411.66, suggesting a downside of -37.97% from the current price of $663.63. gf value is gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. it is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and the future estimates of the business' performance.

      "Content": "The value that neocloud companies offer to major AI players\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: AVGO\n\nCRWV\n\nMU\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMicron Technology ( MU ) stock continues to pop after boasting strong fiscal first quarter earnings results driven by demand around high-bandwidth memory chips for AI data centers. As more companies invest into large-scale AI infrastructure buildouts, what does this all mean for the broadening AI trade and even neocloud operators?\n\nFreedom Capital Markets Managing Director Paul Meeks talks about the three chip companies he still has at the top of his list and the upside that neocloud companies like CoreWeave ( CRWV ) could offer some of the bigger players, such as Nvidia ( NVDA ).\nAlso catch Paul Meeks explain how much higher he sees Micron's stock going.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Julie\nHow does this sort of change the dynamics in the memory market? I mean, as you mentioned, it's an oligopoly, there are two other players. We've seen memory prices go crazy, not even the high bandwidth kind, the overall kind that goes into all kinds of devices. So what are some of the sort of knock-on effects in the industry that you're watching and other names that you're watching?\n00:24 Paul\nSo I continue to like the people that are benefiting from the uh spend. I recently initiated coverage with Coreweave, which is one of the neo clouds with a $100 price target. But believe it or not, I think there's upside in Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi, some of these companies that when I get push back, what people will say, how can you possibly recommend Nvidia after it's done so well for all these years. Well, it's because I see even more greatness ahead of them. And you know, some of these stocks, Julie, have come down quite a bit in the last couple of weeks. I think it's a good buying opportunity for several of the names.\n01:21 Julie\nUm I'm curious about the the neo clouds in particular Paul, because there have been some questions about that business model, right? That if you were, you know, renting space from someone else, if you're trying to go out to the smaller providers, um as your clients, that maybe you're a little more vulnerable if there are chinks in the armor of this whole um AI thesis. What do you think about that?\n02:02 Paul\nanother excellent question. The way I look at it is you have to look at these contracts that they are signing very carefully. In the case of Core Weve, we have five and six-year deals with well-funded folks like Microsoft and Meta. and they are paying 15 to 25% of total contract value upfront. So there's some initial cash flow. And so I think that even though some of these companies are levered and Cory mind you is highly levered, that they have a nice runway and I think that over the next couple of years their plans are set and they're funded by the most well-funded companies almost on planet Earth.\n03:00 Paul\nAnd the other thing that's interesting about Core Weve, it has an interesting deal with Nvidia, which is also a 6% shareholder in which if Core Weve has any surplus capacity between now and April of 2032, it'll be socked up by Nvidia. So, some people will say that's a quote-unquote circular deal, but I actually like that deal a lot. And so I do think there's upside. Yes, it's speculative, yes, they're highly levered, but I think that this is all under control as long as the spending from the big boys continues. And I think all these companies when they announce their results in January or February, will confirm at least the 2026 capital expenditure spend.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

On December 15, Jefferies upgraded the semiconductor equipment maker to “Buy” and raised the price target to $1,500 from $1,100. The firm believes that KLAC's run is “just beginning,” citing expanding AI accelerator use cases and a robust outlook for leading-edge and advanced packaging demand.\nBesides KLAC, Jefferies also identified Nvidia and Broadcom as companies with sustainable demand from the build out of AI infrastructure. With chip complexity increasing, the firm sees upside for KLA as rising process control intensity plays directly on its strengths.\nThe firm further highlighted how packaging complexity is also rising, which requires more process control and benefits KLAC’s business model.

      "Content": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Sells Broadcom Stock and Buys an Overlooked Stock Up 6,910% Since Its IPO\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MELI\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Broadcom is benefiting from demand for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure due to its strong market position in networking solutions and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).\nMercadoLibre operates the largest commerce and fintech ecosystem in Latin America, and the company is making smart investments in its logistics and credit businesses that should reinforce its dominance.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller was one of the most successful hedge fund managers in history, generating returns of 30% annually over three decades without a single down year. He closed his hedge fund in 2010, and now exclusively manages his own money through Duquesne Family Office.\nIn the third quarter, Druckenmiller sold his entire stake in Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and bought shares of MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) , a stock often overlooked by investors despite returning 6,910% since its 2007 IPO.\nDruckenmiller is an excellent source of inspiration, but the trades mentioned above took place in the third quarter, which ended several months ago. Here is a more current look at Broadcom and MercadoLibre.\nBroadcom: The stock Stanley Druckenmiller sold The investment thesis for Broadcom centers on its strong presence in networking chips and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The company builds the fastest Ethernet switching and routing chips, and it holds over 80% market share. The buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure should drive demand for high-speed networking platforms in the coming years.\n\nAdditionally, Broadcom is the leading supplier of custom AI accelerators, sometimes called ASICs. The company has long designed AI chips for Alphabet 's Google and Meta Platforms , but its clientele has more recently expanded to include TikTok parent company ByteDance, OpenAI, and Anthropic. The company also has other major customers in the pipeline, including Apple and xAI.\nBroadcom reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended in November), beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 28% to $18 billion, driven by particularly strong demand for AI semiconductors. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income increased 37% to $1.95 per diluted share.\nImportantly, Broadcom's custom AI accelerators compete with Nvidia GPUs as the engines that power training and inference workloads in data centers. ASICs are generally cheaper, which has led to robust demand from certain hyperscale customers. \"We see momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double,\" CEO Hock Tan said in the press release.\n\nStory continues\nHowever, while ASICs themselves are often cheaper than Nvidia GPUs, system-level costs are generally higher because custom AI chips require custom software tools that must be built from scratch. ASICs also use more expensive optical interconnects. Consequently, most analysts expect Nvidia to maintain its dominant market position. That could explain why Druckenmiller sold his position.\n\nRegardless, Wall Street expects Broadcom's adjusted earnings to grow 42% annually over the next two years. That makes the current valuation of 50 times adjusted earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 53 analysts, Broadcom has a median target price of $461 per share, which implies 35% upside from its current share price of $342.\nMercadoLibre: The stock Stanley Druckenmiller bought MercadoLibre operates the largest commerce and fintech ecosystem in Latin America. Its e-commerce marketplace accounted for 28% of online retail sales in the region in 2024, and its market share is projected to reach 30% in 2026. The company has been successful due to its first-mover status, as well as its ecosystem of adjacent services.\n\nTo elaborate, MercadoLibre reinforces the network effect inherent to its business model by providing adjacent solutions for advertising, payments, and logistics. In fact, it is the largest advertiser and the largest fintech payment processor in Latin America. The company also has the \"fastest and most extensive delivery network\" in the region.\nMercadoLibre reported decent financial results in the third quarter, despite missing the consensus estimate on the bottom line. Revenue increased 39% to $7.4 billion, driven by solid sales growth across the commerce (33%) and fintech (49%) segments. That was the 27th consecutive quarter in which revenue growth exceeded 30%, according to management.\nMeanwhile, MercadoLibre's operating margin dropped 70 basis points and GAAP earnings increased just 6% to $421 million. But those disappointing numbers were due to strategic investments that strengthen its market position and lay the foundation for stronger growth in the future. For instance, MercadoLibre lowered its free shipping threshold in Brazil and launched its credit card in Argentina.\n\nIndeed, those investments are already paying off to some degree. Unique buyers in Brazil increased 29% in the third quarter, the fastest pace in over four years. Also, the number of items sold in Brazil increased 42%, meaning the average buyer made more purchases. Finally, 60% of Argentine adults do not have a credit card, giving MercadoLibre a chance to pull a large percentage of the population onto its fintech platform.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects MercadoLibre's earnings to increase at 32% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 49 times earnings look quite reasonable. Investors should feel comfortable buying a position today. Among 27 analysts, MercadoLibre has a median target price of $2,842 per share, implying 42% upside from its current share price of $1,998.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

You need a 'strong stomach': Dan Ives' strategy\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: PLTR\n\nCRWV\n\nAMD\n\nIVES\n\nMETA\n\nIn the AI trade, you \"can't just bet on one company,\" Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research, Dan Ives, tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting the importance of diversification for AI investors.\nWatch the video above to hear more about Ives' AI thesis and the 30 stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF ( IVES ).\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThere's another stock I want to ask you about, and that is CoreWeave, which as you know, has sold off pretty sharply. Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock To Buy in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Alphabet is finally getting some recognition from investors for its AI accomplishments.\nThe search-engine giant has ample opportunities to benefit from increased AI spending.\nWhile the stock has gotten a bit expensive, it looks poised to fly higher in the long-run.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has served as an unprecedented bellwether for technology stocks over the last three years. In particular, semiconductor stocks including Nvidia , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , and Broadcom were all ushered into the trillion-dollar club thanks to the AI revolution.\nAs investment in AI infrastructure continues to unfold, I think it's likely that chip stocks will remain sound investment choices. But as 2026 approaches, I see a different tech titan taking center stage: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nLet's dig into how Alphabet has built an AI fortress poised to dominate the future. From there, I'll explore the company's valuation trends and make the case for why now is a great time to buy Alphabet stock hand over fist.\nIt's been a quiet three years for Alphabet...until now The AI revolution kicked off almost exactly three years ago when OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT. ChatGPT quickly captured the imaginations of people all over the world with its ability to answer virtually any question instantly.\nThe dramatic rise in popularity among large language models (LLMs) caused some on Wall Street to pose the idea that traditional search tools like Google were headed for doom. Think of the business stakes at hand here: Why would advertisers continue paying a premium on platforms like Google and YouTube when everyone's attention was flocking to chatbots?\n\nWhile Alphabet's advertising business did show some signs of stalling, the company's cash cow remained somewhat resilient. For a couple of years, revenue from Google and YouTube wasn't as robust as it once was, but it also wasn't plummeting at an alarming rate.\nWhat many investors were overlooking, however, was Alphabet's other ventures. At the beginning of the AI revolution, Google Cloud was operating at an annual revenue run rate of about $29 billion. Meanwhile, this segment of Alphabet's business was unprofitable.\nFast forward to today, and Google Cloud is now on pace for more than $50 billion of annual sales while boasting positive operating income. What's even more interesting is that Google Cloud has won major deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic -- the two LLMs that were once seen as the ultimate existential threat to Google's relevancy.\n\nStory continues\nBesides the success of its cloud division, Alphabet has also successfully launched its own LLM -- called Gemini. According to management, Gemini has over 650 million monthly active users (MAUs) while search queries are increasing threefold quarter over quarter.\nWhy 2026 could be epic for Gemini For most of the AI revolution, I think the consensus view around Alphabet was one of uncertainty. While not everyone bought into the extinction of Google narrative, it's fair to say that it took some time for Alphabet to prove its AI ambitions were bearing fruit.\nOne of the biggest catalysts the company has going into next year is an extension of Google Cloud through commercializing custom hardware. Specifically, Alphabet's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), known as tensor processing units (TPUs), have seen some early traction with Apple and Anthropic.\n\nWhile TPUs aren't going to dethrone Nvidia's GPU business anytime soon, I think Alphabet is on the cusp of unlocking a new wave of growth in the cloud infrastructure market that's currently dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\nAlphabet stock could soar to new highs next year As of this writing, Alphabet's forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio is hovering around 28 -- its highest level during the AI boom.\nNormally, I tend to stay away from momentum stocks. More times than not, by the time a company reaches a record high, it's dicey to buy the premium and expect shares to move materially higher.\nThis is a rare instance where I think the opposite is true. Alphabet's current price increase reflects two factors: An appreciation for the company's current operating performance and a bullish outlook that Alphabet will keep up its strong performance.\n\nAlphabet's ecosystem -- from search, cloud computing, consumer electronics, custom hardware, and more -- is a major differentiator compared to its mega cap peers. The company has a unique flexibility stitched into its DNA -- benefiting from AI across its various assets and subsidiaries during any market cycle. These dynamics position Alphabet as a particularly durable business for the long run.\nAs investments in AI infrastructure are expected to continue rising going into next year, I expect Alphabet to benefit from these tailwinds more so than any one singular chip designer or software developer.\nWith this in mind, I think Alphabet will continue to show signs of accelerating revenue and profit margin expansion across its entire business next year -- which should lead to even more buying from shareholders. Against this backdrop, I see Alphabet as the best opportunity in the AI landscape as 2026 approaches.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

President Trump announced the news in the Oval Office in January, flanked by the respective companies’ leaders, including Oracle chair Larry Ellison — a move that sent the stock soaring .\n\nAI optimism continued to push Oracle shares higher following its quarterly earnings reports in June and September , with AI-driven deals set to push cloud segment revenue to $166 billion in 2030. The stock’s surge in September briefly made Ellison the world’s wealthiest person .\nBut AI euphoria quickly gave way to doubt. Investors became increasingly concerned over the rising use of debt to fund tech firms’ AI spending, just as the payoff of that spending remains hotly debated. Those concerns are evidenced in the budding demand for Big Tech credit default swaps (CDS) — financial contracts that act as insurance by letting investors bet on the likelihood that a company will default on its debt.",

(NASDAQ: AVGO ) is one of the Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for 2026 . The share price of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has fallen more than 19% since the company released its fiscal Q4 2025 results on December 11. The falling investor sentiment comes despite the earnings beat. However, Wall Street remains bullish on the stock with analysts’ 12 month price target reflecting more than 40% upside.\n\n​During the fiscal Q4 2025, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) grew its revenue by 28.18% year-over-year to $18.02 billion, surpassing estimates by $555.89 million. The EPS of $1.95 also topped consensus by $0.08. Management attributed the strong quarterly performance to AI growth from XPUs and networking. Notably, the company forecasts that its AI business will deliver more than 100% year-over-year growth to reach $8.2 billion in Q1 2026.\n​A recent report by Forbes, published on December 18, noted that the falling investor sentiment despite the earnings beat, mainly stems from the disappointing gross margin outlook for Q1 2026. Management expects the margins to compress by around 100 basis points, driven by a shift towards lower-margin AI hardware.\n\n​However, Wall Street maintains its bullish outlook on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). Recently, on December 17, Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $462 price target. Earlier on December 15, Timothy Arcuri from UBS also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and also raised the price target from $472 to $475.\n​Arcuri noted the recent share price pull-back as an overreaction based on his discussion with the company’s management. He added that the drop also indicates overly consensus-long positioning, thereby reflecting widespread bullish consensus. Arcuri highlighted that commentary on AI semiconductor revenue suggests high expectations for the next year, and he raised the price target to $475.\n​Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) designs, develops, and supplies various semiconductor devices and infrastructure software solutions worldwide. The company operates in two segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "The Secret to Finding the Next Broadcom Is Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Broadcom's custom AI chips are growing in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's.\nNow, Amazon has created its own custom AI chip, Trainium3, to carve out its own niche.\nAmazon needs to sustain its strong AWS growth in 2026 to be a successful stock pick.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nSemiconductor company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has enjoyed an incredible year, rising some 50% so far, even after a large pullback due to poorly received fourth-quarter results. This has investors searching for the next Broadcom, as who wouldn't want those incredible one-year returns?\n\nThe secret to Broadcom's rise is tied to the custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips it's developing. These compete directly against Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are incredibly costly due to their impressive performance and flexibility. Broadcom's custom AI chips can outperform Nvidia's GPUs at a lower price point when the workload is set up properly, giving them a huge advantage at the cost of flexibility.\nDesigning custom AI computing units is going to become more popular, as Nvidia's chips are far too expensive not to explore this avenue. While many companies are choosing to partner with Broadcom, others are opting to do it themselves. One of these companies is hiding in plain sight, and its recent release is incredibly promising.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has dived into designing its own AI chip, and the results have been phenomenal. This innovation could provide Amazon with the growth it needs to be a monster stock pick over the next few years, making it an excellent investment today.\nAmazon's new device provides incredible performance Amazon's new computing chip is known as Trainium3. It is built on cutting-edge 3nm (nanometer) chip architecture and delivers impressive performance at a lower price point. Compared to previous generation Trainum2 servers, they offer 4 times the computing performance while improving energy efficiency by 4 times as well. That helps reduce operating costs and run time, which allowed several generative AI clients to reduce training and inference costs by up to 50%, including Anthropic.\n\nThose are huge boosts for Amazon, and it could attract new clients to its servers. One of those is OpenAI, which is reportedly considering using Amazon's Trainium3 chips in exchange for a $10 billion investment. This could be the first of many companies flocking to Amazon's training servers, as cost is starting to become a large bottleneck in the artificial intelligence investing realm.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors want to see real innovation in exchange for their dollars, and companies may need to stretch their funding to achieve better results. Switching from GPUs to alternative computing units like Amazon's is one way to do that, and it could grow in popularity in 2026.\nDepending on how popular this product is, Amazon could become the next Broadcom. We'll see success tied to Amazon's cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), if it has any boost in 2026. Fortunately for Amazon and its investors, it's already looking up.\n\nAWS is critical to Amazon's success Despite AWS accounting for only 18% of Amazon's total revenue, it represents 66% of its operating profits. That's because AWS' margins are far better than the base e-commerce business, so as AWS goes, so will Amazon.\nIn Q3, AWS posted its best growth rate in multiple years, rising at a 20% pace. This indicates that more workloads are coming online at AWS, which is an excellent sign for 2026. If Amazon can continue this momentum in 2026, combined with the rise of Trainium3 workloads, Amazon's stock could dramatically rise in 2026.\n\nWhile I doubt it can duplicate Broadcom's 50% rise this year, I think Amazon is prepped to be a market-beating stock, especially after its underperformance this year. Amazon is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing AI workload, and with the rest of its business also producing strong results (advertising in particular), I think Amazon has what it takes to be a top stock pick in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Is There Now An Opportunity In Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nToday we're going to take a look at the well-established Broadcom Inc. ( NASDAQ:AVGO ). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$413 and falling to the lows of US$325. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Broadcom's current trading price of US$340 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Broadcom’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nIs Broadcom Still Cheap? The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 17.97% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Broadcom today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $288.52, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Broadcom’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\nWhat kind of growth will Broadcom generate? Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Broadcom. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You Are you a shareholder? AVGO’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nStory Continues\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AVGO, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Broadcom you should know about.\nIf you are no longer interested in Broadcom, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Be Worth More Than $2 Trillion by 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMETA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Tesla is operating in a difficult environment.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are providing computing units for the AI build-out.\nMeta Platforms' stock was slammed due to spending plans.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nThere are currently five stocks that have a valuation of $2 trillion or more. Outside of these five, only a handful of others are in a position to be worth $2 trillion or more in 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\n\nThe next largest company is Berkshire Hathaway , which has a market cap of about $1 trillion. For that stock to double would be a huge feat, especially without Warren Buffett at the helm, so let's put it aside.\nNow we're left with Meta, Tesla, Broadcom, and TSMC. Which of these will make it to $2 trillion by the end of 2026?\nAll will beat the market if they reach $2 trillion by 2026 The largest is Meta Platforms, sitting at a $1.66 trillion valuation. The smallest is Taiwan Semiconductor at $1.49 billion. That places all four of these stocks in relatively close proximity to each other, which means the required return is fairly similar. Meta would need to rise 21% while Taiwan Semiconductor must rise 34%. Both of these potential performance figures would indicate a market-beating stock, so if any of these companies can breach the $2 trillion threshold, they will likely be great to own.\nThe $2 trillion threshold is also uncharted territory for this group. Both Meta and Broadcom have come close, but neither has crossed into the $2 trillion zone.\nI think three will make it, while one will be left out If you sort the companies by growth rates, it's clear that there's one outlier: Tesla.\nIt's no secret that Tesla is struggling in the current environment, due to electric vehicle (EV) credits ending from the U.S. government. Meanwhile, the other three are posting incredible growth rates that don't look to be slowing down anytime soon in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips in the artificial intelligence supply chain. Without its production capabilities, none of the AI computing power we know now would be possible. Demand for AI chips isn't slowing down, and Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to continue growing at a rapid 21% pace in 2026, according to Wall Street analysts. However, these analysts have consistently underestimated Taiwan Semiconductor's growth over the past few years, so don't be surprised if TSMC outperforms these expectations. Couple that with the second-cheapest valuation in this group, and Taiwan Semiconductor should reach the $2 trillion mark in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms nearly entered the $2 trillion club, but pulled back following a poorly received third-quarter earnings report. While the business's performance was incredible, investors didn't like Meta's massive spending plans. There is growing concern that Meta is overextending itself, which is why investors have started selling off the stock. However, I think Meta is just the first company to max out its cash flows being devoted to AI computing capacity, and it won't be the last. The market will come back around to Meta's stock in 2026 and will send it back to levels allowing it to reach the $2 trillion point.\n\nLast is Broadcom, which also sold off due to 2026 guidance. Wall Street wanted greater visibility into faster AI growth, and Broadcom told investors they needed to be patient. Still, Broadcom informed investors that its Q4 AI revenue was $6.5 billion, up 74% year over year, and that it projects Q1's growth to be north of 100%. Broadcom is a much larger business than just AI, and the business isn't nearly as successful in those endeavors. Still, I think sustained growth from its custom AI computing units will drive Broadcom's stock higher in 2026, allowing it to reach the $2 trillion threshold.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now?

      "Content": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMU\n\nAVGO\n\nAMD\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock has underperformed its peers in the semiconductor space this year.\nThe company's valuation is becoming cheaper despite its historic operating performance.\nNvidia has a number of catalysts going into 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWhen it comes to leading semiconductor stocks, investors don't need to look much further than companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Broadcom , Advanced Micro Devices , Micron Technology , and of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nWhile Nvidia has been the headline act for much of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, shares have lagged its chip peers throughout 2025.\nAs 2026 draws closer, growth investors may be wondering if Nvidia remains a good buy , or if now is the time to rotate capital away from the world's most valuable company and seek new opportunities.\nWhat should Nvidia investors be on the lookout for in 2026? For the last three years, Wall Street's primary focus surrounding Nvidia is the performance of its data center business. This segment accounts for the bulk of Nvidia's revenue and profits, as it captures demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPU).\nThroughout the AI revolution, investors have paid close attention to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's commentary around the company's Hopper and Blackwell GPU architectures. While Blackwell remains an important catalyst for Nvidia, investors should start to pay closer attention to guidance around the upcoming Rubin chips. So far, investors have already gotten a small preview of demand for Rubin.\n\nFor instance, Huang recently noted that Nvidia has a total order backlog of around $500 billion for Blackwell, Rubin, and accompanying networking products. Of note, a portion of this revenue has already been booked, with an estimated $300 billion expected to be recognized during 2026.\nIn addition, Anthropic recently signed a $30 billion compute capacity agreement with Microsoft . As part of the deal, Anthropic will be leveraging clusters of Blackwell and Rubin chips.\nAt a macro level, Goldman Sachs estimates that hyperscalers including Microsoft, Alphabet , Amazon , and Meta Platforms will spend roughly $500 billion on AI capital expenditures (capex) next year. Taking this one step further, McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion opportunity over the next five years.\nAgainst this backdrop, investors should monitor how these secular tailwinds fueling accelerated investment in infrastructure continue to impact Nvidia, being aware that rising infrastructure will impact Nvidia well beyond its core data center operation.\n\nStory Continues\nThroughout next year and beyond, Nvidia's opportunities in adjacent markets, including next-generation CPUs and accelerated computing operating systems, should begin to come into focus as well, thanks to some savvy partnerships with Intel and Palantir Technologies .\nNvidia's valuation trends are getting interesting In the table, I've summarized Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, as of the end of each quarter over the last year.\nMetric\nCurrent\n3Q25\n2Q25\n1Q25\n4Q24\nPrice-to-sales (P/S)\n23.3\n30.2\n29.6\n20.7\n26.4\nForward price-to-earnings (P/E)\n23.4\n31.5\n57.4\n24.8\n28.1\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\nThere are two anomalies that stick out from the data.\nFirst, Nvidia's valuation multiples experienced notable compression during the company's first fiscal quarter of 2025 (ended April 30). This was driven by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, as well as fear that a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek could pose a threat to U.S. dominance in the AI landscape.\n\nThe second theme that's beginning to become more noticeable is that Nvidia's P/S and forward P/E ratios are hovering around the same levels as their prior lows earlier this year. Once again, I think this contraction revolves around fear more than anything else. Specifically, investors are concerned about rising competition from AMD and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from Broadcom.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy heading into the new year? While rising competition in the chip space is a very real thing, I don't see Nvidia necessarily losing its grip anytime soon. AI infrastructure is expected to be a multitrillion-dollar market that lasts several years. Buying into the idea that the hyperscalers will migrate away from Nvidia's GPUs overnight is unrealistic.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is becoming cheaper by the day despite the company operating at historic levels and signing new deals and partnerships -- effectively broadening its total addressable market (TAM) beyond data center services and simultaneously bringing new levels of business visibility as the AI infrastructure era kicks off.\nI think now is a great time to buy the dip and capitalize on the chip king's ongoing sell-off. Investors with a long-term time horizon could use the recent depressed price action to add to a core buy-and-hold position. Given these dynamics, I see Nvidia as a no-brainer heading into the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?
