      "Content": "Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) five-year earnings growth trails the 55% YoY shareholder returns\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nBuying shares in the best businesses can build meaningful wealth for you and your family. And we've seen some truly amazing gains over the years. For example, the Broadcom Inc. ( NASDAQ:AVGO ) share price is up a whopping 705% in the last half decade, a handsome return for long term holders. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. And in the last week the share price has popped 7.4%. But this could be related to the buoyant market which is up about 3.1% in a week. It really delights us to see such great share price performance for investors.\n\nThe past week has proven to be lucrative for Broadcom investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance.\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nOver half a decade, Broadcom managed to grow its earnings per share at 49% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 52% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here. .\n\nWhat About Dividends? When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return . The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Broadcom the TSR over the last 5 years was 795%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nStory Continues\nA Different Perspective It's nice to see that Broadcom shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 47% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 55% per year, is even more impressive. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Broadcom that you should be aware of.\n\nThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

If it doesn't, you know, the market's going to come off its wheels. But having said that, I mean, recently, you can look at, you know, some poster childs of the AI trade. You know, I think of an AI heavy name like an Nvidia. It's well off its 52-week high, Joseph, but this market has continued to grind higher. I'm just curious what you make of that.\n00:23 Joseph\nWell, I think that it it it bolsters the the thesis that the 493 certainly have legs. And I think that I think more broadly, the economy is stronger than people thought it would be when we started the year. Uh, rates are probably lower than uh, lower today than where where we thought they would be. Inflation is probably a tick lower uh, than we thought it would be. So the underlying conditions are somewhat better for the broad market and the broad market has been able to weather as you talked about, the bumps in the road that are inevitable uh uh with regard to the Mag 7 and and the AI trade. So, I think it's positive for the index as we enter 2026 that we've seen some level of broadening. And obviously, we see opportunities uh in the defense sector, uh in in healthcare and selectively in technology as well as as this rally continues to broaden.\n01:21 Speaker A\nYeah, let's get to some of those specific names and picks, Joseph. Uh you like Broadcom here for example. How come? What do you like about C.O. Hock Tan's company specifically? Is it the business model, margins, his AI story?\n01:40 Joseph\nWell, you know, our strategy is to invest in recurring revenue businesses and Broadcom has one of the great uh technology recurring revenue businesses. When you think about how they're positioned with regard to AI, they're really very, very well positioned uh in a category where the product, the GPU is 90% of the cost of the solution. And Broadcom with their XPUs is dramatically reducing the cost of effectuating the outcome that AI provides. And so we think that they'll continue to take market share among the hyperscalers, which is going to drive fantastic revenue growth in the AI business. We see the AI business doubling uh in 2026 for Broadcom and we see it growing very, very rapidly uh after 2026. So long-term, they're very, very well positioned with a product that is that is highly efficient for their customers.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Broadcom delivered fourth-quarter earnings of $1.95 per share on revenue of $18.02 billion, both exceeding Wall Street forecasts.\nCEO Hock Tan projected AI chip sales would double year-over-year (YoY) to $8.2 billion in the current quarter, driven by custom chips and AI networking semiconductors. The company also disclosed a massive $73 billion backlog for custom chips and data center components over the next 18 months.\nYet shares initially climbed in after-hours trading before reversing course during the earnings call, ultimately plunging around 17% over two trading sessions. Valued at a market cap of $1.65 trillion, AVGO stock is down 18% below all-time highs.\nInvestors are concerned about potential margin compression as Broadcom scales production. In the recent earnings call, company CFO Kirsten Spears warned that gross margins could decline for some AI chip systems.\n\nLet’s see if you should buy, sell, or hold AVGO stock at the current multiples.\nBroadcom Stock Benefits From a Widening AI Moat Broadcom CEO Hock Tan dropped a bombshell during a recent investor presentation, disclosing that his 2030 compensation incentives are tied to growing AI revenue to more than $120 billion. Comparatively, in fiscal 2025, Broadcom’s AI sales were around $20 billion.\nManagement expects explosive growth despite recent stock weakness and insider selling activity. Tan clarified that Broadcom is laser-focused on just seven customers creating large language models and dismissed the broader enterprise market as irrelevant to the company's core AI strategy.\nThese hyperscalers and AI labs are engaged in a race toward super intelligence, which requires massive investments in compute infrastructure that Broadcom supplies through custom accelerator chips and advanced networking equipment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe CEO emphasized that custom ASICs and networking infrastructure represent Broadcom's competitive moat rather than merchant GPUs sold to thousands of smaller enterprises. He highlighted that networking becomes the critical bottleneck as AI clusters scale from 100,000 to potentially 1 million GPUs working simultaneously.\n\nBroadcom's intellectual property in orchestrating these massive parallel workloads through Ethernet-based networks provides differentiation that competitors struggle to match.\nTan revealed that fiscal 2026 AI revenue growth would accelerate materially beyond the previously guided 60% rate, driven by a recently converted customer focused on inference workloads.\nHe confirmed Anthropic as the mystery customer who placed a $10 billion order for Google's (GOOG) (GOOGL) tensor processing units during the quarter. Broadcom now has five customers for custom chips, with two additional prospects in the pipeline.\nThe networking business stands to benefit as customers transition from copper-based connections to optical networking capable of 100 terabits per second bandwidth. This shift enables memory sharing across 512 or even 1,024 accelerator chips within a single rack, which improves training convergence times. Tan expects this optical transition to accelerate in 2027 as cluster sizes expand.\n\nDespite a bullish long-term vision, Broadcom acknowledged near-term margin pressure as it scales production of AI chip systems.\nIs AVGO Stock Overvalued Right Now? Analysts tracking AVGO stock forecast revenue to increase from $64 billion in fiscal 2025 (ended in October) to $227 billion in fiscal 2030. In this period, adjusted earnings are forecast to expand from $6.82 per share to $23.37 per share.\nIf Broadcom stock is priced at 27x forward earnings, which is similar to its three-year average, the stock should trade around $630 in late 2028, indicating an upside potential of 70% from current levels.\nOut of the 40 analysts covering AVGO stock, 34 recommend “Strong Buy,” three recommend “Moderate Buy,” and three recommend “Hold.” The average AVGO stock price target is $456.20, above the current price of $351.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Uh-Oh! Did Nvidia Just Signal Problems with Intel’s Comeback?\n\nRich Duprey\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nTSM\n\nQuick Read Intel ( INTC ) secured $8.9B from the U.S. government and $5B from Nvidia ( NVDA ) to revive its foundry business.\nNvidia halted testing of Intel’s 18A chip manufacturing process and stopped moving forward with production plans.\nIntel’s foundry turnaround depends on 18A attracting major customers beyond smaller deals with Microsoft and Amazon .\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIntel ( NASDAQ: INTC ) has experienced a dramatic shift in fortunes over the past year. Once viewed as a failing chipmaker losing ground to competitors like Broadcom ( NASDAQ: AVGO ), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( NYSE: TSM ), and Nvidia ( NASDAQ: NVDA ), Intel faced speculation that rivals were circling its foundry business and other assets.\nBy the middle of the year, however, Intel regained momentum through significant backing from the Trump administration, which converted CHIPS Act grants into an equity stake worth approximately $8.9 billion, or 10% of the company, making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. This was followed by a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, giving it roughly a 4% stake, as well as partnerships aimed at joint product development in data centers and PCs.\n\nThese moves indicated renewed confidence, positioning Intel as a key player in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing once again. Yet, a Reuters report today suggests a big potential setback, raising questions about whether Intel's revival is beginning to falter.\nA Promising Rebound Built on Execution Intel's recent progress has been notable, driven by strategic investments and a focus on revitalizing its core businesses. The Trump administration's equity stake provided essential capital and aligned Intel with national priorities for domestic chip production.\nWeeks later, Nvidia's $5 billion commitment further supported Intel's turnaround, with the two firms agreeing to collaborate on custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms and integrated system-on-chips for PCs. An Intel spokesperson emphasized that 18A technologies are \"progressing well.\"\n\nDespite these positive developments, the rebound has always hinged on Intel's ability to execute, particularly in its foundry business. The 18A process node has been central to its plans for regaining manufacturing leadership, as it is intended to enable high-volume production of advanced chips and attract customers.\nNvidia's Decision Raises Questions About 18A According to the Reuters article, Nvidia recently evaluated whether to manufacture its next-generation chips using Intel's 18A process but halted the testing and stopped moving forward. Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed this to Reuters, though Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nStory Continues\nThis development comes despite Nvidia's earlier investment and ongoing product collaborations, which explicitly did not include commitments to use Intel's foundry. Intel has previously noted strong interest in 18A, and the company continues to highlight progress on the node, with products like Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest ramping up toward production.\n\nThe reasons for Nvidia's decision remain unclear, but earlier reports indicated both Nvidia and Broadcom conducted tests on 18A. While testing is a standard step, not all evaluations lead to production commitments.\nIf technical or yield issues contributed to the halt, it could signal challenges for Intel in convincing major designers to shift volume from established leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel's foundry has faced scrutiny over quality and scalability before, though the company maintains that 18A is on track and sees interest shifting to the subsequent 14A node for even more advanced applications.\nBroader Implications for Intel's Foundry Strategy Winning high-profile customers has been a key goal for Intel Foundry, which has invested heavily to compete as a contract manufacturer. Deals with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) for custom chips on 18A have been announced, and Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) might go with Intel for its entry-level M-series chips in 2027, but volumes from such clients are relatively small compared to demands from AI leaders like Nvidia.\n\nNvidia halting the testing -- while not a definitive rejection -- underscores the high bar set for advanced nodes. Competitors continue to dominate high-end production, and Intel must demonstrate reliable yields and performance to secure larger commitments.\nKey Takeaway Investors should not read too much into Nvidia's decision to pause 18A testing at this stage, as qualification processes are lengthy and multifaceted. However, greater caution is warranted moving forward.\nMuch of Intel's turnaround depends on the success of the 18A process in delivering competitive manufacturing capabilities. If the node falls short of expectations in attracting major business from customers, it could complicate the company's path to foundry profitability and an overall recovery.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Broadcom's Semiconductor Growth Picks Up: A Sign of More Upside?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:02 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nGOOG\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nBroadcom ’s AVGO Semiconductor revenues are benefiting from strong demand for XPUs, which are a type of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) necessary to train Generative AI (Gen AI) models. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, AI revenues surged 74% year over year to $6.5 billion. XPU adoption accelerated in the reported quarter as enterprises continue to use these to train their large language models and monetize their platforms through inference APIs and applications. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are major users of these XPUs.\n\nAVGO’s expanding clientele, which now includes Anthropic, is driving growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received a $10 billion order to sell Alphabet’s latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received an additional order worth $11 billion from the same customer. The company’s current order backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion as AVGO’s latest 102-terabit per second Tomahawk 6 switch continues to gain traction. AVGO now expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 AI revenues to double year over year to $8.2 billion.\n\nAVGO’s networking portfolio is gaining from strong demand for Tomahawk 6 products, as well as the Jericho 4 Ethernet fabric router. Broadcom also has a rich partner base that includes the likes of OpenAI, Walmart, NVIDIA, Canonical, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies, Meta Platform, Juniper and Supermicro, among others. AVGO expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 Semiconductor revenues of $12.3 billion, suggesting 50% year-over-year growth. Infrastructure Software revenues are expected to grow 2% year over year to $6.8 billion.\n\nAVGO Faces Tough Competition in the Semiconductor Market Broadcom is a major player in the semiconductor market, but is facing stiff competition from NVIDIA NVDA and Marvell Technology MRVL.\n\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of AI and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for Gen AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues from Data Center (accounted for 89.8% of NVDA revenues) jumped 66% year over year and 25% sequentially to $51.22 billion.\n\nMarvell Technology is benefiting from the strong demand environment across the data center end market. MRVL’s data center end-market revenues jumped 39% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, propelled by strong growth across AI-driven demand for custom XPU silicon and electro-optics interconnect products. Marvell Technology’s AI-driven custom silicon business has secured more than 20 multi-generational XPU and XPU-attach socket wins. MRVL’s design pipeline has expanded to more than 50 opportunities worth $75 billion, underscoring hyperscalers’ growing reliance on Marvell’s differentiated capabilities.\n\nStory Continues\nAVGO’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Broadcom shares have appreciated 45.7% in a year, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nAVGO Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe AVGO stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/earnings of 33.89X compared with the broader sector’s 27.78X.

      "Content": "MRVL's Data Center Revenues Hit $1.5B: Can the Momentum Continue?\n\nOm Jaiswal\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:17 AM PST 3 min read\n\nMarvell Technology MRVL posted strong results in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, which was led by its data center business. Revenues from the data center business reached $1.52 billion, up 38% from a year ago. This segment made up about 73% of total revenues, showing that data centers are now becoming the main growth engine for the company.\n\nThe main growth driver for the data center business is rapidly rising artificial intelligence (AI) spending by large cloud customers. As these customers add more AI servers, they need faster and more reliable networking. This is helping demand for Marvell Technology’s interconnect products, such as optical digital signal processors, drivers and Transimpedance Amplifiers. Management said revenues from optical interconnect products grew at a double-digit rate from the previous quarter, pointing to healthy demand.\nMarvell Technology is also seeing solid growth in its data center switching and storage business. Demand for 12.8T switches remains strong, and the company has started shipping newer 51.2T switches. As a result, Marvell Technology now expects data center switch revenues to exceed $500 million in fiscal 2027.\n\nThe custom silicon business is another key growth area. Marvell Technology already has purchase orders covering the full fiscal-year forecast for a major next-generation XPU program at a large customer. While custom revenues can move up and down each quarter, Marvell technology expects this business to grow at least 20% in fiscal 2027.\n\nLooking ahead, Marvell Technology expects data center revenues to grow more than 25% in fiscal 2027. This outlook is supported by continued AI investments, higher product use inside AI systems and strong customer demand. Overall, MRVL’s wide data center product lineup puts it in a good position to benefit if AI infrastructure spending continues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRVL's fiscal 2026 and 2027 revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 41.9% and 22.4%, respectively.\n\nHow Competitors Fare Against MRVL Marvell Technology competes with Broadcom AVGO and NVIDIA NVDA in the data center market.\nBroadcom benefits from AI through its networking chips and custom silicon used by large cloud customers. AVGO’s AI revenues grew 65% year over year to $20 billion in fiscal 2025 and 74% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Furthermore, Broadcom expects its AI revenues to double year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 to around $8.2 billion.\n\nNVIDIA sits at the center of AI data centers with its graphics processing units (GPUs), which power most AI workloads today. The company reported $51 billion in data center revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, up 66% year over year. NVIDIA also benefits indirectly from higher spending on networking and connectivity around AI clusters, which raises demand for GPUs.\n\nStory Continues\nMRVL's Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Marvell Technology have gained 16.6% in the past six months compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s growth of 25.8%.\nMRVL 6-Month Performance Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Marvell Technology trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 7.33X, higher than the industry’s average of 6.42X.\nMRVL Forward 12-Month (P/S) Valuation Chart\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 80.9% and 26.1%, respectively. The estimates for fiscal 2026 have been revised upward by a penny over the past 30 days, while the estimates for fiscal 2027 have been revised upward by a cent over the past seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMarvell Technology currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

      "Content": "These 6 stocks will lead the $1 trillion chip surge in 2026, BofA says\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAVGO\n\n^GSPC\n\nLRCX\n\nKLAC\n\nThe artificial intelligence boom isn't cooling off — it's getting bigger, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya contends.\nWhile AI skeptics have pointed to eye-popping valuations as a reason to run, Arya said the industry is only at the \"midpoint\" of a decade-long transformation, and it's being led by Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ).\n\nIn a report titled \"2026 Year Ahead: choppy, still cheerful,\" Arya forecast a 30% year-over-year surge in global semiconductor sales that will finally push the sector past a historic $1 trillion annual sales milestone in 2026.\nArya noted a strong belief in companies with \"moats that are quantified by their margin structure.\" In addition to Nvidia and Broadcom, he highlighted four other large-cap semiconductor companies — Lam Research ( LRCX ), KLA ( KLAC ), Analog Devices ( ADI ), and Cadence Design Systems ( CDNS ) — as his top picks for 2026.\n\"I often say that investing in semis is very simple,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call. \"You don't need any sell-side analyst to do that. Just take all your companies, sort them by gross margins, and buy the top five, and you're not going to be that wrong.\"\nBofA estimates that the total addressable market for AI data center systems will reach over $1.2 trillion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion opportunity.\nDespite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious because AI data centers are expensive. A typical 1 gigawatt facility requires upwards of $60 billion in capital expenditures, with roughly half of that going directly to hardware, per Bank of America.\n\nThat raises the question: Will the return on investment ever materialize?",

Finance and YCharts. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio . EPS = earnings per share. Data as of Dec. 23, 2025.\nNvidia: The dominant maker of AI chips and related tech Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), its flagship semiconductors, are considered the gold standard for training artificial intelligence (AI) models and deploying AI applications.\nThe company's data center platform had been performing well for quite some time. But demand began skyrocketing for its AI-enabling products -- its GPUs and high-performance networking products -- soon after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. This event demonstrated to company leaders and the general public the phenomenal capabilities of generative AI.\n\nIn late October at the company's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, D.C., CEO Jensen Huang said that management has \"visibility\" into $500 billion of demand for its key data center technology over the next five quarters . This demand of $100 billion per quarter, on average, is truly mind-blowing. As context, in its fiscal third quarter (ended late October), Nvidia's total revenue was $57.0 billion, of which $51.2 billion was from the data center platform.\nBroadcom: The leading maker of custom AI chips Broadcom develops semiconductors for various end markets and also develops infrastructure software.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's robust growth is being drven by strong demand for its custom AI-enabling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and Ethernet networking products, both for data centers. Its acquisition of software maker VMware in late 2023 is proving to be a shrewd move, as this business is also growing nicely.\n\nBroadcom is the top partner for big tech companies seeking custom ASICs. As the name suggests, these chips are designed for specific applications. These include internal uses and, in some cases, for availability in their cloud computing services. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs can be considered more general-purpose AI chips. There is a need for both GPUs and ASICs, so investors shouldn't be concerned that one of these types of chips will fully win out over the other.\nTSM: The world's largest chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest chip foundry. That means it produces chips of various types for companies that contract out all or some of the manufacturing of chips they design.\nTSM is the largest producer of AI chips worldwide, which has led to significant financial growth in recent years, driven by surging demand for these chips.\n\nTSM's customers include nearly every major chip company, such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which is Nvidia's main rival in the AI-enabling GPU market. Moreover, it also manufactures chips, including AI chips, for major tech companies that have designed their own chips. This includes Apple , widely considered the company's largest customer, though some Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to soon overtake Apple as TSM's top customer.\nAn added benefit for some investors is that TSM pays a decent dividend for a tech company. The dividend yield was 1.13%, as of the close of the market on Dec. 23.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Most members of the Magnificent Seven stocks advanced, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising over +3% to lead gainers in the Dow and Amazon.com (AMZN) gaining more than +1%. Also, some chip stocks gained ground, with Marvell Technology (MRVL) climbing over +3% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 and Broadcom (AVGO) rising more than +2%. In addition, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM) climbed over +5% after the company said it had received multiple acquisition offers as part of its ongoing review of strategic alternatives. On the bearish side, ServiceNow (NOW) fell more than -1% after agreeing to acquire cybersecurity firm Armis for $7.75 billion in cash.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, in its initial estimate of Q3 GDP growth, said on Tuesday that the economy grew at a +4.3% annualized rate, stronger than expectations of +3.3%. Also, U.S. November industrial production rose +0.2% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.1% m/m. At the same time, U.S. durable goods orders fell -2.2% m/m in October, weaker than expectations of -1.5% m/m, and core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation, rose +0.2% m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.3% m/m. In addition, the U.S. Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell to 89.1 in December, weaker than expectations of 91.7.\n“The strongest pace of economic growth in two years is bolstering confidence that corporate earnings will continue to expand robustly in 2026,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. At the same time, U.S. money markets continue to price in at least two Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026.\nMeanwhile, the much-anticipated Santa Claus Rally period officially kicks off today. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has delivered an average return of 1.3%, posting gains 78% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.\n\nStory continues\nToday, investors will focus on U.S. Initial Jobless Claims data, which is set to be released in a couple of hours.

Energy stocks advanced on Wednesday, as oil prices climbed for a sixth straight session. Luxury stocks also gained ground. Meanwhile, the regional Stoxx 600 index hit a new record high on Tuesday and is on track for its best annual performance since 2021, underpinned by lower interest rates, Germany’s fiscal spending push, and investor rotation away from expensive U.S. technology stocks. In other news, the Bank of Spain raised its economic growth forecast to 2.9% from 2.6% for this year and to 2.2% from 1.8% for 2026.

China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.53%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -0.14%.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index closed higher today, extending its gains for a sixth consecutive session. The benchmark index notched its longest winning streak since July. Technology stocks gained ground on Wednesday. Global investors are ramping up bets on Chinese AI-related companies, wagering on the next DeepSeek and looking to diversify. Earlier this week, Moore Threads Technology, often referred to by analysts as “China’s Nvidia,” introduced a range of new products, including its next-generation chip architecture and AI chips. Meanwhile, the yuan extended its gains on Wednesday, moving closer to the key 7-per-dollar level after the People’s Bank of China set a firmer fixing. In other news, the Trump administration said on Tuesday it will impose tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports over Beijing’s “unreasonable” push for chip industry dominance, but will delay the move until June 2027. Hong Kong’s market will be closed on Thursday and Friday for the Christmas holidays, while mainland China’s financial markets will remain open as usual.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index gave up earlier gains and closed slightly lower today, marking its first decline in four sessions. Japanese equities were pressured by a stronger yen. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas sales for the country’s heavyweight exporters, with automakers among the notable underperformers on the day. The Japanese currency rose for a third day as traders stayed alert for signs of intervention following Tokyo’s warning against excessive moves. Financial stocks also slumped, paring some of the sharp gains that followed the Bank of Japan’s interest-rate hike last Friday. Limiting losses, some chip stocks climbed, tracking overnight gains in their U.S. peers. Data from the Cabinet Office released on Wednesday showed that Japan’s October leading economic indicators index, which gauges the economic outlook for a few months ahead based on data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, was revised slightly lower. Meanwhile, minutes from the Bank of Japan’s October meeting released on Wednesday showed that policymakers debated the need to keep raising interest rates toward levels seen as neutral for the economy. A few members of the nine-member board also said recent yen declines could risk an inflation overshoot by driving up import costs. In other news, a draft seen by Reuters showed that Japan plans to issue new government bonds worth about $189 billion to finance a record-sized budget for the next fiscal year. Investor focus is now squarely on a raft of Japan’s economic data, scheduled for release on Friday, including Tokyo core CPI, industrial production, retail sales, and employment figures. Investors also await BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda’s speech on Thursday, as they seek guidance on the central bank’s policy path.

The general rise in the price of goods and services is trending towards the Fed’s 2% goal as of late, which is good news. The higher rates that fought inflation also didn't slow economic activity enough to catalyze a recession. So far, soft landing. This, combined with recent rate cuts (half a percent in September 2024 and a quarter percent in November 2024) have led to strong stock market performance in 2024. The icing on the cake for 2024 returns was Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. Presidential Election in early November, sending major indices to all-time highs in the week following the election. Still, debates around the health of the economy and the impact of potential tariffs and corporate tax cuts remain, leaving much uncertainty around 2025.\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals?

      "Content": "Quantum Enablers Poised for 40% Plus Growth in 2026: INTC, AVGO & TER\n\nUrmimala Biswas\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QBTS\n\nLMT\n\nINTC\n\nAVGO\n\nIONQ\n\nThe pure quantum hardware sector, featuring companies like IonQ and D-Wave, has garnered significant attention. These firms have made tangible progress, securing government contracts, enterprise pilots and cloud integrations. Analysts characterize these pure plays as long-term prospects with growth potential but not guaranteed near-term earnings drivers for 2026.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that quantum offers no near-term investment opportunity. Instead, the more compelling path lies in quantum enablers - companies already generating revenues today by supplying the infrastructure, semiconductors, testing tools, cloud platforms and security frameworks required for quantum adoption at scale.\nSo, if the goal is to participate in quantum’s growth story with measurable financial outcomes in 2026, it makes sense to look beyond the flagship hardware makers and toward the ecosystem enabling quantum adoption today.\nHere in this article, we have discussed three such quantum computing enablers, Intel INTC, Broadcom AVGO and Teradyne TER, which are projected to report more than 40% earnings growth in 2026.\nThe Enabler Advantage: Real Revenues, Not Future Promises At present, several established semiconductor and enterprise technology companies are positioned to benefit from quantum development while being simultaneously projected to report solid earnings growth in 2026.\nAdvanced Micro Devices AMD, for example, is collaborating with IBM on hybrid high-performance computing and quantum workloads, leveraging its CPUs and accelerators within quantum-adjacent systems. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD suggests roughly 58% earnings growth in 2026, driven primarily by data center demand rather than speculative quantum revenues.\n\nPost-Quantum Cryptography: Demand is Already Here Perhaps the most immediate quantum-linked opportunity lies in post-quantum cryptography. Governments and enterprises are racing to secure data against future quantum decryption risks, often referred to as “Q-Day.” Industry research and regulatory guidance increasingly emphasize early migration to quantum-resilient encryption standards.\n\nSEALSQ Corp. illustrates this trend. The company has commercialized secure chips with embedded post-quantum cryptography and expanded partnerships in defense and critical infrastructure, demonstrating real-world adoption rather than experimental pilots. The stock is projected to report 66.7% earnings growth in 2026.\nIn 2025, Lockheed Martin LMT advanced its role as a quantum enabler by moving quantum technologies closer to real defense applications, including a U.S. Department of Defense Innovation Unit contract to prototype a quantum-enabled inertial navigation system (QuINS) that can operate without GPS, in partnership with Q-CTRL and AOSense. The stock is projected to report 34.8% earnings growth in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\n2025 Stock Comparison of Quantum Enablers\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n3 Quantum Computing Enablers With Strong Growth Potential Intel : Its positioning as a quantum enabler rests on continued progress in scaling qubit counts and improving device performance using its legacy CMOS manufacturing infrastructure. By applying its 300 mm fabrication techniques to silicon spin qubits, Intel expects to incrementally increase qubit connectivity and fidelity, essential steps toward larger, more uniform qubit arrays while refining control and interconnect technologies. Continued collaboration with research institutions in 2026 should further accelerate collective understanding of qubit behavior and materials interface challenges, helping Intel contribute to the broader quantum ecosystem even as commercial fault-tolerant systems remain on a multi-year horizon.\n\nIntel, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, is expected to report earnings growth of 83.4% in 2026 on revenue growth of 3.3%. The stock has skyrocketed 81.4% in 2025.\nBroadcom : In 2025, Broadcom strengthened its position as a quantum enabler by embedding post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into enterprise networking and storage products, turning future quantum security risks into near-term demand. The company rolled out quantum-safe Fibre Channel and SAN solutions, including Emulex secure host bus adapters and Brocade Gen 8 Fibre Channel platforms, which integrate PQC and 256-bit encryption to protect data in motion across mission-critical infrastructure.\nIn 2026, Broadcom is positioned to benefit from rising demand for quantum-resilient infrastructure, driven by regulatory mandates such as CNSA 2.0, NIS2 and DORA and growing AI-led data center workloads, enabling quantum-linked growth without dependence on commercial quantum computers.\n\nBroadcom, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, is expected to report earnings growth of 42.5% in fiscal 2026 (ending October 2026) on revenue growth of 44.8%. The stock has gained 47.3% in 2025.\nTeradyne : In 2025, Teradyne strengthened its role as a quantum enabler by expanding its photonics and semiconductor test capabilities, highlighted by its acquisition of Quantifi Photonics, a specialist in photonic integrated circuit (PIC) testing.\nThe deal enhances Teradyne’s ability to deliver scalable PIC test solutions essential for optical interconnects used in high-performance and hybrid computing systems. Teradyne also introduced a high-volume, double-sided wafer probe test cell for silicon photonics with ficonTEC, supporting advanced electro-optical testing. These investments position Teradyne to benefit from rising demand for photonics, AI infrastructure, and high-performance computing test solutions, which underpin future quantum-adjacent ecosystems.\n\nTeradyne, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, is expected to report earnings growth of nearly 45% in 2026 on revenue growth of 22%. The stock has gained 56.7% in 2025. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Applied Digital Is Building the Compute Power That AI Needs. Could the Stock Surge Next?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: APLD\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Applied Digital is in the right place at the right time as AI spending ramps up.\nIts ability to achieve projects on time and on budget may help it win over the trust of big tech companies.\nA single deal could add billions of dollars to Applied Digital's balance sheet, and the company is in a position to sign several big deals.\n10 stocks we like better than Applied Digital ›\n\nArtificial intelligence is revolutionizing the world. AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT quickly became mainstream, with autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots on the way. All of these innovations require AI chips, which is why investors have been loading up on semiconductor stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom .\nThese AI chips work, but there's one big problem. They all require significant power to operate. AI models and innovations require gigawatts to operate, and traditional data centers aren't cutting it. Those buildings aren't optimized for AI workloads, and that's where AI data center providers like Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) come in.\nApplied Digital has roughly 4 gigawatts worth of data center capacity at the moment, and that could translate into billions of dollars in annual recurring revenue once it's all set up and deals have been established. Applied Digital has already entered three lease agreements with CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) , with the total revenue coming to approximately $11 billion over 15 years.\nThe leases cover 400 megawatts, and Applied Digital's 4 gigawatt pipeline suggests the company could support nine additional deals like the CoreWeave contract. Here's why Applied Digital could expand beyond CoreWeave and continue to win over tech giants.\nThe AI race is intense The key players in the AI race have all committed to spending more money on this technology. Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , and Meta Platforms are some of the top players in the industry. These companies generate billions of dollars in quarterly profits and view AI as the next internet boom.\nAI models, autonomous vehicles , and humanoid robots have the potential to change how people shop and interact with the world. Companies know the potential of AI and have already thrown a lot of money at Nvidia. Now, they are increasingly looking at the energy bottleneck that companies like Applied Digital solve.\n\nRight now, Applied Digital makes almost all of its AI revenue from CoreWeave. Other AI data center providers like Iren (NASDAQ: IREN) and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) have made deals with Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and other tech companies. It's fair to assume Applied Digital will land deals like that in the future, especially since it has proven to be a trustworthy option for CoreWeave.\n\nStory Continues\nApplied Digital is a leading data center builder Timelines are critical for maintaining a lead in the AI race, and Applied Digital is doing its part. The AI data center provider told investors that its 100 MW building at Polaris Forge 1 is nearing completion while remaining on time and on budget.\nFulfilling project benchmarks will help Applied Digital build more trust with tech giants. Applied Digital Chairman and CEO Wes Cummins also views it that way.\n\n\"We feel this third lease validates our platform and execution, positioning Applied Digital as a trusted strategic partner to the world's largest technology companies,\" Cummins said in the Q3 press release. \"With hyperscalers expected to invest approximately $350 billion into AI deployment this year, we believe we are in a prime position to serve as the modern-day picks and shovels of the intelligence era.\"\nApplied Digital's 4-gigawatt pipeline also puts it ahead of most AI data center stocks. Iren has approximately 3 gigawatts in its pipeline, while Cipher Mining has 3.2 gigawatts in its pipeline. Applied Digital has the lead, which will come in handy once data centers are built and tech companies scramble to sign big deals.\n\nNew deals can happen quickly and suddenly change the long-term view Applied Digital has a 15-year contract with CoreWeave for $11 billion that covers 400 megawatts. It's a big contract, but it's not the only one in the industry. Iren signed a five-year, $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft for 200 megawatts. Cipher Mining also signed a 15-year deal with Amazon Web Services for $5.5 billion, and that contract covers 300 megawatts.\n\nA single deal adds billions of dollars to an AI data center provider's revenue. These are long-term agreements that result in steady recurring revenue. When Applied Digital has all 4 gigawatts ready to go, it can support enough deals to make billions of dollars each year. The company may have only made $64 million in Q1 FY26, but revenue growth should compound quickly based on the CoreWeave leases and future deals. That development sets the stage for Applied Digital stock to continue its rally.\nShould you buy stock in Applied Digital right now?

      "Content": "3 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:38 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: CRSP\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points CRISPR Therapeutics has figured out a way to successfully repair genetic code. Monetizing this know-how is the next step.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) data center interconnectivity powerhouse Broadcom hasn’t had much competition … until now.\nChina’s AI industry is mostly developing in its own silo. One company is positioned to dominate it.\n10 stocks we like better than CRISPR Therapeutics ›\n\nAll investors would love to get rich overnight. As anyone who's been in the market for a while can attest, however, that's just not how things work. Growing wealth takes time. And, the more time you're willing and able to give your picks, the better your returns tend to be.\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three stocks that are not only solid long-term prospects. Granted, they will require lengthy holding periods to reach their full potential and pay off in full. This, of course, means taking the risk of stepping into a name with a future that's still a bit fuzzy and far from guaranteed. If things pan out the way they appear to, though, this risk will be well worth it.\n1. CRISPR Therapeutics The premise of repairing damaged or faulty DNA has long been on the healthcare industry's mind. It didn't become a commercial reality, however, until late 2023, when CRISPR Therapeutics ' (NASDAQ: CRSP) Casgevy became the first-ever FDA-approved gene therapy. Although it's only approved to treat sickle cell disease, it's a tacit but important validation of the underlying science.\n\nThat science is the use of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -- or CRISPR -- found in human DNA to cut out damaged genetic code and then replace it with the correct one. Or, more specifically, removing a segment of faulty DNA forces the body to use its own self-repair process to create a permanent, healthy fix.\nThe idea has near-term promise as the basis for treating diabetes and autoimmune diseases, as well as for cardiovascular diseases -- all of which CRISPR Therapeutics is working on in clinical trials now underway. Further down the road, though, this approach could conceivably be refined to treat cancer, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, and more. That's why Precedence Research believes the global CRISPR therapy market is poised to grow at an average annualized pace of nearly 17% through 2034.\n\nGiven that one of the company's co-founders (Emmanuelle Charpentier, Ph.D.) won a Nobel Prize in 2020 for her discovery and creation of this CRISPR-based approach to gene editing, it's not a stretch to suggest CRISPR Therapeutics itself is very well positioned to capture at least its fair share of the medical science's future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nJust understand that medical science moves incredibly slowly, requiring a long-term mindset from investors.\nThis might put things in perspective, as well as help you stick with it in the meantime: Although Casgevy was approved as a treatment for sickle cell a little over two years ago, its revenue isn't expected to truly explode until next year, ramping up from this year's projection of just a few million dollars to a little over $100 million next year to nearly $300 million after that. By then, progress on fronts other than sickle cell disease should start driving the stock on a more consistent basis.\n\n2. Astera Labs To date, Broadcom has been one of the big names other than Nvidia to soar thanks to the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia makes the computing processors used in most AI data centers. Broadcom then provides the technology that connects them to turn them into a true neural network.\nAs is so often the case, though, smaller and newer competitors watched what Broadcom did to become the dominant name in this sliver of the AI business, and then figured out a way to do it better.\n\nAstera Labs (NASDAQ: ALAB) is one of those smaller and newer competitors. It makes a range of interconnectivity solutions purpose-built for artificial intelligence data centers. For instance, its Aries line of PCIe Smart Gearboxes allows data center owners/operators to connect next-generation processors with previous-generation motherboards, extending the useful life of the latter while allowing the utilization of the former.\nAt the same time, Astera's Leo CXL Smart Memory Controllers are \"the industry's first purpose-built solution that supports both memory expansion and memory pooling,\" according to the company's website, offering access to memory in a way that gets the most out of an artificial intelligence platform, and inference platforms in particular.\n\nPriced at nearly 90 times this year's projected profits of $1.78 per share, Astera Labs stock isn't cheap. That's the chief reason the stock's peeled back so much from its September peak, outpacing the overall market's weakness for this time frame.\nJust take a step back and see the bigger picture. After more than doubling this year, analysts are calling for revenue growth of more than 40% next year, driving per-share profits up from $1.78 to $2.37 as a result. This is likely just a glimpse of the kind of demand we're going to see for specialized AI interconnectivity solutions for a long, long while.\n3. Alibaba Finally, add Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) to your list of brilliant growth stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.\nIt's an addition that might surprise some investors who have kept loose tabs on the company. Although no one denies it dominates China's e-commerce market, it's a market that's as saturated as it is mature. It's also running into an economic headwind.\n\nFor perspective, the country's retail sales only grew 1.3% in November, slowing from October's pace of 2.9%, as well as falling short of estimates for growth of 2.8%. Concern isn't entirely unmerited.\nExcept that e-commerce isn't going to be Alibaba's big growth engine for the foreseeable future. It's going to be artificial intelligence. In August, the company unveiled an AI processor chip that's surprisingly competitive with Nvidia's powerful H2O processors designed for overseas customers. Less than a month later, it had already lined up its first customer: telecom giant China Unicom. More are sure to be in the works, too.\nIt's not just powerful AI processors, though. Unlike many of the Western Hemisphere's hardware makers and software companies, Alibaba jointly brings both to the table, with a deep lineup of open-source software offerings that work well with its conventional cloud computing service and its home-grown artificial intelligence model called Qwen. Indeed, just last month, the company introduced its consumer-oriented chat-based AI assistant Qwen App. It's yet another way Alibaba is widening its digital ecosystem's net, even if it doesn't yet know exactly how it's going to monetize every aspect of this deep reach.\n\nIt matters simply because China's artificial intelligence industry is apt to grow there, like other AI platforms are growing elsewhere. Morgan Stanley expects the country's AI industry will be worth $140 billion by 2030, while Goldman Sachs believes more than 30% of China's corporations will be utilizing some sort of artificial intelligence tech by the end of the same time frame. Alibaba is readier than any other to help make that happen.\nShould you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?

      "Content": "Broadcom (AVGO) Stock Options Are Signaling Pensiveness. Here’s Why the Fear Might Be Unwarranted.\n\nJosh Enomoto\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 10:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nWith fears of a bubble brewing in artificial intelligence consistently wreaking havoc on tech players in the fourth (calendar) quarter, semiconductor and software giant Broadcom (AVGO) has been put through the ringer. True, on a year-to-date basis, AVGO stock is doing well, gaining over 47%. However, in the trailing month, the security is down almost 10%.\n\nWhat has regular, everyday investors freaked out is that even the smart money appears pensive. Take a look at Barchart’s options flow screener, which focuses exclusively on big block transactions likely placed by major institutions. On Dec. 8, a few days before its fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings disclosure, net trade sentiment stood at over $151.16 million. However, just 10 days later, net trade sentiment slipped to $148.84 million below parity.\nMore News from Barchart This Michael Burry Stock Spiked on a $1B Activist Stake. How Our Top Analyst Found the Trade Early.\nValero (VLO) Stock Just Triggered a Rare Quant Signal the Options Market Is Missing\nPalo Alto Networks Stock Is Down But Not Out - Worth Buying PANW Here?\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nEven though Broadcom beat on both the top and bottom lines, disappointments over a less-than-expected AI backlog, combined with concerns about operating margins, weighed heavily on AVGO stock. Basically, the central anxiety is that, with the low-hanging AI fruit being plucked, Broadcom and its ilk need to prove viability.\nBecause of this great overhang, it’s not terribly surprising that AVGO’s unusual options activity screener also shows structural pensiveness. While it’s important not to read too deeply into any one metric, here’s what we can largely infer. Due to very long-dated out-the-money (OTM) calls being paired with long-dated, deep in-the-money (ITM) puts, the smart money is effectively hedged for kinetic uncertainty.\nIf the transactions symbolized directional bets, you would expect the bulk of the transactions to feature more realistic call and put strike prices. Instead, what’s happening here is that most of these strikes are positioned to respond only at the tails of the underlying outcome distribution.\n\nWhile I’m not going to sit here and pretend that I know what the smart money is thinking about, the unusual options activity points to net protection against unusual behaviors. Otherwise, the structure of activity points to a lack of confidence in where AVGO stock may go.\nUsing Risk Geometry to Narrow Down the Possibilities for AVGO Stock Another clue regarding the hedging activity that’s occurring right now is the relatively heightened implied volatility (IV). If we look at Barchart’s Expected Move calculator, you’ll notice that for the options chain expiring Feb. 20, 2026, the expected range of outcomes goes from $302.85 to $380.05, thus representing an 11.3% move in either direction relative to Monday’s close.\n\nStory Continues\nThat’s a very wide dispersion, which stems in large part from IV, which is a residual value based on actual order flows. Therefore, we have a situation where AVGO stock could shoot quite high over the next two months or it could sharply correct.\nFor traders, you have two basic paths: you can either play the volatility game or you can take a directional wager. Personally, I prefer the latter because betting on volatility is a tricky business when IV is already heightened due to substantial hedging activities.\n\nTo make an informed decision, we must calculate the risk geometry of AVGO stock. This can be accomplished through a hierarchical distribution. If we took a single 10-week strand of AVGO’s price data, the return during this period won’t tell us much about the probability of performance for the other weeks in the dataset.\nBut what if we took hundreds of rolling 10-week trials and stacked them in a fixed-time distribution? Under this framework, the most consistent behaviors would create a bulge in probability mass. This bulge represents risk geometry, which tells us how buyers become more aggressive in their speculative fervor.\nMore importantly, risk geometry also shows us where buyers are tempted to become sellers. In this manner, we can identify both upside profit opportunities and help curtail opportunity costs.\nUsing this hierarchical approach, we note that the typical 10-week distribution would land AVGO stock somewhere between $330 and $380, assuming an anchor price of $341.48, Monday’s close. However, the current quantitative signal is the 4-6-D sequence; that is, in the trailing 10 weeks, AVGO printed only four up weeks, leading to an overall downward slope.\n\nUnder this setup, the forward 10-week returns would typically range between $322 and $404. Further, probability mass would be thickest between $350 and $380.\nTwo Enticing Wagers Available to Consider Given the market intelligence above, perhaps the most obvious trade is the 350/360 bull call spread expiring Feb. 20, 2026. With the strike price sitting right on the center of probability mass, there would seem to be a solid chance for this trade to be fully profitable.\nPlus, if AVGO stock rises through the second-leg strike ($360) at expiration, the maximum payout would be roughly 133%. That’s an awfully nice reward. However, one thing to keep in mind is probability decay (or lack thereof).\nBetween $350 and $380, probability density only drops by 7.48%. Based on the statistical evidence, there’s a good chance that if AVGO stock is going to hit $360, it can reasonably hit $380. Therefore, capping the reward at $360 may risk absorbing a hefty opportunity cost.\n\nNow, the thing is, from $380 to $390, probability density drops by 64.14%. In other words, if we cap our reward at the $380 strike, the chance of us absorbing an opportunity cost is exponentially less than at $360, assuming that the same sentiment regime assumption holds.\nIf it does hold, you could be leaving money on the table with the 350/360 spread. Instead, the boldest idea is the 370/380 bull spread, also expiring Feb. 20.\nRisky? Extremely. But you’re also looking at a payout of nearly 228%.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Where Will Broadcom (AVGO) Stock Be in 5 Years?\n\nDavid Moadel\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 6:52 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nQuick Read Broadcom (AVGO) has a P/E ratio exceeding 70x and pays a small dividend.\nOn the other hand, Broadcom’s expected $73 billion AI product backlog should jump-start AVGO stock to new heights.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nSometimes in discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) hardware providers, Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ) gets left out of the conversation. Yet, it's a mistake for technology investors to overlook Broadcom and AVGO stock.\nAlong with the potential for a Broadcom stock split, there may be a value proposition for investors here. In five years, unless there's a catastrophic event, Broadcom shares could trade much higher than they do today.\nIf that happens, you'll wish you had gotten in before the rocket ride started. When all is said and done, value investors should open their minds and consider AVGO stock a bargain even if it's not immediately obvious.\nNot an Obviously Attractive Stock At first glance, some investors might not be immediately find Broadcom stock attractive. For one thing, the share price recently pulled back from nearly $415 to $340, representing a scary 18% drawdown.\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing, though, if you're a value investor looking to hold AVGO stock for five years. Maybe the 18% share-price correction was needed in order to bring Broadcom down to a low valuation.\n\nThis theory is difficult to support with old-school metrics, however. For example, Broadcom has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 71x to 72x , which doesn't look like a bargain.\nFurthermore, Broadcom's forward annual dividend yield of 0.76% probably won't impress many income investors. Sometimes a share-price pullback will set the stage for a high dividend yield, but this apparently hasn't happened with AVGO stock.\nBroadcom's Knockout Quarter In order to justify a five-year buy-and-hold with Broadcom stock, the company really needs to demonstrate its growth potential. From a financial standpoint at least, Broadcom definitely checked the right boxes with its fourth-quarter fiscal year 2025 results.\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan had every right to brag when he announced the company's record quarterly revenue of $18 billion, up 28% year over year. Tan further clarified that Broadcom's revenue growth was \"driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74%\" year over year.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's difficult to extrapolate five years out, but clearly Broadcom's growth trajectory is on a powerful uptrend. If you can believe it, Broadcom's Q4 FY2025 GAAP-measured net income nearly doubled year over year, increasing 97% to $8.518 billion.\nAlso on a year-over-year basis, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) grew 36% to $7.466 billion while the company's adjusted EBITDA expanded 34% to $12.218 billion. Given these figures, it's surprising that Broadcom isn't a darling of the financial market.\n\nSo maybe value investors ought to be willing to overlook Broadcom's seemingly high P/E ratio. Given AVGO stock's five-year trajectory and the company's growth pathway, a $500 share price in a couple of years and $800 in five years is entirely possible.\nGreat Expectations Besides, even if the company doesn't get all of the attention on Wall Street, Broadcom is a power player among AI hardware producers. To cite one example, Broadcom recently introduced the Brocade X8 Directors and Brocade G820 storage network products.\nThe company describes these products as the \"industry’s first 128G Fibre Channel platforms designed for today’s mission-critical workloads and enterprise AI applications.\" Only time will tell, but these could prove to be major revenue generators as Broadcom expands its array of enterprise AI hardware offerings.\n\nLooking ahead, Broadcom anticipates $73 billion worth of AI product backlog over the next year and a half. Deliveries of these products, moreover, should drive 150% year-on-year AI revenue growth for Broadcom in fiscal year 2026.\nGranted, these are only expectations and not all predictions work out as planned. Ultimately, Broadcom will only succeed and thrive over the next five years if enterprise AI product demand remains robust.\nCould AVGO Stock Hit $800 in Five Years? The point is that if you see an AI bubble and expect it to burst, then you probably shouldn't buy and hold Broadcom stock. As the old saying goes, scared money doesn't make money.\nHowever, without an AI hardware market collapse, the runway is clear for AVGO stock to hit $800 in five years. Broadcom knocked it out of the part in Q4 FY2025, and the company's AI product backlog prediction should boost investors' confidence.\n\nTherefore, it's fine to keep track of Broadcom's seemingly high P/E ratio and small dividend, but there's no need to obsess over these figures. Instead, consider owning AVGO stock after the recent 18% dip and holding your Broadcom shares for five years or longer.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

CLS reported quarterly revenues of $3.19 billion, up 27.8% year over year. The figure exceeded management’s guidance of $2.875 billion to $3.125 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $170 million. The growth was driven by multiple factors.\n\nThe company boasts a robust portfolio of enterprise-level data communications and information processing infrastructure products, such as routers, switches, data center interconnects, edge solutions and servers. Such a comprehensive product suite, combined with a strong focus on innovation, is allowing Celestica to tap into the expanding AI infrastructure market. The company is actively collaborating with other industry leaders such as AMD and Broadcom to further augment its portfolio offerings.\n\nDuring the third quarter, net sales from the company’s Connectivity and Cable Solution portfolio surged 43.2% year over year to $2.41 billion. The growth was primarily driven by healthy demand for 800G and 400G switching products in the data center networking vertical.\n\nPer a report from Grand View Research, the global data center networking market is valued at $38.49 billion in 2024. The market is projected to witness a 17.2% compound annual growth rate from 2025 to 2033. This presents a solid growth opportunity for Celestica. Management is bullish about its revenue growth outlook. The company expects to generate revenue between $3.325-$3.575 billion, indicating 36% year over year growth backed by continuous momentum in the data center market.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring? Celestica faces competition from Jabil, Inc. JBL and Flex Ltd . FLEX in the Electronics Manufacturing Services industry. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Jabil reported revenues of $8.3 billion, up from $6.96 billion a year ago, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $227 million. The uptick was driven by healthy demand in the Capital Equipment and AI-related Cloud and Data Center Infrastructure verticals. Jabil is steadily expanding its portfolio offering to gain a competitive edge in the AI data center vertical.\n\nIn the September quarter, Flex generated $6.8 billion in revenues, up 4% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $142 million. The uptick was driven by strong data center growth in both the cloud and power end markets. Flex’s diversified portfolio, spanning multiple industries — from cloud infrastructure and AI data centers to automotive and healthcare — continues to be a key strength.\n\nCelestica's Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Celestica’s shares have soared 215.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 93.7%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Celestica trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 37.68, up from the industry average of 24.13.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 6.3% to $5.90 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 have also increased 20.9% to $8.20.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCelestica currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "1 Stock I'd Buy Before Tesla in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Tesla is hovering around an all-time high despite its core automotive business posting poor results.\nNvidia’s high margins enable it to invest aggressively in research and development without draining its cash flows.\nNvidia is a far better value than Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been on a tear -- hitting an all-time high on Dec. 15 . Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Plus, get a 1% bonus if you transfer your investments and keep them there until December 31, 2025.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) traded significantly lower over the past month as the former high-flying AI server maker faces intense scrutiny regarding its accounting practices and delayed financial filings. The company is fighting to regain investor trust after a tumultuous period that saw its valuation severely reset amid fears of a potential delisting.\nAgainst that backdrop, we ran Super Micro Computer through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI’s GPT. The goal was not to chase a sensational long-term target, but to see how a data-driven model handicaps the next 60 days for a stock that has become shorthand for the entire AI trade.\nWhat the AI model is actually predicting The agent was asked to generate a near-term outlook for Super Micro Computer, using recent price action and a focused set of technical indicators. At the time of the run, SMCI traded at $30.13. For the period from Dec. 17 through Dec 31, the model’s base-case projection came out to:\nAverage predicted price: $30.75\nImplied move: slightly lower over the next month\nSignal snapshot: The technical indicators (MACD and RSI) both skewed negative\n\nThe model is saying that, given current momentum and volatility, the most likely path is a modest grind lower from current levels rather than a dramatic reset. Still, broader AI price prediction says that Super Micro Computer could hit $176 by 2030, which illustrates the massive long-term upside baked into the current valuation if it continues its AI server dominance.\nThe key driver behind the AI model’s bearish short-term view is the recent cooling in the AI infrastructure trade, often triggered by tempered outlooks from key players like Oracle and Broadcom. Super Micro Computer is a critical supplier of specialized, high-performance servers, particularly those optimized for NVIDIA’s latest GPUs.\nWhile demand remains massive, the company has a record order backlog, the market has recently focused on short-term challenges. Namely, a temporary dip in revenue growth and significant gross margin compression were reported in the recent quarter, which has intensified concerns about pricing power amid rising competition.\n\nStory Continues\nThe single biggest factor weighing on the stock is the shrinking gross margin, which recently went down. This signals the high cost of scaling production rapidly and the intensifying competition from larger, established server makers and rising Asian rivals. The model’s negative forecast for the next 14 days is a technical reflection of this fundamental pressure. The market is effectively demanding proof that Super Micro can maintain its design advantage and market share in specialized server and liquid cooling solutions without continually sacrificing profitability. Until management can demonstrate a clearer path to margin recovery, the stock is likely to remain under pressure.\n\nThe negative skew in both the MACD and RSI confirms the short-term downward bias. A declining MACD suggests the selling momentum is strengthening, with the short-term average falling below the long-term one.\nThe RSI, currently near the low 30s, is approaching “oversold” territory, which suggests the stock is suffering from strong selling pressure. This dual negative signal implies that the stock’s recent four-day losing streak could continue into the new year, aligning with the model’s predicted decline.\nDespite the near-term technical weakness, Super Micro's long-term bullish case rests on its deep strategic integration with NVIDIA and its leadership in advanced thermal management, particularly Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC). AI data centers generate immense heat, and SMCI’s liquid cooling solutions are critical for managing the power and thermal demands of next-generation chips like the NVIDIA Blackwell.\n\nBy selling full, rack-scale solutions, its Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) strategy, rather than just individual servers, Super Micro aims to capture more value per customer, a strategy that is expected to drive margin recovery as production scales.\nWall Street, for now, is still leaning into that growth. Across major platforms, analysts maintain a Hold consensus with 12-month price targets clustering in the mid-$40s to mid-$50s. Some of the more aggressive firms see upside into the low-$60s if Super Micro Computer maintains its dominant share in AI rack-scale and liquid-cooled servers. Even the median targets imply a 45% to 55% upside from current levels, a bullish outlook that starkly contrasts with the AI model’s cautious 14-day prediction.\nThe AI forecast can be viewed as a short-term temperature check on how quickly the market might be willing to reopen the multiple after a shakeout, not a verdict on whether Super Micro Computer's run is over.\nImage: Shutterstock\nThis article ChatGPT Super Micro Computer Stock Will Close At This Price In The Next 60 Days originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

The last time the stock lagged the S&P 500 was back in 2019. Even then, the gap was narrow. The index climbed 29% that year, while Broadcom shares rose 24%. Overall, long-term investors have been well rewarded. The stock is already up more than 42% so far in 2025.\n\nOn December 11, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) posted its full-year results for fiscal 2025. Revenue reached $63.9 billion, up 24% from the prior year. The bigger surprise came from earnings. Net income jumped to $23.1 billion, nearly four times the $5.9 billion reported a year earlier.\nArtificial intelligence was the clear growth driver. Broadcom said AI-related semiconductor revenue surged 74% in the most recent quarter. CEO Hock Tan added that demand remains strong into the first quarter, with AI chip revenue expected to roughly double compared with the same period last year.\nMuch of this strength comes from Broadcom’s custom chips designed for hyperscale customers. In late November, reports surfaced that Meta Platforms may look to buy Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Unit chips. Broadcom has worked closely with Alphabet for years on TPU development.\n\nThe company’s AI accelerators are built for highly specific workloads, especially where patterns are well defined.

Why TSMC Is Winning the Most\n\nNauman Khan\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:33 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nGlobal semiconductor foundry revenue rose about 17% year over year to roughly $84.8 billion in the third quarter of 2025, supported by strong demand for artificial intelligence chips built on advanced manufacturing nodes, according to a research note from Counterpoint Research.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( NYSE:TSM ) widened its lead, with market share edging up to about 72%. The gains followed higher output of its 3-nanometer process and solid utilization of 4- and 5-nanometer capacity, used heavily by AI accelerator customers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), and Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ).\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with INTC.\nIs INTC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTSMC's foundry revenue grew more than 40% from a year earlier, outpacing the broader market. Counterpoint said most rival foundries posted slower growth, with non-TSMC players collectively expanding revenue by about 6%, reflecting softer orders after earlier tariff-related demand but some support from China's subsidy programs.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts said capacity limits at advanced nodes and constraints in advanced chip packaging, known as CoWoS, may cap sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Full-year 2025 foundry revenue growth is estimated at around 15%.\nCounterpoint expects the pure-play foundry segment to grow at a faster pace, helped by continued shipments of AI GPUs and custom AI chips. Texas Instruments ( NASDAQ:TXN ), Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ), Infineon (IFNNY), and Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) maintained mid-single-digit market shares.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Year-End Window Dressing? 3 Stocks Funds May Buy Late in 2025\n\nVasundhara Sawalka\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:29 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nWDC\n\nMU\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nThe final trading days of 2025 are delivering textbook year-end window dressing as institutional investors position portfolios for favorable year-end reports. With the S&P 500 up more than 16% year to date at 6,834 and the Dow Jones hovering near record highs above 48,000, fund managers are loading up on winners while shedding underperformers before Dec. 31 statements go to clients, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data.\n\nPortfolio Repositioning Drives Late-Year Activity Window dressing — the practice of buying top-performing stocks to display in quarterly holdings reports — is creating predictable patterns this December. Institutional investors are actively positioning select AI-infrastructure stocks for 2026. The phenomenon particularly benefits stocks, including Micron Technology MU, Western Digital WDC and Palantir Technologies PLTR, which returned 196.4%, 194.2% and 139.7%, respectively, over the past year, all outperforming the S&P 500’s 16.4% growth in the same time frame.\n\nWestern Digital gained Nasdaq-100 inclusion effective Dec. 22, prompting index-tracking funds to add shares, while Morgan Stanley and Cantor Fitzgerald designated it a top 2026 pick given storage supply constraints extending through calendar year-end. Micron Technology, upgraded to Buy by Bank of America following Dec. 17 earnings, has HBM memory sold out through 2026 with multiyear customer agreements. Major holders Vanguard Group and BlackRock increased their Palantir Technologies stakes in the third quarter of 2025 by 4% and 6.4%, respectively, reflecting continued institutional confidence in AI-software positioning.\n\n1-Year Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFed Signals Slower 2026 Pace While AI Momentum Accelerates The Federal Reserve delivered its third consecutive rate cut on Dec. 10, reducing the benchmark rate to 3.50-3.75% in a divided 9-3 vote. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized that officials are \"well positioned to wait and see how the economy performs,\" with projections indicating just one additional cut expected in 2026, per official Federal Reserve statements. The cautious stance reflects concerns about persistent inflation despite a moderating labor market.\n\nDespite monetary caution, AI infrastructure spending continues powering market momentum heading into 2026. Nvidia NVDA reported third-quarter revenues of $57 billion in November, up 62% year over year, with CEO Jensen Huang noting \"Blackwell sales are off the charts\" and cloud GPUs remaining sold out. Similarly, Broadcom AVGO announced in December that AI semiconductor revenues surged 74% year over year, with first-quarter 2026 AI chip sales expected to double to $8.2 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nWall Street Sees Continued Gains Ahead Major financial institutions project significant upside for 2026. JPMorgan set a baseline S&P 500 target of 7,500 with potential to exceed 8,000 if the Fed continues cutting rates, citing 13-15% expected earnings growth. Goldman Sachs projects 12% earnings growth to $305 per share in 2026, while Morgan Stanley forecasts 17% earnings expansion driven by AI productivity gains and accommodative policy.\n\nThe convergence of year-end positioning, resilient corporate earnings, and substantial AI infrastructure investment suggests favorable conditions for equity markets entering 2026, despite elevated valuations and monetary policy uncertainties.\n\nTop 2025 Performers to Bid Up for 2026 Micron Technology offers exceptional growth potential for 2026 investors following fiscal first-quarter 2026 results announced on Dec. 17, 2025. The company delivered record revenues of $13.64 billion (57% year over year) and projected second-quarter revenues of $18.7 billion with 68% gross margins. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company secured agreements for its entire calendar 2026 high-bandwidth memory supply, including industry-leading HBM4 ramping in second-quarter 2026. With the HBM market expanding from $35 billion (2025) to $100 billion (2028) — accelerated two years — and supply constraints persisting beyond 2026, Micron's $20 billion fiscal 2026 capital investment positions it to capture surging AI data center demand while maintaining pricing power across tight DRAM and NAND markets. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MU’s fiscal 2026 earnings has moved north by 35% to $21.9 per share over the past 60 days.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote\nWestern Digital presents a compelling buy opportunity for 2026 following its October 2025 fiscal first-quarter results, where revenues surged 27% year over year to $2.82 billion with non-GAAP gross margins expanding to 43.9%. This Zacks Rank #1 company's Dec. 22, 2025, Nasdaq-100 inclusion triggers passive fund inflows from $600 billion in tracking assets. Management demonstrated confidence by delivering strong second-quarter guidance projecting $2.9 billion in revenues with 44.5% gross margins. As AI accelerates data creation, Western Digital's high-capacity storage solutions address supply-constrained cloud demand extending through 2026, positioning the focused HDD provider for sustained shareholder value. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WDC’s fiscal 2026 earnings has moved north by 14.9% to $7.63 per share over the past 60 days.\n\nWestern Digital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Western Digital Corporation Quote\nPalantir Technologies represents an investment opportunity, backed by strongly accelerating revenues and AI adoption. December 2025 contracts include a $448 million U.S. Navy ShipOS deployment and strategic Accenture partnership to scale enterprise AI globally. Palantir renewed its DGSI contract with France's intelligence agency and unveiled Chain Reaction — the operating system for American AI infrastructure. With third-quarter 2025 U.S. commercial revenues surging 121% year over year and 204 deals exceeding $1 million closed quarterly, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company's Foundry and AIP platforms demonstrate unmatched traction. Government spending tailwinds combined with proven platform scalability position Palantir for sustained growth throughout 2026 as enterprises accelerate AI transformation initiatives.

The analyst said Intel’s lower exposure to the AI demand cycle “could insulate it from broader AI investment overheating concerns,” even as market share pressures persist.\nHe flagged a marked improvement in credit metrics in the third quarter, supported by asset sale proceeds and equity investments, alongside a return to positive free cash flow for the first time since 2023.\n\nBofA raised its fiscal 2025 (FY25) and FY26 EBITDA estimates by 20% and 18%, respectively, and expects leverage to continue improving into 2026.\nMicron was also upgraded, to Marketweight from Underweight, as supply shortages and strong AI-driven demand extend the current memory upcycle.\nCurcuruto said robust pricing across HBM and traditional DRAM is driving a sharp improvement in free cash flow, noting that Micron estimates it can meet only “1/2 to 2/3 of demand from key customers.”\nWhile near-term fundamentals are strong, he warned that capital intensity and cyclicality present medium-term risks. Still, Micron’s recent results, higher forward guidance and debt repayments underpin expectations for significantly higher free cash flow in FY26, even after an increase in planned capital spending.\nBofA also reiterated an Overweight stance on Broadcom, citing continued AI-driven growth, disciplined capital allocation and ongoing deleveraging. In terms of relative value, Broadcom and Intel remain the most compelling names within the group, Curcuruto said.\nRelated articles\nBofA upgrades credit ratings of Intel and Micron\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\n3 Strategies to Make the Most of Dow's Record-Breaking Run\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "International Markets and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): A Deep Dive for Investors\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:15 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nHave you evaluated the performance of Broadcom Inc.'s (AVGO) international operations during the quarter that concluded in October 2025? Considering the extensive worldwide presence of this chipmaker, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial resilience and potential for growth.\n\nIn today's increasingly interconnected global economy, a company's ability to tap into international markets can be a pivotal factor in shaping its overall financial health and growth trajectory. For investors, understanding a company's reliance on overseas markets has become increasingly crucial, as it offers insights into the company's sustainability of earnings, ability to tap into diverse economic cycles and overall growth potential.\nParticipation in global economies acts as a defense against economic difficulties at home and a pathway to more rapidly developing economies. However, it also comes with the complexities of dealing with fluctuating currencies, geopolitical risks and different market dynamics.\nIn our recent assessment of AVGO's quarterly performance, we discovered notable trends in its overseas revenue sections, which are typically modeled and scrutinized by Wall Street analysts.\n\nThe company's total revenue for the quarter amounted to $18.02 billion, showing rise of 28.2%. We will now explore the breakdown of AVGO's overseas revenue to assess the impact of its international operations.\nA Closer Look at AVGO's Revenue Streams Abroad During the quarter, Asia Pacific contributed $10.8 billion in revenue, making up 60% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $9.61 billion, this meant a surprise of +12.46%. Looking back, Asia Pacific contributed $8.96 billion, or 56.2%, in the previous quarter, and $7.93 billion, or 56.4%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nOf the total revenue, $2.33 billion came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 13%. This represented a surprise of -9.14% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $2.57 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $2.27 billion, or 14.2%, and $2.1 billion, or 15%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nAnticipated Revenues in Overseas Markets Wall Street analysts expect Broadcom Inc. to report $19.23 billion in total revenue for the current fiscal quarter, indicating an increase of 28.9% from the year-ago quarter. Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa are expected to contribute 49.3% (translating to $9.48 billion), and 13.2% ($2.54 billion) to the total revenue, respectively.\n\nStory Continues\nFor the full year, a total revenue of $92.51 billion is expected for the company, reflecting an increase of 44.8% from the year before. The revenues from Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa are expected to make up 44.5%, and 11.8% of this total, corresponding to $41.17 billion, and $10.93 billion, respectively.\n\nFinal Thoughts The dependency of Broadcom Inc. on global markets for its revenues presents a mix of potential gains and hazards. Thus, monitoring the trends in its overseas revenues can be a key indicator for predicting the firm's future performance.\nIn a world where international interdependencies and geopolitical conflicts are ever-increasing, Wall Street analysts closely monitor these trends for companies having international presence to adjust their earnings forecasts. Of course, there are several other factors, including a company's standing within its home borders, that influence analysts' earnings forecasts.\n\nEmphasizing a company's shifting earnings prospects is a key aspect of our approach at Zacks, especially since research has proven its substantial influence on a stock's price in the short run. This correlation is positively aligned, meaning that improved earnings projections tend to boost the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool, comes with an externally validated impressive track record. It effectively utilizes shifts in earnings projections to act as a dependable barometer for forecasting short-term stock price trends.\nAt present, Broadcom Inc. holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). This ranking implies that its near-term performance might mirror the overall market movement.

The Zacks Computer and Technology sector, of which Broadcom Inc. is a part, has risen 2% over the same period.

      "Content": "These AI Stocks Could Still Deliver Big Upside in December and Beyond\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Nvidia still can't keep up with demand for its data center GPUs.\nAfter a tepid stock performance in 2025, Amazon is looking to bounce back in 2026.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator chips are growing in popularity with hyperscalers.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nAlthough we're nearly at the end of a year during which the S&P 500 gained a strong 16%, there are still plenty of stocks that look like top-tier buys. Some of the biggest names in the market have retreated from their recent highs, and I think investors should consider scooping them up before 2026 arrives. At the top of my last-minute shopping list are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) .\nNvidia Nvidia has been the poster child for the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout since it began. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the computing power for the vast majority of AI workloads today, but investors are worried about two things.\nFirst, they are concerned that there is a general bubble in the AI space. However, with all of the hyperscalers having announced that 2026 will be another year of record-setting capital expenditures, I don't see that thesis as valid. Second, some are worried that Nvidia's dominance in the AI accelerator chip niche is slipping. While there have been several promising product launches from its competitors, Nvidia's GPUs are still the top option. In its earnings release for its fiscal 2026 third quarter, which ended Oct. 26, CEO Jensen Huang stated that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs.\n\nThis is a company that brought in $57 billion in revenue during Q3, and it's clear that it could have made more if it had more chips to sell, so it's hard to say Nvidia's dominance is slipping with a straight face.\nWith Nvidia's stock price down nearly 20% from its all-time high and Wall Street analysts expecting the chipmaker's revenue to grow by 48% next year, I can think of few better buys heading into 2026.\nAmazon Amazon stock is essentially flat for the year. However, some recent events have me bullish about it as we prepare to enter 2026.\nFirst, its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, delivered 20% revenue growth rate in Q3 -- its best rate in years -- showing that it's resurging as the go-to place to bring workloads online. Second, growth in Amazon's advertising service business is also reaccelerating. This segment has become a major part of the company's business over the past few years.\nI think Amazon's stock will come roaring back in 2026, and it will be on the backs of these two important business units.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Broadcom is up by an incredible 40% or so year to date. However, it was previously even higher: The stock sold off heavily after a poorly received earnings report.\nIn its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ended Nov. 2, revenues grew by 28% as diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose 37%. Its AI semiconductor business was a bright spot, with revenue rising 74% year over year. Management expects this trend to continue into Q1, forecasting that its AI semiconductor revenue will more than double. That all sounds impressive, but the stock sold off in part due to revenue timing.\n\nBroadcom told investors that some of its customers wouldn't be purchasing some of their custom AI chips until 2027 and beyond. That was a letdown for investors, and many headed for the exit. As a result, Broadcom's stock is down by more than 20% from its all-time high.\nFollowing the sell-off, Broadcom's stock now trades for about 32 times expected forward earnings.\nConsidering the monster AI-related growth the company expects over the next few years, I think this is a great price to pay for Broadcom's stock. Its AI semiconductor revenue will continue to rise throughout 2026, which will eventually get the market excited about the stock again. But until it does, the stock looks like a great value.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "The value that neocloud companies offer to major AI players\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: AVGO\n\nCRWV\n\nMU\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMicron Technology ( MU ) stock continues to pop after boasting strong fiscal first quarter earnings results driven by demand around high-bandwidth memory chips for AI data centers. As more companies invest into large-scale AI infrastructure buildouts, what does this all mean for the broadening AI trade and even neocloud operators?\n\nFreedom Capital Markets Managing Director Paul Meeks talks about the three chip companies he still has at the top of his list and the upside that neocloud companies like CoreWeave ( CRWV ) could offer some of the bigger players, such as Nvidia ( NVDA ).\nAlso catch Paul Meeks explain how much higher he sees Micron's stock going.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Julie\nHow does this sort of change the dynamics in the memory market? I mean, as you mentioned, it's an oligopoly, there are two other players. We've seen memory prices go crazy, not even the high bandwidth kind, the overall kind that goes into all kinds of devices. So what are some of the sort of knock-on effects in the industry that you're watching and other names that you're watching?\n00:24 Paul\nSo I continue to like the people that are benefiting from the uh spend. I recently initiated coverage with Coreweave, which is one of the neo clouds with a $100 price target. But believe it or not, I think there's upside in Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi, some of these companies that when I get push back, what people will say, how can you possibly recommend Nvidia after it's done so well for all these years. Well, it's because I see even more greatness ahead of them. And you know, some of these stocks, Julie, have come down quite a bit in the last couple of weeks. I think it's a good buying opportunity for several of the names.\n01:21 Julie\nUm I'm curious about the the neo clouds in particular Paul, because there have been some questions about that business model, right? That if you were, you know, renting space from someone else, if you're trying to go out to the smaller providers, um as your clients, that maybe you're a little more vulnerable if there are chinks in the armor of this whole um AI thesis. What do you think about that?\n02:02 Paul\nanother excellent question. The way I look at it is you have to look at these contracts that they are signing very carefully. In the case of Core Weve, we have five and six-year deals with well-funded folks like Microsoft and Meta. and they are paying 15 to 25% of total contract value upfront. So there's some initial cash flow. And so I think that even though some of these companies are levered and Cory mind you is highly levered, that they have a nice runway and I think that over the next couple of years their plans are set and they're funded by the most well-funded companies almost on planet Earth.\n03:00 Paul\nAnd the other thing that's interesting about Core Weve, it has an interesting deal with Nvidia, which is also a 6% shareholder in which if Core Weve has any surplus capacity between now and April of 2032, it'll be socked up by Nvidia. So, some people will say that's a quote-unquote circular deal, but I actually like that deal a lot. And so I do think there's upside. Yes, it's speculative, yes, they're highly levered, but I think that this is all under control as long as the spending from the big boys continues. And I think all these companies when they announce their results in January or February, will confirm at least the 2026 capital expenditure spend.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

On December 15, Jefferies upgraded the semiconductor equipment maker to “Buy” and raised the price target to $1,500 from $1,100. The firm believes that KLAC's run is “just beginning,” citing expanding AI accelerator use cases and a robust outlook for leading-edge and advanced packaging demand.\nBesides KLAC, Jefferies also identified Nvidia and Broadcom as companies with sustainable demand from the build out of AI infrastructure. With chip complexity increasing, the firm sees upside for KLA as rising process control intensity plays directly on its strengths.\nThe firm further highlighted how packaging complexity is also rising, which requires more process control and benefits KLAC’s business model. China exposure was also highlighted.\nKLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is a semiconductor manufacturing corporation engaged in the design, manufacture, and marketing of process control, process-enabling, and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related electronics industries worldwide.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of KLAC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Sells Broadcom Stock and Buys an Overlooked Stock Up 6,910% Since Its IPO\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MELI\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Broadcom is benefiting from demand for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure due to its strong market position in networking solutions and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).\nMercadoLibre operates the largest commerce and fintech ecosystem in Latin America, and the company is making smart investments in its logistics and credit businesses that should reinforce its dominance.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller was one of the most successful hedge fund managers in history, generating returns of 30% annually over three decades without a single down year. He closed his hedge fund in 2010, and now exclusively manages his own money through Duquesne Family Office.\nIn the third quarter, Druckenmiller sold his entire stake in Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and bought shares of MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) , a stock often overlooked by investors despite returning 6,910% since its 2007 IPO.\nDruckenmiller is an excellent source of inspiration, but the trades mentioned above took place in the third quarter, which ended several months ago. Here is a more current look at Broadcom and MercadoLibre.\nBroadcom: The stock Stanley Druckenmiller sold The investment thesis for Broadcom centers on its strong presence in networking chips and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The company builds the fastest Ethernet switching and routing chips, and it holds over 80% market share. The buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure should drive demand for high-speed networking platforms in the coming years.\n\nAdditionally, Broadcom is the leading supplier of custom AI accelerators, sometimes called ASICs. The company has long designed AI chips for Alphabet 's Google and Meta Platforms , but its clientele has more recently expanded to include TikTok parent company ByteDance, OpenAI, and Anthropic. The company also has other major customers in the pipeline, including Apple and xAI.\nBroadcom reported strong financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended in November), beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 28% to $18 billion, driven by particularly strong demand for AI semiconductors. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income increased 37% to $1.95 per diluted share.\nImportantly, Broadcom's custom AI accelerators compete with Nvidia GPUs as the engines that power training and inference workloads in data centers. ASICs are generally cheaper, which has led to robust demand from certain hyperscale customers. \"We see momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double,\" CEO Hock Tan said in the press release.\n\nStory continues\nHowever, while ASICs themselves are often cheaper than Nvidia GPUs, system-level costs are generally higher because custom AI chips require custom software tools that must be built from scratch. ASICs also use more expensive optical interconnects. Consequently, most analysts expect Nvidia to maintain its dominant market position. That could explain why Druckenmiller sold his position.\n\nRegardless, Wall Street expects Broadcom's adjusted earnings to grow 42% annually over the next two years. That makes the current valuation of 50 times adjusted earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 53 analysts, Broadcom has a median target price of $461 per share, which implies 35% upside from its current share price of $342.\nMercadoLibre: The stock Stanley Druckenmiller bought MercadoLibre operates the largest commerce and fintech ecosystem in Latin America. Its e-commerce marketplace accounted for 28% of online retail sales in the region in 2024, and its market share is projected to reach 30% in 2026. The company has been successful due to its first-mover status, as well as its ecosystem of adjacent services.\n\nTo elaborate, MercadoLibre reinforces the network effect inherent to its business model by providing adjacent solutions for advertising, payments, and logistics. In fact, it is the largest advertiser and the largest fintech payment processor in Latin America. The company also has the \"fastest and most extensive delivery network\" in the region.\nMercadoLibre reported decent financial results in the third quarter, despite missing the consensus estimate on the bottom line. Revenue increased 39% to $7.4 billion, driven by solid sales growth across the commerce (33%) and fintech (49%) segments. That was the 27th consecutive quarter in which revenue growth exceeded 30%, according to management.\nMeanwhile, MercadoLibre's operating margin dropped 70 basis points and GAAP earnings increased just 6% to $421 million. But those disappointing numbers were due to strategic investments that strengthen its market position and lay the foundation for stronger growth in the future. For instance, MercadoLibre lowered its free shipping threshold in Brazil and launched its credit card in Argentina.\n\nIndeed, those investments are already paying off to some degree. Unique buyers in Brazil increased 29% in the third quarter, the fastest pace in over four years. Also, the number of items sold in Brazil increased 42%, meaning the average buyer made more purchases. Finally, 60% of Argentine adults do not have a credit card, giving MercadoLibre a chance to pull a large percentage of the population onto its fintech platform.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects MercadoLibre's earnings to increase at 32% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 49 times earnings look quite reasonable. Investors should feel comfortable buying a position today. Among 27 analysts, MercadoLibre has a median target price of $2,842 per share, implying 42% upside from its current share price of $1,998.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?

Arya added that the price target is based on the assumption that we are potentially in a memory upcycle.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat do other analysts think about MU stock? Following the earnings report, Morgan Stanley analysts raised the MU stock price target from $338 to $350, and reiterated an overweight (buy equivalent) rating.\nAccording to MarketBeat , the analysts' consensus is a buy, with 34 analysts giving a buy rating and three giving a hold rating, and the average price target is $282.61.\n\nGoldman Sachs has reiterated its neutral rating and $235.00 price target, following the earnings report, as reported by Investing.com .\nPossible problems for the memory upcycle Chinese memory maker ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) is reportedly planning an IPO for 2026. If the company goes public, it will receive a significant cash boost, which will enhance its growth as well as its ability to catch up with Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix.\nCXMT is expected to begin mass production of HBM3 chips in 2026, which, according to analysts, means that it is about four years behind its competitors, as reported by Tom’s Hardware .\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\nMicron is expected to launch its HBM4 in 2026, as reported by DigiTimes .

You need a 'strong stomach': Dan Ives' strategy\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: PLTR\n\nCRWV\n\nAMD\n\nIVES\n\nMETA\n\nIn the AI trade, you \"can't just bet on one company,\" Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research, Dan Ives, tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting the importance of diversification for AI investors.\nWatch the video above to hear more about Ives' AI thesis and the 30 stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF ( IVES ).\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThere's another stock I want to ask you about, and that is CoreWeave, which as you know, has sold off pretty sharply. Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock To Buy in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Alphabet is finally getting some recognition from investors for its AI accomplishments.\nThe search-engine giant has ample opportunities to benefit from increased AI spending.\nWhile the stock has gotten a bit expensive, it looks poised to fly higher in the long-run.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has served as an unprecedented bellwether for technology stocks over the last three years. In particular, semiconductor stocks including Nvidia , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , and Broadcom were all ushered into the trillion-dollar club thanks to the AI revolution.\nAs investment in AI infrastructure continues to unfold, I think it's likely that chip stocks will remain sound investment choices. But as 2026 approaches, I see a different tech titan taking center stage: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nLet's dig into how Alphabet has built an AI fortress poised to dominate the future. From there, I'll explore the company's valuation trends and make the case for why now is a great time to buy Alphabet stock hand over fist.\nIt's been a quiet three years for Alphabet...until now The AI revolution kicked off almost exactly three years ago when OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT. ChatGPT quickly captured the imaginations of people all over the world with its ability to answer virtually any question instantly.\nThe dramatic rise in popularity among large language models (LLMs) caused some on Wall Street to pose the idea that traditional search tools like Google were headed for doom. Think of the business stakes at hand here: Why would advertisers continue paying a premium on platforms like Google and YouTube when everyone's attention was flocking to chatbots?\n\nWhile Alphabet's advertising business did show some signs of stalling, the company's cash cow remained somewhat resilient. For a couple of years, revenue from Google and YouTube wasn't as robust as it once was, but it also wasn't plummeting at an alarming rate.\nWhat many investors were overlooking, however, was Alphabet's other ventures. At the beginning of the AI revolution, Google Cloud was operating at an annual revenue run rate of about $29 billion. Meanwhile, this segment of Alphabet's business was unprofitable.\nFast forward to today, and Google Cloud is now on pace for more than $50 billion of annual sales while boasting positive operating income. What's even more interesting is that Google Cloud has won major deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic -- the two LLMs that were once seen as the ultimate existential threat to Google's relevancy.\n\nStory continues\nBesides the success of its cloud division, Alphabet has also successfully launched its own LLM -- called Gemini. According to management, Gemini has over 650 million monthly active users (MAUs) while search queries are increasing threefold quarter over quarter.\nWhy 2026 could be epic for Gemini For most of the AI revolution, I think the consensus view around Alphabet was one of uncertainty. While not everyone bought into the extinction of Google narrative, it's fair to say that it took some time for Alphabet to prove its AI ambitions were bearing fruit.\nOne of the biggest catalysts the company has going into next year is an extension of Google Cloud through commercializing custom hardware. Specifically, Alphabet's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), known as tensor processing units (TPUs), have seen some early traction with Apple and Anthropic.\n\nWhile TPUs aren't going to dethrone Nvidia's GPU business anytime soon, I think Alphabet is on the cusp of unlocking a new wave of growth in the cloud infrastructure market that's currently dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\nAlphabet stock could soar to new highs next year As of this writing, Alphabet's forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio is hovering around 28 -- its highest level during the AI boom.\nNormally, I tend to stay away from momentum stocks. More times than not, by the time a company reaches a record high, it's dicey to buy the premium and expect shares to move materially higher.\nThis is a rare instance where I think the opposite is true. Alphabet's current price increase reflects two factors: An appreciation for the company's current operating performance and a bullish outlook that Alphabet will keep up its strong performance.\n\nAlphabet's ecosystem -- from search, cloud computing, consumer electronics, custom hardware, and more -- is a major differentiator compared to its mega cap peers. The company has a unique flexibility stitched into its DNA -- benefiting from AI across its various assets and subsidiaries during any market cycle. These dynamics position Alphabet as a particularly durable business for the long run.\nAs investments in AI infrastructure are expected to continue rising going into next year, I expect Alphabet to benefit from these tailwinds more so than any one singular chip designer or software developer.\nWith this in mind, I think Alphabet will continue to show signs of accelerating revenue and profit margin expansion across its entire business next year -- which should lead to even more buying from shareholders. Against this backdrop, I see Alphabet as the best opportunity in the AI landscape as 2026 approaches.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

President Trump announced the news in the Oval Office in January, flanked by the respective companies’ leaders, including Oracle chair Larry Ellison — a move that sent the stock soaring .\n\nAI optimism continued to push Oracle shares higher following its quarterly earnings reports in June and September , with AI-driven deals set to push cloud segment revenue to $166 billion in 2030. The stock’s surge in September briefly made Ellison the world’s wealthiest person .\nBut AI euphoria quickly gave way to doubt. Investors became increasingly concerned over the rising use of debt to fund tech firms’ AI spending, just as the payoff of that spending remains hotly debated. Those concerns are evidenced in the budding demand for Big Tech credit default swaps (CDS) — financial contracts that act as insurance by letting investors bet on the likelihood that a company will default on its debt.",

(NASDAQ: AVGO ) is one of the Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for 2026 . The share price of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has fallen more than 19% since the company released its fiscal Q4 2025 results on December 11. The falling investor sentiment comes despite the earnings beat. However, Wall Street remains bullish on the stock with analysts’ 12 month price target reflecting more than 40% upside.\n\n​During the fiscal Q4 2025, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) grew its revenue by 28.18% year-over-year to $18.02 billion, surpassing estimates by $555.89 million. The EPS of $1.95 also topped consensus by $0.08. Management attributed the strong quarterly performance to AI growth from XPUs and networking. Notably, the company forecasts that its AI business will deliver more than 100% year-over-year growth to reach $8.2 billion in Q1 2026.\n​A recent report by Forbes, published on December 18, noted that the falling investor sentiment despite the earnings beat, mainly stems from the disappointing gross margin outlook for Q1 2026. Management expects the margins to compress by around 100 basis points, driven by a shift towards lower-margin AI hardware.\n\n​However, Wall Street maintains its bullish outlook on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). Recently, on December 17, Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $462 price target. Earlier on December 15, Timothy Arcuri from UBS also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and also raised the price target from $472 to $475.\n​Arcuri noted the recent share price pull-back as an overreaction based on his discussion with the company’s management. He added that the drop also indicates overly consensus-long positioning, thereby reflecting widespread bullish consensus. Arcuri highlighted that commentary on AI semiconductor revenue suggests high expectations for the next year, and he raised the price target to $475.\n​Broadcom Inc.

      "Content": "The Secret to Finding the Next Broadcom Is Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Broadcom's custom AI chips are growing in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's.\nNow, Amazon has created its own custom AI chip, Trainium3, to carve out its own niche.\nAmazon needs to sustain its strong AWS growth in 2026 to be a successful stock pick.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nSemiconductor company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has enjoyed an incredible year, rising some 50% so far, even after a large pullback due to poorly received fourth-quarter results. This has investors searching for the next Broadcom, as who wouldn't want those incredible one-year returns?\n\nThe secret to Broadcom's rise is tied to the custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips it's developing. These compete directly against Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are incredibly costly due to their impressive performance and flexibility. Broadcom's custom AI chips can outperform Nvidia's GPUs at a lower price point when the workload is set up properly, giving them a huge advantage at the cost of flexibility.\nDesigning custom AI computing units is going to become more popular, as Nvidia's chips are far too expensive not to explore this avenue. While many companies are choosing to partner with Broadcom, others are opting to do it themselves. One of these companies is hiding in plain sight, and its recent release is incredibly promising.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has dived into designing its own AI chip, and the results have been phenomenal. This innovation could provide Amazon with the growth it needs to be a monster stock pick over the next few years, making it an excellent investment today.\nAmazon's new device provides incredible performance Amazon's new computing chip is known as Trainium3. It is built on cutting-edge 3nm (nanometer) chip architecture and delivers impressive performance at a lower price point. Compared to previous generation Trainum2 servers, they offer 4 times the computing performance while improving energy efficiency by 4 times as well. That helps reduce operating costs and run time, which allowed several generative AI clients to reduce training and inference costs by up to 50%, including Anthropic.\n\nThose are huge boosts for Amazon, and it could attract new clients to its servers. One of those is OpenAI, which is reportedly considering using Amazon's Trainium3 chips in exchange for a $10 billion investment. This could be the first of many companies flocking to Amazon's training servers, as cost is starting to become a large bottleneck in the artificial intelligence investing realm.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors want to see real innovation in exchange for their dollars, and companies may need to stretch their funding to achieve better results. Switching from GPUs to alternative computing units like Amazon's is one way to do that, and it could grow in popularity in 2026.\nDepending on how popular this product is, Amazon could become the next Broadcom. We'll see success tied to Amazon's cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), if it has any boost in 2026. Fortunately for Amazon and its investors, it's already looking up.\n\nAWS is critical to Amazon's success Despite AWS accounting for only 18% of Amazon's total revenue, it represents 66% of its operating profits. That's because AWS' margins are far better than the base e-commerce business, so as AWS goes, so will Amazon.\nIn Q3, AWS posted its best growth rate in multiple years, rising at a 20% pace. This indicates that more workloads are coming online at AWS, which is an excellent sign for 2026. If Amazon can continue this momentum in 2026, combined with the rise of Trainium3 workloads, Amazon's stock could dramatically rise in 2026.\n\nWhile I doubt it can duplicate Broadcom's 50% rise this year, I think Amazon is prepped to be a market-beating stock, especially after its underperformance this year. Amazon is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing AI workload, and with the rest of its business also producing strong results (advertising in particular), I think Amazon has what it takes to be a top stock pick in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Is There Now An Opportunity In Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nToday we're going to take a look at the well-established Broadcom Inc. ( NASDAQ:AVGO ). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$413 and falling to the lows of US$325. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Broadcom's current trading price of US$340 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Broadcom’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\nIs Broadcom Still Cheap? The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 17.97% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Broadcom today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $288.52, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Broadcom’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Broadcom\nWhat kind of growth will Broadcom generate? Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Broadcom. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\nWhat This Means For You Are you a shareholder? AVGO’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\n\nStory Continues\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AVGO, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Broadcom you should know about.\nIf you are no longer interested in Broadcom, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Be Worth More Than $2 Trillion by 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMETA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Tesla is operating in a difficult environment.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are providing computing units for the AI build-out.\nMeta Platforms' stock was slammed due to spending plans.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nThere are currently five stocks that have a valuation of $2 trillion or more. Outside of these five, only a handful of others are in a position to be worth $2 trillion or more in 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\n\nThe next largest company is Berkshire Hathaway , which has a market cap of about $1 trillion. For that stock to double would be a huge feat, especially without Warren Buffett at the helm, so let's put it aside.\nNow we're left with Meta, Tesla, Broadcom, and TSMC. Which of these will make it to $2 trillion by the end of 2026?\nAll will beat the market if they reach $2 trillion by 2026 The largest is Meta Platforms, sitting at a $1.66 trillion valuation. The smallest is Taiwan Semiconductor at $1.49 billion. That places all four of these stocks in relatively close proximity to each other, which means the required return is fairly similar. Meta would need to rise 21% while Taiwan Semiconductor must rise 34%. Both of these potential performance figures would indicate a market-beating stock, so if any of these companies can breach the $2 trillion threshold, they will likely be great to own.\nThe $2 trillion threshold is also uncharted territory for this group. Both Meta and Broadcom have come close, but neither has crossed into the $2 trillion zone.\nI think three will make it, while one will be left out If you sort the companies by growth rates, it's clear that there's one outlier: Tesla.\nIt's no secret that Tesla is struggling in the current environment, due to electric vehicle (EV) credits ending from the U.S. government. Meanwhile, the other three are posting incredible growth rates that don't look to be slowing down anytime soon in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips in the artificial intelligence supply chain. Without its production capabilities, none of the AI computing power we know now would be possible. Demand for AI chips isn't slowing down, and Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to continue growing at a rapid 21% pace in 2026, according to Wall Street analysts. However, these analysts have consistently underestimated Taiwan Semiconductor's growth over the past few years, so don't be surprised if TSMC outperforms these expectations. Couple that with the second-cheapest valuation in this group, and Taiwan Semiconductor should reach the $2 trillion mark in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms nearly entered the $2 trillion club, but pulled back following a poorly received third-quarter earnings report. While the business's performance was incredible, investors didn't like Meta's massive spending plans. There is growing concern that Meta is overextending itself, which is why investors have started selling off the stock. However, I think Meta is just the first company to max out its cash flows being devoted to AI computing capacity, and it won't be the last. The market will come back around to Meta's stock in 2026 and will send it back to levels allowing it to reach the $2 trillion point.\n\nLast is Broadcom, which also sold off due to 2026 guidance. Wall Street wanted greater visibility into faster AI growth, and Broadcom told investors they needed to be patient. Still, Broadcom informed investors that its Q4 AI revenue was $6.5 billion, up 74% year over year, and that it projects Q1's growth to be north of 100%. Broadcom is a much larger business than just AI, and the business isn't nearly as successful in those endeavors. Still, I think sustained growth from its custom AI computing units will drive Broadcom's stock higher in 2026, allowing it to reach the $2 trillion threshold.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMU\n\nAVGO\n\nAMD\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock has underperformed its peers in the semiconductor space this year.\nThe company's valuation is becoming cheaper despite its historic operating performance.\nNvidia has a number of catalysts going into 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWhen it comes to leading semiconductor stocks, investors don't need to look much further than companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Broadcom , Advanced Micro Devices , Micron Technology , and of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nWhile Nvidia has been the headline act for much of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, shares have lagged its chip peers throughout 2025.\nAs 2026 draws closer, growth investors may be wondering if Nvidia remains a good buy , or if now is the time to rotate capital away from the world's most valuable company and seek new opportunities.\nWhat should Nvidia investors be on the lookout for in 2026? For the last three years, Wall Street's primary focus surrounding Nvidia is the performance of its data center business. This segment accounts for the bulk of Nvidia's revenue and profits, as it captures demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPU).\nThroughout the AI revolution, investors have paid close attention to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's commentary around the company's Hopper and Blackwell GPU architectures. While Blackwell remains an important catalyst for Nvidia, investors should start to pay closer attention to guidance around the upcoming Rubin chips. So far, investors have already gotten a small preview of demand for Rubin.\n\nFor instance, Huang recently noted that Nvidia has a total order backlog of around $500 billion for Blackwell, Rubin, and accompanying networking products. Of note, a portion of this revenue has already been booked, with an estimated $300 billion expected to be recognized during 2026.\nIn addition, Anthropic recently signed a $30 billion compute capacity agreement with Microsoft . As part of the deal, Anthropic will be leveraging clusters of Blackwell and Rubin chips.\nAt a macro level, Goldman Sachs estimates that hyperscalers including Microsoft, Alphabet , Amazon , and Meta Platforms will spend roughly $500 billion on AI capital expenditures (capex) next year. Taking this one step further, McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion opportunity over the next five years.\nAgainst this backdrop, investors should monitor how these secular tailwinds fueling accelerated investment in infrastructure continue to impact Nvidia, being aware that rising infrastructure will impact Nvidia well beyond its core data center operation.\n\nStory Continues\nThroughout next year and beyond, Nvidia's opportunities in adjacent markets, including next-generation CPUs and accelerated computing operating systems, should begin to come into focus as well, thanks to some savvy partnerships with Intel and Palantir Technologies .\nNvidia's valuation trends are getting interesting In the table, I've summarized Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, as of the end of each quarter over the last year.\nMetric\nCurrent\n3Q25\n2Q25\n1Q25\n4Q24\nPrice-to-sales (P/S)\n23.3\n30.2\n29.6\n20.7\n26.4\nForward price-to-earnings (P/E)\n23.4\n31.5\n57.4\n24.8\n28.1\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\nThere are two anomalies that stick out from the data.\nFirst, Nvidia's valuation multiples experienced notable compression during the company's first fiscal quarter of 2025 (ended April 30). This was driven by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, as well as fear that a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek could pose a threat to U.S. dominance in the AI landscape.\n\nThe second theme that's beginning to become more noticeable is that Nvidia's P/S and forward P/E ratios are hovering around the same levels as their prior lows earlier this year. Once again, I think this contraction revolves around fear more than anything else. Specifically, investors are concerned about rising competition from AMD and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from Broadcom.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy heading into the new year? While rising competition in the chip space is a very real thing, I don't see Nvidia necessarily losing its grip anytime soon. AI infrastructure is expected to be a multitrillion-dollar market that lasts several years. Buying into the idea that the hyperscalers will migrate away from Nvidia's GPUs overnight is unrealistic.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is becoming cheaper by the day despite the company operating at historic levels and signing new deals and partnerships -- effectively broadening its total addressable market (TAM) beyond data center services and simultaneously bringing new levels of business visibility as the AI infrastructure era kicks off.\nI think now is a great time to buy the dip and capitalize on the chip king's ongoing sell-off. Investors with a long-term time horizon could use the recent depressed price action to add to a core buy-and-hold position. Given these dynamics, I see Nvidia as a no-brainer heading into the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Their chips are deployed in massive numbers by cloud computing companies, hyperscalers, and AI companies for AI model training and inference.\nNot surprisingly, both Broadcom and Nvidia have been witnessing remarkable growth lately. Nvidia reported an impressive 62% jump in revenue last month for the third quarter of its fiscal 2026 (ended on Oct. 26, 2025) to $57 billion. Even Broadcom just reported a solid 28% year-over-year increase in revenue for its latest quarter, driven by a terrific year-over-year jump of 74% in AI revenue.\nThese solid results explain why their shares are up nicely in 2025. While Broadcom stock has jumped 47% this year, Nvidia is sitting on respectable gains of 32%. The good part is that both companies still have a lot of room for growth, but their expensive valuations could limit their upside in 2026.\nHowever, there's one AI infrastructure play that's significantly cheaper than both Nvidia and Broadcom, despite soaring a stunning 147% this year: Ciena (NYSE: CIEN) . Let's see why this company could continue to outperform Nvidia and Broadcom in 2026.\nCiena's growth is set to accelerate in 2026 While Broadcom and Nvidia make AI processors that help train large language models (LLMs) and run AI inference applications, Ciena's optical networking components and software ensure that their chips can perform optimally. After all, Ciena's products, which include routers and switches, ensure high-speed data transmission over fiber networks.\n\nIts offerings are used in data centers, telecom networks, and cloud computing to move massive amounts of data quickly over long distances. This explains why Ciena has been witnessing healthy growth lately. The company released its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results (for the three months ended Nov. 1) on Dec. 11.\nCiena reported a 20% increase in revenue from the year-ago period to $1.35 billion. Its non-GAAP earnings jumped by a much stronger pace of 68% from the year-ago quarter, driven by an improvement in the top line as well as a stronger mix of software sales. More importantly, Ciena is expecting its revenue growth to accelerate in the current quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nIt anticipates a 30% year-over-year increase in revenue at the midpoint to $1.39 billion. Ciena management remarked on the latest earnings conference call that it is now experiencing stronger demand for its networking products from Meta Platforms , which is going to contribute toward the bigger jump in its top line.\n\nMeta is going to deploy Ciena's solutions in \"multiple new data centers.\" Ciena management also added that it is \"engaged in advanced technical discussions with additional hyperscalers\" to supply its data communications products in their data centers. So there is a possibility of Ciena's revenue growing at a faster pace than the 24% increase that it is currently expecting for fiscal 2026 to $5.9 billion.\nThe company's top line jumped by 19% last year, and the guidance for the first quarter suggests that it could easily overhaul its full-year forecast. Importantly, Ciena can sustain the acceleration in its growth in the long run as well. That's because AI data centers reportedly require five times more optical connections as compared to traditional data centers.\nThe size of the AI data center market is poised to grow at an annual rate of 27% through 2032. This explains why analysts have become more bullish about Ciena's prospects.\nThey are forecasting its top-line growth to filter down to the bottom line as well, and expect the company to witness stronger earnings growth thanks to a potential improvement in its margin profile.\nThe strong growth in the company's top and bottom lines could send the stock soaring in 2026 and beyond. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising to see it outperforming both Nvidia and Broadcom in the new year as well.\nThis networking stock could keep crushing the AI infrastructure stalwarts We have already seen that Ciena's fiscal first-quarter revenue is on track to increase by 30% from the year-ago period. Though the company's fiscal 2026 revenue growth guidance of 24% is lower than what it expects to achieve in the current quarter, there is a chance that it could exceed expectations for the full year.\n\nCiena received $7.8 billion worth of orders in the previous fiscal year, which exceeded its annual revenue of $4.8 billion by a big margin. It ended fiscal 2025 with a revenue backlog of $5 billion, pointing out that this figure \"supports a large share of our fiscal 2026 revenue expectations.\" Ciena's impressive backlog and its negotiations with other hyperscalers suggest that the company is on track to exceed the $5.9 billion revenue estimate for fiscal 2026.\nAssuming it can consistently maintain a 30% growth rate throughout the year, its top line could hit $6.25 billion (based on the fiscal 2025 revenue of $4.8 billion). Ciena is currently trading at just 6.4 times sales, which is significantly lower than the two other AI stocks discussed in this article.\nThe U.S. technology sector trades at an average price-to-sales ratio of 8.7. If the market rewards Ciena with a premium valuation owing to its accelerating growth, and it trades at even 10 times sales after a year, its market cap could jump to $62.5 billion (based on the $6.25 billion revenue it could generate this year). That will be more than double its current market value, suggesting that it can deliver stronger gains than Broadcom and Nvidia in the coming year, as per their 12-month median price targets.\n\nSo, investors can consider buying Ciena stock hand over fist going into 2026, as it could sustain its red-hot rally in the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ciena right now?

      "Content": "Did Nvidia Just Lose Its Spot as Wall Street’s AI Chip Darling? JPMorgan Says This ‘Overall Top Pick’ Is Better.\n\nJustin Estes\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAMD\n\nIf someone asked you to name a large AI chip manufacturer, you’d probably say Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), or maybe Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Your first thought probably wouldn’t be Broadcom (AVGO).\nBut Broadcom is actually a giant in the AI hyperscaler space with a $1.6 trillion market cap. Up 54% over the past year, the company has found defining success by pursuing only seven to 10 main customers who need billion-dollar buildouts rather than chasing many small $10 million contracts.\n\nMore News from Barchart 5 \"Best of the Best\" Dividend Stocks to Own in 2026\nThis 1 Lesser-Known Stock Is Set to Dominate with Nvidia and Broadcom in 2026\nNike, Tilray, and Palantir: Their Unusually Active Put Options Will Boost Your Wallet After Christmas\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nThat strategy is paying off in a major way. Broadcom reported an AI order backlog of $73 billion to be delivered over the next six quarters, with management expecting that figure to continue growing as new orders roll in.\nJPMorgan recently raised its price target on the stock and maintained its “Overweight” rating, calling the recent dip a buying opportunity. So what exactly does Broadcom do, and why are Wall Street’s biggest investors loading up on shares?\nWhat Does Broadcom Do? Broadcom has achieved its success through category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company operates two primary business segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.\nOn the semiconductor side, Broadcom is the leader in custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) designed specifically for data center AI workloads.\n\nASICs are specialized chips built to exact specifications for hyperscalers such as Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which need massive computing power.\nThe infrastructure software segment, which includes the VMware acquisition, provides enterprise software for planning, developing, automating, managing, and securing applications across different platforms.\nWith roots in the technical heritage of AT&T/Bell Labs, Lucent, and Hewlett-Packard/Agilent, Broadcom combines more than 60 years of innovation with global scale and engineering depth. The company serves the world’s most successful tech companies by focusing on technologies that connect our world.\nCEO Hock Tan explained the strategy at the Goldman Sachs technology conference: Broadcom is laser-focused on about seven customers building large language models and racing toward what he calls “super intelligence.” These companies are collectively spending around $30 billion annually on AI compute infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nRather than pursuing thousands of enterprise customers who might spend $10 million each on merchant GPUs, Broadcom sees its biggest opportunity in providing custom chips and networking infrastructure for these hyperscalers building AI at unprecedented scale.\nWhy Did JPMorgan Upgrade Broadcom Stock? JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur pointed to the continued surge in capital expenditure by hyperscalers and the consequent rise in demand for ASIC chips as key drivers for Broadcom’s growth.\nBroadcom reported Q4 2025 revenue of $18.02 billion, up 28% year over year. The semiconductor segment jumped 35% to $11.07 billion, while the high-margin infrastructure software segment grew 19% to $6.94 billion.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, Broadcom’s revenue hit $63.9 billion, a 24% increase driven overwhelmingly by AI, which saw revenue grow 65% year-over-year to $20 billion.\nBut here’s where it gets really interesting: Broadcom forecasts its AI business will hit $8.2 billion in Q1 2026 alone, marking roughly 100% year-over-year growth. And Tan revealed that his compensation package tied to 2030 targets includes achieving AI revenue over $120 billion — a sixfold increase from the $20 billion generated in fiscal 2025.\nOne customer prospect turned into over $10 billion in orders expected in the second half of fiscal 2026—a major driver behind this is that Broadcom designs and manufactures Google’s custom TPU chips, a specialized ASIC built specifically for AI tasks rather than general-purpose computing (GPU). Google’s latest TPUv7 chip is performing better than expected and attracting major customers like Anthropic and Meta, with Anthropic alone committing to potentially 1 million units.\n\nWall Street Doubled Down Many investors have been trying to make the most of the AI trade, but when AVGO dipped over 27% in Q1 2025 — hitting a yearly low of $138 in April — that was a green light for some of Wall Street’s most famous money managers.\nThese investors spotted what Michael Burry later articulated in his new Substack: while 40%-50% of hyperscaler spending goes to Nvidia GPUs with “ever shorter product cycles,” Broadcom is positioned differently.\n\nBurry specifically named Broadcom alongside Google, Amazon, and Microsoft as “very well-funded” and capable of challenging Nvidia’s dominance.\nMajor Q1 2025 buyers included:\nJeremy Grantham (GMO): Bought over 1.5 million shares despite calling AI a bubble. His fund holds a $291 million position in Broadcom versus just $21 million in Nvidia — nearly 14x more exposure to AVGO than NVDA.\nRenaissance Technologies: Purchased over 2.4 million shares, massively increasing its stake. Regarded as the most successful hedge fund of all time, Renaissance’s bet signals strong conviction in Broadcom’s differentiated positioning.\nTwo Sigma Advisors: Bought around 2.5 million shares, bringing its total position to 3.9 million shares — the largest holding since Q3 2024 when Broadcom traded at just $159 versus Q1’s average of $211.\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio): Added 280,000 shares, betting that Broadcom’s custom ASIC strategy offers structural advantages over commodity GPU manufacturers.\n\nThe stock has since recovered to around $330. While Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting hit other AI stocks, Broadcom’s $73 billion backlog of multi-year contracts with just 7-10 customers provides revenue certainty that short-cycle GPU sales can’t match.\nIs Broadcom a Buy? Broadcom stock has pulled back from December highs near $415 to around $330. If you’ve been on the sidelines, here are three bullish indicators worth considering:\n1. The structural moat is different. While Nvidia sells commodity GPUs facing shorter product cycles and growing competition, Broadcom has locked in $73 billion in backlog with just 7-10 hyperscaler customers through multi-year custom chip contracts. These aren’t off-the-shelf components that competitors can easily replicate.\n\n2. Wall Street’s smartest money doubled down. Renaissance Technologies, Jeremy Grantham, Two Sigma, and Ray Dalio all bought aggressively when the stock dipped in Q1. Grantham holds 14 times more Broadcom than Nvidia despite calling AI a bubble, betting that custom ASICs offer better risk-adjusted returns than merchant chip sales.\n3. Broadcom (mostly) dodged the Burry selloff. Michael Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting triggered the recent tech selloff, but he specifically named Broadcom as well-positioned to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. The company’s custom chip focus sidesteps the depreciation and replacement cycle concerns hitting pure-play GPU manufacturers.\nThe stock trades at 61x earnings, but with 100% AI revenue growth and signed contracts providing multi-year visibility, Broadcom offers a differentiated AI infrastructure play built on structural advantages rather than pure momentum and hype.\nOn the date of publication, Justin Estes did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Where Will Broadcom Stock Be in 1 Year?\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 4:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nKey Points Broadcom stock has pulled back sharply after its latest quarterly results.\nInvestors are concerned about the lack of clarity regarding its new fiscal year.\nHowever, don't be surprised to see Broadcom overcoming the recent negativity.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has turned out to be a solid investment in the past year, as shares of the semiconductor specialist have jumped 52% during this period, owing to its growing influence in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nHowever, investors weren't satisfied with Broadcom's latest quarterly report. The stock fell more than 11% after releasing its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results (for the quarter ended Nov. 2) on Dec. 11.\nLet's see why that was the case, and check if the hit this semiconductor stock has taken going into 2026 will have an impact on its performance in the coming year.\nAI revenue continues to grow at an incredible pace Broadcom reported fiscal Q4 revenue of a record $18 billion, up by 28% from the year-ago period. Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings shot up by 37% year over year to $1.95 per share. Wall Street would have settled for $1.87 per share in earnings on revenue of $17.5 billion, and the company easily cruised past those expectations.\n\nEven the guidance was solid. Broadcom expects $19.1 billion in revenue in the current quarter, higher than the $18.5 billion consensus estimate. The guidance points toward a healthy year-over-year increase of 28% in revenue. However, investors seem to be concerned about a couple of factors.\nFirst, management pointed out that the increase in Broadcom's AI revenue is compressing its margins. As a result, the company expects its fiscal Q1 gross margin to fall by 100 basis points on a sequential basis. Management added that Broadcom's gross margins are likely to be impacted by the higher AI product mix.\nSecond, Broadcom's AI order backlog of $73 billion (which it expects to fulfill over the next six quarters) and management's reluctance to provide full-year guidance seem to have dented investor confidence. After all, Broadcom reported a much bigger backlog of $110 billion at the end of fiscal Q3. Moreover, investors would have wanted more clarity about the potential growth that it could deliver for the entirety of the new fiscal year.\n\nThat's not surprising, as Broadcom is trading at an expensive 26 times sales and 71 times trailing earnings. So, the potential drop in Broadcom's margins and the lack of a significant acceleration in growth in fiscal Q1, as compared to its performance last quarter, haven't gone down well with investors.\n\nStory Continues\nDoes this mean it would be a good idea to start booking profits in Broadcom stock? Or will the company be able to overcome the post-earnings pullback and jump higher in 2026?\nCan investors expect more upside in the next year? Broadcom's 12-month median price target of $475 points toward 39% upside from current levels. What's more, 92% of the 50 analysts covering the stock suggest buying it. But investors may be wondering if it makes sense to buy Broadcom stock, considering the expensive multiples it is trading at.\n\nBroadcom indeed seems worth buying if we take its AI prospects into account. The company reported a 74% year-over-year increase in its AI semiconductor revenue last quarter. It is now expecting faster growth this quarter, forecasting that its AI revenue will double in fiscal Q1 to $8.2 billion. For comparison, Broadcom's AI revenue increased by 65% in the previous fiscal year to $20 billion.\nAnother important point worth noting is that Broadcom's consolidated backlog stood at a much more handsome $162 billion last quarter, which is more than double its AI backlog.\nBroadcom isn't a pure-play AI chip company. It also sells infrastructure software solutions: high-speed networking components such as switches, routers, and smartphone chips. AI accounted for just under a third of its overall revenue of $63 billion last year. However, the AI business is set to move the needle in a bigger way for Broadcom this year.\n\nWe have seen that Broadcom is expecting to fulfill its $73 billion AI semiconductor backlog in six quarters, translating into a quarterly revenue run rate of $12 billion. So there is a possibility of Broadcom's AI revenue landing at $48 billion over the next four quarters, almost 2.5x the revenue it generated from this segment last year.\nThe company's non-AI business (including infrastructure software) grew by 11% last year to $43.9 billion. Assuming it can sustain such growth in the non-AI business this year as well, its revenue from this segment could increase to almost $49 billion. So, Broadcom's revenue in the current fiscal year could jump to $97 billion (assuming it sells $48 billion worth of AI chips, as estimated).\nThat points toward a potential jump of 51% in revenue this year, much higher than the 23% growth it clocked last year. Broadcom is currently trading at an expensive 26 times sales, but its accelerating growth justifies that valuation. So, it won't be surprising to see the stock indeed hitting the median price target of $475 in the next year, which is why it may be a good idea to buy this AI stock following its latest pullback.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "These 2 AI Giants Could Soar in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor will thrive regardless of which computing unit is being used the most.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerators may steal some of the new workload coming online.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nNvidia has been a dominant force in the AI computing market since the AI buildout began in 2023. However, viable alternatives are starting to pop up that could challenge Nvidia's dominance. If Nvidia's empire starts to crack, two stocks could soar in its place.\nI think both are excellent buys for 2026 and are primed to soar, even if Nvidia can maintain its superiority.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) , but it doesn't manufacture them. Instead, it farms out that work to a handful of other companies. In the chip manufacturing world, that work primarily goes to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) . Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest chip foundry by revenue , and it has achieved this position through continuous technological innovation and strong production yields.\n\nMany of Nvidia's competitors also source their chips from Taiwan Semiconductor, so if Nvidia's dominance slips, Taiwan Semiconductor will be OK. Additionally, if Nvidia maintains its incredible grip on the artificial intelligence computing market, TSMC will continue to do great. For Taiwan Semiconductor to succeed as an investment, AI hyperscalers need to continue spending at their current rate. If they do, Taiwan Semiconductor will be well-positioned to soar in 2026, as it trades at a discount to the fabless chip companies.\nThe three primary computing unit providers in the AI arms race are Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Nvidia is the largest of all of them, and happens to be the cheapest. But none of these three is cheaper than Taiwan Semiconductor.\nTaiwan Semiconductor trades for 29 times forward earnings. That's a hefty discount to its peers, despite benefiting from the same tailwinds pushing these other stocks higher. I think this low starting valuation will play in its favor during 2026 and will be a key reason why it outperforms Nvidia in 2026.\n\nBroadcom Broadcom is taking a different approach to the AI computing problem than its peers. Instead of creating a broad-purpose GPU like AMD or Nvidia, it's partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to build custom AI accelerators. These computing units aren't designed to handle a wide variety of workloads like a GPU is. Instead, it's designed specifically around the workload that it will see. By doing this, Broadcom can maximize performance while decreasing costs, albeit at the expense of flexibility.\n\nStory Continues\nThese computing units are surging in popularity, and Broadcom's financials reflect that. In Q4 (ending Nov. 2), its AI semiconductor revenue rose 74% year over year. For reference, Nvidia's data center division, which encompasses the GPUs primarily used for AI computing, increased revenue at a 66% pace. Broadcom is growing as a popular option to partner with, and I'd expect that trend to accelerate during 2026.\n\nHowever, Broadcom doesn't just make custom AI accelerator units. It has a whole host of other business units that develop mainframe software and hardware, virtual desktops, cybersecurity solutions, and numerous other products. These divisions slow down Broadcom's overall growth rate, as evidenced by Broadcom's net revenue only rising 28% in Q4.\nThis could be what holds Broadcom's stock back from outperforming in 2026, but if the investment community is excited about Broadcom's AI prospects, it could soar past Nvidia. For Q1, Broadcom expects AI revenue to come in at $8.2 billion -- indicating a double over last year's total. This shows that Broadcom's AI growth rate is accelerating while others are moderating. Investors love to see accelerating growth, and if there is still appetite for AI investment, Broadcom's stock could soar past Nvidia's, especially if Nvidia starts to lose market share to more of Broadcom's custom AI accelerators.\n\nI think both of these companies will do great in 2026, but I also wouldn't count Nvidia out, either.

      "Content": "This ETF Trounced the S&P 500 in 2025. Here's Why It Could Do It Again Next Year\n\nJeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 11:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nSMH\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nSPY\n\nKey Points The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has been a top performer over the last decade, and is up about 40% this year.\nPaced by Nvidia, Taiwan Semi, and Broadcom, its holdings are delivering strong revenue growth.\nThe ETF trades at a premium to the S&P 500, but that seems deserved.\n10 stocks we like better than VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF ›\n\nInvesting in an S&P 500 ETF like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF or the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: SPY) can be one of the best financial decisions you make in your lifetime.\nAfter all, the S&P 500 has historically returned an annual average of 9% a year, and the broad-market index even beats most hedge funds most years. With its holdings diversified among the top 500 U.S. stocks, and a quarterly rebalancing to make sure that the collection stays up to date, the S&P 500 has a proven formula to deliver long-term gains.\nHowever, an S&P 500 index fund isn't necessarily the best-performing ETF in a given year, and several ETFs have outperformed in 2025. In fact, one has delivered more than double the S&P 500's gains this year. That's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) , which is up 39.5% year-to-date through Dec. 17. The chart below shows how the semiconductor ETF's performance this year compares to the S&P 500.\nIn the third year of the AI boom, semiconductor stocks, led by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , have continued to surge, so perhaps it's not a surprise that the SMH has beaten the S&P 500 by such a wide margin. Let's take a closer look at the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and why it's a good candidate to outperform the S&P 500 again this year.\nWhat's in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF The ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, which is designed to track the overall performance of the semiconductor production and equipment sector.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF's top three holdings include Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , three stocks that have been among the biggest winners in the AI boom and continue to set the pace for the sector.\nAll three stocks are growing briskly heading into 2026. The chart below shows how fast revenue growth has been for all three companies over the last year.\nAs you can see, all three of these stocks, which make up more than a third of the ETF, are delivering strong growth, and two of the three of them reported accelerating revenue growth in their most recent quarters. Those results seem to push back on the narrative of an AI bubble , and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said as much in the company's most recent earnings report, saying he sees AI at a tipping point, implying that demand and usage were about to accelerate.\n\nStory Continues\nWhy the VanEck Semiconductor ETF could beat the S&P 500 next year The strength of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF will depend on the AI boom, but the same could be said for the S&P 500.\nThe SMH does trade at a premium to the S&P 500, but it's not by as much as you might think. The semiconductor ETF currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 38.6, which compares to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF at 28.5.\n\nEven with that premium, the risk/reward in the VanEck ETF looks attractive considering the growth rates of its top three holdings and other major holdings like Micron and Advanced Micro Devices .\nThe buildout of AI data centers is continuing, and demand for semiconductors, which are becoming an essential component in everything from medical equipment to automobiles, will keep growing.\nThe ETF is vulnerable to an AI bubble, and valuations could eventually catch up to the semiconductor sector, but as Jensen Huang believes, the facts on the ground seem to point in the opposite direction. That's a good reason to bet on its outperformance next year as well.\nShould you invest $1,000 in VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF right now?

This included Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , whose profile has risen thanks to its cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The company was swept up in the bullish trend, which was bolstered by an analyst's price target raise on its stock.\n\nA 2% move made a difference The raiser was Truist Securities's William Stein, who made an upward adjustment to his Broadcom target to $510 per share; previously, his price tag was $500. In making the change, he maintained his buy recommendation on the company.\nStein acknowledged the concern many investors have expressed about the significant resource and capital needs of AI, according to reports. Yet he feels certain AI-associated stocks remain inexpensive relative to their powerful growth potential, and Broadcom is one of those bargains.\nThe pundit wrote that, despite the challenges of building out the technology, AI investment will continue to mount in the proximate future. As a renowned AI chipmaker, Broadcom is sure to benefit from this.\n\nUnstoppable AI This sounds like a very plausible argument to me. From what I've observed, once a hot technology captures the public's imagination, there's little that can stop it from growing and spreading.\nEven if AI companies don't experience the monster growth many people once anticipated, they should still do very well if their products and/or services are appealing. Broadcom indisputably ticks that box, so I'd say its stock looks like a buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

The news sent Oracle's shares plummeting and created a ripple effect across the AI landscape, dragging down chipmakers like Nvidia and Micron Technology. The negative sentiment was so pervasive that even Broadcom, which posted better-than-expected results, saw its stock decline. The market reaction signals investor anxiety about when the massive capital expenditures on AI infrastructure will translate into tangible profits, leading to a broader rotation out of big tech names.\n\nStory Continues\nAmkor is up 55.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $40.51 per share, it is still trading 13.9% below its 52-week high of $47.04 from December 2025.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 4.3% on the news that investors rotated out of AI-linked high-flyers following underwhelming earnings updates from Oracle and Broadcom as the core thesis shifted from \"growth at any cost\" to \"prove the returns.\"\n\nOracle triggered the alarm by missing revenue estimates while simultaneously hiking capital expenditures by $15 billion. This reignited fears that AI infrastructure spending is outpacing actual monetization. Broadcom compounded the anxiety; despite beating earnings, its stock fell as CFO Kirsten Spears cautioned that gross margins may come under pressure as product mix shifts further toward system-level AI sales. This sparked a macro rotation away from AI infrastructure and power plays. High-valuation names like AMD, Vertiv, and Bloom Energy fell as markets looked to sectors that can benefit from the recent Fed rate cut and a resilient economy.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD is up 77.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $214.30 per share, it is still trading 18.9% below its 52-week high of $264.33 from October 2025.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 4.8% on the news that cooler-than-expected inflation data reignited hopes for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\nThe November Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose 2.7% year-over-year, coming in below economists' expectations of a 3.1% increase. Similarly, \"core\" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.6%, beating the consensus forecast of 3.0%. This encouraging report meant that inflationary pressures were easing more quickly than anticipated. As a result, investors grew more optimistic that the Federal Reserve would have the flexibility to cut interest rates in the near future. Lower interest rates generally reduce borrowing costs for companies and can make stocks, particularly growth-oriented tech shares, more attractive to investors.\n\nStory Continues\nPalantir Technologies is up 158% since the beginning of the year, and at $193.64 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $207.18 from November 2025.

Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. No one was very focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 for a while was bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. But not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Intel vs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points TSMC is the undisputed leader in manufacturing advanced chips.\nIntel's stock outperformed in 2025 after the company was backed by some big investors.\nTSMC has a clearer growth path between the two companies.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nWhen it comes to chip manufacturing, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the undisputed foundry leader, while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is trying to make inroads. However, in 2025, it was Intel's stock that outperformed, up nearly 80% as of this writing, compared to a 40% gain for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\nLet's look at which stock is set up to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC for short, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. Due to its technological expertise and scale, the company manufactures the vast majority of advanced chips, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) . It counts Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom among its top customers.\n\nIn chip manufacturing, the goal is to consistently push down node sizes, which refers to the transistor density of the chips. The more transistors that can be fit on a chip, the more powerful and energy efficient they become. However, producing advanced chips at scale is difficult, and TSMC's main competitors, including Intel and Samsung , have struggled with yields (the number of defects per wafer). Meanwhile, nearly three-quarters of its production is at 7nm nodes and below, and it is set to move to 2nm technology next year.\nGiven its position in the industry, TSMC is the go-to partner for chip designers. It works closely with companies like Nvidia to grow capacity to meet their projected demand. And, as the only foundry that can really make these advanced chips at scale with high yields, it has also garnered strong pricing power. The company is set to raise prices once again next year, while the cost of its new 2nm processing technology is forecasted to be 50% higher than its 2nm technology.\n\nTSMC is well-positioned to continue to benefit from the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout and sees AI chip demand growing by more than a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years.\nThe case for Intel Intel stock's outperformance in 2025 wasn't really a result of its operational performance. The company has struggled to grow its revenue, and it felt a lot of gross margin pressure in the first half of the year. However, it did see a huge rebound in adjusted gross margins in Q3, with it climbing from 18% a year ago to 40%. Revenue, meanwhile, edged up 3%.\n\nStory continues\nThe biggest reasons for Intel's gains in 2025 were from the high-profile investments others made into the company's stock. Nvidia made a $5 billion equity investment in the company, while SoftBank invested $2 billion. Meanwhile, the U.S. government made an $8.9 billion investment. These investments, along with the 51% sale of its Altera business for $5.2 billion, helped Intel end Q3 with nearly $31 billion in cash on its balance sheet.\n\nThe company will use that cash to keep building out its foundry business and advance its chip manufacturing technology. Meanwhile, it is collaborating with Nvidia on new products, including integrating its central processing units (CPUs) with Nvidia's NVLink system to allow its CPUs to communicate more quickly with Nvidia's GPUs. This would help give Intel a nice advantage in the data center CPU market, where it has been losing share to Advanced Micro Devices . Separately, Intel is also working on its own AI chips designed for inference, and it is supposedly close to a deal with SambaNova Systems to further its efforts in this area.\nThe verdict Intel's 2025 performance was largely from events that won't repeat in 2026. For the company to outperform next year, it's probably going to need to win a large foundry customer or show major progress in data center chips, either with its CPUs or GPU efforts. That makes the stock more of a wildcard.\n\nTSMC, meanwhile, is the much safer choice. The company is set to benefit from the continued AI data center buildout, and its path forward is much clearer. As such, it's my pick to outperform in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

Shares of fabless chip and software maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) jumped 1.7% in the morning session after the company received positive commentary from Wall Street analysts, who viewed the stock's recent sharp decline as a buying opportunity.\nSpecifically, Truist Securities raised its price target on the stock to $510 from $500, while keeping a 'Buy' rating. This followed a nearly 20% drop in the share price after the company's recent earnings report, where some investors were reportedly concerned about the lack of a full-year artificial intelligence revenue outlook. Echoing the positive sentiment, a UBS analyst noted the sell-off was likely an overreaction and also increased their price target to $475. The stock also benefited from a broader rally among chipmakers.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $332.72, up 0.8% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Broadcom? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Broadcom’s shares are very volatile and have had 24 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago when the stock dropped 5.4% after it continued a multi-day slide as management warned that its fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) business would negatively impact gross profit margins. The drop extended a steep decline that began after the company's recent earnings update. During the update, management indicated that increasing sales of custom AI processors, which have lower margins, would reduce the company's overall gross margins in the upcoming quarter. This guidance alarmed investors, who feared that the profitable AI surge might not be as lucrative as Broadcom's traditional software business. The continued selling pressure capped a multi-day slide that was reportedly the stock's worst in several years.\n\nBroadcom is up 43.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $332.72 per share, it is still trading 19.4% below its 52-week high of $412.97 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Broadcom’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $7,758.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened.

      "Content": "Broadcom vs. AMD: Which AI Chip Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 7:45 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points AMD is looking to carve a niche in the inference market.\nBroadcom has a massive opportunity with custom AI chips.\nThe stocks trade at similar valuations.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nTwo of the top semiconductor companies looking to eat into Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure dominance are Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) . Both stocks have performed well in 2025, led by AMD, which is up more than 70% year to date, as of this writing, compared to about a 45% gain for Broadcom.\nThe question, though, is which stock will perform better in 2026. Let's look at the case for both stocks.\nThe case for AMD AMD is the distant No. 2 player in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market behind Nvidia. However, the company has carved out a nice niche in inference, where price-per-inference costs are more important than raw computing power, given its ongoing nature, and where Nvidia's CUDA software moat isn't quite as wide. Importantly, inference is also eventually expected to become a much larger market than training over time.\n\nMicrosoft has already been working on a toolkit to convert CUDA software code to AMD's ROCm in order to use more of AMD's GPUs for inference. Meanwhile, the company struck a partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of GPUs, beginning with 1 gigawatt next year. As part of the deal, OpenAI is also taking a stake in AMD through warrants that vest based on deployment milestones. It also has a deal with Saudi Arabian company Humain.\nGPUs are not AMD's only business, however. The company is also the leading provider of central processing units (CPUs), both in computers and in the data center. While GPUs provide the muscle, CPUs act as the brain. The market isn't as large as the one for GPUs, but it is growing quickly, and AMD has been taking share in the data center space.\n\nThe case for Broadcom Broadcom is attacking the AI chip market much differently than Nvidia and AMD. Instead of making GPUs, the company helps customers design custom AI ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). These are preprogrammed chips that are hardwired for specific tasks, and as such, they can both perform better and be more energy efficient.\n\nBroadcom helped Alphabet develop its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which have led to other big hyperscalers (owners of massive data centers) becoming customers. It has said its three furthest along customers could be a more than $60 billion opportunity in its fiscal year 2027 (ending October 2027), and a fourth customer, Anthropic, has placed a $21 billion order for Alphabet's TPUs that it will fulfill.\n\nStory Continues\nIn addition, Broadcom is working with OpenAI, and it will deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to be completed before the end of 2029. There have also been reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on developing its own custom AI chips and that they could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nBroadcom also has a strong networking portfolio, which consists of components, such as Ethernet switches and routers, that help transfer data and distribute AI workloads across servers. This business has also been booming, given the ongoing data center build-out.\nThe verdict Both AMD and Broadcom trade at similar valuations. AMD has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 32 times next year's analyst estimates, while Broadcom trades at around 33.5 times its fiscal-year 2026 estimates (ending October 2026). As such, which stock outperforms will likely come down to their growth next year, as well as future expectations.\n\nI think both stocks can once again have strong performances in 2026, but I think Broadcom will be the stock that will outperform. The company just has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it over the next few years with custom chips. The custom chip business requires high upfront costs, so these are multiyear commitments, usually for large projects. Many of these deals are already in place (as seen in its $73 billion backlog), and now it just has to deliver.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

Global bond yields are climbing today, led by a surge in the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to a 26-year high of 2.025% after the BOJ raised interest rates and said it will keep raising rates if its economic and price outlook is realized.\n\nUpbeat comments today from New York Fed President John Williams were supportive for stocks but negative for bonds, as he said some data we're seeing is \"pretty encouraging\" and he sees no sign of sharp deterioration in the jobs data. He added that he sees US GDP growth of 1.5% to 1.75% this year, with growth picking up next year, and that there's \"no urgency to need to act further on monetary policy right now, because I think the cuts we've made have positioned us really well.\"\nStock market moves may be exaggerated and more volatile than usual today due to the expiration of options, futures, and derivatives during the quarterly event known as triple witching. According to Citigroup, a record $7.1 trillion of notional open interest will roll off the US options market today.\n\nThis week's market focus will be on US economic news.

Today's strength in stocks has reduced safe-haven demand for government debt securities and is weighing on T-notes. Also, hawkish comments from New York Fed President John Williams are undercutting T-note prices after he said some of the data we're seeing is \"pretty encouraging\" and that he sees no sign of sharp deterioration in the jobs data. In addition, T-notes have a negative carryover from today’s jump in the 10-year Japan government bond yield to a 26-year high of 2.025%.\n\nThe steepening yield curve is also bearish for T-note prices. Steepening trades occur when bond investors buy short-term government debt and sell long-term debt. The yield curve has steepened since last Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, when the Fed said it would begin purchasing up to $40 billion of short-term T-bills a month to boost liquidity in the financial system.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nBofA frames 2026 as the midpoint of an “8–10 year journey,” where traditional IT infrastructure upgrades are driving accelerated computing and AI workloads. This sets a multi-year growth runway for equipment suppliers like Lam Research.\nThe bank projects the semiconductor industry to grow roughly 30% toward its first $1 trillion in global sales in 2026, with wafer fab equipment (WFE) sales expanding at nearly double-digit year-over-year (YOY) rates as fabs invest in capacity and advanced process technologies. Further, another robust year is anticipated, with over 50% growth in AI semiconductor sales, supported by high data center utilization, tight supply, enterprise AI adoption, and intense competition among LLM builders, hyperscale cloud providers, and sovereign clients.\n\nLet's discover why Lam Research is being highlighted as one of BofA’s top semiconductor stocks for 2026, alongside NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), positioned to capture demand across key AI and semiconductor segments.\nAbout Lam Research Stock Fremont, California-based Lam Research designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes, and services advanced semiconductor processing equipment critical to integrated circuit fabrication.\nWith a market cap of nearly $194.7 billion, Lam Research’s scale is clearly reflected in its stock performance. Its shares have jumped 119% over the past 52 weeks, with a recent three-month surge of 30.38%, highlighting robust momentum fueled by sustained AI-driven semiconductor expansion and continued chip demand growth.\nValuation metrics show LRCX stock is currently trading at 34.08 times forward adjusted earnings and 9.15 times sales, marking a premium to industry averages. It reflects investor confidence in Lam’s prospects.\n\nStory Continues\nMoreover, Lam Research rewards shareholders through steady dividends, maintaining an 11-year streak. It pays an annual $1.04 dividend, yielding 0.64%, with the most recent $0.26 installment scheduled for Jan. 7, 2026, to shareholders of record as of Dec. 3.\nLam Research Surpasses Q1 Earnings On Oct. 22, Lam Research surprised Wall Street with Q1 fiscal 2026 results. Revenue jumped 27.7% YOY to $5.32 billion, beating the $5.24 billion forecast, while adjusted EPS came in at $1.26, topping expectations of $1.22. Strong demand for AI-driven semiconductor equipment and high-bandwidth memory investments spurred growth, sending the stock up nearly 4.5% in the following session.\n\nLam promoted both expansion and efficiency. The gross margin for the September quarter was at the upper end of management guidance at 50.6%, up from 50.3% in June. The operating margin reached 35%, which also came in more than anticipated.\nAdditionally, the firm improved its financial flexibility by retaining $6.7 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of September, up from $6.4 billion in June. Looking ahead, management anticipates that demand for AI data centers will create market opportunities worth billions of dollars, giving Lam an opportunity to increase its market share.\nIn the face of strong market trends, they anticipate sales of $5.2 billion ± $300 million, a gross margin of 48.4% ± 1%, and an EPS of $1.15 ± $0.10 for December 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts see Q2 fiscal year 2026 EPS rising 27.5% YOY to $1.16. They forecast full-year fiscal 2026 earnings growing 15.7% to $4.79 and anticipate fiscal 2027 EPS climbing 16.3% to $5.57.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Lam Research Stock? Wall Street analysts maintain strong confidence in Lam Research’s stock. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon reaffirmed a “Buy” rating with a $175 price target, signaling belief in Lam’s ability to capitalize on AI-driven semiconductor demand.\nLRCX stock carries an overall “Moderate Buy” consensus rating, reflecting broad conviction in its growth and execution. Out of 31 analysts covering the stock, 20 rate it “Strong Buy,” two assign “Moderate Buy,” and nine recommend “Hold.”\nThe stock’s average price target of $167.08 represents marginal potential upside. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $210 from Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis implies potential gain of 27.5% from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Aanchal Sugandh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Why This AI Stock Could Outperform Nvidia Over the Next 5 Years\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Nvidia is sold out of cloud GPUs.\nAMD and Broadcom could take market share from it in the data center segment.\nAll three chipmakers outsource much of their manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has led the artificial intelligence (AI) investing sector since 2023. While 2025 hasn't been quite as good a year for its shareholders as the previous two were, the stock is still up around 30% year to date. The chipmaker is still a dominant force in the AI realm, but observers are raising the possibility that its competitors could start taking meaningful market share away from it.\nShould Nvidia start to lose its edge over the competition, it may no longer be the best AI stock to own. But over the next five years, which stock could overtake it?\nDifferent approaches to the AI computing problem Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , which are computing units that can process many thousands of calculations in parallel. This makes them perfectly suited for tasks that require a lot of computing power and that can be broken down into many smaller tasks that can be handled independently. Most artificial intelligence workloads fall into that category. Nvidia's GPUs have been the most popular parallel processors available since before the AI infrastructure buildout started in 2023, but that may change.\n\nOne issue Nvidia is having right now is that demand is outpacing its supply. In its earnings release for its fiscal 2026 third quarter (which ended Oct. 26), CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. While some may view this as a good problem to have, I think it's a bit of an issue. Its clients' needs for AI accelerator chips aren't going to decrease just because Nvidia can't fully supply them. Instead, they are going to look for alternative solutions.\nThat could open up the door for competing chipmakers to steal some significant market share, particularly if buyers find that the alternative products provide similar performance with lower costs. Two chipmakers that appear poised to benefit are AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) .\n\nAMD is a direct competitor to Nvidia, as it also makes GPUs. It recently forecast that it would grow its data center revenue at a 60% compound annual rate over the next five years. For reference, its data center division's revenue growth was a mere 22% during Q3. For AMD to grow as fast as predicted, it will need to eat into Nvidia's market share, which it already might be doing.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom is taking a different approach to the AI computing problem. Rather than designing another general-purpose GPU, it's partnering directly with hyperscalers to design custom AI computing units -- called application-specific integrated circuits -- that meet their precise needs. Among the best examples of these chips are Alphabet 's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nTPUs and other custom AI computing units aren't designed to handle a wide variety of workloads like GPUs are. However, when these computing units only see the one type of workload that they are configured for, they can deliver higher performance at lower costs. The trade-off of lower price and higher performance for less flexibility is a no-brainer for many data center operators, and Broadcom's approach could eat into Nvidia's market share as AI workloads become more streamlined.\nThese companies have the potential to steal some of Nvidia's market share over the next five years, but all the chip designers all have one thing in common.\nTaiwan Semiconductor will rise regardless of which chip designers are winning None of these companies fabricates its computing units in-house. Instead, the \"fabless\" chipmakers outsource that work to a handful of other companies that specialize in fabrication. In the chip production realm, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) captures nearly all of the highest-end work. It's not only the largest chip manufacturer by revenue in the world, but also a leader in its ability to deliver the most advanced chips. Broadcom, AMD, and Nvidia often work with Taiwan Semiconductor for their cutting-edge chips, and that's unlikely to change in the future, as that industry is nearly impossible to disrupt.\n\nWith Nvidia projecting between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in data center infrastructure spending by 2030, all three of these fabless chip companies could have a significant market opportunity to capture. I'm not sure which will be the ultimate winner among them. Still, I know that TSMC will be a winner regardless, giving it a strong chance of outperforming Nvidia over the next five years, particularly if Nvidia loses a meaningful amount of market share to its peers.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

If history is any guide, stocks will keep pushing higher: Since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, rising 1.3% on average, data compiled by Citadel Securities show.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nWhile longer-term worries about the artificial-intelligence trade linger and valuations remain stretched, optimism over a strong economy and corporate profits is keeping investor sentiment upbeat. Traders are snapping up bullish options on chipmakers and large-cap technology shares, according to Susquehanna International Group, while the retail crowd remains avid buyers of US stocks.\n“Barring any major shocks, it will be hard to fight the overwhelmingly positive seasonal period we are entering and the cleaner positioning set-up,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk team including Gail Hafif wrote in a note to clients. “While we don’t necessarily see a dramatic rally, we do think there is room to go up from here into year end.”\n\nUS stocks bounced back Thursday after a cooler-than-expected — albeit controversial — inflation report bolstered prospects for more interest-rate cuts next year. Technology shares led the advance, with the Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index rising 2% and the Nasdaq 100 Index adding 1.5% after wobbling in the past five days.\nThat’s good news for derivatives traders who spent the last few days buying options wagering on a further rally in technology shares. They scooped up call spreads tied to Nvidia Corp., Micron Technology Inc. and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), while selling puts on megacap names including Alphabet Inc., Nvidia and Broadcom Inc., according to data compiled by Susquehanna.\n“This is a classic expression of confidence that declines will be shallow and temporary,” said Chris Murphy, Susquehanna’s co-head of derivatives strategy. “Investors were using the tech drawdown to increase exposure to AI, semiconductors and long-duration tech, not flee from them.”\n\nStory Continues\nThe broader backdrop for US equities remains constructive as well. Investors have put about $100 billion into US stocks in the past nine weeks, extending a steady trend of inflows seen throughout 2025, according to Goldman Sachs. A gauge of investor sentiment tracked by the firm is sitting at the most bullish level since April.\n\nRetail investors, the stock market’s biggest cheerleaders this year, are showing few signs of losing interest. Individual traders have been net buyers of call options on US stocks for 32 of the past 33 weeks, the longest stretch in Citadel Securities’ data.\n“Following a year of strong portfolio returns and record household wealth, retail participants enter 2026 with both conviction and balance-sheet capacity to increase market participation,” Scott Rubner, head of equity and equity-derivatives strategy at Citadel Securities, wrote in a note to clients Thursday.\nInstitutional investors have become more upbeat on the stock market as well, scooping up calls across the stock market and piling into sectors outside Big Tech in the past few weeks, Rubner added. Economically sensitive real estate and industrials stocks showed the strongest buy signal for a second consecutive week, he said.\n\nSubsiding volatility ahead of a seasonally quiet part of the year is adding another tailwind. The S&P 500’s 10-day realized volatility has dropped to one of its lowest levels of the year, a dynamic that could prompt volatility-targeting and trend-following funds to increase equity exposure.\n“We still think there is room for volatility to compress further,” Goldman’s trading desk wrote. “Lower levels of implied volatility mean more fuel for systematic re-leveraging.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Six Charts That Show How Stock Markets Got Reshaped in 2025\n\nMichael Msika and Jan-Patrick Barnert\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nGOOG\n\n^VIX\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Stock investors can’t claim that this year has lacked market drama.\nIt didn’t always look likely, but equities have managed strong returns in 2025, weathering shocks like DeepSeek of China’s challenge to US artificial intelligence and the tariff storm unleashed by the Trump administration in April.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nDips were bought at record pace and a fear of missing out on the rally dominated sentiment. In the background, a powerful wave of diversification swept through the market as investors responded to the cracks appearing in so-called US exceptionalism by buying up European, Asian and emerging-market stocks.\nHere are six charts that capture some of the key episodes that reshaped equity markets in 2025:\n\nThe year started with investors maxed-out on American exposure and convinced US dominance was here to stay. But DeepSeek shook the status quo in the AI world, while President Donald Trump’s April tariff salvo all but spelled the end of the bull market that began in 2022. Still, as Trump dialed back his trade war, interest rates fell and the global economy showed resilience, investor confidence returned.\nThat didn’t spare US stocks from bearing the brunt of the selloff. And they never fully caught up with the rest of the world, held back by a weakening dollar. The greenback hasn’t clawed back its 13% slump in the first half, while a growing chorus of strategists has recommended international equities over their US peers.\nMSCI Inc.’s gauge of global stocks excluding the US is tracking its strongest outperformance over the S&P 500 since 2009.\nThe US flagship index is missing from the ranks of best-performing benchmarks, but it did still achieve decent enough gains of 14%. The nagging worry for investors has been the concentrated nature of those returns. “Bubble in the making” became a key concern this year, with some data echoing the early stages of excessive internet over-valuations. The tech sector’s weighting in the S&P 500 reached a record 36%, breaching the previous peak of 2000 leading into the dotcom crash, before retreating below 35%.\n\nA closer examination of this year’s trading reveals unprecedented levels of concentration behind the gains on Wall Street. Tech megacaps powered the rally all year long, with just five stocks accounting for nearly 45% of the benchmark’s returns: Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile excitement around AI has driven returns in the US and Asia, the story has been very different in Europe, a market crucially lacking tech stocks. Here, other thematics stepped to the fore. Banks led Europe’s rally, surging on the way to their strongest year since 1997, while governments’ defense, energy and infrastructure spending commitments lifted the names set to benefit from these outlays.\nThe upshot of all this is the widest dislocation in market leadership between the US and Europe ever seen. Value stocks inspired the advance in Europe, while growth equities led it in the US. This pushed investors into unchartered territory, as equity factors typically move in similar fashion.\nInvestors buffeted by April’s extreme turbulence could hardly have anticipated the relatively smooth ride they had the remaining three-quarters of the year. No drawdown exceeded 5% until November, with each dip enthusiastically snapped up at a rapid clip. The AI narrative, solid earnings and the leftovers from April’s sudden positioning washout encouraged investors to chase stocks steadily higher. The impressive rally stalled only as exuberance over AI was questioned in the final stretch of the year.\nStrong appetite for stocks has been accompanied by the destruction of volatility this year. Considering historical reset patterns for the VIX Index, it’s surprising how often the gauge managed to retrace a spike of 40% or more within a 10-day trading period. This didn’t happen at all before 2011, but has already occurred several times in topsy-turvy 2025.\nStock investors embraced the notion that volatility spikes have become increasingly short-lived. A new market logic appears to have taken hold: stocks panic, volatility gets bid, the risk event is resolved, gamma supply takes over and volatility quickly retreats.\nUS option volumes marked fresh highs, with two daily prints exceeding 100 million turnover this year for the first time. To emphasise the increased demand, trading volume was above 60 million daily contracts on 117 days compared to only 12 days in 2024.\nWhile hedging demand played a role in April and November, most of the time it was calls dominating the tape. With investors chasing the right tail as well as volatility sellers using ultra short-term contracts to earn income, the options market remains a key factor for stocks, contributing to the swift resets in volatility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Still, the stock sold off as the market weighed uncertainty around longer-term AI demand visibility.\nAfter meeting with Broadcom's full management team, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said recent trading likely reflects an overreaction. He raised his estimates for fiscal 2026, projecting AI semiconductor revenue above $60 billion, nearly triple year-over-year growth.\nArcuri also lifted his fiscal 2027 forecasts, including revenue of $135 billion and earnings per share of $14.15. He pointed to a $73 billion AI backlog covering roughly 18 months, noting that shipments may arrive sooner than initially outlined.\nThe analyst highlighted strong backlog growth tied mainly to large customers such as Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta Platforms (META), with additional upside possible as AI inference demand expands.\nUBS kept a Buy rating on Broadcom and increased its price target to $475.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Asian shares advance after weaker US price data push Wall Street higher, and a rate hike in Japan\n\nELAINE KURTENBACH\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:15 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CL=F\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nMU\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nAsian shares were moderately higher and U.S. futures were mixed after the Bank of Japan raised its key policy rate Friday to its highest level in 30 years.\nThe 0.25 percentage point increase by the BOJ was widely expected. It took the benchmark rate to 0.75%, which is still low compared with other major economies.\n\nThere was scant immediate reaction in the markets to a decision that could reverberate through currency and cryptocurrency markets. Regional shares advanced after stocks on Wall Street rose Thursday following an encouraging report on inflation that could help the Federal Reserve keep cutting interest rates next year.\nThe future for the S&P 500 was barely changed, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2%.\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 gained 1.2% to 49,568.66. Financial industry companies that may see profits climb due to higher interest rates led the advance.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4% to 25,610.50, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.5% to 3,895.75.\nIn Seoul, the Kospi climbed 0.5% to 8,628.70.\nTaiwan's index gained 0.9%, while the Sensex in India dipped 0.2%.\n\nOn Thursday, European indexes gained after the Bank of England cut its key interest rate and the European Central Bank kept its rate steady .\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.8% to 6,774.76, and broke a four-day losing streak . The Dow added 0.1% to 47,951.85, and strength for tech stocks sent the Nasdaq composite up a market-leading 1.4%, to 23,006.36.\nSome relief came from a report showing that inflation was lower last month than economists expected. That could soothe nerves at the Fed, which is responsible for keeping inflation low and for keeping the job market strong.\nInflation is still higher than anyone would like, at 2.7% last month, but if it creeps closer to the Fed’s target of 2%, Fed officials could feel more free to cut interest rates to help a slowing job market . Wall Street loves lower rates because they can boost the economy and prices for investments, even if they may also worsen inflation.\n\nThursday’s inflation update may not move the needle much at the Fed given how noisy economic reports have been following the U.S. government’s shutdown. Next month’s update on inflation could provide a better gauge of what’s actually happening.\nAlso helping to drive gains was Micron Technology, a maker of memory and storage for computers, which rallied 10.2% after reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\nBillions of dollars are flowing into artificial-intelligence technology, which helped superstar stocks like Nvidia lead the market for years.\n\nStory Continues\nBut questions are rising about whether those stock prices shot too high and whether customers will get a good-enough return on their AI investments through bigger profits and productivity. Worries are also weighing on companies that are borrowing lots of money amid the AI frenzy.\nOracle added 0.9% and Broadcom rose 1.1%. They have been at the center of such concerns recently. Nvidia, the chip company that’s become Wall Street’s most influential because of its immense size, gained 1.8%.\n\nAnother winner was Trump Media & Technology Group, which jumped 41.9% to trim some of its steep loss for the year so far, 69.3% coming into the day. The company, which began with President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform and then moved into cryptocurrencies and various other lines of business, is now moving into nuclear power.\nIt’s merging with TAE Technologies in an all-stock deal, and each company will own roughly half of the combined business.\nIn other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 16 cents to $55.84 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 21 cents to $59.61 per barrel.\nThe dollar rose to 156.08 Japanese yen from 155.53 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1719 from $1.1723.\nThe price of bitcoin rose to about $86,900.\n___\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Stan Choe contributed.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Over the past five days, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has declined by approximately 2.4%.\nMixed earnings from companies such as Oracle and Broadcom have added to the AI bubble concern, raising questions about whether massive AI-related spending will translate into returns.\n\nThe uncertainty has weighed on shares across the AI supply chain , including companies indirectly tied to the theme.\nGE Vernova ( GEV ), a maker of energy turbines and grid equipment, has also come under pressure. The company has increasingly been viewed as an AI play because of the enormous amount of electricity required to power data centers.\nGE Vernova stock is down roughly 15% over the past five days, despite some analysts setting positive tones on the stock.\n“AI is still in the build phase,” Fidelity analyst says Training AI models and running AI applications consume vast amounts of power, creating growing opportunities for companies involved in power generation and grid infrastructure, according to Clayton Pfannenstiel , co-manager of the Fidelity Select Industrials Portfolio at Fidelity.\nNatural gas turbines are one of the most immediate solutions to easing the power bottleneck.\n\nRelated: Analysts revamp Oracle stock price target after slump\n“If we need power now, the main source is gas turbines,” said Pfannenstiel.\nGE Vernova is Pfannenstiel’s fourth-largest holding, accounting for about 5.4% of the portfolio. He said the company is already seeing stronger natural gas turbine orders, prompting management to raise its earnings outlook.\n“AI is still in the build phase,” said Pfannenstiel. “There are a lot of ‘picks and shovels’ companies that could potentially benefit.”\nAI power demand reshapes GE Vernova’s growth outlook GE Vernova recently lifted its guidance at its Dec. 9 investor update event . The company now expects revenue to reach $52 billion in 2028, up from $45 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding from about 9% this year to 20% by 2028.\nManagement also raised its backlog outlook to $200 billion from $135 billion, driven in part by rapid growth in its electrification business. GE Vernova expects free cash flow to rise to $22 billion from $14 billion between 2025 and 2028.\n\nThe company has doubled its dividend to $0.5 per share and increased its share repurchase authorization to $10 billion from $6 billion.\n“Electric power will be critical to unlocking economic growth in the decades ahead and we are well-positioned with our large installed base and platform of advanced solutions to serve this growing, long-cycle market,\" said GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik.\n\nStory Continues\nBank of America bullish on GEV stock Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin has a $804 price target and a buy rating on GE Vernova stocks, citing strong demand for power and grid equipment, according to a Dec. 16 research note sent to TheStreet.\nObin said GE Vernova remains “laser focused on execution” as regulatory (for example, the Environmental Protection Agency is reconsidering air regulations on power plants), data center, and electrification trends all stand in the company’s favor.\n\nRelated: Cathie Wood sells $40 million of megacap tech stock\nThe analyst added that his target multiple for GE Vernova represents a premium to the roughly 14 times peer average on 2026 estimates, reflecting GE Vernova’s stronger financials.\n\"We argue a premium multiple is warranted given above-peer earnings growth and margin trajectory,\" said Obin.\nWhat's boosting the need for power generation and grid equipment is not just data centers, but also building electrification and electric vehicles, Obin said in an earlier Dec. 10 research note.\n\"We see data center growth, building electrification, and electric vehicle adoption driving faster electrical load growth. This should drive increased demand for power generation and grid equipment as well as gas power services,\" he said.\nGE Vernova stock is up roughly 95% year-to-date as of Dec. 18.\nRelated: Longtime fund manager offers 2-word stock market prediction for 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 19, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Company May Now Be Winning the AI War\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:52 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points After ChatGPT took some of its search traffic, Alphabet rebounded by introducing AI Overviews and AI Mode.\nAlphabet's Gemini 3 is considered a leading LLM.\nManagement will increase the tech giant's capital expenditures in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIt's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world in significant ways, and the major hyperscalers are all investing hundreds of billions of dollars in their efforts to capitalize on the trend. Companies like Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all developing robust AI businesses that are driving the charge, and companies like Nvidia and Broadcom are providing key parts of the hardware infrastructure that supports the technology.\n\nIf 2025 was a year of expansion, 2026 could be a year when those companies' investments start showing results, and when that happens, Alphabet could be a big winner.\nMore AI for more people The current types of large language models (LLMs) were first introduced to the public through OpenAI's ChatGPT three years ago, but Alphabet has actually used similar tech to power its Google search engine for years. However, the ChatGPT launch changed the AI landscape and led to a new LLM race, and Alphabet now offers its own generative AI services.\n\nAlthough it looked for a time like Google was in danger of losing its dominance in search as more people just asked questions to ChatGPT and had it do the legwork, Alphabet has responded effectively by rolling out its own competitive LLMs, and it flipped the script by offering AI Overview and AI Mode on its search pages. Recently, paid clicks have been accelerating, and Alphabet's revenue is soaring. Sales increased 16% year over year in the third quarter, with strong performances across the business.\nToday, its operation includes a broad spectrum of products and services, including YouTube, Android, Waymo autonomous vehicles, and others. Google Search remains its core business, but there's a lot more going on. Its varied revenue streams will provide it with diverse growth drivers in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHowever, of particular importance recently is the Google Cloud Platform. Alphabet's cloud services are where its clients engage with generative AI to create their own apps and agents, and cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3. The accelerating pace of growth in this area implies that the opportunity to create with AI is attracting more clients to the cloud, and Alphabet's newest LLM, Gemini 3, has been rated the top LLM to use right now according to several leaderboards. Gemini has 650 million active users, and the company is capitalizing on its strong user base to monetize these services.\n\nStory Continues\nNot just LLMs Beyond its robust LLMs, which may be winning the LLM wars at least for now, and its search feature, which still holds a market share of about 90%, Alphabet has other AI products that are driving growth. It designs its own AI accelerator chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it uses to train and power its LLMs, along with the Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that most of its rivals are using today.\n\n\"Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products, is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said.\nAlphabet has made several important deals recently for its TPUs, which are specialized chips designed for deep learning and inference workloads, in contrast with Nvidia's more general-purpose GPUs. TPUs give Alphabet an edge in AI development, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated and need more of this kind of processing power to deliver the results users want. Alphabet signed a key partnership with Anthropic, which makes the popular Claude LLM, and is rumored to be in talks with Meta to supply it with chips.\nMore in store for 2026 On the Q3 earnings call, management told investors that it expects to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from its previous forecast figure of $85 billion. It also plans a \"significant increase\" in capex in 2026.\nThe results of all this spending are already showing up in accelerated cloud growth, accelerating paid clicks, and higher overall sales, and those trends could get even better next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Broadcom Stock Just Raised Its Dividend by 10%. Should You Buy AVGO Stock Now?\n\nJabran Kundi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:30 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nOn Dec. 11, Broadcom (AVGO) declared a $0.65 dividend for the quarter, a 10.2% increase from the previous quarter’s $0.59. The chipmaker continues to reward long-term investors as a rare dividend payer in the semiconductor industry. The fact that the company can not only keep up with but also increase the dividend payout speaks volumes about its strong cash flows.\n\nThe world is seeing increasing investment in IT infrastructure upgrades since the emergence of generative AI in 2022. As an AI chipmaker, AVGO is expected to continue reaping the benefits of this AI boom, which, according to analysts, is likely only at the halfway stage in terms of infrastructure spending.\nMore News from Barchart Why Short–Term Bond ETFs Might Be the Best Income Investment for 2026\nThis Bank Stock May Be Small, But It Has Big Potential\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nBank of America’s analysts believe volatility is set to dominate chip stocks, mainly because the question of ROI on AI investments is going to become increasingly important. However, for companies like Broadcom, the chip demand should stay strong. In 2026, semiconductor sales are likely to hit the $1 trillion mark for the first time. AVGO will take a good chunk of this pie.\nAbout Broadcom Stock Broadcom is a global tech giant that designs semiconductor equipment, along with software and networking equipment. The company plays a pivotal role in meeting the demand of the AI industry through its custom chip designs, built specifically to run AI workloads. It is led by CEO Hock Tan and headquartered in San Jose, California.\nDespite a 22% drop in the last five trading sessions, the stock is up 35% in the last year, comfortably outpacing the Nasdaq Composite Index’s ($NASX) 13.2% gains.\nBroadcom’s forward P/E of 44.68x has finally fallen below its five-year average forward P/E of 47.36x. This isn’t any significant discount, especially when seen in the context of its peers. Both Nvidia (NVDA) and Marvell Technologies (MRVL) trade at a forward P/E below AVGO at 38.38x and 28.06x, respectively. Even with a 22% dip in a matter of five days, the stock is trading at a premium to its peers. Its long-term debt-to-total capital ratio of 42.33% is also significantly higher than NVDA's 7.31% and MRVL’s 22.43%. It is quite possible that this high valuation is what has caused such a strong negative reaction post-earnings, coupled with the obvious margin pressure the company is facing going forward.\n\nStory Continues\nAVGO now boasts a 0.77% forward dividend yield, giving enough dividend security to investors who like to cash in quarterly dividends while betting on the growth of the semiconductor industry.\nBroadcom Stock Reports Strong Earnings AVGO announced its Q4 2025 earnings on Dec. 12. It reported an EPS of $1.95 vs. $1.86 expected on a strong revenue of $18.02 billion vs. $17.49 billion expected. Going forward, the first fiscal quarter’s revenue is likely to come in at $19.1 billion, a healthy 28% year-over-year (YoY) growth.\nManagement clarified on the earnings call that the $10 billion customer announced during the quarter was Anthropic. Investors were presented with another surprise, as the company announced a fifth large customer as well. Broadcom also signed a deal with OpenAI recently and carries a $73 billion backlog, which it is likely to deliver over the next 18 months. This aids Broadcom's ambitious revenue targets, as per analysts.\n\nWhat Analysts Are Saying About AVGO Stock AVGO is a top pick among analysts, with 34 out of 40 Wall Street analysts rating it a “Strong Buy.” Earlier in the week, UBS raised AVGO’s price target from $472 to $475, implying a further 45% upside. Due to the ongoing dip in the stock price, the highest price target of $535 offers 64% upside from here on.\nOn the date of publication, Jabran Kundi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares of semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) jumped 4.6% in the afternoon session after the company was named a top pick for 2026 by Jefferies amid a broader rally in the chip sector.\nThe positive sentiment came after the investment firm identified KLA alongside industry leaders Nvidia and Broadcom. The recommendation noted a shift in investor interest toward companies with sustainable demand from the build-out of AI infrastructure. KLA's stock also benefited from a wider rebound among chipmakers, which followed a strong forecast from memory-chip maker Micron Technology. Micron's upbeat outlook was driven by surging demand and supply shortages, which allowed the company to charge more for its products and lifted sentiment for peers like KLA and Applied Materials.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $1,225, up 4.5% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy KLA Corporation? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us KLA Corporation’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 14 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 3.9% on the news that Jefferies upgraded the semiconductor company's stock to Buy from Hold and raised its price target.\n\nThe firm increased its price target on the shares to $1,500 from a previous target of $1,100, marking a significant 36% jump. This move signaled a more positive outlook for the company. The sentiment was echoed by other analysts. TD Cowen also raised its price target for KLA to $1,300 from $900. Similarly, Stifel increased its price target to $1,260 while maintaining its Buy rating, pointing to the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations. These actions reflected a strong growth outlook for KLA.\nKLA Corporation is up 92.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $1,225 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $1,246 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of KLA Corporation’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,671.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

The Chinese government has updated its guidelines to include AI chips from homegrown companies like Huawei and Cambricon. This policy shift effectively steers government and state-affiliated buyers away from American semiconductor firms.

The most notable takeaway was Micron’s guidance for next quarter, with revenue expectations raised to $18.7 billion from roughly $14.2 billion and earnings guidance nearly doubling from $4.78 per share to $8.42.\n\nManagement struck a confident tone, noting that it is “more than sold out,” and reiterated expectations for the total addressable market for high-bandwidth memory to reach $100 billion by 2028, implying a compound annual growth rate of roughly 40%.\nThere’s no question this was a stellar report, capping off a banner year for the memory giant. Still, it’s hard to ignore the industry’s cyclical nature. Historically, peak earnings often coincide with peak pricing, and memory stocks have a habit of looking cheapest just before margins begin to roll over.\nThat said, the AI-driven demand backdrop makes this cycle anything but typical. With powerful secular tailwinds, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) , and strong technical momentum reinforcing the bullish fundamentals, excessive caution here could quickly prove misplaced.\n\nWhile AI leaders like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) have traded sideways to lower over the past several months, Micron has continued to push higher. The key question is whether tight high-bandwidth memory supply will persist and drive the stock even higher, or if investors begin rotating back into established leaders like Nvidia and Broadcom.\nFor investors considering MU stock, the most practical approach is to let the price action be the guide. Below, I’ll break down Micron’s technical setup and outline a tactical plan.\nMicron Technology Shares Rally on Earnings Upgrades As shown in the chart below, Micron shares largely stagnated between 2022 and mid-2025, reflecting a choppy earnings revision trend and lingering skepticism around the durability of the memory recovery. While AI-driven demand for high-bandwidth memory was already emerging, investors lacked confidence that Micron could fully monetize that opportunity.\n\nThat changed in the summer of 2025, when earnings revisions turned decisively higher as visibility into HBM production, pricing, and capacity allocation improved. Management’s increasingly confident guidance signaled that demand was not only strong but constrained by supply, forcing analysts to raise forecasts. As earnings expectations reset higher, the stock followed.\nThe wave of earnings upgrades has continued, earning Micron a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) . Estimates were raised again today, and over the past 60 days, current year earnings expectations have climbed 22.38%, while next year’s estimates are up 32.42%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCan MU Stock Breakout Again? Micron’s technical chart is sending several important signals. The stock has delivered an impressive run, forming a series of consolidations and subsequent breakouts over the past several months. While shares are trading sharply higher today, MU has not yet cleared prior highs and remains within a broad trading range.\n\nKey support and resistance levels are critical to watch here. This news should be decisively bullish, but if the stock fails to break out and close above the $262 level in the near-term, it raises some caution flags. A clean breakout above that level, however, would likely signal another leg higher.\nIf MU does not break out, investors should closely monitor the rising support below. A decisive move beneath that level would materially increase downside risk. One additional cautionary signal is the expansion in the stock’s daily trading range. Stocks that grind higher on low volatility often sustain trends, but rising volatility (ranges) during an advance, as seen in MU, can sometimes precede a corrective phase.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nWhat’s Next for Shares of Micron Technology? Micron’s earnings reset has clearly established the stock as a leader in the AI infrastructure trade, but the next phase will likely be driven by price action rather than headlines. As long as high-bandwidth memory supply remains tight and earnings revisions continue to trend higher, MU has room to extend its outperformance, even as larger AI names like Nvidia work through their own consolidation phases.\n\nThat said, leadership rotations are a constant in this market. If investor risk appetite shifts back toward platform and networking exposure, or some other vertical, you could see leadership emerge elsewhere in the AI industry. For now, however, MU’s combination of accelerating earnings momentum and constructive technicals keeps the stock firmly in focus.\nUltimately, investors should remain disciplined and let the chart confirm the next move. A sustained breakout would argue for another leg higher, while a failure to hold key support would signal that expectations may be getting ahead of fundamentals.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While Social Security is tweaked annually in an attempt to keep up with the pace of inflation, its buying power has been dwindling in recent decades while the core inflation rate of 3% continues to hover above the Federal Reserve's elusive 2% target. One strategic way to bolster your retirement income is to add a mix of income ETFs that are the most likely to offset any deficiencies left by Social Security.\nRather than relying on a single stock or even asset class, we've uncovered a trio of income ETFs, including both equity and fixed-income flavors, that are dependable bets to offset any Social Security shortfall. These funds include the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF ( NYSE Arca: SCHD ), Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSE Arca: VYM) and the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSE: Arca: AGG), delivering a diversified mix of steady performers, high-yield plays and fixed-income stability. Given the uncertainty around the Social Security System, I would turn to these three income ETFs to strengthen my income streams in retirement.\n1.) Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEArca: SCHD) is one to consider in the current market climate. Targeting the returns of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, SCHD has a high standard for fundamental strength, including cash flow, among members, providing potential capital appreciation to a diversified portfolio in addition to the cash flow stream that dividends generate. With just over 100 stock holdings, SCHD has a trailing dividend yield of 3.84%, surpassing that of the average dividend stock in the S&P 500 at 1.16%.\n\nWith a total expense ratio of 0.060%, SCHD is attractive for its above-3% dividend yield, for a current quarterly payout of $0.2782 per share. By investing in SCHD, you're gaining exposure to leading stocks such as AbbVie ( NYSE: ABBV ), defense giant Lockheed Martin ( NYSE: LMT ), biotechnology stock Amgen ( Nasdaq: AMGN ) as well as pharmaceutical giant Merck ( NYSE: MRK ), consumer staple stock PepsiCo ( NYSE: PEP ), Big Tech company Cisco Systems ( Nasdaq: CSCO ), energy holdings ConocoPhillips ( NYSE: COP ) and Chevron ( NYSE: CVX ), among many others.\n\nStory Continues\nDividends are paid quarterly, giving investors an opportunity to plan and budget for cash flow as needed in retirement or decide to reinvest the dividends for a rainy day. Investors can replace the dependability of a steady paycheck with that of dividend income from stocks that have set the standard as steady payers for years, with some, like PepsiCo, achieving status as a Dividend Aristocrat for paying consistent dividends for at least 25 years.\n\n2.) Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) Next consider the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) if your risk/reward profile allows for some high-yield drama. The higher the dividend yield, the greater the chance that these payouts could become unsustainable in the future. VYM tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, pursuing domestic large-cap names, falling on the moderate-to-aggressive side of the risk spectrum. Stocks include JPMorgan ( NYSE: JPM ), Broadcom ( Nasdaq: AVGO ), Exxon Mobil ( NYSE: XOM ), among hundreds of other names.\n\nThis ETF provides investors with grand sector exposure, ranging from financials to consumer staples to tech to energy and beyond, a strategy that that favors established cash generators over passing trends, spreads risk across sectors, and delivers a steadier yield profile than many other options. Distributions can ebb and flow with markets, but VYM’s wider emphasis on value and blue-chip names make it a credible core income path to help supplement Social Security, especially when combined with a cash or short-term bond instrument to buffer any potential rough patches.\nIn addition to dividends, VYM has a proven performance history on the capital appreciation side, generating returns of 12.91% year-to-date, just shy of the 15.71% in the S&P 500 index. There are always trade-offs; value-focused funds can lag when growth stocks lead, and dividend stocks have a tendency to favor financials and energy. Overall, VYM can add steady cash flow and capital appreciation to offset part of Social Security.\n\n3.) iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) For some fixed income exposure, consider the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSEArca: AGG). This fund strategy targets wide exposure to U.S. investment-grade bonds, ensuring that your portfolio is filled with credit-worthy instruments. The growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment into this ETF would surpass $20,000 over the past two decades. With a dividend yield of 3.86% on a trailing 12 month basis, AGG makes distributions monthly, helping you to cover those bills in retirement without having to depend on Social Security.\n\nAGG tracks the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, holding a wide mix of Treasuries, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and investment-grade corporate bonds. With a low expense ratio of 0.03%, this ETF is somewhat sensitive to interest rates; prices can dip when yields rise and rise when rates fall. AS a result, AGG offers both diversification away from stocks as well as steady monthly income for predictable cash flow when you need it the most.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?
