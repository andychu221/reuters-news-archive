      "Content": "Has Broadcom’s AI Fueled Surge Run Ahead of Its Fundamentals in 2025?\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:13 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nIf you are wondering whether Broadcom is still attractive after its massive run, or if the market has already priced in the story, this article will unpack whether the current share price lines up with the fundamentals.\nEven after a recent pullback of around 16.0% over the last week and a flat 30 day move, Broadcom is still up about 47.1% year to date and roughly 43.5% over the past year, following multi year gains north of 500% over three years and more than 770% over five.\nThose swings have come against a backdrop of big headlines around Broadcom's role in powering AI data centers and its ongoing integration of VMware. Together, these have sharpened the market's focus on its long term growth runway and execution risks. At the same time, investors are weighing how much of that optimism is already embedded in the price as chip and infrastructure names re rate across the sector.\nAccording to our checks, Broadcom scores a 1 out of 6 valuation score , which suggests that on most traditional measures it is not obviously cheap, but that is only part of the story. Next, we will break down the different valuation approaches behind that score and then circle back at the end to a more holistic way of thinking about what the stock may be worth.\n\nBroadcom scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown .\nApproach 1: Broadcom Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis The Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company is worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them back to today in dollar terms. For Broadcom, the model starts with last twelve month free cash flow of roughly $26.9 billion and then builds in expectations for strong growth as AI and infrastructure demand scale.\n\nAnalyst estimates and Simply Wall St extrapolations suggest free cash flow could rise to about $107.1 billion by 2030, with further increases beyond that as growth gradually tapers. These ten year cash flow projections are then discounted back using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity framework to arrive at an intrinsic value of roughly $290.56 per share.\nCompared with the current share price, this DCF implies Broadcom is about 17.5% overvalued, meaning much of the anticipated cash flow growth already appears to be reflected in the market price.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Broadcom may be overvalued by 17.5%. Discover 915 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Broadcom.\n\nLire la suite\nApproach 2: Broadcom Price vs Earnings For a mature, highly profitable business like Broadcom, the price to earnings ratio is a useful way to gauge how much investors are paying today for each dollar of current profits. In broad terms, faster growth and lower perceived risk justify a higher normal PE, while slower growth or higher uncertainty usually warrant a lower one.\n\nBroadcom currently trades on a PE of about 69.7x. This is almost double the broader Semiconductor industry average of roughly 36.8x and also well above the peer group average of around 54.2x. To put that into better context, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio for each stock, which estimates what its PE should be given its specific earnings growth outlook, industry, profit margins, market value and risk profile. This is more precise than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for the fact that not all chip companies grow, earn or risk the same way.\nFor Broadcom, the Fair Ratio is around 54.8x, noticeably below the current 69.7x. This points to the shares trading at a premium to what its fundamentals alone would suggest.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1460 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Broadcom Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your own story about a company linked directly to numbers like fair value, and forecasts for future revenue, earnings and margins. A Narrative on Simply Wall St turns your view of Broadcom’s AI opportunity, VMware integration, customer concentration and competitive risks into a structured financial forecast, then connects that forecast to an explicit fair value you can compare with today’s share price to consider whether you think it is a buy, hold or sell. Narratives live on the Community page of Simply Wall St, are easy to create and follow, and are dynamically updated when fresh information such as earnings, guidance or major news arrives. For example, one Broadcom Narrative might assume rapid AI chip adoption, a smooth VMware ramp and premium profitability, giving a fair value above the current analyst consensus of about $403 per share. A more cautious Narrative might lean on the bearish analyst view near $218 if you expect slower growth, more intense competition and bumpier integration.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Broadcom?

Analyst answers\n\nSam Boughedda\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nInvesting.com -- The debate over which AI chip stock to own heading into 2026 remains central for investors, and Morgan Stanley says the outlook for next year still strongly favors the sector’s leaders.\nIn a 2026 semiconductor outlook, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote that “the picture for CY26 appears very strong,” with AI spending supported by “the scaling up of token growth for complex inference, around usage of the models, not training.”\n\nMoore acknowledged ongoing skepticism around longer-term AI assumptions, noting it has “some skepticism on the 5-year views that make 2025 strength look like a rounding error.”\nStill, the bank said visibility for 2026 remains solid, helped by recent capital raises among major model developers and sustained demand for compute.\nWithin processors, Morgan Stanley “remain[s] OW NVDA and AVGO, maintaining a preference for NVDA.”\n“[Nvidia is] still the nucleus for the AI trade, and at an undemanding multiple we think it’s hard to look elsewhere in AI,” said Moore.\nThe analyst highlighted “growing enthusiasm for ASIC, where growth will be strong,” but added that “as various bottlenecks emerge we continue to think that NVIDIA will be the highest ROI solution in cloud, particularly as Vera Rubin ramps in 2h26.”\n\nMorgan Stanley also believes “the market is underestimating NVIDIA’s position.”\nBroadcom remains favored as part of Morgan Stanley’s overweight positioning, but Nvidia stands out as the preferred name.\nHowever, the bank wrote that “on the GPU alternatives debate, we prefer AVGO as the proven and enduring accelerator story beyond CY2026.”\n“We really like the growth story here, and while we tend to be vocal on GPUs maintaining market share leadership, we still see very strong growth potential for both custom silicon and networking at Broadcom ,” Moore added.\nRelated articles\nNvidia vs. Broadcom: Which AI chip stock to own for 2026?

      "Content": "Nvidia vs AMD: Which AI Chipmaker Will Lead the Next Decade of Compute?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Nvidia has been the leading AI chip designer since the start of the AI boom, but AMD has been gaining ground.\nBoth companies design the chips powering crucial AI tasks.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the \"go-to\" source for artificial intelligence (AI) chips since the start of the AI boom, and this is thanks to two things: the company's first-to-market advantage and the strong performance of its chips. All of this has generated enormous earnings growth, with revenue and profit reaching record levels, and mind-boggling share price gains -- the stock has advanced more than 900% over three years.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't alone in the exciting AI space. It faces competition from other chip designers such as Broadcom and even some of its own customers that have developed their own chips, like Amazon , for example. But one name in particular represents perhaps the biggest threat to Nvidia's dominance, and that's Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) , a company that's been quickly advancing with new high-powered chips and attractive pricing. And the coming years could represent a crucial moment for chip companies, as Nvidia predicts AI infrastructure spending may reach as much as $4 trillion.\nWhich of these two AI chip designers will lead the next decade of compute? Let's find out.\nNvidia's path to leadership First, let's consider Nvidia's path to leadership and how it's managed to stay ahead of rivals so far. As mentioned, Nvidia entered the market first with its supercharged graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips that power the most crucial of AI tasks from training to inferencing . This offered the company the opportunity to build relationships with customers, and for customers to be won over by the quality of Nvidia's products.\n\nNvidia maintained this leadership by continuing to innovate on a regular basis, and in recent years, it committed to annual updates to its top chips.\nAMD made AI a focus with the launch of its Instinct line of accelerators back in 2017, and since then has added to GPU offerings, gaining in performance and therefore becoming a stronger rival for AI powerhouse Nvidia.\nIn the most recent earnings report, the company delivered a 36% increase in revenue to a record level of $9.2 billion, and chief executive officer Lisa Su said quarterly performance and guidance for the next quarter marked \"a clear step up in our growth trajectory.\" Demand from data center customers for the company's EPYC processors and Instinct AI accelerators drove gains in the period.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD and OpenAI It's also important to note that AMD recently signed a deal with OpenAI for the deployment of six gigawatts of AMD GPUs, with the first gigawatt set to roll out in the second half of next year. (OpenAI also has a deal with Nvidia for the deployment of 10 gigawatts of Nvidia GPUs.)\nThough AMD has come a long way in a short period of time and surely will continue to gain many orders for its GPUs, I don't see the company unseating Nvidia and driving compute in the coming decade. And here's why: Nvidia truly has built out a massive ecosystem within the world of AI, offering everything needed to do the AI job, from GPUs to high-performance networking equipment and software, as well as platforms for specific industries like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and robotics. And within those industry platforms, Nvidia's built tools designed to help customers reach their goals.\n\nThough AMD also offers a significant array of products and services, it's not as far-reaching as that of its bigger competitor.\nLeading the next decade of AI All of this makes Nvidia better positioned to lead the next decade of compute -- but this doesn't mean AMD won't benefit from the upcoming phases of AI growth. AMD's chips and systems are powerful, pricing is competitive, and the company has seen demand take off in recent quarters. Major chip customers, like Amazon, just to name one, buy GPUs from a variety of chip designers -- not just from Nvidia. In its recent earnings call, Amazon chief Andy Jassy said Amazon Web Services continues \"to work closely with chip partners like Nvidia, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as well as with AMD and Intel .\"\n\nAll of this means that AMD may have plenty of very of bright days ahead, but considering the empire Nvidia has carefully built over time and its commitment to innovation, I expect this AI giant to keep powering the AI revolution.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Companies tied to hyperscale data center spending, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, remain central to the buildout. At the same time, memory makers like Micron and Western Digital continue to benefit from constrained supply conditions that support pricing.\nCantor argued that the investment cycle behind AI is still in its early stages and should offer multi-year growth potential rather than the short-lived surge some investors feared.

The S&P 500 lost 0.6%, the Dow Jones advanced 1.1% and the Nasdaq retreated about 1.6% last week. The tech stocks were beaten down, taking a toll on the Nasdaq-100 as well as the S&P 500. Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS lost 1.7% last week, while State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF XLK was off 2.5%.\n\nInside the Tech Sell-off Oracle 's ORCL shares plummeted 14% last week as revenues missed expectations, dragging down related AI names like NVIDIA and Micron. Broadcom AVGO fell about 11% despite strong earnings and guidance, intensifying concerns over high capital spending and delayed AI revenue payoffs (read: ETFs to Watch as Oracle Dips Despite Beating on Q2 Earnings).\n\nFed Rate Cut The Fed enacted its final rate cut of the year last week. The move brings the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 3.5% to 3.75% after a closely divided vote among policymakers.The Fed will now conclude the year facing a softer labor market and inflation still about one percentage point above its 2% target.\n\nAfter three rate cuts in 2025 totaling three-quarters of a percentage point, the Fed&rsquo;s outlook for 2026 looks more restrained. Policymakers continue to project just one rate cut next year, consistent with their September forecast (read: 'A Hawkish Cut' From Fed? ETFs to Gain).\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning exchange-traded fund (ETF) areas of last week.\nWinning ETF Areas in Focus Cannabis\nRoundhill Cannabis ETF WEED &ndash; Up 51.2%\nAmplify Seymour Cannabis ETF CNBS &ndash; Up 51.0%\nCannabis stocks surged significantly on Dec. 12, 2025, thanks to reports of President Trump's plans to ease federal marijuana regulations by reclassifying it to Schedule III from a Schedule I. This news sparked gains across major players, boosting investor optimism despite no final policy confirmation, as mentioned in CNBC.\n\nSilver Miners\nGlobal X Silver Miners ETF SIL &ndash; Up 8.4%\nAmplify Junior Silver Miners ETF SILJ &ndash; Up 7.6%\nSilver is often considered an industrial metal. Rising industrial usage in solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics, and AI data centers has fueled demand. Plus, persistent supply shortages have now been boosting silver prices. As a result, silver mining stocks soared in recent tradings.\nSpace Economy\nProcure Space ETF UFO &ndash; Up 7.8%\nRocket Lab Corp RKLB surged 22.8% last week. The stock is benefiting from the uptick in investors&rsquo; attention in the overall space economy.Rocket Lab&rsquo;s successful move in the next-gen Neutron rocket and securing of new funding from the Canadian Space Agency were other positives. There has been a report about a potential $1.5 trillion SpaceX IPO for 2026 (per Bloomberg, as quoted on Yahoo Finance). SpaceX news acted as a cornerstone for the entire space investing arena.\n\nStory Continues\nGold Miners\nVanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF GDXJ &ndash; Up 7.1%\nSPDR Gold Trust GLD gained 2.2% last week as the greenback weakened further. Since gold mining stocks act as leveraged plays of the underlying metal, GDXJ surged materially.\nPlatinum\nGraniteShares Platinum Trust PLTM &ndash; Up 6.3%\nPlatinum surged above $1,700 per ounce, touching its strongest level since 2011, per Tradingeconomics. The World Platinum Investment Council forecasts a 2025 deficit of 69,200 ounces, marking a third successive annual shortfall. However, 2026 could see a balance in the platinum market with a modest surplus of about 20,000 ounces, as quoted on Tradingeconomics.\n\nHealth Care\nRoundhill GLP-1 & Weight Loss ETF OZEM &ndash; Up 6.3%\nThe Roundhill GLP-1 & Weight Loss ETF is the world&rsquo;s first GLP-1 ETF. OZEM is an actively-managed ETF. The fund charges 59 bps and yields 0.16% annually.

(NASDAQ: AVGO ) is one of the Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street . On December 12, Cantor Fitzgerald maintained its “Overweight” rating on the stock with a $525 price target. The firm has reiterated its “Top Pick” status on Broadcom based on AI infrastructure momentum and expanding silicon footprint.\n\nThe fabless chip and software maker reported a top-and-bottom-line earnings beat. Besides strong results for the October quarter, the company also provided a modest raise for January quarter guidance.\nHowever, this was partially affected by a higher tax rate forecast for fiscal year 2026. There was also a $73 billion of AI backlog, including $53 billion in custom silicon, which is anticipated to convert to revenue over the next six quarters.\nBroadcom also announced a fifth customer, bringing its total AI customer count to six, including Google, Anthropic, META, Bytedance, and OpenAI. The firm estimates AI semiconductor revenue to grow by more than 100% in calendar year 2026, leading to an earnings per share of at least $10.70.\nBroadcom is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Bank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\n\nVuk Zdinjak\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 5:37 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nORCL\n\nAVGO\n\nPalantir stock has gained about 20% since its November slump. It appears that the stock has weathered the storm of the AI sell-off, which was triggered by investor fears that AI is a bubble.\nLast week was especially difficult, as Oracle and Broadcom both took a sharp drop after reporting earnings, dragging other AI companies down with them.\nBank of America analyst Mariana Perez Mora and her team hosted investor meetings last week, featuring Palantir CFO Dave Glazer, Deployment Strategists Hind Kraytem and Austin Lee, and Investor Relations representative Cary Li, in South Korea. They updated their opinion on the stock afterward.\nBank of America says “PLTR still in a league of its own” The team said they came back confident from the meetings, as Palantir’s ( PLTR ) growth continues to build momentum in tandem with enterprise-level AI adoption.\nThey noted that U.S. Commercial growth continues to show the strongest momentum, thanks to strengthening backlog and lower contract duration. Palantir recently received a two-year contract with the U.S. Navy for ShipOS, worth $448 million, and Mora said that it further aligns the company with the Trump administration’s priorities regarding reindustrialization of America.\n\nThe team believes Palantir has an opportunity for margin expansion, as operating leverage grows with each use case across the businesses.\nRelated: Bank of America resets Broadcom stock price target\nMora wrote: “We continue to see PLTR unmatched in their ability to rapidly achieve in-production solutions and provide human-machine teams with the ability to make the most informed decisions.”\nIn a research note shared with TheStreet, Mora reiterated a buy rating and the target price of $255 for PLTR stock, based on a 15 enterprise multiple estimate for 2035. She used a longer-term valuation methodology to reflect the sustained high-growth and profitability profile of the company.\nMora believes this valuation fairly captures the beneficial position to national security and U.S. government, reflecting a leading role in artificial intelligence platforms, strong balance sheet , and strong profitability.\n\nAnalysts noted downside risk factors for Palantir: Lower-than-expected AI-platforms market growth\nFaster-than-expected commoditization\nCompetitors catching up with technologies,\nStronger-than-expected resistance from government customers to use commercial\noff-the-shelf solutions\nUpside risk factors for Palantir are: Stronger-than-expected growth of the AI-platforms market\nHigher-than-expected Palantir penetration\nBetter-than-expected profitability\nBetter-than-expected successful agreements and investments\nOther opinions on Palantir stock Wedbush analyst Dan Ives and his team rate Palantir with a buy rating and a target price of $230. TheStreet Pro ’s veteran analyst Stephen Guilfoyle rates Palantir with a buy rating and a target price of $215.\nMorgan Stanley reiterated a hold rating and raised Palantir’s price target from $155 to $205 in November, according to TipRanks .\n\nMotley Fool's Keithen Drury believes Palantir is “grossly overvalued.” He sees a big problem for Palantir in Wall Street ’s estimates for Palantir’s revenue growth rate for next year of 41%, because if they are correct, this will be a slowdown.\nIn turn, this slowdown will increase the number of years required for growth to bring Palantir’s valuation to a reasonable level.\nPalantir’s recent activity Palantir announced a three-year renewal of its contract with the DGSI, France’s domestic intelligence agency. The company will supply its proprietary software platform to the agency, along with the necessary integration, support, and assistance services for the software’s deployment and operational use.\n\n“We are very proud to support the DGSI in its crucial work in the service of France and its fight against terrorism,\" said Palantir CEO Alex Karp . \"This contract renewal reaffirms Palantir’s commitment to serving the interests of France since 2016, and ensuring the security of the French people.”\nMore AI Stocks:\nIs Nvidia’s AI boom already priced in?

The platform’s founding partners include CenterPoint Energy and Nvidia .\n\n\"We have spent years quietly deploying systems that keep power plants running and grids reliable,\" Tristan Gruska, Palantir’s head of energy and infrastructure, stated. \"Chain Reaction is the result of building from the ground up for the demands of AI.”\nAfter spending more than 12 years at Palantir, Jim Siders has stepped down from his most recent position of CIO and joined Shield Technology Partners to serve as CEO, according to CNBC .\nRelated: Bank of America resets Oracle stock price target\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 16, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.
