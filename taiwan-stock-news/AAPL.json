Analysts led by Dan Ives noted growing demand from CIOs, signaling a potential inflection point for the Redmond tech giant.\n\nIs PLTR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nPalantir is also on the radar, with steady traction across government and commercial contracts suggesting the company could scale significantly in the AI era. CrowdStrike is expected to benefit as cybersecurity needs expand alongside AI adoption, positioning its platform for broader enterprise growth.\nOn the consumer side, Tesla's ambitions in autonomous driving and robotics are expected to unlock more AI-driven value, while Apple can leverage its 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones to monetize AI features over the next few years. Wedbush estimates AI could add $75 to $100 per share to Apple's story.\nInvestors looking at 2026 may want to watch these leaders closely, as Wedbush signals the real AI gains will come from execution, not just buzz.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO and IBM Corp. IBM.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nTop Research Reports for Apple, Cisco & IBM\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc. and IBM Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here >>>\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.\n\nYou can read today's AWS here >>> Pre-Markets Lower on Low Seasonal Volume\n\nToday's Featured Research Reports\n\nApple&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry over the past six months (+33.5% vs. +32.6%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in its Services revenues. The company now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The new iPhone 17 series is expected to drive top-line growth. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy.\n\nApple expects the December quarter&rsquo;s (first-quarter fiscal 2026) net sales to grow between 10% and 12% on a year-over-year basis. The company expects iPhone sales to grow in double digits year over year. The Mac segment is expected to face a tough year-over-year comparison, and Services are expected to grow at the 2025 rate.\n\nHowever, gross margin is expected to be 47-48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, including a tariff impact of $1.4 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> )\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past six months (+14% vs. +13.6%). The company&rsquo;s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. An increase in recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Splunk's acquisition enhances the company&rsquo;s recurring revenue base.\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco&rsquo;s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco&rsquo;s security portfolio.\n\nNetworking sales benefited from strong demand for AI infrastructure and campus networking solutions. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers were strong driven by high double-digit order growth in hyperscalers. However, stiffening competition is a headwind.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>> )\n\nIBM&rsquo;s shares have gained +4.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry&rsquo;s gain of +47.8%. The company is betting big on the Watsonx platform, which is likely to be its core technology platform for AI capabilities. The company&rsquo;s focus on quantum technology for solutions to complex problems beyond the reach of classical computing is a tailwind.\n\nIBM is benefiting from a surge in demand for heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has led to sustainable growth through advanced technology and deep consulting expertise.\n\nHowever, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Macroeconomic headwinds are worrisome. IBM&rsquo;s acquisition spree has also escalated integration risks, while its high debt level is burdensome.\n\n(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>> )\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Warren Buffett gifts us 5 secrets for investing success, as he hands off Berkshire’s reins this week\n\nLawrence A. Cunningham\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nAs Warren Buffett exits his CEO role at Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A BRK.B, many will revisit his investing milestones — including his purchases of stakes in American Express AXP, See’s Candies, Coca-Cola KO and Apple AAPL — and his prudent pearls of investor wisdom: margin of safety, circle of competence, look-through earnings.\n\nBut two points matter most. First, Buffett is not disappearing; he remains Berkshire’s chairman. Second, his experience and lessons are as valuable today as ever, whatever the world’s volatility and distractions bring.\nMost Read from MarketWatch Strategy’s stock falls to fresh lows after using more share sales to buy bitcoin\nMicrosoft’s business is on fire. So how can its stock break from its curse?\nBuffett’s legacy isn’t stock picks or pithy statements — it’s a system Buffett’s greatest achievement is not beating the market, impressive as that is. It’s designing, in Berkshire, a decision‑making system that has minimized errors, resisted pressure and aligned incentives over decades.\nThat system matters as much now as it always has. Markets move faster, information is cheaper and noisier, and attention is commoditized. That may sound like a description of our moment, but it could have been written at almost any point in Buffett’s lifetime.\n\nThe hardest problems investors face — judgment, discipline, temperament — have not changed. Buffett understood this early. His response was not to chase speed or complexity but to build structures that reduce mistakes, personally and institutionally.\nBuffett’s enduring lessons for investors 1. Time is an asset: Buffett treated time as an asset — not a variable to manage around. Compounding rewards patience only if investors avoid self‑inflicted interruptions — unnecessary losses early, premature gains later.\nBuffett taught me this firsthand in 1997 when he urged me to self‑publish “The Essays of Warren Buffett.” In the short term, the book was a mountain of work. Over three decades, the payoff has compounded far beyond what any publishing contract could have delivered.\n\nIn an America dominated by quarterly guidance and real‑time dashboards, such a mindset is rare and valuable. Algorithms may trade in milliseconds, but businesses still create value over years.\n2. Value incentives and trust over forecasts: Buffett spent far less energy predicting macroeconomic outcomes than understanding people. He focused on incentives — how managers are paid, how boards behave, how capital is allocated — because incentives shape outcomes more reliably than projections.\nThat perspective is just as relevant today, as investors assess founder control, pay practices and corporate governance — just as they always have.\n\nStory Continues\nThe enduring lesson: Before asking what a company will do, ask about the character of its leaders and how they are rewarded.\n3. Simplicity is a discipline, not naïveté: Buffett avoided complexity not because he lacked skill, but because he recognized its dangers. Complexity obscures risk, dilutes accountability and creates false confidence. Look back at Enron, Theranos or certain corners of today’s markets.\n\nIn investing, complexity often signals not insight but confusion — or worse. Models grow elaborate precisely when reliability is lowest.\nThe enduring lesson: If you cannot explain an investment plainly, you probably do not understand it well enough to own it.\n4. Institutional patience beats individual brilliance: Berkshire Hathaway was designed to reduce the odds of bad decisions. Decentralized operations, a strong balance sheet, modest leverage and a culture of trust all served one purpose: preserving judgment under stress.\nIndividual investors cannot replicate Berkshire, but they can borrow from its logic — by setting rules in advance, limiting forced decisions and resisting the urge to constantly “do something.”\nThe enduring lesson: that the best investing systems protect you from yourself.\n\n5. Temperament remains the most mispriced asset : Buffett never claimed to be the smartest person in the room. He claimed to be among the most consistent. Emotional control — remaining rational when others are euphoric or fearful — is Buffett’s sharpest edge.\nTh​is edge has always been valuable, and it will remain so. In financial markets saturated with commentary and instant feedback, temperament deserves an even greater premium.\nThe enduring lesson: Intelligence is common; emotional discipline is scarce.\nWhat investors should write on a notecard These are not slogans but constraints — designed to limit damage rather than promise brilliance. They have worked across history, in all markets, and the best investors will recognize their relevance today despite the seeming novelty of the age.\nBuffett’s most relevant passage One passage from Buffett’s 1994 letter to Berkshire shareholders captures the durability of his philosophy better than any summary: “We will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts, which are an expensive distraction for many investors and businessmen,” Buffett wrote. “Thirty years ago, no one could have foreseen the huge expansion of the Vietnam War, wage and price controls, two oil shocks, the resignation of a president, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a one-day drop in the Dow of 508 points, or treasury bill yields fluctuating between 2.8% and 17.4%. But, surprise — none of these blockbuster events made the slightest dent in Ben Graham’s investment principles [nor render Buffett’s practices unsound].”\n\nIf Buffett were updating that passage today, his list would change, but the conclusion would not. “Thirty years ago,” he might say, “no one could have foreseen the impeachments of two presidents, the attacks of Sept. 11 and the wars that followed, the dot-com bubble and collapse, the freezing of credit markets and the ‘Great Recession,’ a global pandemic, mortgage rates swinging from under 2% to double digits, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, trade wars — or artificial intelligence.”\nNone of those political and economic events made a dent in Buffett’s timeless principles. And, 30 years from now, investors will surely compile a different list of shocks — only to reach the same conclusion.\nMore: These are the secrets to Buffett’s investment success, according to this billionaire investor\nPlus: Berkshire’s Buffett is stepping down. Why little will change and why that’s OK.\nMost Read from MarketWatch It’s time for a retirement checkup: 5 easy ways to stay on track\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why One Fund Ditched Viper Energy in a $12 Million Exit Amid a 20% Stock Slide\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Michigan-based Nemes Rush Group sold 319,503 shares of Viper Energy in the third quarter.\nThe position was worth an estimated $12.18 million as of the previous period.\nThe move marked an exit for Nemes Rush, which reported holding no VNOM shares as of September 30.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nOn November 13, Michigan-based Nemes Rush Group disclosed it sold out its entire position in Viper Energy (NASDAQ:VNOM) , reducing holdings by 319,503 shares worth an estimated $12.18 million.\nWhat Happened According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing dated November 13, Nemes Rush Group sold all 319,503 shares of Viper Energy (NASDAQ:VNOM) during the third quarter. The estimated transaction value was approximately $12.18 million based on average quarterly pricing.\nWhat Else to Know The fund's VNOM stake previously comprised 1.33% of reportable AUM.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ:AVGO: $55.44 million (5.5% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:AAPL: $52.14 million (5.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:MSFT: $42.41 million (4.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:GOOGL: $38.28 million (3.8% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:NVDA: $37.42 million (3.7% of AUM)\n\nAs of Monday, Viper Energy shares were priced at $38.48, down 20% over the past year and well underperforming the S&P 500, which is instead up about 15.5% in the same period.\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.19 billion\nNet income (TTM)\n$243.66 million\nDividend yield\n5.5%\nPrice (as of Monday)\n$38.48\n\nCompany Snapshot Viper Energy owns and manages mineral interests in oil and natural gas properties, primarily in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale\nThe company generates revenue from royalties on hydrocarbon production\nIt operates as a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy\nViper Energy focuses on acquiring and managing mineral rights in key U.S. oil and gas basins, enabling participation in upstream production economics while minimizing capital expenditures and operational risks. The company’s business model is based on collecting royalties from operators extracting oil and gas on its acreage.\n\nFoolish Take What makes this exit worth watching is not the size of the sale but what it signals about investor tolerance for volatility in income-focused energy plays. Viper Energy is not a growth stock -- it’s a royalty business designed to convert commodity exposure into cash flow, dividends, and buybacks. That model has worked operationally, but the share price recently has not worked out so well.\n\nIn the third quarter, Viper produced more than 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and generated $165 million in pro forma cash available for distribution. It returned 85% of that cash to shareholders through a $0.58 combined base and variable dividend and $90 million in buybacks. That translated into an annualized yield north of 6% at recent prices. At the same time, reported results showed a net loss driven by non-cash impairment charges tied to asset transfers, not underlying operating weakness.\n\nFor a diversified fund, trimming or fully exiting a sub 2% position after a sharp drawdown can be a portfolio hygiene move rather than a fundamental call, and that may be what long-term investors should most keep in mind here.\n\nStory Continues\nGlossary Assets under management (AUM): The total market value of investments managed by a fund or investment firm.\n13F reportable assets: Securities that institutional investment managers must disclose quarterly to the SEC if over a certain threshold.\nLiquidated: Sold off an entire investment position, reducing holdings to zero.\n\nDividend yield: Annual dividends paid by a company divided by its share price, shown as a percentage.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): Financial data covering the most recent 12 consecutive months.\nMineral interests: Ownership rights to minerals (like oil or gas) beneath land, often generating royalties.\nRoyalties: Payments made to mineral rights owners based on production or revenue from resource extraction.\nUpstream production: The exploration and extraction phase of oil and gas operations, before refining or distribution.\nCapital expenditures: Funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property or equipment.\nOperational risks: Potential losses resulting from failed internal processes, systems, or external events.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Sign up now!\nVersus their pandemic high, however, Intel shares remain down some 50%, suggesting persistent structural and executions risks continue to weigh on sentiment.\nWhat to Expect From Intel Stock in 2026 The latest setback for INTC stock came from Nvidia (NVDA) that’s reportedly scrapped plans of producing its advanced chips using Intel’s 18A node.\nStill, Daniel Newman – the chief executive of Futurum Group – believes the longer term bull case remains intact for one simple reason: Taiwan Semi (TSM) just “can’t produce enough chips.”\n\nThe unprecedented AI-driven demand is making big names like Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM), and even AMD (AMD) explore alternatives, reinforcing Intel’s role as an auxiliary capacity provider.\nAnd since demand is truly explosive, being only an adjunct resource for the semiconductor space may prove sufficient in driving Intel stock higher in 2026, he told CNBC in a recent interview.\nINTC Shares Remain Inexpensive to Own Newman doesn’t see NVDA news as a major setback for Intel shares since Lip-Bu Tan had already broadcast that the initial ramp-up of the firm’s 18A node is optimized for and dedicated to its own internal products.\nAccording to him, the real inflection point for Intel will be its upcoming “14A” process, expected to enter volume production in 2028.\n\n“This is the one where rubber meets the road for companies like Nvidia, Apple, and others.”\nFrom a valuation perspective, INTC shares are just as attractive. Despite an explosive year-to-date rally, they’re going for just over 3x sales at the time of writing, versus more than 35x for Nvidia.\nWall Street Disagrees with Newman on Intel Wall Street analysts do not entirely agree with Newman’s constructive view on Intel stock, though.\nThe consensus rating on INTC shares remains at “Hold” only with the mean target of nearly $37 already in line with the price at which they are trading currently.\n\nStory Continues\nThis article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.

The Mac segment is expected to face a tough year-over-year comparison, and Services are expected to grow at the 2025 rate.\n\nHowever, gross margin is expected to be 47-48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, including a tariff impact of $1.4 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> )\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past six months (+14% vs. +13.6%).

The company&rsquo;s focus on quantum technology for solutions to complex problems beyond the reach of classical computing is a tailwind.\n\nIBM is benefiting from a surge in demand for heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has led to sustainable growth through advanced technology and deep consulting expertise.\n\nHowever, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Macroeconomic headwinds are worrisome.

      "Content": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Although nine publicly traded American companies have achieved a valuation of $1 trillion or more, only four have graduated into the $3 trillion club.\nAmazon is an incredibly diverse technology company, with a dominant market position in industries like e-commerce, cloud computing, and more.\nThe tech titan could join the $3 trillion club in 2026 thanks to a combination of its attractive valuation and its strong earnings growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nNine publicly traded American companies are worth $1 trillion or more, but only four have graduated into the exclusive $3 trillion club so far: Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , and Microsoft .\nI think Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could join them by the end of 2026 thanks to the accelerating revenue growth in its cloud computing division, and the surging profits in its legacy e-commerce business. The company has a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion as I write this, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a 21% return over the next year if it does cross the $3 trillion milestone.\nRead on, and let's consider Amazon's growth prospects in the year ahead.\nAll eyes on Amazon Web Services Amazon's potential pathway to the $3 trillion club next year starts with its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It used to be a place where businesses would simply store data and host their critical digital applications, but it has evolved to become the center of Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAWS operates state-of-the-art data centers and it rents the computing capacity to AI developers who don't have the financial resources to build their own infrastructure. These data centers are filled with advanced AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia , but Amazon also designed its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium. Top developers like Anthropic are using hundreds of thousands of the latest Trainium2 chips, which offer up to 40% better price performance than competing hardware when training AI models.\nThen there is the AWS Bedrock platform, where businesses can access hundreds of completed AI models from third-parties including Anthropic and Meta Platforms . Developing models from scratch is time consuming and expensive, so using a ready-made solution can help businesses achieve their AI goals much faster.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), which was up 20% year over year. That was the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, which highlights the platform's incredible AI-driven momentum. But it gets better, because AWS has a whopping $200 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online, so the strong top-line results are likely to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's earnings continue to crush Wall Street's estimates The $33 billion in third-quarter revenue that AWS brought in accounted for just 18% of Amazon's total revenue of $180 billion. However, the cloud business is the company's most profitable by far, contributing 65% of its total operating income. E-commerce is actually Amazon's largest source of revenue, but its profit margins are very thin because its Amazon.com site focuses on selling a high volume of products at low prices.\n\nHowever, Amazon is pushing to improve profitability in its e-commerce business by boosting efficiency and implementing new technologies. In 2023, it broke its U.S. logistics network into eight distinct regions, so now the products in each fulfillment center are specific to their geographic region. As a result, orders travel shorter distances to reach customers, which brings down packing and shipping costs.\nAmazon also uses AI-powered software like Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers, which uses computer vision to identify defective products before they ship. This reduces returns and refunds, creating further cost savings.\nThe accelerating growth at AWS combined with improved efficiency in the e-commerce business is driving a huge increase in Amazon's overall profit. The company generated earnings of $5.22 per share during the first three quarters of 2025, which was a whopping 42% jump from the same period in 2024. Plus, Amazon's earnings have beaten Wall Street's consensus estimates in every single quarter of 2025, by an average of 22%.\n\nHow Amazon can cross the $3 trillion milestone in 2026 Amazon stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.8 as I write this. That's roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so Amazon stock is basically sitting at fair value relative to its peers in the tech sector.\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate earnings of $7.86 per share in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6.\nAssuming Wall Street is right, Amazon stock would have to climb by 11% next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 32.8, lifting its market cap to $2.75 trillion. But remember, the company has a habit of beating Wall Street's expectations.\nIf its 2026 earnings beat the consensus estimate by 22% like they have so far in 2025, then its stock could be poised for a 35% gain next year instead. That would catapult its market value to a whopping $3.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, even an earnings beat of just 9% next year would be enough to see Amazon join the $3 trillion club. Given the incredible momentum across its e-commerce business and AWS, I think that's an achievable target.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Apple Is Likely to Return to Double-Digit Revenue Growth in Fiscal 2026 -- and the Stock Looks Like a Buy\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 9:01 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nKey Points Apple guided for double-digit revenue growth in fiscal Q1.\nThe latest iPhone lineup is off to an excellent start.\nApple's lucrative services business is already growing at a double-digit rate, and management expects the segment's strong growth to persist in fiscal 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nBetween the end of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) annual sales volume essentially went nowhere. In fact, it even declined slightly over that two-year stretch. But the company's latest results, combined with its upbeat outlook for its important holiday quarter, suggest this era of suppressed sales may be ending.\nIn its fourth-quarter 2025, Apple reported $102.5 billion in revenue, up 8% year over year, helped by robust iPhone revenue growth and double-digit growth in services. Even more, Apple guided for its revenue growth rate to accelerate in fiscal Q1 -- a critical period that includes the holiday season.\nI believe this acceleration in Apple's business is a sign of an enduring pick-up in its business that ultimately makes the stock attractive today.\nA holiday-quarter outlook that sets the tone Setting the stage for what is likely to be a strong fiscal 2026 for the iPhone maker, Apple chief financial officer Kevan Parekh said during its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call that it expects revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year to rise 10% to 12% year over year, with iPhone revenue growing at a double-digit rate.\n\nNot only is Apple's holiday quarter typically its biggest, but it also marks the first full quarter of sales of the company's latest iPhone lineup, so it arguably sets the stage for how the latest iPhone line can drive sales during the entire fiscal year. And with management specifically calling out an expectation for iPhone sales to grow at a double-digit rate during the period, this provides even more reason to be confident in Apple's momentum headed into fiscal 2026.\n2 more key catalysts While Apple's iPhone gets the most headline attention, the company's services segment is arguably just as important to the tech company 's growth story. The segment, which boasts high-margin revenue from Apple's share of third-party app sales and subscriptions, the company's native services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV, and Apple Care, and more, posted 15% year-over-year growth in fiscal Q4. And, looking to fiscal Q1, management said it expects its services revenue to continue growing at a double-digit rate.\nJust how lucrative is Apple's services segment? Its gross margin came in at 75.3% in fiscal Q3 -- more than double the 36.2% gross profit margin that Apple's product segment boasted during the quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nFurther, there's a recurring nature to Apple's services business that investors love. As the company's installed base of active devices expands and as those users become more active over time, Apple can benefit from monetizing its users via recurring payments tied to Apple's ecosystem -- even during periods when hardware demand isn't robust.\n\nAnd then there's another major tailwind that could help Apple's business in the coming years: AI (artificial intelligence). Unlike tech peers like Microsoft and Alphabet , Apple isn't spending wild sums on capital expenditures to fund expansions in AI-capable data center infrastructure. But that doesn't mean it won't benefit from AI. The company could benefit from it in several ways, including increased demand for high-performing technology devices providing users with access to cloud-based AI features, and potentially even from entirely new product categories that emerge in the coming years, ultimately enabled by AI.\nWith all of this said, investors do seem to already be pricing an anticipated reacceleration in Apple's business. The stock's valuation is not cheap. Shares currently command a price-to-earnings ratio of about 37 and a forward price-to-earnings of 33.\n\nBut given the powerful brand that Apple boasts, the intense loyalty of its customer base, and the potential of AI leading to an unusually large wave of device upgrades over the coming years, I believe the tech giant deserves this valuation.\nOf course, no investment is without risk. Apple's heavy reliance on iPhone is a tailwind during good times for the flagship device, but it can weigh on its business when iPhone sales weaken. Further, there's always competition aiming to capture a slice of Apple's lucrative hardware markets. For these reasons, investors should be careful about how they size any position in the stock. Ultimately, however, I do think the tech stock looks attractive today -- even when considering the risks.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now?

      "Content": "Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nEllie Diamond\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: FIG\n\nSTLA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAAPL\n\nThere are countless articles and profiles of entrepreneurs who dropped out of college. Fortune magazine recently featured several, including Figma CEO Dylan Field and Scale founder Lucy Guo, the world’s youngest self-made billionaire woman, who built her own fortune.\nInnovators like these young people make the news because they’re inspiring, intelligent and innovative. They’re also exceptional. which can make them unrealistic role models, according to Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon. He advises aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from experience before striking out on their own.\n\nThe Exception, Not the Rule In October 2025, two entrepreneurs took the stage at Italian Tech Week in Turin. One was John Elkann, the chair and executive director of automaking giant Stellantis [ 3 ]. During his interview with Bezos, Elkann asked what he thought of the ideal of the prodigy entrepreneur.\nThese are personalities such as Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Steve Jobs. Each became hugely successful after rejecting the conventional pathway to success: a college education and years of climbing the ladder .\n\nElkann didn’t take this route, and neither did Bezos. They have great respect for those who did, but Bezos is quick to point out that it shouldn’t be an expectation.\n“It is possible to be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college and be a great entrepreneur ,” he said. “We have famous examples of that. But these people are the exception.”\nThe numbers back him up. A Clifford-Lewis Private Wealth study found that among the top 0.1% of rapidly growing new businesses, the founder’s average age was 45 at startup. Based on its data, Clifford-Lewis estimates that entrepreneurs have a much higher chance of success at 30 than at 20.\nSee Next: I Asked ChatGPT How To Build Wealth for the Rest of Trump’s Term: Here’s Its Plan\nTrending Now: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too\n\nThe Value of Professional Experience Bezos started Amazon at age 30. He had graduated from Princeton University in 1986 and worked at several Wall Street companies, including Fitel and Bankers Trust. In 1990, he became the youngest-ever vice president of hedge fund D.E. Shaw. He opened Amazon in July 1995 at age 31.\nBezos said these 10 years of working for others improved Amazon’s chances of success . He gained hands-on experience leading a growing company, and these skills helped him guide Amazon through its early days of explosive growth. In only two years, he took the company public, with an initial public offering price of $18 per share.\n\nStory Continues\nBezos now counsels young aspiring entrepreneurs to follow a similar path. As he said in Turin:\n“I always advise young people, go work at a best-practices company where you can learn a lot of basic, fundamental things: how to hire really well, how to interview, etc. There’s a lot of stuff you would learn in a great company, and there’s still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it”.\n\nBezos believes that these early career lessons do what pure inspiration and talent cannot: They teach young entrepreneurs how to do things right from day one. This knowledge supports better decision-making, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on growth.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/374eb4de-ba6e-3788-991c-dc6200b60e51/apple-ceo-tim-cook-just-gave.html",
      "Content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook Just Gave Nike Investors 3 Million Reasons to Cheer\n\nBram Berkowitz, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Apple CEO Tim Cook has been a member of Nike's board of directors for two decades.\nCook just made one of his largest open-market purchases of Nike stock.\nThis comes as Nike attempts a bold turnaround plan.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\nIt's been tough sledding for the iconic sports apparel company Nike (NYSE: NKE) , which has seen its stock shed roughly 19% this year and over 57% in the past five years. Retail brands like Nike have been challenged by rising competition in the space, more price-sensitive consumers, and macro challenges, among others.\nNike has also acknowledged strategic mistakes, including an overemphasis on online promotions and a lack of product innovation. Recently, however, Apple 's CEO Tim Cook, who has been on Nike's board of directors for about two decades, gave Nike investors 3 million reasons to cheer.\nTim Cook doubles down on Nike Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings recently revealed that Cook purchased 50,000 shares of Nike at an average price of $58.97 per share, totaling nearly $3 million. Cook made the purchases on the open market, and the move nearly doubles his stake in the company. According to MarketWatch, these purchases are also Cook's first market buys since 2005, not including equity-based compensation or purchases associated with derivatives.\n\nInsider buys indicate bullishness, and shares jumped after the SEC filings were made public. As the CEO of Apple, Cook possesses keen business acumen and carries more recognition than the typical board member, so it makes sense that his purchases are being received positively. They also come as Nike is attempting a large turnaround plan that has struggled to gain momentum thus far.\nNike recently reported earnings results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. The actual earnings results came in strong when the company reported $0.53 earnings per share on revenue of $12.4 billion, both of which came in ahead of Wall Street estimates. However, the stock got crushed after management delivered disappointing guidance, especially as it pertains to its business in China, which is viewed as a key market for the company.\n\nDuring the company's earnings call, Nike CFO Matthew Friend told analysts that headwinds in Greater China and challenges with Nike's Converse brand are expected to persist for the remainder of its fiscal year 2026. Tariffs are another headwind impacting the company.\nNike is guiding for revenue in the third fiscal quarter to decline in the low single-digit percentage range, with performance in China and Converse similar to that in the second quarter. Nike's CEO Elliott Hill, who was pulled out of retirement to lead the company toward the end of 2024, described the company's turnaround plan as being in the \"middle innings.\"\n\nStory Continues\nCan Nike figure it out? Nike's turnaround plans involve an intense refocus on athletes, the brand, and product innovation. Under Hill, the company has seen positive traction regarding its new product lines, which is reflected in improved revenue for the North American business. However, the company is also dealing with headwinds outside of its control, due to tariffs.\n\nChina is likely the biggest challenge for Nike right now. The company needs to determine how to better connect with consumers in terms of its brand and products, as well as how to most efficiently reach them in China. Nike is making changes in the region, but investors will likely need to see more proof that the strategy is working.\nI don't think Nike is necessarily going to rally overnight, and this is likely a position that will require plenty of patience. That said, some very big names like Cook are now showing confidence in the name, and investors can collect a dividend with a nearly 2.75% yield as they wait. Long-term-minded investors can certainly start nibbling on the stock if they're interested.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nike right now? Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nLeer más\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

If you received an Apple gift card over the holidays and are exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.\nWith its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.\n\nDespite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice.\nWhile the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more.\nAlthough it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller.\nOf course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need.\n\nWe’ll walk you through the similarities and differences between the two smart watches to help inform your decision.\nSimilarities between the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch SE 3 Differences between the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch SE 3\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Next Stock-Split Stock That Could Make You Rich\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:11 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nAAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms is trading at a price where big tech peers have announced stock splits.\nIf Meta splits its stock, it could benefit from increased liquidity and broader investor participation.\nWith nearly 3.5 billion daily active users and aggressive capital investments in AI infrastructure, the company’s core digital advertising business continues to grow at an impressive pace.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have soared 443% over the past three years, closing at $661.50 on Dec. 22. At this share price, Meta now trades in the same range where companies such as Apple , Nvidia , and Tesla previously announced forward stock splits .\nWhile Meta has never executed a forward stock split since going public, the company's rising share price and growing earnings power have meaningfully increased the probability of a split in 2026.\nStock splits don't change the value of any investor's holdings, but here's why a Meta stock split could prove beneficial for investors, if it were to enact one.\n\nUpside drivers Although stock splits do not change a company's fundamentals, they tend to improve liquidity and broaden the investor base as they lower the per-share price (while increasing the number of shares), which can support higher trading activity and market valuation over time. While the availability of fractional shares has reduced some barriers to entry in stocks with high nominal share prices, research suggests that many retail investors still prefer owning full shares.\n\nAccording to data from Bank of America 's Research Investment Committee, companies that split their stock reported an average total return of 25.4% in the 12 months following the split announcement, more than double the 11.9% average return of the benchmark S&P 500 index in the same time frame. Hence, Meta's stock could see an incremental upside from improved liquidity and broader participation following a stock split.\nMeta reaches almost 3.5 billion people daily across its family of apps, giving it unmatched global scale and pricing power in digital advertising. Management has also guided for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, mainly for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nThese investments are already showing results. Meta's AI-driven ad tools are improving ad targeting efficiency and advertiser returns on ad spend. The company is also expanding its addressable market with newer ad surfaces, including on WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nHence, for long-term investors, a potential stock split could serve as an accelerator on top of the company's robust fundamentals, which can drive up its share prices in the coming months. I think Meta could be a stock-split stock that could make investors rich.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

(NASDAQ: GSAT ) ranks among the best telecom stocks to invest in . Deutsche Bank began coverage of Globalstar, Inc. (NASDAQ:GSAT) on December 16 with a $62 price target and a Hold rating. The bank’s study addresses Globalstar’s place in the satellite communication (satcom) industry, highlighting the company’s deliberate shift from direct competition with providers like as Inmarsat and Iridium to transforming into a major capacity supplier as Apple’s direct-to-device (D2D) network operator.\nFollowing the Echostar and SpaceX arrangement, Globalstar’s spectrum gained “material” strategic worth, according to Deutsche Bank, which helped the stock more than double in the last three months.\nAdditionally, in order to support its third-generation mobile satellite services throughout Central and South America, Globalstar, Inc. (NASDAQ:GSAT) stated more than a month ago that it will be adding eight new six-meter C-3 tracking antennas to its ground stations throughout Brazil. The eight additional antennae being set up are part of a larger global expansion that includes up to 90 new tracking antennas for Globalstar’s third-generation C-3 satellite system.\n\nGlobalstar, Inc. (NASDAQ:GSAT) is an international telecom infrastructure provider that offers reliable satellite and terrestrial connectivity services. The company operates a satellite constellation in low Earth orbit to deliver secure data transmission for asset tracking, critical data transfer, and safety applications for consumers, businesses, and government agencies around the world.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of GSAT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "From Tesla To Nike: Why Tim Cook's Buy Is Drawing Market Parallels\n\nSurbhi Jain\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:31 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNKE\n\nAAPL\n\nMarket bottoms rarely arrive with reassurance. They show up when skepticism turns casual — when stocks stop being debated and start being dismissed. That's the backdrop against which Apple Inc ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook 's purchase of Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ) shares is suddenly getting serious attention .\n\nEarlier this year, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) found its footing just as public commentary around the stock turned openly mocking, including a high-profile jab from Tim Walz . The remark didn't cause the bottom — but it coincided with a moment when pessimism appeared fully priced in. Tesla didn't explode higher overnight. It simply stopped going down. And that was the tell.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nPeak Skepticism Setup Nike now sits in a similarly uncomfortable place. The stock has spent months under pressure from margin concerns, inventory cleanups, and questions around consumer demand. Expectations are low. Sentiment is thin. The narrative has grown tired. The shares are down over 18% YTD.\nThat's what makes Tim Cook's personal purchase of roughly $3 million worth of Nike shares stand out. Not the size — the timing.\n\nWhy This Buy Matters Cook isn't a Nike insider. He isn't required to buy. And he isn't known for tactical trades. When someone with his profile steps into a struggling consumer name, markets naturally ask whether downside risk is becoming asymmetric.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThis isn't a call that Nike's problems are solved. Execution still matters, and fundamentals will ultimately decide the outcome. But selective, high-profile buying tends to show up closer to inflection points than to peaks.\nTesla's Quiet Lesson Tesla's bottom earlier this year offered a simple reminder: markets often turn when confidence looks misplaced and skepticism sounds effortless. Nike may not follow the same script — but Tim Cook's move suggests the risk-reward conversation has shifted.\nAnd when that happens, the story usually changes before the stock does.\nRead Next:\nBuffett's Secret to Wealth?

      "Content": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: ASML vs. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points ASML's equipment is essential to producing the world's most advanced semiconductors.\nTSMC has effectively leveraged ASML's equipment to produce the world's most advanced chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) are arguably the two most essential artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the hardware space. TSMC is well known for being the foundry of choice for Nvidia , Apple , and other top semiconductor companies.\n\nHowever, TSMC's success is not possible without ASML. It uses the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines built by ASML to manufacture the world's most advanced chips.\nThis creates a harder job for investors trying to discern which stock is more likely to make the highest long-term gains. Although both companies are critical to this process, investors need to take a closer look to see which is the more suitable stock for them to own.\nThe case for ASML Investors should remember one thing about ASML. Despite ASML's importance, only a tiny client base is interested in its EUV machines, which can cost as much as $400 million each. Worse, political concerns bar what equipment it can sell to countries like China, further adding to that limitation.\nNonetheless, companies such as Samsung and Intel are among the companies buying EUV machines. Additionally, ASML operates in the deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) market. Although the market has more competitors, it also allows it to earn business from foundry companies that produce other types of chips.\n\nFurthermore, such costly equipment needs periodic maintenance. With that, the Netherlands-based company runs a thriving maintenance business that accounts for more than one-third of ASML's revenue.\nAmid the growth in AI, its machines are more in demand, so much so that ASML earned almost 23 billion euros ($27 billion) in revenue in the first nine months of 2025, a yearly increase of 21%.\nAlso, ASML limited expense growth, leading to a net income of 6.8 billion euros ($7.9 billion), a 39% rise from year-ago levels. With the rising profits, the stock is up by almost 50% over the last year.\nInvestors should also note the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. While that is above the S&P 500\naverage of 31, it closely approximates the company's average over the last five years. Considering the demand in AI, such a valuation is unlikely to deter investors from bidding the stock price higher over time.\n\nWhy investors might consider TSMC However, with a larger client base, investors might find TSMC stock more appealing. They might also like its dominance.\n\nStory Continues\nAs mentioned, TSMC makes the world's most advanced chips. While companies like Samsung and Intel have attempted to compete, TSMC's dominant market share continues to grow. As of the second quarter of 2025, that market share reached 70%, giving the company a tremendous competitive advantage.\nThis arguably makes TSMC's biggest threat operating in Taiwan, an island that has dealt with periodic threats of an invasion by China. Since Chinese companies also depend on its chips, the threat could be overblown. Still, it was concerning enough that Warren Buffett reversed a decision by his lieutenants to invest Berkshire Hathaway 's capital in the company.\n\nThat threat has not stopped TSMC's growth. The $87 billion in revenue TSMC earned in the first nine months of 2025 rose 36% compared to the same period last year.\nAlso, like with ASML, expenses grew more slowly than revenue. Still, with other comprehensive losses weighing on the bottom line, its comprehensive income of $35 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 increased by 30% year over year. If not including those losses, net income would have grown by 52%.\nAmid the rising demand and income, TSMC stock is up by almost 50% over the last year. Also, with a 30 P/E ratio, it is cheaper than ASML and trades at a valuation that closely matches the S&P 500 average.\nStill, TSMC has tended to trade at a discount, and for that reason, it is above its average earnings multiple of 25 over the last five years. That makes it unclear whether TSMC is a better bargain, or whether investors feel the geopolitical concerns justify the discounted multiples of the past.\n\nASML or TSMC? Considering these similarities, investors will likely win by choosing either or both stocks. However, choosing between the two probably comes down to risk tolerances.\nTSMC offers similar revenue and stock price growth at a lower valuation. Hence, if one is comfortable with the geopolitical risk, it might make sense to lean more toward TSMC.\n\nConversely, if one feels as Buffett does about the geopolitical concerns, ASML is probably the more suitable choice, as most of its manufacturing takes place far away from geopolitical hotbeds.\nUltimately, investors have the choice between two critical AI hardware stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market. Thus, this is one case where they should assess their risk tolerances and act accordingly.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nCramer has remained an ardent defender of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) regardless of the share price performance. The CNBC TV host sticks to his mantra of ‘own it, don’t trade it’ when it comes to the stock. Recently, his optimism has also been met by Wall Street analysts. For instance, investment bank Morgan Stanley raised Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s share price target to $315 from $305 on December 17th and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. Morgan Stanley explained that the reason behind the price target bump was an increased fiscal year 2027 earnings estimate to $9.83 from $9.55. It added that rising prices for memory chips could reduce Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s margins. On the same day, Jefferies raised the price target to $283.36 from $246.99 and kept a Hold rating on the shares. As per Jefferies, when it comes to memory chip prices, the fact that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) charges premium prices can help it buffer against possible impacts to the gross margins. As Cramer praised FedEx for moving into the business-to-consumer segment, he added that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was an example of a firm that had excelled in the consumer space:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The decision lets Apple keep selling its Series 9 and Ultra 2 devices, even though Masimo says they use its blood-oxygen sensor technology without permission.The action is based on a ruling by the International Trade Commission in 2023 that protected Masimo's patents on light-based pulse oximetry. In response, Apple released a software update that moved certain blood-oxygen computations to the iPhone that was linked with the watch. Earlier this year, U.S. Customs authorities allowed importation of the upgraded devices because of the change.Masimo said that the Customs decision was wrong and that Apple's remedy didn't fix the alleged violation. But Judge Ana Reyes turned down Masimo's request for an injunction, noting that the firm had not completed the legal requirements to stop imports.The ITC has started a fresh evaluation of the case, which means that there might be further decisions in the future.

Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nIn a letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he once wrote that “the best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return (1).”\n\"The worst business to own,\" Buffett continued, \"is one that must, or will, do the opposite — that is, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low rates of return.\"\nHalfway through 2025, Buffett announced his decision to retire from his longtime post as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year (2). As of this writing, he ranks tenth on the Forbes real-time billionaires index, with a net worth of $148.1 billion (3).\nHere are some great examples of his advice — and holdings — in action.\nApple (AAPL) Buffett’s largest holding is Apple, the iPhone maker based in Cupertino, California. While Berkshire has been famously dumping shares of the company since 2024, Apple still makes up 20.5% of Berkshire’s portfolio, more than any other single holding (4).\nThe iPhone’s continued popularity, alongside solid high-margin segments for its services and software makes Apple an attractive investment.\n\nMost tellingly, Apple’s return on invested capital (ROIC) is currently sitting around 47% (5). That’s exactly the kind of capital efficiency that Buffett described as the hallmark of a great investment. It means for every dollar Apple reinvests into the business, it earns nearly half of it back in profit annually. That’s Buffett’s investing principle in full force.\nRobinhood offers a simple and convenient way to invest like Buffett in a wide variety of stocks, ETFs and options.\nThe platform provides commission-free investing in companies like Apple — meaning you won’t pay any extra fees to invest with Robinhood.

That jump stood out because overall phone shipments in China barely grew, rising just 1.9% to 30.16 million units. Foreign brands shipped about 6.93 million phones during the month, suggesting demand snapped back sharply after a weak stretch last year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nIs AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe rebound didn't come out of nowhere. In October, foreign-brand shipments totaled roughly 7.03 million units, up 13% year over year, pointing to improving momentum heading into year-end.\nChina's smartphone market remains brutally competitive, dominated by players like Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Xiaomi ( XIACF ), Huawei, Oppo, vivo, and Honor. the surge hints that foreign brands, especially Apple, may be regaining traction in China after a choppy year, something investors will be watching closely into 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Lukewarm AI Plays Can Catch Up in 2026\n\nJoey Frenette\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nQuick Read Apple stock gained only 12% in 2025 versus over 18% for the S&P 500.\nApple has spent significantly less on AI than its Magnificent Seven peers.\nA major Gemini-powered Siri update is scheduled for Spring 2026.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe heaviest hitters of the AI trade cooled off in the final quarter of 2025. As we breeze through Santa Claus rally season (it seems to be on the table this year), the big question is what's next for the AI trade. Undoubtedly, there's still a lot of nerves out there over the latest wave of volatility, which may very well be the start of a painful, drawn-out move lower.\nAs to whether we're in an AI bubble, though, remains a mystery. It'll probably be the big question going into the new year. With a recent wave of relief powering hard-hit AI stocks higher in the last few sessions, it seems like AI fears might be in an even bigger bubble than the AI stocks themselves.\nAI bubble or not, there's still value in big tech Either way, there's no denying that there are questionable valuation metrics on more than a handful of AI innovators. In short, we're closing off a great year with AI stocks and gold (as well as silver) on a high note, though things do seem to feel \"toppy,\" even though recent volatility has been shrugged off with the bull back in the driver's seat. At this juncture, I think it's a bit lazy to dismiss anything involved in the AI space as being a bubble.\n\nYou really don't have to look far for decent valuations across the stack. Whether you're interested in a \"pick and shovels\" kind of play with the GPU makers, or if you're more into the data center buildout, there are still somewhat reasonable prices of entry to be had, especially with the names that are still down a great deal from their prior highs.\nOf course, certain Magnificent Seven innovators may be some of the bigger, more obvious bargains in the AI scene today. And they might be skating to where the puck is going into 2026, as they invest in their own AI chip capabilities while looking to position themselves to profit from various emerging trends within AI.\nNotably, the productization of AI and the hyper-personalization of AI could both effectively monetize the technology. In this piece, we'll look at a \"lukewarm,\" underperforming mega-cap stock that's well-positioned to seize such opportunities in the new year.\n\nStory Continues\nApple Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) is up a rather unimpressive 12% on the year. It's an okay gain, but a market-tailing one nonetheless, with the S&P 500 up over 18%. Of course, shares of Apple have been a big winner if you bought at the post-Liberation Day lows. Still, Apple has not been all too magnificent, especially compared to some of its Mag Seven rivals, many of which investors would consider to be further along in AI.\n\nIn any case, Apple hasn't really spent as much on AI as its peers, which might make the shares a relative outperformer once those inevitable AI corrections (or worse) hit. In a prior piece, I went as far as to say that Apple stock would be spared, even rewarded, if an AI spending bubble were to let out some of its air. With shares tumbling close to 5% after briefly hitting new highs of $286 per share, it seems like Apple shareholders need more time to digest the latest run-up.\nThe stock doesn't appear cheap at more than 36.7 times trailing P/E. But, at the same time, 2026 has a ton to look forward to in AI (big Gemini-powered Siri update coming Spring 2026), new products (a home hub or wall tablet?), and beyond. Undoubtedly, it was mostly a boring, less eventful year for Apple in 2025, unless, of course, we're talking about the heated sales of the iPhone 17, which surprised many.\n\nCould Apple be the king of AI monetization? As we go into 2026 with strength in iPhone sales intact and shares in a 5% \"mini correction,\" I think there's a good setup to ring in the new year right. Personally, I'd look for that coming Siri update to serve as an example that AI can, in fact, lead to massive profits.\nFor Apple, it'll probably be in the form of device sales, as a significant product update cycle looks to play out in 2026. If Apple's AI sells while it keeps spending in check, perhaps Apple could rise as the king of AI monetization.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "QCOM Rides on Strength in Premium Handset Market: Will it Sustain?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n2454.TW\n\nAAPL\n\nSSNLF\n\nQualcomm Incorporated ( QCOM ) generated about $6.96 billion in handset revenues in the latest quarter, with a year-over-year increase of 14% and an estimated $27.8 billion in fiscal 2025, contributing roughly 63% of the total company’s revenues. Qualcomm’s strong handset revenues are driven by its increased customer demand for Snapdragon-powered premium Android smartphones.\n\nQualcomm faces strong competition from rivals like MediaTek, especially in mid-range and budget smartphones, which puts pressure on its market share and pricing. U.S.-China trade tensions have reduced companies' handset demand to a great extent. Qualcomm's handset business experienced ongoing challenges as global smartphone demand slowed down day by day. Moreover, major handset manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, are moving toward in-house chip development. This is a major challenge for Qualcomm.\nTo overcome challenges in the smartphone business, Qualcomm is focusing on premium Snapdragon chips to stay competitive in flagship devices. Qualcomm recently launched the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, offering high-speed performance, advanced AI, improved graphics, and enhanced camera capabilities for flagship smartphones from global brands like iQOO , Honor, ASUS, OnePlus, and Vivo.\n\nPer a report from Precedence Research, the global 5G chipset market is expected to reach $126.4 billion by 2030 from $18.7 billion in 2022, with a CAGR of 27%, indicating strong underlying growth potential for Qualcomm’s handset segment in the near future. QCOM’s continuous innovation in powering flagship devices with cutting-edge features helps to boost its handset revenues, maintain leadership in the premium segment, and drive future revenue growth.\nOther Tech Companies Focused on Handset Chip Development Qualcomm faces competition from Apple, Inc. ( AAPL ) and Broadcom, Inc. ( AVGO ). Apple recently launched the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and upgraded Vision Pro, all powered by their M5 chip. Apple’s iPhone 17 series uses the A19 chip, and the iPhone Air features the A19 Pro chip, both offering faster performance, better graphics, and advanced AI capabilities. These recent chips strengthen Apple’s position in the smartphone market and reduce its reliance on third-party suppliers.\n\nBroadcom recently launched Wi Fi 8 chips for smartphones and connected devices, improving speed, reliability, and efficiency. Broadcom, by providing essential smartphone components like Wi Fi, Bluetooth, and RF chips for major brands, remains important in the handset market. The company also focuses on affordable LTE chips for emerging markets, helping OEMs bring affordable smartphones to countries like India.\n\nStory Continues\nQCOM’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Qualcomm shares have gained 11.1% over the past year compared with the industry ’s growth of 35.3%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/earnings ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 14.26 forward earnings, lower than 34.54 for the industry.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 2% to $12.15 over the past 60 days, while those for 2026 have risen 3.4% to $12.60.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQualcomm stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Futures associated with the Dow were lower by nearly 0.2% in early trading, while those tied to the S&P 500 were fractionally lower. Futures tracking the Nasdaq crept higher. U.S. benchmark crude oil futures were at nearly $58.50 a barrel as the commodity stayed near two-week highs. Bitcoin traded at $88,600, higher than the $87,400 it hit on Wednesday. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a range of consumer loans, were at 4.14%, ticking higher from Wednesday’s levels.\n\nGold, Silver Extend Streak of Highs Gold and silver again touched record highs on Friday as the precious metals continued to see their prices rise. Gold futures were trading around $4543.50 an ounce after earlier pressing as high as $4561.60. Silver futures were at $75.67 an ounce recently after earlier reaching a new high of $75.84. Precious metals continued to add value in December, with silver rising by more than 27% this month and gold adding more than 6%. Silver has more than doubled in value this year, while gold is up by more than 70%. Investors have been pouring into the safe-haven assets as investors anticipate lower interest rates and central banks have been adding to their holdings.\n\nNvidia to Buy Assets from AI Startup Groq Nvidia ( NVDA ) has made a deal with artificial intelligence startup Groq, according to news reports and a post on the startup’s site. Groq in a statement said that Nvidia entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement for the startup’s inference technology.“The agreement reflects a shared focus on expanding access to high-performance, low cost inference,” it said. CNBC reported that the deal include an asset purchase worth $20 billion in cash, citing Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led a $750 million fundraising round for the startup.The move comes as AI stocks have been moving higher to end the year. Nvidia shares were higher by 0.6% in premarket trading.\n\nStory continues\nFederal Regulators Probe Tesla Door Release Issue The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it earlier this week opened an investigation into Tesla ( TSLA ) after it received a petition saying the mechanical door release for the 2022 Tesla Model 3 wasn’t easily accessible. “The petition cites allegations that the mechanical door release is hidden, unlabeled, and not intuitive to locate during an emergency,” the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation said. The issue is expected to affect about 179,000 vehicles. The NHTSA had opened other investigations into Tesla , including a probe on electronic door lock issues with a different model. Tesla shares ticked higher in premarket trading.\nNike Shares Continue Rise After Apple CEO Stock Purchase Nike ( NKE ) shares continued to rise in premarket trading after the athletic apparel maker helped lead stocks higher in Wednesday’s session. Nike shares gained 4.6% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook, a member of Nike's board, bought nearly $3 million worth of the company’s stock. Despite the surge, Nike shares are lower by 20% so far this year.

Nike (NKE) climbed over +4% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 and Dow after a regulatory filing revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook purchased 50,000 shares of the footwear maker. Also, some chip stocks advanced, with Micron Technology (MU) rising more than +3% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 and Lam Research (LRCX) gaining over +1%. In addition, Dynavax (DVAX) jumped more than +38% after Sanofi agreed to acquire the vaccine maker for about $2.2 billion. On the bearish side, Intel (INTC) fell about -0.5% after Reuters reported that Nvidia had paused a test of using Intel’s manufacturing process to make advanced chips.\n\nThe Labor Department’s report on Wednesday showed that the number of Americans filing for initial jobless claims in the past week fell by -10K to 214K, compared with the 224K expected.\nAs traders digested the latest economic data, they maintained their view that the Fed will deliver two quarter-point rate cuts next year. Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in an 84.5% probability of no rate change and a 15.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at January’s monetary policy meeting.\n“The stock market is finally starting to eke out some gains for December after a choppy few weeks, and just in time for the market’s Santa Claus rally, which we expect to take place in its typical format,” said Paul Stanley at Granite Bay Wealth Management.\nA Santa Claus rally refers to the consistent gains observed in the stock market over the final five trading days of December and the first two trading days of January. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has delivered an average return of 1.3%, posting gains 78% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.\n\nIn other news, China’s foreign ministry said on Friday it imposed sanctions on 10 individuals and 20 U.S. defense firms, including Boeing’s St. Louis unit, over arms sales to Taiwan. The measures freeze any assets the companies and individuals hold in China and prohibit domestic organizations and individuals from doing business with them.\n\nStory Continues\nThe U.S. economic data slate is empty on Friday.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.151%, up +0.51%.\nMost major markets in Europe remain closed today for holidays.\nAsian stock markets today closed in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.10%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.68%.\n\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index reversed earlier losses and closed higher today, extending its winning streak to eight sessions. Gold mining stocks outperformed on Friday as gold prices climbed to a new record high. Steel stocks also advanced after China said on Friday it will continue to regulate crude steel output and ban the addition of illegal new capacity from 2026 to 2030. At the same time, technology stocks retreated as investors took profits following recent strong gains. Meanwhile, the benchmark index logged its strongest week in two months, and analysts expect the upward momentum to continue, supported by a strengthening yuan. The yuan posted its strongest official close in 2-1/2 years on Thursday and hovered just shy of the psychologically important 7-per-dollar level on Friday. The currency appreciation “is expected to whet foreign appetite for yuan assets, push up valuations and increase interbank liquidity,” according to Huatai Securities. In other news, Goldman Sachs Research’s Xinquan Chen said China’s central bank has hinted at potential monetary easing in the months ahead, noting that the PBOC adopted a measured easing tone in its fourth-quarter MPC meeting’s statement. In corporate news, Sichuan Swellfun Co. fell over -1% after the spirits maker denied media reports of a potential takeover by a rival firm. Investors now look ahead to China’s November industrial profits data, scheduled for release on Saturday, which will provide insight into how companies are coping with excess-capacity pressures.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher today, led by gains in technology and healthcare stocks. The benchmark index notched a second consecutive weekly gain. Government data released on Friday showed that core consumer inflation in Japan’s capital eased in December as food cost pressures moderated, but remained above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target, keeping the central bank on course for further monetary tightening. The data supports the BOJ’s view that core inflation will dip below its 2% target in the coming months as cost pressures ease, before picking up again in a more demand-driven manner that would justify further rate hikes. The BOJ is expected to raise rates in July and December of 2026, according to a research note from two members of Barclays’ FICC Research. Separate data showed that Japan’s monthly industrial output fell more than expected in November amid the continued drag from U.S. tariffs, though companies expect output to rebound soon. In addition, data showed that retail sales growth slowed in November but was roughly in line with expectations. Meanwhile, Japan’s cabinet on Friday approved a record initial budget of about $785 billion for the next fiscal year, seeking to balance Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s proactive fiscal stance with concerns over ballooning debt by capping new bond issuance. New government bond issuance will increase only marginally from this year’s 28.6 trillion yen to 29.6 trillion yen. Notably, Japan’s finance ministry will issue the smallest amount of super-long government bonds in 17 years in the next fiscal year. The issuance plan helped push super-long JGB yields lower on Friday. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +15.98% to 21.77.\n\nThe Japanese December Tokyo Core CPI rose +2.3% y/y, weaker than expectations of +2.5% y/y.\nThe Japanese November Industrial Production (preliminary) fell -2.6% m/m, weaker than expectations of -1.9% m/m.\nThe Japanese November Retail Sales rose +1.0% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.9% y/y.\nThe Japanese November Unemployment Rate was 2.6%, in line with expectations.\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nNvidia (NVDA) rose about +0.7% in pre-market trading after agreeing to a licensing deal with AI startup Groq.\nChip stocks are edging higher in pre-market trading. Micron Technology (MU) is up over +1%, and ON Semiconductor (ON) is up about +0.5%.\nGold mining stocks advanced in pre-market trading after gold prices climbed to a record high, with Freeport-McMoran (FCX) rising over +3% and Newmont (NEM) gaining more than +1%.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) climbed more than +5% in pre-market trading after the South Korean e-commerce company said all customer data leaked in the breach had been deleted by the suspect.\nBiohaven (BHVN) plunged over -14% in pre-market trading after its experimental treatment for depression failed to achieve the primary endpoint in a mid-stage study.\nYou can see more pre-market stock movers here\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Friday - December 26th\nNone.\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is one of the best performers on Wednesday.\nNike Inc. jumped by 4.64 percent on Wednesday to close at $60 apiece after an Apple executive nearly doubled his stake in the company.\nIn a regulatory filing, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) said that Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., acquired $2.9 million worth of new shares in the company.\n\nCook is currently an independent director and now owns a little more than 105,000 shares in Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE).\nThe purchase reflected strong confidence in the stock, despite posting dismal earnings performance in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and posting lower sales guidance for the next quarter.\nIn the second quarter, the athletic fashion maker said that net income declined by 32 percent to $792 million from $1.16 billion in the same period last year.\nRevenues were flat at $12 billion due to sales declines in China, Asia Pacific, and Latin America, which were primarily offset by growth in the North American region.\nRegions with a high quality of life, including safety and healthcare, often become a magnet for new residents.\nLooking ahead, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) expects revenues for the third quarter to drop by low single digits, falling below analyst expectations of modest growth, on expectations that its operations in China, alongside higher tariffs, would continue to dampen sales.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NKE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "Italian Competition Authority fines Apple EUR 98M over app tracking\n\nTipRanks\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:25 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nThe Italian Competition Authority has issued a EUR 98M fine to Apple ( AAPL ) over ‘abuse of a dominant position’. The agency said, “The Authority found the App Tracking Transparency policy to restrict competition. The policy lays down the privacy rules imposed by the company on third-party developers of apps offered on the App Store. The Italian Competition Authority has imposed a 98,635,416.67 euro fine on Apple, Apple Distribution International and Apple Italia for abuse of a dominant position. Apple breached article 102 of the TFEU in the market for the supply to developers of platforms for the online distribution of apps to iOS users. In this market, Apple holds a super-dominant position through its App Store. The Authority conducted a complex investigation in coordination with the European Commission, other national competition authorities and the Italian Data Protection Authority. The Authority’s findings confirmed the restrictive nature – from a competition-law perspective – of the App Tracking Transparency policy, i.e. the privacy rules imposed by Apple for iOS devices, as of April 2021, on third-party developers of apps distributed through the App Store. In particular, third-party app developers are required to obtain specific consent for the collection and linking of data for advertising purposes through Apple’s ATT prompt. However, such prompt does not meet privacy legislation requirements, forcing developers to double the consent request for the same purpose. The Authority established that the terms of the ATT policy are imposed unilaterally and harm the interests of Apple’s commercial partners. The terms were also found to be disproportionate to the achievement of the company’s stated data protection objectives. Since user data are a key input for personalised online advertising, the double consent request that inevitably arises from the ATT policy, as implemented, restricts the collection, linking and use of such data. As a result, such double consent requirement is harmful to developers, whose business model relies on the sale of advertising space, as well as to advertisers and advertising intermediation platforms.”\n\nClaim 70% Off TipRanks This Holiday Season Unlock hedge fund-level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

      "Content": "Billionaires Are Buying an AI Stock That Could Be the Apple of the 2030s\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Meta recently debuted its first pair of augmented reality smart glasses, a stepping stone along a roadmap that leads to fully-immersive glasses powered by superintelligence.\nJust as smartphones have replaced personal computers for many tasks, Mark Zuckerberg says smart glasses will displace smartphones as our primary computing devices in the future.\nMeta dominates the nascent smart glasses market, and it could become a consumer electronics giant if it successfully integrates its devices with a superintelligence system.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) revolutionized mobile computing when it launched the first iPhone in 2007. Since then, smartphones have gradually become our primary computing devices, but it stands to reason that another technology could eventually fill that role.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is betting on smart glasses. The company currently earns the vast majority of its money by selling targeted ads across its social media properties. But smart glasses developed by its Reality Labs business unit could eventually become a major source of revenue, especially with assistance from its Superintelligence Labs unit.\nThe following hedge fund billionaires, all of whom outperformed the S&P 500 over the past three years, bought shares of Meta Platforms in the third quarter.\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management added 793,500 shares. Meta Platforms is his eighth-largest holding, excluding options.\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors added 1.4 million shares. Meta Platforms is his fourth-largest holding, excluding options.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management added 355,900 shares. Meta Platforms is his largest holding.\nHere's what investors should know.\nWhy Meta Platforms could be the Apple of the 2030s In September, Meta Platforms launched its first augmented reality (AR) smart glasses, which feature a built-in display on the right lens. The glasses, called Meta Ray-Ban Display, also integrate the artificial intelligence assistant Meta AI. While analysts do not anticipate earthshaking sales, they do see the product as an important stepping stone toward the Orion glasses.\n\nMeta first announced Orion in 2024 and is reportedly working toward a product launch in 2027. Orion smart glasses will have a built-in display on both lenses, creating a true holographic experience that blends the digital and physical worlds. Meta eventually plans to pair Orion with a superintelligence system, an AI assistant that surpasses human intelligence and can teach itself.\n\"Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote earlier this year. \"Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices.\"\n\nStory Continues\nZuckerberg does not mean we will abandon smartphones in the future. Instead, he thinks AR smart glasses (paired with superintelligence) will be our go-to devices. For instance, personal computers are still very useful, but smartphones have replaced them for various tasks. Zuckerberg thinks smart glasses will displace smartphones in much the same way.\n\nImportantly, Meta has been investing in smart glasses for years, and Zuckerberg says the company is \"several years ahead\" of its closest competitors. Indeed, Meta accounted for 73% of smart glasses shipments in the first half of 2025, up from 66% in the second half of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research.\nIf everything comes together as Zuckerberg expects -- meaning AI smart glasses become our primary computing devices, and Meta maintains its leadership position in the market -- Orion could be as successful as the iPhone, if not more so. In that scenario, Meta could become the Apple of the 2030s as it evolves into a consumer electronics giant.\nWhy Meta Platforms stock is worth buying today In the near term, the investment thesis for Meta Platforms centers on its status as the second-largest ad tech company, a position derived from its dominance in social media. Facebook and Instagram generate consumer data on a large scale, creating a network effect that makes Meta's content recommendation and ad targeting engines increasingly effective over time.\n\nMeta Platforms has invested in artificial intelligence to reinforce that network effect. New AI-powered recommendation and ranking systems are deepening user engagement and improving ad conversion rates (i.e., more clicks) by showing people more relevant content across its social media properties. Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan writes, \"Meta is a digital advertising juggernaut poised to increase its market share.\"\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842.50 per share. That implies 26% upside from its current share price of $665.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "If You'd Invested $10,000 in Verizon Communications 10 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:53 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: VZ\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points A $10,000 Verizon investment in 2015 would be worth just $14,650 today, badly trailing the S&P 500.\nThe same investment made in 2005 grew to $27,400 by 2015, beating the market.\nThe stock may suit dividend-focused income investors, but long-term growth seekers should look elsewhere.\n10 stocks we like better than Verizon Communications ›\n\nBear with me for a second; I'd like to start this overview with a quick history lesson.\nVerizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) was a hot tamale in 2015. The telecom giant was on a hot streak in the early days of the smartphone era. If you had invested $10,000 in Verizon stock near the end of 2005, activated the dividend reinvestment program (DRIP), and left it alone for the next 10 years, you'd have a market-beating $27,400 in your pocket.\nThe good old days are over But the smartphone frenzy slowed down over the years, though Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) managed to build one of the world's largest market caps around the iPhone.\nVerizon's soaring sales growth cooled off. Smaller rival T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) stole millions of Verizon's mobile subscribers. The company continued to generate impressive cash flows despite several rounds of expensive network infrastructure upgrades .\n\nBut the old magic was gone. If you started a new $10,000 Verizon investment on Dec. 22, 2015, you'd have $4,650 in total returns today for a total value of $14,650. That's better than sticking the cash under your pillow for a decade, but far behind the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) posting a $40,220 total-return value over the same span.\nSo, should you buy Verizon today? Verizon remains a solid dividend stock, fueled by generous cash flows. The dividend yield stands at 6.9% today -- one of the 10 highest yields in the S&P 500.\nTherefore, the stock may make sense for dividend-hungry income investors, but it seems unable to maintain its value over the long haul. Perhaps I'll change my tune in a couple of decades, as retirement approaches, but I'm not buying Verizon stock today.

Find out which 37 stocks are leading the charge .\nApple Investment Narrative Recap To own Apple, you need to believe its ecosystem can keep turning a mature iPhone base into steadily growing, high‑margin services and software income. The biggest near term catalyst is how effectively Apple layers AI features like SHARP 3D imaging across hardware and services, while the key risk is mounting regulatory pressure on its App Store model. The new iOS openings in Japan and Brazil appear meaningful symbolically but do not yet transform the overall investment case.\n\nThe Brazilian settlement that opens iOS to third party app stores and alternative payments sits at the heart of that risk. It directly touches Apple’s most profitable Services revenue stream while testing whether the company can defend its security and privacy pitch as regulators push for more competition. How Apple balances compliance with preserving App Store economics will be central to how investors assess its next phase of AI and services driven growth.\nYet behind the AI headlines, investors should be aware that escalating app store regulation could...\nRead the full narrative on Apple (it's free!)\nApple's narrative projects $477.4 billion revenue and $133.6 billion earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "Stock Market Today: 'Santa Rally' Brings New Records for Dow and S&P 500 On Christmas Eve\n\nNoah Weidner\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:23 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nThis live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market. To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here .\nHappy Wednesday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Dec. 24, 2025. This post recaps the market day after the abbreviated holiday session.\n\nUpdate: 1:00 p.m ET Closing Bell The U.S. market is now closed. The market is shut early for Christmas Eve, but it still managed to hand bulls one more present ahead of the holiday: green, green, green.\n\nThe Dow (+0.60%) led among major indexes as 28 of the index's 30 components rose today; one declined and one was flat. Nike Inc. (+5.1%) saw the largest strides as Apple CEO Tim Cook bought shares in the beleaguered footwear giant. The index set a new record today at 48,731.16.\n\nThe S&P 500 (+0.32%) set a record close of its own, closing out the market at 6,932.05. Only 111 of the index's components were in decline today, with a wide variety of firms pitching in to lift the index -- and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (+0.22%).\n\nRounding out the pack, the Russell 2000 (+0.20%) closed out the day by reversing some of yesterday's declines. The small cap index fell yesterday amid worries that fast GDP growth could derail hopes for the Fed's 2026 rate cuts.\n\nThe market will be shut tomorrow to observe Christmas Day. However, here are some of the more consequential events and insights that marked today's abbreviated trading session:\nToday's Movers & Shakers Among firms with at least a $2 billion market cap , Edgewise Therapeutics (+25.2%) was the best-performing stock on the U.S. markets today, lifted by news that it completed a phase two trial for its clinical-stage heart disease drug. It was joined by a field of healthcare and technology names, including Travere Therapeutics (+13.9%), UiPath (+7.5%), and others.\nOn the other end of the market, some of the excesses of the retail trade fell back to Earth on Wednesday. AST SpaceMobile (-8.6%), Hycroft Mining (-8%), and D-Wave Quantum (-5.5%) led up a list of equities which have made our midday movers list in recent days, largely due to a bump in excitement around space, mining, quantum computing, and other popular trades.\nEconomic Data + Events Before peacing out for the Christmas holiday, investors were also treated to a small handful of economic readouts to close out the week in data.\nChief among them were jobless claims for last week. They were bifurcated, as they have been as of late: While initial claims declined (+214K, down from +224K in the previous week), continuing claims rose (+1.923 million, up from +1.885 million).\n\nStory Continues\nHere is a short digest of today's economic data:\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 24, 2025, where it first appeared in the Latest Business & Market News section.

      "Content": "1 Top Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist Before the Nasdaq Soars Higher in 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^IXIC\n\nKey Points Tech stocks have performed well in 2025, and Apple has benefited from this broader rally, thanks to the strong demand for its latest iPhones and the improving services business.\nApple's top-line growth is poised to accelerate in 2026.\nA massive installed base of users on older iPhones can help Apple outgrow the broader smartphone market in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nTechnology stocks have delivered a resilient performance in 2025, which is evident from the 21% jump in the Nasdaq Composite index this year as of this writing. I call the sector's performance resilient because tech stocks have been under stress at certain times this year owing to various factors.\nFrom the potential fallout of the Trump administration's tariffs to concerns about heavy artificial intelligence (AI) spending turning into a bubble, there have been times when investors have panicked and hit the sell button. However, the strong growth that tech companies have been reporting this year has helped them overcome the negatives.\nThe good part is that the strong spending on AI infrastructure is set to drive the stock market higher over the next couple of years. According to JPMorgan, the S&P 500 index's average earnings growth could be between 13% and 15% for \"at least the next two years,\" thanks to the \"AI supercycle.\" As a result, it won't be surprising to see Nasdaq stocks jumping higher in the new year.\nHere's a closer look at an important Nasdaq stock that can ride the broader market's rally and deliver solid gains to investors.\nThis tech giant could do better than the industry it operates in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has rallied impressively in recent months, jumping 58% since hitting a 52-week low in the first week of April. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock's impressive rise can be attributed to the healthy demand for its latest iPhones and the improving traction of the services business.\n\nApple ended its latest fiscal year 2025 (ended on Sept. 27) with $416.1 billion in revenue, up by 6.4% from the prior year. Earnings increased by 23% from the prior year to $7.46 per share. Analysts are expecting its top-line growth to accelerate to almost 9% in the current fiscal year to just over $453.1 billion.\nYou may be surprised to see that analysts are upbeat about Apple's prospects in a year when the high cost of smartphone memory chips is likely to weigh on the industry. Memory manufacturers are scrambling to meet the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips deployed in data centers, which is why they are allocating more capacity to this niche.\n\nStory Continues\nAs a result, the shortage of smartphone memory chips could lead to a 7% increase in smartphone prices next year, according to Counterpoint Research. The research firm estimates that smartphone shipments could decline by 2.1% next year. Apple, however, is expected to grow despite these headwinds. It is easy to see why that's the case.\n\nApple was the second-largest player in the global smartphone market with a share of 18.2% at the end of the third quarter, which means that it has both scale and purchasing power on its side. This gives Apple the ability to negotiate favorable prices with component suppliers. Additionally, the cheapest iPhone that Apple sells is priced at $599, which is higher than the average smartphone average selling price (ASP) of $465.\nSo, Apple can absorb the potential price increases and continue to maintain its healthy share of the smartphone market. Throw in the fact that the company's latest iPhone 17 models are experiencing healthier demand than last year's lineup, thanks to a huge installed base of users on older devices, and it is easy to see why Apple is likely to outperform the broader smartphone market in 2026.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush estimates that more than 315 million iPhones are at least four years old. Apple is expected to ship 234 million iPhone units this year. The number of users in an upgrade window indicates that it could witness a substantial jump in its shipments in 2026. Moreover, Apple is expected to launch a foldable smartphone next year, a move that could give it a nice shot in the arm.\nThe foldable smartphone market is poised to grow by 30% next year, according to IDC. Apple, therefore, will be making a smart move by diving into this space since a foldable phone can contribute toward a bigger jump in its revenue than what analysts are estimating.\nApple's impressive rally is set to continue in 2026 Apple trades at 9.8 times sales right now. That isn't very expensive as compared to the U.S. technology sector's price-to-sales ratio of 8.6. Importantly, Apple can sustain the slight valuation premium next year as well, considering the potential acceleration in growth.\nLet's say Apple's top line grows by 10% next year to $458 billion and it trades at 10 times sales. Its market cap could hit $4.6 trillion. That would be a 14% increase from its current market cap. However, Apple's ability to outperform the market's growth expectations thanks to the catalysts discussed above could help it easily deliver bigger gains, which is why buying this Nasdaq stock hand over fist looks like the smart thing to do right now.\n\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Nike shares jump after Apple CEO Cook doubles stake to $6 million\n\nReuters Videos\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:50 AM PST\n\nIn this video: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nSTORY: EDITORS PLEASE NOTE: A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS REPORT PUT THE WORTH OF TIM COOK'S SHARES IN NIKE AT $6 BILLION, WHEN THEY ARE VALUED AT $6 MILLION. THIS VERSION HAS BEEN AMENDED TO REFLECT THE CORRECT FIGURE. Nike shares climbed about 5.5% in Wednesday morning trading after Apple CEO Tim Cook doubled his personal stake in the sportswear giant. That's according to a regulatory filing. Cook sits on Nike's board and now owns about $6 million worth of stock. The purchase appears to be a vote of confidence in the turnaround efforts of Nike CEO Elliot Hill. It comes days after the company reported weaker quarterly margins and weak sales in China. That's despite Hill's attempt to lift demand with fresh marketing plans and innovation focused on running and sports while phasing out lagging lifestyle brands. The CEO has also tried to mend ties with wholesalers like Dick's Sporting Goods... to try and put the brand in front of shoppers as competition heats up with rivals. However, Hill's plan is putting strain on Nike's margins, now in decline for over a year, and its efforts to get back on top in China are faltering. Nike's shares have slumped nearly 13% since it reported results on December 18 and are on track for the fourth straight year of declines.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Apple's Tim Cook Drove Nike Stock Higher Today\n\nHoward Smith, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:29 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Apple's Tim Cook nearly doubled his stake in Nike.\nThat vote of confidence has investors thinking Nike stock has bottomed.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\nNike (NYSE: NKE) shares surged on this holiday-shortened trading day. It might not be for a reason you would think, though. The global footwear and apparel maker has had a rough year. Even amid great overall market returns, Nike shares have plunged 20% this year.\n\nMost recently, the shares dropped sharply after the company reported fiscal 2026 second-quarter results. But shares are popping today after lead independent director, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, just nearly doubled his stake in Nike with a purchase of 50,000 shares.\nAfter rising as much as 5.6% this morning, Nike shares closed today higher by 4.7%.\nIs Tim Cook calling a bottom? Nike recently reported a mixed quarter, but investors were spooked by a significant 17% drop in its China sales. That sent Nike shares sharply lower after the report, closing near a 52-week low. A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing yesterday showed Nike's lead independent director -- and Apple CEO -- Tim Cook scooped up shares on the dip.\n\nCook purchased 50,000 shares, bringing his total direct holdings to 105,480 shares, valued at approximately $6.3 million.\nThat vote of confidence has also prompted investors to jump into Nike stock today. There are also fundamental reasons to like Nike stock. While China sales slumped last quarter, sales in North America jumped 9%, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), revenue increased 3%.\nIt's not surprising to see some investors following Tim Cook's lead, thinking Nike is in the early stages of a turnaround that could make the stock a market-beater in the coming months.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nike right now? Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

( AAPL , Financials ) has agreed to open its iOS ecosystem in Brazil , allowing third-party app stores and alternative payment methods as part of a settlement with the country's antitrust regulator.\nIs AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nBrazilian competition body CADE said its internal panel accepted Apple's proposal, ending a three-year dispute. Apple will allow developers to connect to other websites and utilize outside payment methods for in-app sales under the arrangement.\nOnce developers must comply, the modifications will take effect. CADE gave Apple 105 days to comply with the new standards or risk a 150 million reais ($27 million) penalties. The deal lasts three years.\nApple will comply with the judgment but warned that exposing iOS to outside app stores and payment systems might compromise user privacy and security. Though it cannot remove such dangers, the corporation has taken efforts to mitigate them.\nA 2022 lawsuit from MercadoLibre charged Apple of hindering competition in digital goods delivery and payments on iOS devices. MercadoLibre applauded the verdict but said it only partly addressed the need for more equitable guidelines.\nInvestors will see whether comparable regulatory pressure extends to other places, possibly changing Apple's App Store strategy.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

That's according to a regulatory filing. Cook sits on Nike's board and now owns about $6 billion worth of stock. The purchase appears to be a vote of confidence in the turnaround efforts of Nike CEO Elliot Hill. It comes days after the company reported weaker quarterly margins and weak sales in China. That's despite Hill's attempt to lift demand with fresh marketing plans and innovation focused on running and sports while phasing out lagging lifestyle brands. The CEO has also tried to mend ties with wholesalers like Dick's Sporting Goods... to try and put the brand in front of shoppers as competition heats up with rivals. However, Hill's plan is putting strain on Nike's margins, now in decline for over a year, and its efforts to get back on top in China are faltering. Nike's shares have slumped nearly 13% since it reported results on December 18 and are on track for the fourth straight year of declines.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Apple CEO Tim Cook\n\nAaron Rennie\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:39 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Takeaways Shares of Nike rose Wednesday, helped by news of a buy from Apple CEO Tim Cook, a member of the company's board.\nCook bought at average prices near $59, well below Wall Street analysts' consensus price target around $80.\nA vote of confidence from the leader of one big brand is helping the shares of another today.\n\nShares of Nike ( NKE ) climbed on Wednesday's holiday-shortened trading session —the shares were recently up about 4.5%, leading all gainers on the S&P 500—following an expression of support from Apple CEO Tim Cook.\nWhy This Matters to Investors As a general rule, investors sell shares when they think they have better uses for the money—and those reasons can be hard to divine. The other side of that coin is that investors only buy shares when they think they're poised to rise. That's why watching the trades of people associated with a particular company is part of many investors' strategies.\n\nA regulatory filing revealed that Cook, a member of Nike's board for two decades, bought nearly $3 million worth of Nike stock on Monday, acquiring 50,000 shares—a rough doubling of his stake—at a weighted average price of $58.97, not far off Friday's close.\nEven with today's surge, Nike shares have lost about 20% of their value this year. The company is about a year into a turnaround launched by CEO Elliot Hill, and while management believes it's made substantial progress investors are still wary .\nWhatever investors may think of the shares, Wall Street analysts are generally positive. The mean price target as tracked by Visible Alpha is around $80, substantially above recent prices closer to $60.\n\"We think consensus estimates are bottoming and see several catalysts that could drive healthier growth,\" Bank of America analysts wrote recently. \"We expect gradual progress on innovation will begin to offset the sell down of older styles.\"\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

According to a Form 4 filing released late Tuesday, Cook bought 50,000 shares on Monday at an average price of $58.97, investing close to $3 million after Nike's results for its second fiscal quarter unsettled investors.

The decision gives a boost to the administration’s campaign to restrict immigration and push demand for US workers. The US Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the proposal, can appeal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nHowell rejected the Chamber’s argument that Trump doesn’t have the power to impose the fee, finding that his proclamation was issued under “an express statutory grant of authority to the President.”\nCongress has given the president broad authority that he used to address “in the manner he sees fit, a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security,” she wrote.\nDaryl Joseffer, the Chamber’s executive vice president, said in a statement the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive.\n“We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations,” Joseffer said.\n\nThe Chamber, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, argued in its October lawsuit that raising the fee is unlawful because it overrides federal immigration law and exceeds the fee-setting authority afforded by Congress.\nA group of 19 state attorneys general also is challenging Trump’s proclamation. Their lawsuit focuses on the projected impact to the public sector, particularly in the fields of health care and education, that also rely on the H-1B visa program. A separate suit was filed by a global nurse-staffing agency.\nThe ruling Tuesday, a so-called summary judgment that doesn’t require a trial, doesn’t have an impact on the other lawsuits, meaning another judge could still block the new visa fee in the months to come. The other cases include a suit filed in Massachusetts earlier this month by more than a dozen mostly Democratic-led states, as well as a suit filed in October in California by a global nurse-staffing agency and several unions.\nBoth of the other cases are also being handled by Obama appointees, and neither judge has yet ruled on any requests for injunctions against the rule. A hearing in the California case is set for Feb. 12 in Oakland. The dispute is likely to ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court.\n\nStory Continues\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of employment-based immigration, allowing companies in the US to hire college-educated foreign workers for specialized occupations. In September, Trump signed a proclamation to increase the application fee to discourage companies from abusing a program that he claimed displaces US workers.\n\nIt’s a stark shift from America’s historical stance toward immigration. Since its founding, the US has welcomed people from diverse countries and economic backgrounds who come to the US in search of a better life and more freedom.\nYet while Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have mused about the prospects of a windfall for the US Treasury that could total $100 billion or more, immigration attorneys have cautioned that an increase in cost of this magnitude would cause major disruptions that would be likely very expensive to the US economy.\n“This puts a chilling effect on America’s employers,” said Michael Wildes, a managing partner at the New York-based immigration law firm Wildes and Weinberg PC. “How can you make America great by taking away the talent pool?” Wildes noted that “it’s a limiting law in that America will skip a beat. There will be a generation of talent out there in the world that will go to other countries. We will be missing an opportunity and that is foolhardy.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said it will replace the lottery for choosing H-1B visa applicants with a weighted selection to overcome wage arbitrage and incentivize American employers “to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers.” There are also proposals being considered to impose a wage floor.\nH-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but are used primarily in the tech industry. Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. are among the companies with the greatest number of H-1B visas, according to the US government.\nThe visa fees will shape hiring efforts, but affect some jobs and companies more than others, said Alexis DuFresne, founder of recruiting firm Archer Search Partners, which specializes in recruitment for alternative financial asset managers.\n\nFor “superstars” in highly-paid, specialized roles, or for jobs that generate a lot of revenue, organizations will be willing to pay the $100,000 fee, she said.\nBut the high cost will change how people making hiring decisions approach looking for employees in more run-of-the-mill jobs, DuFresne said. “If you’re going to search, you’re going to tell the search people ‘Don’t look globally for me. Look domestically for me,’” she said of such common jobs.\nLikewise, organizations with offices around the world will be able to respond to the recruitment costs by shifting where they hire, according to DuFresne. “The firms that it’s going to affect the most are the smaller firms,” she said.\nThe tech industry has been adapting to changes in US immigration rules for a while now as political currents shift.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google is taking steps to help move employees off of H-1B visas and onto more permanent status. The company recently told staff it will be “ramping up” PERM applications next year for eligible employees, Business Insider reported, taking a crucial step to securing a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\nBeyond the US tech companies, the action also hits India hard, as Indians have been the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In addition to the extra costs that Indian IT companies will bear for thousands of employees on such visas, the ongoing unpredictability has unnerved many Indian professionals working in US tech, finance, health care and other industries, especially after the recent mass postponement of work-visa appointments.\n\nThe case is Chamber of Commerce vs. US Department of Homeland Security, 25-cv-03675, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).\n--With assistance from Jake Bleiberg, Erik Larson and Patrick Howell O'Neill.\n(Updates with expert comments in 14th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Based on comments he has made, a tech stock he would've liked to have bought is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- and there's a surprising reason why he didn't.\nWhy Warren Buffett never invested in Microsoft Microsoft has been one of the largest companies in the world for decades. At Berkshire's 2018 annual meeting, an audience member asked Buffett why he never bought shares, especially considering Berkshire's investments in Apple .\nHe answered that in the earlier years, he simply missed out (in his own words, \"the answer's stupidity\"). Buffett's investment strategy is to only invest in what you understand, and he has been selective with tech businesses.\n\nHowever, Buffett also explained that \"it would just be a mistake for Berkshire to buy Microsoft\" because of his friendship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who also served on Berkshire's board of directors. If Berkshire invested in Microsoft before a better-than-expected earnings report or any other positive news, outside observers might speculate that Gates had shared information with Buffett.\nMicrosoft would've been a great stock for Berkshire's portfolio, as it's up 798% over the last 10 years (as of Dec. 18). The S&P 500 has appreciated 241% over the same time period. Along with outperforming the market, Microsoft has also delivered six consecutive quarters of revenue growth, in part because of its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.\n\nFor Buffett, it was more important to avoid the appearance of impropriety than to invest in Microsoft.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

Users can register with an email address or log in directly through Apple accounts, then bind international bank cards including UnionPay, Visa, and Mastercard issued outside China's mainland. The app displays real-time exchange rates for over 160 currencies.\nFor online payments, \"Nihao China\" connects to over 300 platforms spanning train tickets via 12306, food delivery through Meituan and Ele.me (Taobao Shangou), hotel bookings on Ctrip, and shopping on JD.com.\nFor in-store scenarios, the app integrates UnionPay, Alipay, and WeChat Pay acceptance networks, allowing users to scan all QR codes with one app in over 1,000 service scenarios.\nThe app also facilitates tax refunds in major cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with plans to gradually expand the service to cover all tax refund scenarios for international visitors across China, delivering a more efficient and convenient refund experience.\n\nSeamless Mobility Across China\nThe app covers metro systems in 43 major Chinese cities and public bus networks across over 1,760 county-level regions, creating a rail-plus-bus payment network. No need to purchase separate transit cards—simply tap and go.\nThe English map helps to locate nearby ATMs, currency exchange points, and other essential services based on your location.\nSmart Tools, Zero Language Barriers\nReal-time translation supports Chinese-English conversation, with smart recognition added for Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Russian. In-app page translation ensures smooth navigation in your native language.\nThe app's smart assistant goes beyond translation, answering questions about attractions, transportation, and dining while providing customized route planning that combines public transit, walking, and other travel modes.\n\nUpcoming Enhancements and Service Expansion\nThe app will continue to evolve with upcoming features including integrated visa services such as application guidance, appointment booking, and status tracking; virtual SIM card activation for instant mobile data upon arrival; and one-tap reservations for popular museums and scenic spots including the National Museum of China.\n\nStory Continues\nBuilding a More Inclusive Payment Ecosystem for International Travelers\nBeyond the \"Nihao China\" app, to date, over 200 million UnionPay cards and over 200 UnionPay-partner wallets issued outside China's mainland could pay seamlessly across 183 countries and regions worldwide, especially in China.\n\nIn addition, UnionPay has introduced over 10 million SplendorPlus Cards with 59 issuers in 20 international markets, offering benefits across five categories of selected merchants, including airport VIP lounges, transportation, tourist attractions, culture, arts and cuisine for those who travel, study, or work in China.\nUnionPay remains committed to improving its acceptance network, products, and services to create a more user-friendly and secure payment experience for international visitors.\n\nView original content: https://www.prnewswire.com/apac/news-releases/nihao-china-app-launches-as-an-all-in-one-solution-for-international-visitors-302649202.html\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Here's what could be in store in 2026\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:40 PM PST\n\nIn this video: AAPL\n\n2025 was a big year for Apple ( AAPL ). Investors experienced some angst early in the year when concerns arose that the tech giant might be missing out on the AI revolution. However, new product launches and some AI features were enough to send the stock to new highs toward the end of the year.\nYahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley takes a look at Apple's wild ride and what may lie ahead in 2026 .\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Josh\n2025 turned out to be quite the milestone year for Apple, and despite some turbulence, the tech giant has set itself up for its biggest change in years. Yahoo Finances's Dan Howley joins us now with more. Dan.\n00:10 Dan Howley\nThat's right, Josh. This is a huge year for Apple. Not only did they post record revenue, uh they sold their newest iPhone, seeing huge numbers as far as sales go uh so far. And oh yeah, they hit a $4 trillion dollar market cap. The only other company to do that, Nvidia. Uh and they're, you know, kind of playing a little closer to Nvidia now than when Nvidia was at $5 trillion. Um, but what's a trillion between friends, really. Uh, some of the things that the company did though really didn't have to do with one of the biggest issues that they have, AI. Uh that seems to be pushed off until next year. They did have their head of AI retire. They're bringing in more folks. Uh they did see a number of other C suite retirements, whether that was uh their legal counsel or their head of government affairs. And it seems as though for the most part, what this is doing as far as the year goes is teeing up for a post Tim Cook Apple. Now, there was that Financial Times report uh a month ago, basically saying that Cook was ready to retire sometime in early 2026. Then Bloomberg's Mark German said that's not exactly the case. Uh regardless, he is approaching retirement age. Uh and so the company is clearly thinking about what that would look like. And so they've reportedly been grooming John Ternus, one of their uh VPs of hardware engineering to be the the next CEO. He's the top contender, doesn't necessarily mean he will absolutely be the next CEO, but he's being kind of groomed for that position and really Apple kind of giving us a a sense of, you know, this is going to be a uh transition, uh transitional era and this is how we're going to handle it. kind of piecemeal. as people kind of take off, we'll fill in those slots. Uh but it won't be kind of uh all at once approach. And you know, for for a company like Apple that's remarkably stable despite being so large, it can feel a little odd seeing so many departures uh at once or or throughout the year, but the experts that I spoke to say, this is really the best course of action for this company.\n02:18 Josh\nLet me ask you, Dan, you know, Apple's engine is still the iPhone. You know, in 2026, what do you think innovation is going to look like there? You know, what can we expect? You know, is it, is it form factor changes? Is it foldables or revamped Siri? Like what do you think next year Tim Cook has to introduce to keep that engine humming?\n02:44 Dan Howley\nYeah, I mean, the the big rumor is that there will be a foldable iPhone for 2026. and kind of the iPhone Air was seen as kind of teeing that up. Uh you know, showing off that they could put their uh the goods inside of a smaller package. Uh you know, there's been different reports saying that the Air hasn't sold as well as, you know, the Pro or the Pro Max or the base 17, which is a remarkably good phone for the price. Uh but it appears as though that that is what the Air was, kind of a an appetizer almost and the the foldable will be the main course. Now, there's been obviously Samsung with their own foldable phones over time. They have their Fold 7, which is an incredible phone for what you get. It is priced relatively high. Uh and you can imagine that a foldable iPhone would probably have the same kind of price premium. So, you know, for the iPhone itself, that's kind of what we're looking for in 2026.\n03:42 Josh\nDan, great to have you as always. Thank you, sir.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Apple spent 2025 setting itself up for the future — and its biggest moves weren't about AI\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nSSNLF\n\nIt’s been quite a year for Apple ( AAPL ). The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ).\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta ( META ) Reality Labs' new design studio .\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times , Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\nCook is steering a $4 trillion behemoth Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nStory Continues\nCook's decisions drove Apple's stock price ever higher. As a result, the company's market cap has increased from $1 trillion in 2018 to a whopping $4 trillion in 2025.\nRevenue has also continued its steady upward pace, with Apple reporting $416 billion in total sales for its fiscal 2025, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nApple is also reportedly preparing some of the biggest changes in years to its iPhone lineup in 2026. According to Gurman , the company will roll out a foldable iPhone, a first for Apple, in the latter half of the year.\n\nThat could help further goose already record iPhone sales. Apple is also reportedly preparing a new low-cost MacBook model, which would open up the company to a broader customer segment.\nAnd while it may not have the same margins as a high-powered MacBook Pro, a lower-cost MacBook could still help draw more customers to Apple's services, driving increased revenue over the long run.\n\nNew challenges ahead If Ternus is chosen to succeed Cook, he'll inherit an Apple at the peak of its power. While smartphone sales have slowed over time, the company is reaping the benefits of its massive install base, which still upgrades devices every few years and increasingly subscribes to Apple's various services.\n\nBut he'll also have to navigate his share of headaches. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting some kind of movement on Apple's AI strategy. And though the company is making progress on its AI rollout, it still needs to showcase its next-generation version of Siri.\nHe'll also have to prepare to take on the likes of Meta, Google, and Samsung ( 005930.KS ) in the smart glasses space. Meta already has two smart glasses on the market, and Google and Samsung are each working on their own intelligent eyewear.\nFor now, though, Cook is still Apple's CEO. We'll just have to see if that changes in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Will Google Pass Nvidia in 2026 as the World’s Biggest Company?\n\nOmor Ibne Ehsan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 10:25 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nQuick Read Google (GOOG) now leads AI software after overtaking Microsoft. Google is less than $200B away from surpassing Apple as the world’s second-largest company.\nGoogle holds four of the top 10 AI models on LLMArena. OpenAI’s best model ranks eighth.\nMeta is negotiating billions in purchases of Google’s TPUs. Anthropic already bought 1 million TPUs from Google instead of buying from Nvidia (NVDA).\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) as the world's second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street.\nThere are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI \"replacing\" the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals.\n\nLet's take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026.\nGoogle is firing on all cylinders Google was supposed to \"die\" after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can.\nThen, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI \"Bard\" rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in \"code red\" mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards.\n\nIf you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI's sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each.\nIf you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI's GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn't spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) have gone into net debt.\nWhy Google's search business will never be replaced If Google's rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated.\nAs for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with.\n\nIn contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it.\nNvidia's AI GPUs at risk? Software isn't Alphabet's only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia's near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient.\nMeta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth \"billions of dollars,\" with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia's coffers instead.\n\nThe threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google's AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating.\nCould Google become the biggest company in 2026? I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world's largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030.\n\nNvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Apple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\n\nSubhasree Kar\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 8:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nApple (AAPL) has just dropped a game-changing artificial intelligence (AI) model that’s got Wall Street buzzing. The tech titan is racing to gain ground in the AI revolution, unveiling a breakthrough called SHARP that can instantly turn ordinary 2D photos into lifelike 3D images. The stock’s allure is shifting from phones and wearables to intelligent software and machine learning innovation.\n\nSHARP uses a neural network to generate a 3D Gaussian representation in under a second on a standard GPU, enabling real-time, high-resolution rendering at over 100 frames per second. The model supports accurate, metric camera movements and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across datasets, highlighting Apple’s advancing capabilities in AI-driven 3D visualization.\nMore News from Barchart Will Tesla Stock Lose Its ‘Elon Musk Premium’ After the SpaceX IPO?

Sign up now!\n\nWhile this breakthrough can meaningfully strengthen Apple’s long-term growth story, is the stock a buy at current levels?\nAbout Apple Stock California-based Apple continues to stand as a forward-looking company and a worldwide leader in hardware, software, and services. Its portfolio spans iconic devices like the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, alongside widely used platforms such as the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+. The company currently boasts a market cap of $4.1 trillion and Magnificent Seven (MAGS) status.\n\nApple’s stock has delivered a notable performance over the past year, but it remains somewhat muted compared to the highest-growth tech peers. The stock has gained 6.48% over the past 52 weeks and 8.2% year-to-date (YTD).\nAdditionally, it reached a fresh 52-week high of $288.62 on Dec. 3, propelled by optimism around solid iPhone sales momentum, aggressive advancements in AI integration, and robust financial forecasts for the holiday season.\nThe stock is trading at a premium at 33.73 times forward earnings, compared to the sector median and its historical average.\nSteady Q4 Results Apple released its fiscal Q4 2025 results on Oct. 30, for the quarter ended Sept. 27. The company reported total revenue of $102.5 billion, representing an 8% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Its earnings per share (EPS) came to $1.85, up 13% on an adjusted basis from the prior year and ahead of expectations. AAPL reported total revenue of $416.2 billion for the full year, representing 6.4% growth YOY.\n\nStory Continues\nIn terms of business segments, the iPhone division generated approximately $49 billion in revenue for the quarter, marking a 6.1% increase and accounting for nearly half of the company’s quarterly sales. Mac revenue rose about 12.7% to $8.7 billion, while iPad revenue was essentially flat at about $7 billion. The Wearables, Home & Accessories segment also saw flat performance, around $9 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the Services segment achieved an all-time high of $28.8 billion, growing about 15.1% YOY.\nApple now projects revenue growth of 10% to 12% in the holiday quarter (December quarter), driven by an anticipated double-digit increase in iPhone revenue. It expects December revenue to be “best ever” for iPhone. Gross margin for the period is expected to range between 47% to 48%, while Apple also noted ongoing investments in AI and product development, highlighting that while hardware continues to anchor the business, services and ecosystem strength remain a central focus.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Apple Stock? Analysts covering Apple predict its EPS to rise by 10.4% YOY to $2.65 in the first quarter. Further, the consensus estimate of $8.11 for fiscal 2026 indicates an increase of 8.7% YOY, before improving by around 12.5% annually to $9.12 in fiscal 2027.\nRecently, Jefferies raised its price target on Apple to $283.36 from $246.99 while maintaining a “Hold” rating, citing the company’s ability to withstand rising memory costs due to its high pricing power. The firm expects some volume and margin pressure in 2026 but believes a higher iPhone 18 average selling price (ASP) will help offset the impact.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Apple to $315 from $305 and maintained an “Overweight” rating. The firm also pointed to improved iPhone shipment assumptions and continued AI investment, maintaining a favorable risk-reward outlook.\nApple stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Out of 40 analysts covering the tech giant, 21 recommend a “Strong Buy,” three give a “Moderate Buy,” 14 analysts stay cautious with a “Hold” rating, one “Moderate Sell,” and one has a “Strong Sell” rating.\nWhile the average analyst price target of $290.85 suggests an upside of 7.34%, its Street-high target price of $350 suggests as much as 29.17% upside ahead.\nOn the date of publication, Subhasree Kar did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "An X-Ray View of the Magnificent Seven\n\nJohn Dorfman\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:38 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBy John Dorfman December 22, 2025 (Maple Hill Syndicate)\nFor the past three years, a huge share of the stock market's action has been in the Magnificent Seven , a small group of super-successful, super-popular stocks.\nThere are signs of fatigue in this leadership group. But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

( AAPL , Financials ) is seeing shorter lead times for its iPhone 17 lineup as supply catches up with demand, according to new channel checks from J.P. Morgan. Analyst Samik Chatterjee said average global wait times declined roughly three days in the firm's 15th week of tracking, bringing delivery estimates to about three days similar to levels seen during last year's iPhone 16 cycle.\n\nIs AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe report indicates that Apple has largely achieved parity between demand and supply toward year-end, a pattern typical of previous product cycles. In the U.S., delivery times for all iPhone 17 models now average two days, while China and Europe show similar improvements, with most configurations available for immediate in-store pickup.\nChatterjee, who maintains an Overweight rating on Apple, said the easing lead times point to stable production and continued strong consumer demand through fiscal second-quarter 2026. That trend could help sustain higher iPhone unit sales and revenue for the remainder of the model's cycle.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Google started the year behind in the AI race. It ended 2025 on top.\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:03 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nCRM\n\nGoogle ( GOOG , GOOGL ) entered 2025 in a difficult position. While its stock price rose 36% in 2024, the company was still largely perceived by Wall Street as playing second (or third) fiddle to OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) in the AI race.\nFast-forward to today, and Google is stealing the show, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared a \"code red\" emergency as the company works to match Google's latest Gemini 3 AI models. It's an interesting twist, given that Google declared its own code red after ChatGPT hit the market in 2022.\n\nGoogle is also catching up to OpenAI in the key monthly active user (MAU) metric.\nThen there are Google chip wins. In October, Claude developer Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) announced it was expanding its plan to use Google's AI chips, including using up to 1 million processors , to power its AI software.\nGoogle is also in talks to provide its chips to Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta ( META ) to run its AI products, according to The Information .\nIt all added up to a strong 2025 for the search giant, setting it up for continued success in the year ahead.\n\"Google will be the best performing Mag 7 stock in CY26,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a Dec. 11 investor note.\n\"Google is in the strongest position when it comes to a fully integrated AI stack,\" he wrote. \"Gemini is a leading model, its user base is expanding faster than OpenAI's, Search is integrating AI effectively with ads reportedly on the way, and [Google Cloud Platform] continues to hold its ground in the infrastructure buildout cycle.\"\n\nGoogle's AI wins pile up Google counts its AI revenue as part of its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) business. According to the company, that has given GCP a significant boost. In Q3, Google said its GCP revenue grew 34% year over year to $15.1 billion . It rose 32% in the prior quarter.\nThe number of new customers to the GCP jumped 34%.\n\n\"Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins, and backlog,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call.\nAccording to Pichai, Google signed more deals worth more than $1 billion in its third quarter than it did in the previous two years combined. More than 70% of the company's existing cloud customers are using its AI services, he added.\nThe company has also more deeply intertwined its AI capabilities with Google Search, launching its ChatGPT-like AI Mode for all US users in May at the Google I/O conference and dropping ads into AI Overviews in search.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle has also managed to win over social media users with its Nano Banana AI image app, which went viral in August. Then came the biggest bomb: Gemini 3.\nAnnounced in November , Gemini 3 immediately won praise from users, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who said he was ditching ChatGPT after using the app for Gemini 3.\n\nGemini 3 sent shockwaves through the AI industry, unseating GPT-5.1 as the leading AI model across several categories.\nGoogle's user base is also growing. According to TD Cowen's John Blackledge, a survey of roughly 2,500 US consumers found that Gemini's MAU penetration ramped faster than ChatGPT's from July to October.\nGemini MAU penetration was 24% in July and climbed to 26% in October. Google's AI Mode also improved from 18% to 19%. ChatGPT, however, saw its MAU penetration decline from 36% to 35% in the same time period.\n\nMarket intelligence firm Sensor Tower says that both apps continue to see significant growth, with global MAU up 180% and 125% for ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively. But like TD Cowen, Sensor Tower found that ChatGPT's MAU grew roughly 15% between August and December. Gemini was up 30%, thanks in part to its Nano Banana image editing app.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that Gemini is also available on all newer Android devices, making it far easier to access than ChatGPT, which requires users to navigate to a website or download the ChatGPT app.\nGoogle's other beats AI wasn't the only bright spot for Google in 2025. While the company lost its second antitrust case in April, with a judge finding it holds an illegal monopoly through its online advertising business, its legal issues weren't all bad.\nIn September, a judge declined to force Google to give up its Chrome browser after he found the company holds an illegal monopoly over the search market.\nThe judge also allowed Google to continue to make payments to \"distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google Search, Chrome, or GenAI products.\"\nThat means the company can continue to pay Apple upwards of $20 billion a year to make Google Search the default search option on its iPhone and other devices.\n\nOutside of its legal dramas, Google has also made major strides with self-driving car company Waymo. The firm expanded its availability to other cities — including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando — and began offering freeway driving around San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.\nGoogle also showed off its prototype smart glasses and a new Samsung VR headset, both of which use software based on a version of Android called Android XR, which was developed by Google and Samsung.\nLook for that and more in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.
