      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory Continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:25 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) innovations have been lackluster, but its ecosystem is as powerful as ever.\nAmazon is driving tremendous growth in its AWS cloud division thanks to strong AI demand.\nValuation should always play a part in proper investment analysis.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nWhen looking at stocks to buy, investor attention might go to the most dominant and well-known businesses out there. This will naturally lead to technology companies that have strong market positions, popular products and services, and perhaps a presence in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) come to mind. Over the long term, they have both been fantastic stocks to own, doing a great job compounding shareholder capital. And today, they command multitrillion-dollar market caps .\nBoth businesses have their own investment merits. But which is the best stock to buy right now?\nApple is moving slowly with AI, but the moat couldn't be wider The biggest knock on Apple in recent years has been its unhurried approach to AI. Major tech enterprises across the board are moving incredibly fast at building out the necessary infrastructure and software capabilities to position themselves to become leaders in the AI market.\nApple, in typical fashion, started out being cautious, as its usual strategy isn't to be first, but to be the best. However, the Apple Intelligence features on its smartphones aren't turning any heads. And an upgraded Siri launch has been delayed until next year.\n\nThat still doesn't take away from Apple's wide economic moat. The company's competitive position is supported by its strong brand, with Apple arguably being the most recognizable business on Earth. The brand resonates with consumers across the globe, thanks to the company's beautifully designed hardware and software offerings, superior user experience, and premium positioning. The elevated retail experience also has an impact.\nThe moat is also helped by Apple's powerful ecosystem . This combination of products and services is what makes the business truly one-of-a-kind. Customers are essentially locked in, with Apple being able to generate profits on its hardware devices, while also raking in high-margin revenue on its fast-growing services segment.\nThere are very few companies as financially sound as Apple. Its net profit margin has averaged 25.5% in the past five years. It collects massive amounts of free cash flow . And the balance sheet is clean, with $34 billion of net cash on the books (as of Sept. 27). This reduces risk for investors.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon has multiple growth drivers that will push it forward Amazon, on the other hand, is already atop the AI race. It's planning to spend a whopping $125 billion on capital expenditures this year to bolster its technical infrastructure. That's an easy capital allocation decision for the leadership team to make, as they are seeing robust demand from customers for AI-related products and services.\n\nThis shows up in Amazon Web Services (AWS), whose revenue shot up 20% year over year in Q3. This booming segment is also very profitable, bringing in trailing-12-month operating income of $43.8 billion.\nBesides cloud computing, which itself is poised to be a $2.4 trillion market worldwide in 2030, Amazon dominates online shopping. Nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce activity happens on its marketplace, giving it an advantageous position as buyer behavior keeps moving to digital channels.\nInvestors might not realize that Amazon reported $17.7 billion in digital ad sales in the third quarter, a major growth engine that is likely also producing high margins. Amazon also has a presence in streaming entertainment, autonomous driving, and healthcare.\n\nI believe Amazon is in a better position to increase its revenue and earnings power at a faster rate than Apple, thanks to those secular trends working in its favor. Valuation matters as well. Amazon stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 32.1 is below Apple's multiple of 36.6, given the former the upper hand.\nWith a time horizon looking out over the next five or 10 years, I view Amazon as the best stock to buy right now.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "OpenAI vs. Apple? Sam Altman is setting his sights on winning what could be an even higher-stakes AI battle\n\nAlyson Shontell\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 10:25 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAll eyes are on the Big Tech LLM race and, at least in the eyes of investors , it seems like Google (owned by Alphabet , No. 7) could run away with the win.\nGoogle’s Gemini has been steadily stealing buzz and AI traffic share over the last few months from OpenAI. And if there was any moat to be had in LLMs, it would seem like it would belong to the company with the biggest treasure chest of personal data on users. That almost indisputably would be Google, thanks to Android, YouTube , Search history, Maps, and Gmail. On top of that, the company has one of the top AI minds, Demis Hassabis, and Google cofounder Sergey Brin leading its troops toward dominance.\n\nPerhaps that’s why Sam Altman is setting his sights on winning what could be an even higher-stakes AI battle: creating the future mass AI consumer device. Altman feels that in the long term, his greatest foe will be Apple (No. 4), not Google, Meta (No. 22), or Amazon (No. 2). He recruited iPhone designer Jony Ive to OpenAI this May, and Ive has said the company’s secret device could be ready in the next two years.\nWhat will that device be like? If you ask Altman, he describes limitations with the mobile phone. First of all, it can be turned off. It also can’t scan the room around you and give you real-time context and know exactly when to deliver relevant information to you. He sounds more bullish about audio than visual as the primary means of communication. And he sees no reason why a device and an operating system should be sold separately, like Google and Android—a future device should come with the trademark LLM baked in, like iOS in an iPhone.\n\nThanks largely to that iPhone, Apple is generating tens of billions of dollars a year in cash flow that it can plow into new devices and armies of engineers to design them—two areas where OpenAI lags far behind. Then again, Apple seems ripe to be disrupted: As Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said on Joe Rogan’s podcast earlier this year, “They haven’t invented anything great in a while. It’s like Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later.”\nBut for now, OpenAI and its team are all about perfecting ChatGPT. For more on how Altman is planning to position OpenAI as a long-term hardware play, and how he’s combating fast-rising competition like Anthropic and Google in the short term, check out Fortune ’s reporting on what’s happening inside OpenAI as it battles its way through an eight-week code red.\nAlso, we’re taking a break for the holidays, so Fortune 500 Digest will be back in inboxes Jan. 10.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is among the 14 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Now . On December 15, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained an Overweight rating on the stock with a share price target of $305, a reaffirmation of an earlier update on October 31.\nThe adjustment follows Citi analyst Atif Malik lifting his price target on the iPhone-maker to $330 from $315 on December 9, while keeping a Buy rating on the shares.\nCiti sees an uptick in iPhone sales during the coming quarters, as it believes several old users of the smartphone, especially those who have iPhone 12 and 13, are due for an upgrade. Considering this factor, Citi said it was raising its earnings estimates for the company.\n\nEarlier in the month, on December 5, CLSA also hiked its price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $330 from $265, while keeping an earlier Outperform rating, citing a surge in iPhone sales, which is expected to drive revenue and earnings growth in FY26-27.\nAs of the close of business on December 17, Wall Street analysts have a Moderate Buy rating on the stock, with a one-year average share price target of $298.72, implying a 9% upside.\nIn other news, according to a report from The Information on Tuesday, Apple is planning to expand its iPhone product line to include seven variants by 2027.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned the company widespread acclaim and customer loyalty.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "5 predictions for tech and AI in 2026 from mega-bull Dan Ives\n\nSamuel O'Brient\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:11 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nDan Ives, one of Wall Street's biggest tech bulls, released his predictions for 2026.\nHe thinks the AI revolution is just starting, and that investors shouldn't be spooked by bubble talk.\nIves sees big things coming from Tesla , Google, and Apple next year.\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities unveiled his list of top predictions for the tech sector for 2026, and the outspoken tech bull isn't any less optimistic about what the new year holds.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he sees big things ahead for Tesla. Shares of Elon Musk's car company hit a record high this week, but Ives predicts even more gains to come.\nMore broadly, the analyst sees the AI story continuing to unfold in 2026, and urges investors to buckle in for another bullish year in the space.\n\"On one hand this is a 4th Industrial Revolution taking shape with the US leading China on tech for the first in 30 years...while on the other hand the trillions of dollars needed to reach the heights of enterprise/consumer AI Revolution have caused nervousness and doubters among investors,\" Ives said in a note on Friday.\nHere are Ives' biggest predictions for tech and AI in 2026.\nTesla rolls out robotaxis in 30 cities\nIves is as bullish as ever on Tesla and believes that the EV leader will expand its robotaxi reach in 2026.\n\"Tesla will successfully launch Robotaxis in over 30 cities in 2026 and start to scale volume production of Cybercabs,\" Ives predicts.\nThe EV maker still has its bears. Ross Gerber told Business Insider recently that he doesn't think Tesla can catch up in the self-driving car race as Waymo advances rapidly, but Ives remains steadfast in his conviction that Musk's company will win the driverless race.\nHe sees Tesla stock rising 26% in his base case and as much as 68% in his bull case.\nOracle advances in the AI data center market\nOracle has struggled recently after a lackluster earnings report that raised some questions about the strength of the AI trade. However, Ives isn't worried about the concern that the company is overspending on AI . He predicts a turnaround is coming for Oracle stock in 2026.\n\"Oracle successfully builds out its datacenter targets, starts to convert its massive RPO AI backlog and hits $250 per share in 2026 despite the dark negative sentiment on the stock today,\" he predicted.\nApple and Google will team up on AI\nTwo of the biggest names in tech are likely to team up in 2026 to help usher in the next phase of AI, according to Ives. He predicts that a joint venture between Apple and Google is coming, one that will help the iPhone maker catch up to competitors in the AI race.\n\nStory Continues\n\"Apple and Google will announce a formal AI partnership around Gemini that will finally cement a real AI strategy for Cupertino,\" Ives said. \"This will ultimately be a subscription service launched in the Apple network and lead to Apple achieving a $5 trillion market cap in 2026.\"\nNebius to be acquired\nAI infrastructure provider Nebius may be one of the next big winners of the AI arms race. The Dutch company is Ives' top pick to be acquired by a Big Tech hyperscaler in 2026. He named Microsoft , Alphabet and Amazon as likely candidates to swoop in and buy it.\nNebius stock is coming off an extremely strong 2025, with 212% year-to-date gains. Ives isn't the only pro who sees it as a likely winner. Market research firm Futurum Group named it among its picks for the top tech stocks for the next generation of AI.\nCybersecurity stocks will surge\nIves is also highly bullish on the cybersecurity industry, touting it as one of the tech market's highest performing subsectors. He named CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks as Wedbush's top picks in the space for the coming year.\nWhile Palo Alto Networks has struggled recently and is only up 2% year-to-date, CrowdStrike has spent the year trending upward with 41% gains. Cybersecurity industry experts have also flagged both stocks as likely winners set to capitalize on rising security demand.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

We're digging into all of this in today's options pit, sponsored by Tasty trade.\n00:15 Speaker A\nAnd Henry Schwartz, CBOE Vice President of Market Intelligence is here to discuss. Uh, let's talk about this surge in options demand. We were just talking offline. You said it's up what three times since uh COVID?\n00:32 Henry Schwartz\nYeah.\n00:33 Speaker A\nThat is incredible. So, what is this trend tell you?\n00:36 Henry Schwartz\nSo, I mean, this year we're going to see 15 billion option contracts trade. Uh if you go back to to just before COVID, it was about 4 billion contracts a year. So, and in fact, I've been doing the calculations. It looks like the 15 billionth contract will trade on Christmas Eve.\n00:52 Speaker A\nMhm.\n00:52 Henry Schwartz\nI think we should have a door prize or something. Let's see if we can figure out what trade.\n00:56 Speaker A\nThere might be some binary option futures betting markets that could uh take care of that.\n01:00 Henry Schwartz\nAbsolutely. Well, I mean, that that's actually kind of one of the big themes, right? As we've seen this the evolution of risk taking, betting, you know, there's a lot of different ways to discuss it. Um, you know, the the you know, COVID really or you know, that whole kind of market environment really changed the landscape for options trading. And basically, uh we saw growth of about 50% in 2020 and it has kept up and it is retail that is really driving most of that. You know, we continue to see, you know, a healthy institutional business. Uh we see, you know, we see, you know, the the big theme really for this year is kind of everything is just stronger. Across the board, no matter what asset classes you look at, if you're talking about index options like SPX or VIX. If you're talking about ETF options, which you know, we were just talking about kind of the explosion in in number of ETFs and single stock option flow, which is really, you know, primarily retail driven. And when you have a year like, you know, like we're seeing this year with, you know, basically the broad averages up, you know, between 15 and 20%, uh that just brings in more and more activity.\n02:08 Speaker A\nSo, I've been thinking about this and tell me if I'm just way offline here. But if we take it back to early late 2020, early 2021, that's when we had the whole Reddit GameStop phenomenon going on. Arguably, a lot of it was fueled with the stimulus checks, the stimmies. and next year is going to be a blockbuster record year for fiscal stimulus. Um there's going to be a lot of tax refunds and I'm just wondering, is there any way we could have some kind of a repeat of that, maybe not to the same extent, but do you think that we just get another surge, um perhaps just because people have more money to play with?\n02:46 Henry Schwartz\nI I mean, I think you have you have a lot of dynamics going on at the same time. You know, we do have a a a rate, you know, the rates are going down in the cycle, but you also do have some concerns about the labor market, you have concerns about, you know, just fundamental valuations. So there's a little bit of push and pull. I think, you know, that the the COVID situation and you know, zero interest rates and stimulus and meme stock, uh that that was such a perfect storm of just kind of\n03:28 Speaker A\nAgreed, perfect storm.\n03:29 Henry Schwartz\nexplosive bullish activity and and and retail were able to capitalize on it. You know, in a large part because they were at home and they kind of had the freedom to trade. You also had commissions that basically gone to zero just leading into that. So, everything came together and you know, a lot of these traders found each other and learned from each other on Reddit and on, you know, social media. Uh I don't know if 2026 is going to be quite the same. I think there's a little bit more kind of back and forth. Uh but you know, at least in terms of the options activity, you know, we continue to see new brokerage firms coming uh online. We see the existing brokerage firms, you know, innovating and and rolling out new platforms and doing some really interesting things. So, you know, I see the business, at least in the options world continuing to to do very, very well. And you know, in terms of assets, uh you know, I think that you have this environment now where, you know, the US has had an amazing run and there's a lot of people that say, oh, you know, I don't know, this is getting a little bit tired. Uh but at the same time, you you you know, every time we have a dip, uh,\n04:36 Speaker A\nAnd that's arguably better for options traders. I mean, option traders like volatility. I I I want to make sure we get to a couple other things here. The other is the rise of zero-dated options. And so that just gives more opportunities. Back in the day, you only had monthlies, so you had to wait every month. Then we had weeklies, then basically we have dailies now. And that has just increased uh this volume of options. Talk to me about some of the other innovations. I know CBOE has a bunch of new products, too.\n05:08 Henry Schwartz\nYeah, so the so we pioneered the zero DTE or the daily option option cycle starting 2022 and those are now about 2/3 of the activity uh in SPX and um and some of the big ETFs. Uh and there there's no signs of that slowing down. Uh we just rolled out the Mag 10 index, which is the Mag 7 plus uh Broadcom, uh AMD and Palantir. And you know, those 10 symbols together do about a third of the single stock option. Out of almost 4,000 single stocks. So you you can see how concentrated it is. That's what the trader, that's what the investing public really, really is interested in. They're following the stories, they're getting in and getting out of these stocks. And so the Mag 10 index which launched about a month ago, I'm very proud to say I was the very first trade in in Mag 10. and that option expired today and I made a little bit of money at it. Uh we actually have daily options coming in those just uh in two weeks. So that's, you know, and that's new, right? This this is the first time that that there's been a uh an index that's not quite as broad-based with the daily options on it as well. So, um you know, there's you know, the the industry just continues to keep innovating. You know, we see a lot of work going on in complex order execution, which is you know, basically about a third of the activity is customers trading one option against another, vertical spreads, calendar spreads, exactly. Uh and that you know, CBOE and all the other exchanges continue to kind of take steps to make that uh easier to do, add functionality. You can now trade flex options versus listed options, which is a kind of a special option that lets people pick their own expiration date and um and strike price and even exercise style.\n06:56 Speaker A\nAll right, Henry, we got to leave it there, but congratulations on your Mag 10 trade. I hope it pretends a bullish 2026. Thanks for joining us in studio here.\n07:05 Henry Schwartz\nAwesome.\n07:06 Speaker A\nAll right, we'll\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Visa, Mastercard make a global push for mobile wallets\n\nJohn Adams\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 10:40 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MA\n\nV\n\nAAPL\n\nKey insights : Visa and Mastercard are building mobile wallet scale through a series of partnerships.\nWhat's at stake : Both card networks say internal research is tracking popularity for mobile wallets.\nForward look : Apple's agreement with EU regulators to open its NFC technology will draw more wallet providers in the next year.\n\nAs 2025 winds to a close, Mastercard has advanced two partnerships designed to enable merchant access to mobile wallets in dozens of countries, joining rival Visa in building global distribution as consumers and merchants migrate more of their lives to smartphones.\nMastercard's December moves include a collaboration with TerraPay, a London-based cross-border payments company, to enable TerraPay's mobile wallet users to access more than 150 million Mastercard acceptance points for Near Field Communication-based payments.\nNFC is a key enabling technology for smartphone payments. Under regulatory pressure , Apple has agreed to ease access to NFC, which the tech giant traditionally controlled. This is expected to open the market to dozens of mobile wallets, creating a need for Visa and Mastercard to broaden their ability to support a range of new ones.\n\nMastercard's TerraPay partnership comes as the card brand plans to boost mobile wallet usage in Latin America via a joint venture with Telefonica, a Madrid-based telecom. Telefonica and Mastercard plan to launch a mobile wallet in Brazil and surrounding countries that could have an addressable market of up to 87 million consumers.\nMastercard's other recent collaborations include \"Pay like a local,\" a partnership between: Alipay and Mastercard to offer international travelers an option to make cashless payments in China; an integration with Alipay Wallet; and a contactless pay technology tie-up with Alipay.\n\"Collaborations with key ecosystem players like Terrapay play a key role in scaling the positive impact via their multiple wallet partners and simplifying the implementation process,\" said Prakriti Singh, executive vice president for core payments at Mastercard for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, in a statement.\n\nMobility\nSeventy percent of in-person Mastercard transactions are now contactless, the card network said, suggesting the popularity of mobile wallets is migrating from e-commerce to brick and mortar. Banks are also embracing mobile wallets. More than half of banks say at least 60% of their payment initiatives take a \"mobile first\" strategy, according to research from American Banker .\n\nStory Continues\nLike Mastercard, Visa has made a series of partnerships to scale its mobile wallet strategy.\n\nVisa recently announced a digital wallet partnership with BBVA in Spain that combines Visa's Token Service with the bank's payment technology to enable BBVA's mobile wallet. (A \"token\" in this case refers to digital payments security, not migrating services to a blockchain).\nOther Visa mobile wallet projects in the EU include an iOS/Android contactless mobile payment collaboration with Klarna; a Visa co-wallet with Vipps Mobile Pay in the Nordics; and a planned 2026 pilot with Bancomat, an Italian digital payments product.\n\n\"This will enable consumer choice, which is a big underlying issue for us and our strategy,\" Mathieu Altwegg, senior vice president and head of product and solutions for Europe at Visa, told American Banker.\nVisa also cited its own research, reporting mobile payments make up 59% of all e-commerce transactions in Europe, with growth on pace to reach 75% in the next four years. Thirty-two percent of European consumers only use mobile wallets for payments, according to the card brand.\n\"We're seeing demand for these wallets, both to pay online and for face to face transactions,\" he said.\nAltwegg did not directly address Apple's EU NFC settlement, but noted a proliferation of wallets. \"Being able to use different types of wallets will level the playing field,\" he said.\n\nCompetitive response\nIn Europe, the threat to the card networks is Europe's bank-led wallets that use direct bank transfers instead of card networks, according to Ron van Wezel, a strategic advisor for Datos Insights.\n\"Bank consortia provide digital wallets across Europe, launched through collaborative efforts between multiple banks,\" Van Wezel told American Banker, noting that common successful bank-led wallets for specific domestic markets include MobilePay in Denmark, Swish in Sweden, Vipps in Norway, and Bizum in Spain.\n\n\"They're direct bank account payment systems that compete with cards,\" Van Wezel said. \"When someone pays with these wallets, the money moves bank-to-bank via SEPA instant transfers, with no Visa, no Mastercard, and no interchange fees.\"\nThis is why the Apple/EU settlement matters so much, Van Wezel said, adding that these bank wallets couldn't work on Apple devices at the point-of-sale prior to Apple's EU settlement.\n\"They're direct bank account payment systems that compete with cards,\" Van Wezel said. \"When someone pays with these wallets, the money moves bank-to-bank via SEPA instant transfers, with no Visa, no Mastercard, and no interchange fees.\"\nIn this environment it's critical that cards be available in digital wallets, Tony DeSanctis, a senior director at Cornerstone Advisors, told American Banker. \"The question is which wallets are going to be relevant,\" he said.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Art, is it Max 7 or bust for you?\n00:09 Art\nUh, it's not. and I'll tell you this. I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Intel vs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points TSMC is the undisputed leader in manufacturing advanced chips.\nIntel's stock outperformed in 2025 after the company was backed by some big investors.\nTSMC has a clearer growth path between the two companies.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nWhen it comes to chip manufacturing, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the undisputed foundry leader, while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is trying to make inroads. However, in 2025, it was Intel's stock that outperformed, up nearly 80% as of this writing, compared to a 40% gain for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\nLet's look at which stock is set up to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC for short, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. Due to its technological expertise and scale, the company manufactures the vast majority of advanced chips, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) . It counts Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom among its top customers.\n\nIn chip manufacturing, the goal is to consistently push down node sizes, which refers to the transistor density of the chips. The more transistors that can be fit on a chip, the more powerful and energy efficient they become. However, producing advanced chips at scale is difficult, and TSMC's main competitors, including Intel and Samsung , have struggled with yields (the number of defects per wafer). Meanwhile, nearly three-quarters of its production is at 7nm nodes and below, and it is set to move to 2nm technology next year.\nGiven its position in the industry, TSMC is the go-to partner for chip designers. It works closely with companies like Nvidia to grow capacity to meet their projected demand. And, as the only foundry that can really make these advanced chips at scale with high yields, it has also garnered strong pricing power. The company is set to raise prices once again next year, while the cost of its new 2nm processing technology is forecasted to be 50% higher than its 2nm technology.\n\nTSMC is well-positioned to continue to benefit from the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout and sees AI chip demand growing by more than a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years.\nThe case for Intel Intel stock's outperformance in 2025 wasn't really a result of its operational performance. The company has struggled to grow its revenue, and it felt a lot of gross margin pressure in the first half of the year. However, it did see a huge rebound in adjusted gross margins in Q3, with it climbing from 18% a year ago to 40%. Revenue, meanwhile, edged up 3%.\n\nStory Continues\nThe biggest reasons for Intel's gains in 2025 were from the high-profile investments others made into the company's stock. Nvidia made a $5 billion equity investment in the company, while SoftBank invested $2 billion. Meanwhile, the U.S. government made an $8.9 billion investment. These investments, along with the 51% sale of its Altera business for $5.2 billion, helped Intel end Q3 with nearly $31 billion in cash on its balance sheet.\n\nThe company will use that cash to keep building out its foundry business and advance its chip manufacturing technology. Meanwhile, it is collaborating with Nvidia on new products, including integrating its central processing units (CPUs) with Nvidia's NVLink system to allow its CPUs to communicate more quickly with Nvidia's GPUs. This would help give Intel a nice advantage in the data center CPU market, where it has been losing share to Advanced Micro Devices . Separately, Intel is also working on its own AI chips designed for inference, and it is supposedly close to a deal with SambaNova Systems to further its efforts in this area.\nThe verdict Intel's 2025 performance was largely from events that won't repeat in 2026. For the company to outperform next year, it's probably going to need to win a large foundry customer or show major progress in data center chips, either with its CPUs or GPU efforts. That makes the stock more of a wildcard.\n\nTSMC, meanwhile, is the much safer choice. The company is set to benefit from the continued AI data center buildout, and its path forward is much clearer. As such, it's my pick to outperform in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

      "Content": "Steve Jobs sold his Volkswagen to raise $1,300 for Apple’s first computer—he became a millionaire just two years later at 23\n\nEmma Burleigh\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:28 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nVLKAF\n\nIf it wasn’t for a Volkswagen bus and a calculator, Apple might never have existed. At the time, late cofounder Steve Jobs was in his early 20s and strapped for cash, but hooked on the idea that everyone should be able to own a home computer. The only problem? Like many founders, he didn’t have enough money to bring his vision to life.\n\nSo Jobs sold off his Volkswagen bus while fellow cofounder Steve Wozniak got money for his programmable calculator, raising $1,300 to pay for the prototype’s parts. And the first Apple computer, Apple I, was born on April Fools Day in 1976.\nThe sacrifice paid off: A local computer dealer placed a $50,000 order for 100 units soon after it launched, with the product mainly bought up by hobby enthusiasts. But it made the entrepreneurial duo enough money to create Apple II for the mass market—the first personal computer to include a keyboard and color graphics. A year after its 1977 debut, it made nearly $3 million.\n“I was worth about over $1 million when I was 23, and over $10 million when I was 24, and over $100 million when I was 25,” Jobs told PBS in 1996. “And it wasn’t that important, because I never did it for the money.”\n\nThe days of selling their belongings to fund their fledgling business was long behind them.\nFrom college dropout to $10.2 billion net worth: Jobs’ path to Apple success Jobs didn’t discover his passion for technology in a college class; at the age of just 12 years old, the entrepreneur had already found his true calling, and took a massive leap of faith to pursue his dreams.\nA young Jobs thumbed through the yellow pages, and hunted down the phone number of Hewlett-Packard (HP) cofounder Bill Hewlett, ringing him up for a favor. At the time, the tween was in need of spare parts to build a frequency counter. But what he received was far better than some nuts and bolts; Hewlett offered Jobs an internship at the iconic $21.4 billion tech company, where he serendipitously met a talented engineer: Wozniak.\n\nTogether, the pair started their first business illegally selling “blue boxes” that allowed users to make free, long-distance telephone calls. Jobs reminisced on those years in the early 1970s as a &#8220;magical&#8221; time in his life that sent him on the path to soon create Apple.\n&#8220;Experiences like that taught us the power of ideas,&#8221; Jobs said during the 1998 documentary Silicon Valley: A 100 Year Renaissance . &#8220;If we hadn&#8217;t have made blue boxes, there would have been no Apple.&#8221;\nJobs later enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, but his days of higher education were short-lived. He dropped out after just one semester, inevitably working for legendary brand Atari as a technician and games designer at just 18 years old. That would be the last time Jobs worked under somebody else; Just two years later, Apple I hit the market, and Jobs was well on his way to becoming one of the most visionary tech pioneers in modern history.\n\nStory Continues\nFast forward five decades later, and Apple is the second most valuable company in the world. The business sits in fourth place on the Fortune 500, having sold more than three billion iPhones, and boasting more than 100 million Mac users globally.\nAt the time of his passing in 2011, Jobs was estimated to be worth $10.2 billion. Although he had enough money to buy a whole fleet of luxury cars shortly after founding Apple, selling his Volkswagen ironically proved to be a critical sacrifice in making it to the top.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

It’s the largest lending protocol in the sector by a mile, with more than $50 billion in assets deposited across its markets. That&#x27;s a balance sheet that would slot it roughly into the ranks of the top 50 U.S. banks by assets if it were a traditional institution.\nThis feature is a part of CoinDesk&#x27;s Most Influential 2025 list .\n\nStani Kulechov, founder of Aave and developer Aave Labs, has a straightforward version of what he’s building: \"Aave will be the backbone of all credit,\" he said . Not just leverage for crypto traders, but mortgages, credit cards, consumer and business loans, even sovereign debt — with DeFi running quietly in the background.\nThe path there runs on two rails. On the consumer side, the upcoming Aave App , now listed on Apple’s App Store, aims to become a savings account for average investors. Users see an interface closer to a neobank; under the hood, deposits are funneled into Aave’s onchain lending markets — a textbook \"DeFi mullet\" play where a familiar, Web2 front end masks the complex blockchain and DeFi engine in the back end.\n\nThen, there&#x27;s the institutional side and the booming tokenized real-world asset space. Aave&#x27;s Horizon , which debuted this August, is offering regulated players a marketplace to borrow stablecoins on their tokenized assets 24/7 while staying inside compliance lines. It has grown into a roughly $600 million pool despite the past months&#x27; crypto headwinds.\nAs the world is migrating onchain and traditional financial rails and blockchain rails are becoming increasingly intertwined, Aave is positioned to sit close to the center of that flow.\nMost recently, Aave has found itself at the center of a governance dispute between tokenholders — participants in the protocol’s self-governing DAO — and Stabi Kulechov&#x27;s Aave Labs over control of key revenue streams and who ultimately holds rights to core project assets like the brand, trademarks and related IP. At issue is not just the protocol’s parameters onchain, but the power that sits around it.\nThe ramifications of the outcome reaches far beyond the protocol itself. How that conflict is resolved could define what governance tokens truly grant holders in practice, set a precedent across DeFi for protocol ownership and the boundary between decentralized governance and corporate stewardship.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The ETF generates income from dividends paid by underlying equity holdings, tracking the Fidelity High Dividend Index of large and mid-cap stocks. With $7.7 billion in assets and a low 0.15% expense ratio, FDVV appears attractive on paper. However, a closer look at its top holdings reveals a fundamental tension between growth and income.\nPortfolio Composition Raises Concerns FDVV's largest positions are growth-oriented technology stocks that contribute minimal dividend income. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), the fund's largest holding at 6.41%, yields just 0.02% with an annual dividend of $0.04 per share. Despite a 53% profit margin and 67% earnings growth, NVIDIA slashed its quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.01 in 2024—a 75% cut that signals the company prioritizes reinvestment over shareholder payouts.\n\nApple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), the second-largest holding at 6.11%, offers a 0.37% yield with a $1.02 annual dividend. While more substantial than NVIDIA, this remains far below income investor expectations. Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) rounds out the tech triumvirate at 5.24% of the portfolio with a 0.72% yield and $3.40 annual dividend.\nTogether, these three holdings represent nearly 18% of FDVV but collectively yield less than 0.5%.\nTraditional Dividend Payers Provide Stability JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE:JPM ), representing 2.71% of the portfolio, offers more reliable income with a 1.73% yield and $5.55 annual dividend. The bank's 16x earnings multiple and 16% return on equity suggest sustainable payouts. Exxon Mobil ( NYSE:XOM ) at 1.97% of holdings provides a 3.36% yield with a $3.96 annual dividend, though recent quarterly earnings declined 8% year-over-year amid energy price volatility.\n\nThe problem is clear: FDVV's 26.5% allocation to information technology—the largest sector weighting—contradicts its dividend-focused mandate. Meanwhile, traditional income sectors like utilities (9.6%) and energy (8.7%) receive far less emphasis. Dividend payments have also shown concerning volatility, ranging from $0.185 to $0.504 quarterly over the past four years. After growing dividends 48% cumulatively from 2020 to 2023, FDVV experienced its first annual decline in 2024, dropping 7.7%.\n\nStory Continues\nThis infographic evaluates the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV), highlighting its portfolio's reliance on low-yield tech stocks and significant dividend volatility. It presents the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a potentially more reliable alternative for income-focused investors.\nConsider SCHD as an Alternative For investors seeking more reliable dividend income, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF ( NYSEARCA:SCHD ) offers a compelling alternative. SCHD yields 3.80%—significantly higher than FDVV's 2.78%—and focuses exclusively on US companies with consistent dividend growth records. The fund screens for financial strength and dividend sustainability, resulting in a portfolio weighted toward traditional dividend sectors rather than growth tech. SCHD has demonstrated more stable quarterly distributions and maintains a similarly low expense ratio, making it a stronger choice for income-focused investors seeking dependable cash flow.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Alphabet: Which Could Be The World's Biggest Company By End-2026?\n\nPiero Cingari\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have quietly become the two most dominant forces inside the Magnificent Seven, riding different paths to the same destination: artificial intelligence supremacy.\nNvidia's GPUs remain the backbone of the global AI buildout, powering everything from data centers to cutting-edge model training.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is pushing its own vertically integrated AI stack — from custom TPUs to Gemini — embedding intelligence directly across Search, Cloud and consumer products.\nThe market thus far has rewarded both approaches. Nvidia is up 33% year-to-date through Dec. 17, while Alphabet has surged 62%.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nZooming out further tells an even more dramatic story: since early 2023, Alphabet shares are up roughly 250%, while Nvidia has delivered a staggering 1,120% return.\nThat explosive run has made Nvidia the world's biggest company today, with a market capitalization of about $4.318 trillion — even briefly touching $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet ranks third at approximately $3.7 trillion, behind Apple's $4.05 trillion valuation.\n\nYet traders see a far closer race ahead.\nOn Polymarket, both Nvidia and Alphabet are assigned a 35% probability of being the world's most valuable company by the end of 2026.\nA $100 bet on Alphabet overtaking Nvidia to become the world's biggest company by the end of next year would pay out $265 if it happens — with nearly identical returns available for those wagering that Nvidia holds onto the crown.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) trails with a 14% chance, followed by Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT ) at 9%.\nTesla Inc . (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) sit further back, at 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nHow Could Alphabet Overtake Nvidia As World’s Biggest Company? For Alphabet to dethrone Nvidia as world’s biggest company, it needs to outperform by a meaningful margin.\nThe current valuation gap between the two companies is about $600 billion.\nIf Nvidia's market cap were to grow 10% in 2026, it would climb from roughly $4.3 trillion to about $4.75 trillion. For Alphabet to leapfrog Nvidia in that scenario, its shares would need to outperform Nvidia by roughly 19 percentage points.\n\nStory Continues\nIn practical terms, that would mean Alphabet gaining about 29% in a year where Nvidia rises 10%, lifting Google's valuation to around $4.77 trillion.\nAny performance gap of 19 percentage points in Alphabet's favor could hand it the crown — assuming today's market caps as the starting line.\n\nThe bet, then, is whether Alphabet's AI monetization, advertising leverage and cloud growth can accelerate faster than Nvidia's already-dominant chip business.\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nWall Street Still Backs Nvidia Where traders see a coin flip, Wall Street analysts remain more decisive.\nBased on median 12-month price targets, analysts expect Nvidia's reign to continue. Consensus estimates point to Nvidia shares reaching about $250 over the next year, or roughly 40% upside from the current price near $177.\nAlphabet's outlook is far more muted by comparison. Analysts see a median 12-month target of $330, implying just 6% upside from its current level around $306.\n\nThat gap underscores the tension at the core of the debate: prediction markets see a neck-and-neck race for the world's largest company, while Wall Street analysts continue to model an extended run of Nvidia's dominance.\nBy the end of 2026, the outcome may hinge on a single question: will the AI arms race ultimately reward the company supplying the picks and shovels, or the one embedding intelligence into every layer of the digital economy?\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Apple Inc. (AAPL): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nApple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $2.65 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.7%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.11 indicates a change of +12.3% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $137.46 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $451.64 billion and $489.55 billion estimates indicate +8.5% and +8.4% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Apple reported revenues of $102.47 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.9%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $1.64 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $101.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.25%. The EPS surprise was +6.94%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Buffett Leaving Berkshire Creates a ‘Vacuum Risk’ and a $381 Billion Question\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:18 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nBA\n\nBRK-B\n\nGOOG\n\nQuick Read Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) is underperforming the S&P 500 in a rare break from a two-decade trend as Warren Buffett prepares to step down as CEO.\nThe departure of Todd Combs to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) raises concerns about future stock selection and internal investment leadership.\nBerkshire’s $341 billion cash position reflects valuation discipline, but investors are increasingly focused on how effectively the next generation will deploy capital.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video I started the discussion by acknowledging something that feels almost unnatural for long-time Berkshire watchers. Warren Buffett is struggling, at least by his own historic standards. With Buffett expected to step away from the CEO role within weeks, Lee and I agreed that the timing of recent events has only amplified investor anxiety.\n\nA rare break from long-term outperformance Lee reminded me that we have covered Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway for nearly 20 years, and since 2000 the company has outperformed the S&P 500 almost every single year. That streak is coming to an end. The stock has gone through a rocky period, and that kind of volatility is not what investors associate with Buffett’s steady hand. Once Buffett publicly committed to stepping aside, the margin for error narrowed, and the market has become far less forgiving.\n\nTodd Combs and the vacuum risk The most troubling development we discussed was the departure of Todd Combs. As one of Buffett’s two key proteges, Combs played a central role in portfolio management and in supporting Greg Abel, the executive expected to lead Berkshire going forward. When Combs left to take a role at JPMorgan Chase, it immediately raised a hard question. Who finds the next great ideas?\n\nLee pointed out that Combs or his investment cohort were likely behind Berkshire’s position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Even though Buffett was late to that trade, it remains one of Berkshire’s most strategically important modern holdings. The concern now is whether there is another investor inside Berkshire capable of sourcing similar opportunities in a market that is far more complex than it was twenty years ago.\nSelling stocks and stockpiling cash Another focal point of our conversation was Berkshire’s enormous cash hoard, now roughly $341 billion. I argued that this is not a sign of confusion, but discipline. Berkshire’s cash balance will likely continue to grow until markets correct and valuations become more attractive. Whether Buffett himself or his successors pull the trigger, there are clearly stocks the team likes. They just do not like them at current prices.\n\nStory Continues\nLee agreed, noting that patience has always been core to Berkshire’s DNA. The difference now is that investors are watching closely to see whether that patience translates into decisive action once opportunity appears.\nWhat might come next Lee brought up Boeing (NYSE: BA) as a potential example of the type of company Berkshire could target. After years of turmoil following the 737 Max crashes and operational failures, Boeing has begun to stabilize and has secured large new orders. Historically, Berkshire has favored exactly these kinds of battered but essential companies that are likely to survive and recover.\n\nCore holdings still dominate We closed by looking at the current portfolio. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains Berkshire’s largest holding by a wide margin, even after substantial trimming. The same is true for Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) , which has also been reduced significantly. How aggressively the next leadership team continues to reshape these positions will say a lot about Berkshire’s future identity.\n\nFor now, Berkshire sits at an inflection point. Underperformance, executive departures, and a looming leadership transition have unsettled even its most loyal shareholders. Whether that uncertainty creates an opportunity or signals a longer adjustment period will depend on how effectively the post-Buffett team proves it can do what Buffett did better than anyone else.\nTranscript: [00:00:00] Lee Jackson: Now let's talk about Tom Combs leaving and how it's underperformed, et cetera.\n[00:00:06] Doug McIntyre: Warren Buffett has been having a tough time now. He'll be retiring, I think in about three weeks. But yeah, he's\n[00:00:12] Lee Jackson: pretty much out the door from\n\n[00:00:13] Doug McIntyre: the CEO slot. Since he said he was gonna leave, he's had some real problems.\n[00:00:19] Part of it is departures of senior people, but the other one is the stock has been, it's been a rocky period for the stock, which, it's not traditional for him.\n[00:00:31] Lee Jackson: No, because we had done some work on this 'cause we've covered Buffett and Berkshire for almost 20 years here at 24/7. And, literally since 2000, he outperformed the s and p 500 almost every year, if not every year.\n[00:00:47] That ain't gonna be the case this year. And yeah, I think, It's not surprising when people leave. Just ask Old Miss. But, when, somebody like Todd Combs walks out the door, he was one of the two, Buffett proteges, that were helping him with the portfolio, helping the guy that's stepping in to be the new CEO, he was, they were the guys that were helping him.\n\n[00:01:14] When Todd takes a, job at JP Morgan to do. Some investment strategy stuff. I'm, I don't really remember exactly what he's gonna do there, but a, he must have got a huge paycheck to go there, and he's probably filthy rich anyway, because he is been at Berkshire for years. But that's not a good sign for Berkshire.\n[00:01:33] That's not a good sign because who's gonna be the stock pickers? who's gonna find the new ideas? And I think you know, it, was probably him or his, cohort that suggested Google. Even though, Buffett was late to the Google purchase, it's in there. And as, as you've said a lot, and it's been your favorite big name, is there gonna be somebody to find more good ideas like that?\n\n[00:02:00] Because all they've been doing is selling for the last couple of years, and they have that huge pile of cash, like 341 billion of cash. So. Do you think that, I think some investors, especially longtime investors, are concerned that is every anybody else gonna go, the other people gonna\n[00:02:20] Doug McIntyre: leave. Well, there's a second part about this and that is everybody talks about the cash.\n[00:02:25] The cash on that balance is going to grow until the market drops. Right. It may not be Buffett, it may be as proteges, but there are a bunch of people sitting there who love some stocks and they're waiting for them to get to the point where they think that they're a good buy. Yeah. They love the stocks.\n[00:02:43] They love them now, but they don't love 'em at these prices.\n\n[00:02:48] Lee Jackson: Yeah. I agree. And it's funny, I. there was an upgrade for Boeing, and Boeing's gotten some huge orders and it's been a nightmare over the last five years, the 737 max crashes and, all of that stuff, and it's gonna probably be a name like Boeing or, maybe some other company that's been beaten down hard, but, will survive and exist.\n[00:03:10] But yeah, it's gonna be interesting how. The portfolio evolves going forward. 'cause a, apple is still the biggest position by far. Yeah. But you know, they've sold a ton of that. They sold a ton of Bank of America and it'll be interesting to see how things go and it'll be interesting to see if investors start to buy a lower Berkshire or continue to sell it.\n\n[00:03:35] Doug McIntyre: Yeah\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "‘I don’t know how much my wife earns’: I’m 63 with $6.4 million in stocks, mostly Apple. Will I get punished on taxes?\n\nQuentin Fottrell\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:48 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nDear Quentin, I am a longtime reader of your columns. I am interested in vulnerabilities I may not see and any advice you may offer to address my challenges.\nI am a 63-year-old former environmental engineer. After a 33-year career in state government, I retired in December 2020 at 58 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. I have the state pension currently, which pays out about $9,000 a month with a 2% COLA compounding annually. I have the state lifetime healthcare insurance (Kaiser Permanente) and it coordinates with Medicare when I turn 65. My wife is included in all this; she will get 100% survivorship and healthcare when I pass away. I pay for vision (VSP) and dental (Delta Dental) insurance through the state as these are not part of the healthcare insurance plan.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch Gen Z would rather cut Social Security benefits for current retirees than pay higher taxes to save the program\nOK, boomer: Why you should start giving your money to your adult kids now\n‘The stress at my job is getting worse every day’: I’m 61, earn $177K, and have a 401(k) with $965K. Do I retire and downsize?\n‘It’s heartbreaking’: My cousin died and her estranged husband has taken possession of her home. Can we evict him?\n\nMy wife, 62, still works at her Kumon Center, helping children get better academically in reading, writing and math. She wants to stop and is planning to sell the center. I don’t know how much my wife earns. We have lived in this city since 1989 and have a house that is paid off; our first home is rented out at $3,500 a month. Our primary home has a $300,000, 15-year refinance mortgage with 10 years remaining at 2.5%. This was a lucky pandemic era refinance. Both our properties are worth over $1 million each.\nThroughout my career, we have lived frugally, using coupons and deals and adopting the save mentality of our parents. I saved diligently into my 401(k) and 457(b) plans, the Savings Plus Program. Our investments started conservatively, but went aggressive through the years. It currently clocks in at $6.4 million — mostly in stocks and a large-cap index fund that follows the S&P 500. About half of that sits in Apple. This growth was mostly through capital appreciation and the splits these stocks went through all that time.\n\nBoth my son, 34, and daughter, 27, are well accomplished. Each has a master’s degree in the computer-science area and each is employed and living in their own condos that we helped them attain with the down payment. Neither is married yet. We both plan to take up the Social Security benefit at 70. My wife apparently can’t do the spousal benefit because her own benefit would be higher than half of mine. My wife has her own IRAs from her work and we do have a joint investment account with Charles Schwab and a checking account.\n\nStory Continues\nMy dad, 93, is a retired 22-year USN veteran who has land properties in the Philippines which we will have to deal with. I’ve been trying to figure out what to do with them. My mother passed away a while ago and a couple of properties were inherited. I was able to gain dual citizenship. My income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA) will be high but I think some may be reimbursed by the California Public Employee’s Retirement System (CalPER). Medicare premiums, I believe, are reimbursed by CalPERS.\n\nMy challenges:\n(​1.) My RMDs will be at 75 per the SECURE Act 2.0 and will be very high. As it’s all classified as regular income, income taxes will be very high.\n(​2.) Long-term care; I wonder if I can address this with self-funding.\nThank you and season’s greetings to you and yours.\nHopeful\nRelated: ‘I’m in a financial mess’: My income was cut in half. Do I sell my $600K home and kiss my 2.9% mortgage rate goodbye?\nDear Hopeful, Your RMDs are a years-long tax-related obstacle course. There is no one quick fix.\nYou’re a happy, willing, wealthy and hopefully healthy victim of your own success. Taking early withdrawals (59 ½ without having to pay a 10% early-withdrawal penalty) is a good goal, but it only takes you so far. As you rightly indicate, withdraw early only if it is part of a coordinated Roth-conversion and IRMAA-savvy strategy.\n\nYou knocked the ball out of the ballpark in the accumulation stage of your life, and now you are coming — somewhat late (but not too late) — to your distribution phase. You have children who will also benefit from an inheritance, so this is the equivalent of a double-edged silver sword with — you’ll be glad to know — relatively blunt edges.\nThis is not a savings or even a tax problem (you will have to encounter taxes one way or another). Your challenges are twofold: diversification or lack thereof and controlling your withdrawals, hopefully with an aggressive Roth conversion plan that also leaves tax-free withdrawals for your children as part of their inheritance.\nYour mission, if you accept it, will be to keep a handle on your marginal tax brackets, the IRMAA cliff you mention that could indeed lead to a sudden, significant jump in your Medicare Part B and D premiums if you cross that threshold, the 3.8% net investment income tax, California state taxes and, finally, survivor tax rates (when one spouse dies).\n\nAnd now? One of your biggest vulnerabilities has been your greatest strength: riding the tech wave with Apple AAPL, contributing to a substantial appreciation in your portfolio. You say that “about half” of your $6.4 million is Apple shares. That means you have $3.2 million in a single stock. If this is in tax-deferred accounts, selling triggers ordinary income tax, not capital gains.\nWorst-case scenario With a pension of $108,000 a year, Social Security of $90,000 a year for you and your wife collectively and your rental income, you could — in a worst-case scenario — actually exceed $700,000 in annual income, pushing you into the top federal and California state tax brackets. At 75, you could easily have nearly $9 million in stocks, requiring RMDs of $350,000 a year.\n\nFirst, how much will you have to take in RMDs? The Internal Revenue Service calculates RMDs by taking the balances of your tax-deferred retirement accounts at the end of the previous year and dividing that by a number based on your life expectancy. At 75, your RMD is calculated using a life expectancy factor of 24.6, meaning you must withdraw 4.07% of your account.\nYou will likely pay significant income tax on your RMDs assuming you have the lion’s share of that $6.4 million in tax-deferred retirement accounts. Your options include performing Roth IRA conversions and making qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) while strategically managing your withdrawals under the guise of an accountant who specializes in RMDs.\nWith a QCD, people 70 ½ can send up to around $108,000 (in 2025) from an IRA directly to charity, which counts towards your RMD; QCD limits are subject to annual inflation adjustments. In theory, this would help to lower your taxes and Medicare costs. However, this is not applicable for 401(k)s or 457(b)s; you may wish to consider rolling them into an IRA.\n\nA word of caution from Charles Schwab: “A Roth IRA conversion can be especially advantageous during your initial years of retirement, when RMDs haven’t yet kicked in and you’re most likely to be in a lower tax bracket as compared to your working years. But if you’re already receiving retirement benefits, converted funds could increase your taxable income.”\nLife insurance and long-term care Some retirees pair QCDs with Roth conversions in lower‑income years, says Savant Wealth Management, which has offices nationwide. “If you don’t need the distribution for living expenses, you can invest the after‑tax proceeds in a taxable account, contribute to a 529 plan for a grandchild, or incorporate the funds into a broader estate plan,” it says.\n\nGiven your real-estate and investments, you could comfortably finance your own long-term care if need be. Long-term-care insurance effectively doubles between your 60s and 70s. Most men your age can expect to pay a premium of $313 a month (compared with $536 for someone 75 years old), according to this guide from SmartAsset.\nIt’s more expensive for women due to their longer life expectancy (it costs around $524 for a 65-year-old single woman aged 65 versus $966 for a 75-year-old woman). Medicare does not cover long-term-care insurance. Based on your age, gender and health profile, your monthly premium could be $760 or more, according to a review of health insurers by Policygenius.\nIf you do decide to fund long-term care? In California, the median annual cost for long-term-care facilities can range from $65,000 for assisted living to over $150,000 for a private room in a nursing home, depending on the facility and location. In-home care could cost you more than $70,000 a year. You have a $1 million rental property to tap into, in addition to your investments.\n\nMoving onto the state of play after you’re gone: Roth conversions during your lifetimes will also help prevent your wife from facing a wall of taxes if you predecease her. Another reason to pursue this strategy: When you and your wife pass away, your children will also be forced to drain inherited tax-deferred accounts within a 10-year period.\nYou have a lot to do, but you have the wherewithal to do it. Include your wife in your plans.\nDon’t miss: ‘I fear a significant decline in the S&P 500’: Do I sell my tech stocks before it’s too late?\nPrevious columns by Quentin Fottrell:\nMy siblings don’t earn nearly as much as me.

Here’s how agents used a Walmart gift card to catch her red-handed\n\nVictoria Vesovski\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nA $10 Walmart gift card doesn’t scream “criminal investigation.” But in Cobb County, Georgia, that small piece of plastic helped federal inspectors and local police catch a U.S. Postal Service employee accused of stealing mail\nThe sting happened at a time when the institution was processing more than 350 million mail pieces per day last holiday season (1). According to Cobb County police and court records, Isis Hinson, who worked at the U.S. Post Office on East Cobb Road, was charged with theft after officials say she targeted mail containing cash and gift cards.\n\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThe investigation was launched when a fellow letter carrier flagged an unusual pattern of opened envelopes turning up near cluster mailboxes in an Acworth neighborhood.\n\"Envelopes containing greeting cards had been opened and or stolen, and some of those contained cash and or gift cards,\" Cobb County Police Sgt. Eric Smith told Fox 5 Atlanta (2).\nInvestigators then set up a gift card sting, slipping an envelope containing a $10 Walmart gift card into the Marietta East Cobb post office as an “integrity test”. Court records note the card didn’t go unnoticed. It was allegedly activated and used to buy an iPad, along with several Apple subscriptions.\nMissing mail means more than lost envelopes Records indicate Hinson admitted to taking eight gift cards from greeting cards processed through the East Cobb Road post office. Investigators later recovered nine more greeting cards from her vehicle, turning what started as routine complaints into a criminal case.\nThe number of items involved may seem small, but for many households, the postal system is how bills get paid, legal notices arrive, holiday gifts are sent and personal messages from loved ones make it home.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has warned that thieves often target gift cards because once they’re redeemed, the money is typically gone for good (3). In fact, during the first nine months of 2021, nearly 40,000 consumers reported losing $148 million to gift card-related theft.\nThose risks exist within a system operating at an extraordinary scale. Data from virtual mailbox provider Postal suggests that more than 542,000 pieces of mail were lost or went missing nationwide between 2022 and 2024 (4). During that time, the U.S. Postal Service delivered more than 100 billion pieces of mail annually, including 112 billion in 2024, 116 billion in 2023, and 127 billion in 2022.\n\nStory Continues\nUSPS says undelivered mail represents only a small share of overall volume, citing factors such as incorrect addressing, misrouting and theft. Even a limited failure rate can have meaningful consequences when mail carries bills or irreplaceable personal gifts.\nRead More: Vanguard reveals what could be coming for U.S. stocks, and it’s raising alarm bells for retirees. Here’s why and how to protect yourself\n\nMaking sure your package arrives safely Since the envelopes Hinson opened had not been processed or stamped, investigators suspected the mail had been taken before leaving the postal system. Police later confirmed the suspect lived in the same neighborhood where residents reported finding open mail.\n\"If anyone is going to send gift cards or cash through the mail, it's not recommended because anyone can intercept them,” Smith told Fox. “Once they're intercepted, almost anyone can use them.”\n\nTo reduce the risk, it’s recommended that senders opt for tracking or signature confirmation, and drop mail directly at post offices or secure collection boxes, rather than residential mailboxes. Digital gift cards can also be a safer option, alleviating the uncertainty that comes with mailing physical cards.\nBut the most reliable option may be the simplest one: hand-delivering gifts to close friends and family. It removes unpredictability and ensures your package makes it to its destination.\nIf your mail goes missing, the USPS advises customers to act quickly (5). They can submit a request through the Missing Mail search tool on USPS.com or contact their local post office to open a ticket. For mail that appears stolen, opened or tampered with before delivery, reports can be filed with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the federal agency responsible for investigating mail-related crimes.\n\nYou May Also Like Become the landlord of Whole Foods and Walmart without lifting a finger.

      "Content": "Six Charts That Show How Stock Markets Got Reshaped in 2025\n\nMichael Msika and Jan-Patrick Barnert\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nGOOG\n\n^VIX\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Stock investors can’t claim that this year has lacked market drama.\nIt didn’t always look likely, but equities have managed strong returns in 2025, weathering shocks like DeepSeek of China’s challenge to US artificial intelligence and the tariff storm unleashed by the Trump administration in April.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nDips were bought at record pace and a fear of missing out on the rally dominated sentiment. In the background, a powerful wave of diversification swept through the market as investors responded to the cracks appearing in so-called US exceptionalism by buying up European, Asian and emerging-market stocks.\nHere are six charts that capture some of the key episodes that reshaped equity markets in 2025:\n\nThe year started with investors maxed-out on American exposure and convinced US dominance was here to stay. But DeepSeek shook the status quo in the AI world, while President Donald Trump’s April tariff salvo all but spelled the end of the bull market that began in 2022. Still, as Trump dialed back his trade war, interest rates fell and the global economy showed resilience, investor confidence returned.\nThat didn’t spare US stocks from bearing the brunt of the selloff. And they never fully caught up with the rest of the world, held back by a weakening dollar. The greenback hasn’t clawed back its 13% slump in the first half, while a growing chorus of strategists has recommended international equities over their US peers.\nMSCI Inc.’s gauge of global stocks excluding the US is tracking its strongest outperformance over the S&P 500 since 2009.\nThe US flagship index is missing from the ranks of best-performing benchmarks, but it did still achieve decent enough gains of 14%. The nagging worry for investors has been the concentrated nature of those returns. “Bubble in the making” became a key concern this year, with some data echoing the early stages of excessive internet over-valuations. The tech sector’s weighting in the S&P 500 reached a record 36%, breaching the previous peak of 2000 leading into the dotcom crash, before retreating below 35%.\n\nA closer examination of this year’s trading reveals unprecedented levels of concentration behind the gains on Wall Street. Tech megacaps powered the rally all year long, with just five stocks accounting for nearly 45% of the benchmark’s returns: Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile excitement around AI has driven returns in the US and Asia, the story has been very different in Europe, a market crucially lacking tech stocks. Here, other thematics stepped to the fore. Banks led Europe’s rally, surging on the way to their strongest year since 1997, while governments’ defense, energy and infrastructure spending commitments lifted the names set to benefit from these outlays.\nThe upshot of all this is the widest dislocation in market leadership between the US and Europe ever seen. Value stocks inspired the advance in Europe, while growth equities led it in the US. This pushed investors into unchartered territory, as equity factors typically move in similar fashion.\nInvestors buffeted by April’s extreme turbulence could hardly have anticipated the relatively smooth ride they had the remaining three-quarters of the year. No drawdown exceeded 5% until November, with each dip enthusiastically snapped up at a rapid clip. The AI narrative, solid earnings and the leftovers from April’s sudden positioning washout encouraged investors to chase stocks steadily higher. The impressive rally stalled only as exuberance over AI was questioned in the final stretch of the year.\nStrong appetite for stocks has been accompanied by the destruction of volatility this year. Considering historical reset patterns for the VIX Index, it’s surprising how often the gauge managed to retrace a spike of 40% or more within a 10-day trading period. This didn’t happen at all before 2011, but has already occurred several times in topsy-turvy 2025.\nStock investors embraced the notion that volatility spikes have become increasingly short-lived. A new market logic appears to have taken hold: stocks panic, volatility gets bid, the risk event is resolved, gamma supply takes over and volatility quickly retreats.\nUS option volumes marked fresh highs, with two daily prints exceeding 100 million turnover this year for the first time. To emphasise the increased demand, trading volume was above 60 million daily contracts on 117 days compared to only 12 days in 2024.\nWhile hedging demand played a role in April and November, most of the time it was calls dominating the tape. With investors chasing the right tail as well as volatility sellers using ultra short-term contracts to earn income, the options market remains a key factor for stocks, contributing to the swift resets in volatility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-becomes-debt-collector-developer-235619315.html",
      "Content": "Apple becomes a debt collector with its new developer agreement\n\nSarah Perez\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 3:56 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nApple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.\nThe change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\n\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, US, and, now, Japan , where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though possibly not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\nIn its new developer agreement , Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\n\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee , called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\n\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developer’s other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\n\nStory Continues\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\n\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "PayPal CEO Alex Chriss says stablecoins will be key as his company navigates the ‘classic innovator’s dilemma’\n\nBen Weiss\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:44 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: PYPL\n\nSTRI.PVT\n\nAAPL\n\nWhen PayPal launched almost three decades ago, the company made its name as one of the world’s first fintechs. Now, PayPal faces a slew of competitors, from the payments colossus Stripe to Big Tech giants like Apple . “One of the challenges when you are at a certain scale and you’ve been around for a while is the very classic innovator’s dilemma,” Alex Chriss, the president and CEO of PayPal, told Fortune . “What you’ve done has worked, and are you constantly thinking about how to disrupt yourself?”\n\nInvestors are likely wondering the same thing. Since January, PayPal’s stock price has dropped more than 30% as it tries to halt competitors from encroaching on its core products of online checkout and peer-to-peer payments. In response, the fintech is looking to get a lift from next-generation payment products like stablecoins, and working to incorporate them across its operations and products.\n“If you were to build the payments ecosystem from scratch today, it wouldn’t look like the way it does today,” said Chriss. “You would start to use some sort of blockchain, or some sort of thing that probably looks a lot like stablecoins.”\nEarly movers Chriss isn’t a latecomer to crypto. Around 12 years ago, he split the bill for a steak dinner with his friend—but decided to pay his friend back with four Bitcoin. That’d now be worth more than $350,000 at current prices. “I remind him every once in a while when I see him just how expensive that steak meal actually was,” Chriss joked.\n\nPayPal was also early to the world of digital assets. In 2014, around the same time Chriss was paying his friend back in Bitcoin, PayPal announced that a subsidiary would accept payments in the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\nDespite that bout of early experimentation, PayPal largely stayed away from crypto until 2020, when it let users buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin, Ethereum and a handful of other cryptocurrencies in its digital wallet. It’s since expanded its crypto offerings and, in 2023, took a major strategic step with the launch of its own stablecoin, PYUSD.\n“We’re a payments company and a commerce company globally, and so really the heart of what makes it really interesting about blockchain technology is thinking about stablecoin payments,” May Zabaneh, PayPal’s head of crypto, told Fortune .\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. Long popular among crypto traders, the dollar-backed tokens have more recently become touted as tools to upgrade legacy payments infrastructure, speed up cross-border transactions, and reduce transaction fees.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmid the hype, the market capitalization of PYUSD has soared—from about $500 million at the start of January to nearly $4 billion in December. While that pales in comparison to the market leader Tether, whose own stablecoin has a market capitalization of more than $185 billion, PayPal is focused more on the strategic opportunities.\n\n“Most people are focused on stablecoins’ trading market cap. They’re really doubling down in that aspect,” said Zabaneh. “But when you take it from a payments lens, you actually cut it in a very different way.”\nCurrently the payments giant is focused on integrating its stablecoin across its business verticals, bit by bit. Users can hold and earn rewards off of PYUSD in PayPal’s digital wallet and Venmo, another wallet the fintech owns. Customers who use PayPal’s payouts product, like YouTube , can elect to let recipients receive payments in the fintech’s stablecoin. And the company is even using PYUSD for its internal treasury. From August to October, PayPal transferred $1 billion in company funds across five of its corporate entities on three different continents, a spokesperson told Fortune .\n\nMeanwhile, the company also lets customers use its stablecoin at checkout, and is testing a feature to let existing merchants use PYUSD to pay their bills. “How do we enable consumer-to-business transactions and actually disrupt payments by leveraging stablecoins?” asked Chriss.\nStill, analysts are skeptical that PayPal’s stablecoin ambitions will have any immediate impact on its bottom line in the near term. “There has been no real impact to the business today,” Nate Svensson, a director in equity research at Deutsche Bank who follows PayPal, told Fortune .\nBut, that doesn’t mean there won’t be an impact in the future. “If I [were] running PayPal, I would be doing the exact same thing,” added Svensson. “I would be coming up with these solutions and capabilities, just in case there is a future eventuality where you and I start using crypto or stablecoins on a day-to-day basis.”\nAnd it’s a future that PayPal CEO Chriss, who happens to own two hippo-themed NFTs, believes in. “Crypto within PayPal as a priority is top down. It’s being led by me,” he said. “I’m making sure that crypto is top of mind and something that we’re investing in as a company.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla’s ‘Musk Premium’ in Focus With SpaceX IPO in View\n\nJordan Fitzgerald\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nMU\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\n(Bloomberg) -- (Updates stock price after Thursday’s open)\nElon Musk is selling investors a future of driverless cars, robot assistants and life on Mars. The problem for investors is there’s only one way to buy into his vision: Tesla Inc.’s stock.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nNew York Utility Says Queue for Large Power Users Has Tripled\n\nThe electric-vehicle maker’s shares were up nearly 3% on Thursday. They hit their first record of the year on Tuesday amid gains of more than 20% over the last four weeks. Since tumbling to a low on April 8 during the height of panic over the Trump administration’s tariffs, the stock has soared almost 120%, putting it among the 20 best performers in the S&P 500 Index.\nThe rally is a testament to Wall Street’s faith in Musk’s artificial intelligence ambitions, particularly since Tesla’s core auto business is struggling. But it has also made Tesla shares extremely expensive. At 214 times earnings over the next 12 months, the stock has the second highest valuation in the S&P 500, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and far ahead of number three, Palantir Technologies Inc., another high-flyer that trades at 178 times forward earnings as of Wednesday’s close.\n\n“The valuation doesn’t make any sense,” said Vikram Rai, portfolio manager and macro trader at First New York, which sold its Tesla position earlier this year after Musk and President Donald Trump had a very public fallout on social media.\nA Tesla representative didn’t reply to a request for comment.\nWith Musk’s SpaceX possibly going public next year, stock traders looking for “Elon exposure” will likely have another way to get it before long. The space exploration company is planning an insider share sale that would value it at $800 billion, making it the most expensive privately held business in the world. Its initial public offering would be the largest ever.\n\n“A SpaceX IPO could lead to some selling pressure on Tesla shares,” said Dmitry Shlyapnikov, an analyst at Horizon Investments who works with portfolio managers. “There are investors that own Tesla for exposure to Elon’s ideas and not for the car company attached to the ticker.”\nOf course, there’s another school of thought that a SpaceX public stock offering would shine a spotlight on Musk, giving Tesla another jolt of momentum.\n\nStory Continues\n“Historically, when one of Musk’s companies achieves a major milestone, it tends to lift sentiment for the others,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments. “A high-profile SpaceX IPO could attract a fresh wave of investors who are drawn to his innovation story — and that enthusiasm often spills over into Tesla.”\n\nSo far, Tesla’s stock price is getting a boost from the hype surrounding SpaceX, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. The missions of the two companies are interlinked, he said, describing a future where Tesla’s Optimus robots help with Musk’s ambition to colonize Mars, and SpaceX’s Starlink satellite system bolsters vehicle connectivity on Earth.\nThe companies also share lofty valuations. But Tesla skeptics question whether the company’s fundamentals can support those numbers. Its sales are slowing and profits are falling, while regulations rise and consumers spend less on cars.\n“If you’ve been long Tesla stock, you’ve made money, there’s no denying it,” said Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry, who has a small short position in Tesla. “It’s just bizarre to me because the fundamentals are so bad.”\n\n‘Double-Down on Elon’\nOptimists, on the other hand, point to Tesla’s growth prospects with opportunities in autonomous driving and robotaxis. Musk’s goal is to transform Tesla from an auto manufacturer to an artificial intelligence and robotics company. He wrote in a September X post that 80% of the firm’s profits will eventually come from robots.\n“We believe Tesla’s earnings are going to be growing at 30% to 35% over the next two to three years based on the innovation that they have in the automotive segment,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which owns the company’s shares.\nIf Musk can pull that off, Tesla’s stock market valuation would make more sense. If he can’t, that’s where SpaceX comes in. Publicly traded shares of SpaceX would give investors the opportunity to own a piece of Musk’s vision without Tesla’s baggage.\n\n“I think most investors will not want to double-down on Elon,” First New York’s Rai said. “That is a lot of risk to carry.”\nNeedham analyst Chris Pierce disagrees.\n“We don’t see investors making an either/or choice, but instead backing both companies,” he said. “Investors that have made money in Tesla are likely to want to back another Musk venture.”\nFor now, the reality for investors is Tesla is the only way to bet on Musk’s vision. The immediate risk is the stock’s valuation, which is getting close to dangerous territory. On a technical level, the shares had been close to being considered overbought earlier this week. When they last reached that level in early October, the stock fell 10% over the next seven sessions.\n“In the short term, it’s probably ready for a bit of a cooling off type of period after having that all-time high,” Mulberry said.\n\nBut to long-term Musk believers, the valuation may indeed be a short-term concern. Over the next few years, however, many see Tesla as a buy regardless of the price — possibly even more than SpaceX.\n“I fully believe that at some point there will be a commercial mission to Mars, but probably not in my lifetime,” said Mulberry, who is 51 years old. “Does that mean I want to invest in that stock today?

      "Content": "Apple opens up its App Store to competition in Japan\n\nSarah Perez\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nEPGA.PVT\n\nApple announced it will allow alternative app stores in Japan and will permit developers to process payments for digital goods and services outside of its own in-app purchase system in iOS. The iPhone maker is not making these changes because it wants to be more open; it’s being forced — in this case, to comply with the country’s Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which is now going into effect.\n\nWith this update , Apple’s App Store revenues are being impacted in another major market due to anticompetition laws and regulations. The company already has to comply with Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which previously required the tech giant to allow for alternative app stores and other changes.\nIn the U.S., Apple has been strong-armed into changing its in-payments system by way of the courts , after a lawsuit from Fortnite maker, Epic Games. Though it was not declared a monopoly, the court decided Apple needed to give developers the right to process payments outside of its system if they chose. (The specifics around that order are still being worked out after an appeal partially reversed an earlier ruling. )\nAs usual, in its announcement about the changes in Japan, Apple warned that alternative app marketplaces and payments open up “new avenues for malware, fraud, scams, and privacy and security risks.” To mitigate those risks, the company said it worked with Japanese regulators to require an authorization process for app marketplaces (“Notarization”), which it says is designed to protect children specifically from inappropriate content and scams.\n\nThe fact that Apple has come up with a process to dial back the risk for alternative app stores indicates there has always been a technical solution at hand to balance the needs for both openness and security.\nAs in the EU, Apple has come up with a complex fee structure to ensure it doesn’t lose much in the form of App Store revenue, while seemingly complying with the letter of the law.\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, of course, was not silent on this matter, saying Fortnite will still not return to iOS in Japan because Apple is charging a 21% fee on third-party in-app purchases.\nIn a post on X, he wrote , “Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan. Apple chose poorly. Again.”\n\nHe also pointed out the difference between Apple and other game store providers, like Microsoft, by asking, “Can you imagine the gamer and regulator uproar that would ensue if Microsoft required all games from Steam and Epic Games Store to call its commerce surveillance API and report all transactions back to Microsoft?”\n\nStory Continues\n“That’s what Apple just announced in Japan,” he added.\nApple noted that developers will need to agree to the latest update to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, which includes the new options for Japan , by March 17, 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump says Americans need to prepare for something the US ‘has never seen.’ How to get ready (and wealthy) in 2026\n\nJing Pan\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:13 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nJNJ\n\nTM\n\n005380.KS\n\n^GSPC\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nPresident Donald Trump says the U.S. is on the cusp of something “this country has never seen” — and he’s crediting his much-discussed tariff policy.\nSpeaking at a White House Christmas reception, Trump argued that tariffs are driving a manufacturing revival, pointing to the auto industry as a prime example (1).\n\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“Our car industry … went to Europe, they went to Mexico, Japan — they went all over. They went to South Korea,” Trump said. “And now it’s just the opposite. They’re all coming back. We have an age that’s coming up, the likes of which this country has never seen.”\nTrump pointed to Toyota, which recently announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in its U.S. operations over the next five years (2). According to Trump, companies are increasingly choosing to build in the U.S. to avoid tariffs.\n“So they’re coming from Germany, they’re coming from Japan, they’re coming from Canada. Many factories are coming in because they don’t want to pay tariffs — very simple. They’re coming in and they’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said.\nThe result, Trump says, could be a historic economic upswing.\n\n“We have a country that potentially is geared to have the most incredible golden years ever,” he said, adding that when factories open up “by the thousands,” it would mark “the golden age of America.”\nTo be sure, that manufacturing boom has yet to materialize. According to the Institute for Supply Management, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the ninth consecutive month in November (3).\nStill, Trump insists the turnaround is coming soon.\n“You’re going to see results in six months to a year. I think you’ll see results — we’ve never had anything like it,” he said.\nBetting on America While Trump’s tariff policies have drawn criticism, major companies continue to view the U.S. as one of the most dependable places to build and grow. That confidence is showing up in the scale of capital they’re committing — across multiple industries.\nFor instance, Apple has announced a sweeping $600 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and workforce training (4). Johnson & Johnson plans to put $55 billion into U.S. manufacturing, research and development and new technologies (5). Hyundai, meanwhile, is investing $26 billion in the U.S. to boost automotive production capacity, localize key components and accelerate work on future industries (6).\n\nStory Continues\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett has long pointed to America as a prime destination for building long-term wealth.\n“America has been a terrific country for investors. All they have needed to do is sit quietly, listening to no one,” Buffett wrote in his 2023 letter to shareholders (7).\nOne of the simplest and most accessible ways to invest in America is through the stock market. Buffett has argued that doing so doesn’t require picking individual winners.\n\n“In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,” Buffett has famously stated (8). This approach gives investors exposure to 500 of America’s largest companies across a wide range of industries, providing instant diversification without the need for constant monitoring or active trading.\nIf you want to capitalize on this consistency, you could work with SoFi to invest in ETFs like an S&P 500 index fund.

      "Content": "2 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy No Matter What Happens in 2026\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points These two tech leaders had a challenging year but have demonstrated their resilience.\nThey also boast strong prospects and economic moats, making them excellent long-term investments.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nIn 2025, tariff threats and trade wars rocked equities and nearly triggered a full-blown bear market. Despite all that, stocks have performed pretty well this year.\n\nWhat's in store for 2026? Nobody knows. However, some companies can navigate the challenges ahead -- whatever they may be -- and perform well over the long run. These are the kind of businesses that investors want to set their eyes on.\nHere are two excellent, well-known candidates that fit the bill: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . These longtime market beaters are still worth investing in and sticking with next year and beyond.\n1. Amazon Amazon has basically moved sideways this year. The e-commerce specialist is lagging broader equities and most of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers. What's going on with the company?\nThere are several things, and here's one of the most important: Many investors are worried that the company is losing market share to its closest competitors in the cloud computing industry.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) accounts for most of Amazon's operating profits, as it boasts much juicier margins than its e-commerce operations. If it loses ground in this market, Amazon could see slower-growing earnings. That said, Amazon is showing it can perform well, despite this issue.\nDuring the third quarter, the company's sales growth within AWS accelerated, compared to recent quarters, and was stronger than anything investors have seen since 2022. Amazon maintains its lead at the top of the cloud computing industry.\nElsewhere, the company is seeking ways to enhance margins and profits within its e-commerce division. To that end, it has deployed a fleet of industrial robots in its warehouses.\nThe company's goal with this initiative is twofold. First, it will seek to cut costs while making shipping and deliveries faster, thereby improving the customer experience. Amazon's efforts here could help increase its razor-thin margin in its e-commerce division. Even a relatively small improvement may meaningfully boost the company's earnings.\n\nSecond, Amazon has several other potential growth drivers. Its advertising business is going strong, and it's making strides within its healthcare division, thanks to initiatives such as Amazon Pharmacy. And here's the best part: The industries and markets where it dominates still have significant long-term growth prospects.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's the case with e-commerce, which, despite its seeming ubiquity, still captures less than 20% of retail transactions in the U.S. It's also true of cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), which, CEO Andy Jassy has observed, are still in their early innings.\nLastly, Amazon has a wide economic moat due to its brand name, switching costs, and network effects. The company's investment thesis remains intact, despite the headwinds it has faced in 2025.\n\n2. Apple Apple is more exposed to the threat of tariffs than perhaps any of its similarly sized peers. The company still generates most of its sales from its hardware devices, particularly the iPhone, which is manufactured in countries such as China -- a country on which the Trump administration tried to impose steep tariffs.\n\nDespite all that, Apple's shares are up 12% year to date. That's below the performance of the S&P 500 but better than many expected six months ago.\nApple's strength lies in its ability to continue convincing new and existing customers to purchase more iPhones. The company's latest launch, the iPhone 17, was well received and is expected to drive a strong renewal cycle over the next three years, helping to maintain decent sales growth.\nHowever, Apple's hardware business isn't where the company's most important long-term opportunities lie. The company's services segment -- where Apple boasts more than 1 billion paid memberships -- arguably takes that crown. It accounted for a meaningful 39% of its sales, as of the last quarter.\n\nMoreover, the services segment has been growing its revenue, on average, faster than the rest of the business for years, a trend that should continue for the foreseeable future. Since services boast significantly higher margins than hardware sales, Apple's profits should increase meaningfully over the long run as the company expands this segment.\nRevenue from services will rise as Apple's large installed base of devices expands. The company routinely hits new highs in that department. And given the company's high switching costs -- Apple makes it hard to leave its ecosystem -- Apple's installed base should, at the very least, remain stable.\nApple has demonstrated that it can navigate the threat from tariffs, still maintains a solid hardware business, and boasts attractive tailwinds within services. To top it all off, it remains an excellent dividend stock . These are all good reasons to stick with Apple in 2026 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

( AAPL , Financials ) said it would allow alternative iPhone app shops in Japan to comply with new smartphone competition laws. Japanese developers may launch app marketplaces and pay Apple for transactions at 5% under the new architecture.

Developers pay Apple up to 30% on digital sales. Japan's new laws vary from Europe's, where Apple must expose its iOS environment. Apple approves third-party marketplaces in Japan and applies age ratings and notarization to any software sold outside its store.Apple also charged 15% for external payment connections in applications and 26% for App Store in-app purchases. Apple must also handle third-party device access requests, although it may refuse privacy-risky requests. The legislation requires hardware compatibility.Apple claimed it reduced security risks and maintained privacy requirements under the new approach. The company's compliance in Japan follows European and US legal actions. By 2025, Japan's restrictions will harm Apple's valuable services business, so investors will look for updates.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

That give us:\n\n10 – 1.35 x 100 = $865.\nIf we take the maximum gain divided by the maximum loss, we see the trade has a return potential of 15.61%.\nThe loss probability is 17.0%, although this is just an estimate.\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion rating is a 100% Buy with a Average short term outlook on maintaining the current direction.\nLong term indicators fully support a continuation of the trend.\nApple Bull Put Spread\nFor Apple, let’s also look at the Bull Put Spread results for January.\nLet’s use the first line item as an example. This bull put spread trade involves selling the January expiry $265 strike put and buying the $255 strike put.\nSelling this spread results in a credit of around $1.74 or $174 per contract. That is also the maximum possible gain on the trade. The maximum potential loss can be calculated by taking the spread width, less the premium received and multiplying by 100. That give us:\n10 – 1.74 x 100 = $826.\nIf we take the maximum gain divided by the maximum loss, we see the trade has a return potential of 21.07%.\nThe loss probability is 28.8%, although this is just an estimate.\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion rating is a 80% Buy with a Weakening short term outlook on maintaining the current direction.\n\nStory Continues\nLong term indicators fully support a continuation of the trend.\nRelative Strength just crossed below 50%. The market is indicating support for a bearish trend.\nConclusion\nThere you have two bullish trade ideas on two different stocks. Remember to always manage risk and have stop losses in place.\nPlease remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

      "Content": "Alphabet Has Another Hidden Asset, and Its Value Is About to Go to the Moon in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Alphabet's core business remains Google, but it has several other prominent businesses.\nThe company has some hidden assets in Waymo and quantum computing, but a lesser-known one is its investment in space companies.\nThe company is about to see a big windfall from its earlier investment in SpaceX.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is best known for Google, which is the most dominant search engine on the planet. Google commands an approximate 90% market share in search, in large part due to the distribution advantages it has. The company owns both the world's leading web browser in Chrome and the No. 1 smartphone operating system in Android.\nAlphabet also has a search revenue-sharing deal with Apple to be the default search on all its devices. This essentially makes Google the gateway to the internet for most people. Meanwhile, the company monetizes its search engine through the massive global ad network it has created, which can serve everything from global brands to local merchants. It has gained both the trust of users and advertisers, creating a power network effect that is still in place, even as the market shifts due to the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) .\nAlphabet's many businesses However, Google is not Alphabet's only business. It also owns the popular YouTube streaming service, which is the largest video platform on the planet. It also owns a plethora of apps and tools, such as Google Maps, Gmail, and Google Workspace. The company also helps other websites and apps monetize their content through its AdSense network.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's fastest-growing segment is its cloud computing business, Google Cloud. This is an infrastructure-as-a-service business that has been seeing strong growth driven by AI, as customers look to build out their own AI models and apps.\nAlphabet has established a nice edge in this business, as the company has developed its own custom AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), that give it a big cost advantage compared to competitors. It has also helped build one of the top large language models (LLMs) in Gemini, which it lets customers use as a foundational model to build upon. And it's infused Gemini across its own products to make them better.\nAlphabet also has some attractive emerging bets. The one furthest along is its robotaxi business, Waymo. Waymo is expanding rapidly across the U.S. and recently surpassed 450,000 weekly paid rides. It currently has a big first-mover advantage in the U.S. and is also looking to expand internationally into Tokyo, Japan, and London, England. This business could be a big growth driver for the company in the future.\n\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, it is also making strides in the area of quantum computing. Its Willow chip has shown the ability to correct errors in real-time as it scales, which is a major hurdle for the space. Quantum computing is likely many years away from becoming a contributing business, but it's another area where Alphabet is leading the way.\n\nAnother hidden asset While Waymo and its quantum computing unit are two hidden assets at Alphabet, they are not the only ones. Alphabet also owns about a 7% stake in Elon Musk's SpaceX, which could IPO late next year.\nAlphabet made a $900 million investment in SpaceX back in 2015, when the company was valued at around $12 billion. In a secondary market transaction, the company was recently valued at $800 billion, and Musk has said he will be looking for a $1.5 trillion valuation in an IPO. That would value Alphabet's stake at over $100 billion.\n\nSpaceX could look to go public next year to help fund an increasing launch schedule. The company has launched over 100 rockets just this year, with more than 70 for its own Starlink satellites. The company has established a huge satellite network that now powers its Starlink high-speed mobile internet service, which can work around the globe, even in remote areas. That business has been booming, with the company having more than 8 million customers, and the service available in 150 markets and being used by about two dozen airlines.\nSpaceX also makes money through launch services for both the U.S. government and commercial customers. Meanwhile, it also has big ambitions for orbital data centers, which would use solar power from the sun and have free cooling. While that may sound far-fetched, a lot of companies are actually looking into it, including Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet plans to test orbital data centers with its Project Suncatcher, in partnership with satellite imagery company Planet Labs , in which Alphabet owns a 10% stake. It will launch two prototype satellites in 2027 to test the technology and how the hardware handles being in space. Alphabet also owns a stake in AST SpaceMobile , which has a technology that lets satellite networks connect to current smartphones.\nSo, in addition to its many well-publicized businesses, Alphabet also has a nice investment portfolio of intriguing space businesses, one of which is about to be worth a lot of money in SpaceX. However, that's just an added reason to own the stock. The main reason to own it is that it's becoming an AI leader that has the most complete tech stack of any company, with its highly regarded custom AI chips and world-class Gemini AI model. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively valued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27 times 2026 analyst estimates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Mobile phone IDs may help fight fraud\n\nJustin Bachman\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 1:37 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nThis story was originally published on Payments Dive . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Payments Dive newsletter .\nFraud represents a global financial scourge but people&rsquo;s biometric connections to their mobile phones could help better thwart criminals.\nA secure digital identification system paired with the common face and fingerprint ID tools in Apple and Google-Android devices could do more to reduce fraud schemes, Rep. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat, said Tuesday.\n\nThe &ldquo;tool at hand&rdquo; to provide a biometric-based identification system to fight fraud is &ldquo;trusted electronics in your cell phone associated with a national ID, a Real ID, a passport, something similar to that,&rdquo; Foster said. &ldquo;Other countries get this. And it&rsquo;s amazing how that just enables a flowering ecosystem of financial products.&rdquo;\nFoster and Rep. Dan Meuser, a Pennsylvania Republican, spoke at a financial conference sponsored by a banking trade group and The Hill, a Washington media organization.\nA digital ID offers multiple anti-fraud benefits in that a digital passport or Real ID-compliant driver&rsquo;s license offers &ldquo;a legally traceable person,&rdquo; said Foster, who sits on four House committees that deal with financial services, financial technology, national security and illicit finance.\n\nAdditionally, the digital ID is being presented on a mobile phone associated with the same ID and the device can confirm that the rightful owner had completed a biometric login, said Foster, whose district covers western suburbs of Chicago.\nA person&rsquo;s biometric access and their digital ID within the device could become a potent combination to help quash many fraud attempts, Foster said, with Meuser in agreement.\nMost of the recent Android-based and Apple phones require a biometric login to use them &ndash; Apple&rsquo;s latest iPhone 17 is unlocked with facial recognition technology &ndash; but the concept of integrating one&rsquo;s identification documentation into phones is far newer.\nThere are steps in that direction, however. Last month, Apple introduced a Digital ID function for its phones to allow users to load their passport information into its wallet tool.\n\nThat ID, accessed on an Apple phone or watch, is being tested for domestic travel at 250 airports with the Transportation Security Administration.To date, 19 states and Puerto Rico have begun allowing digital IDs , although not every state recognizes every device, and some states require use of their own app, according to the TSA.\n\nStory Continues\nDespite the growth of digital technologies, many U.S. businesses and government agencies still take a dated approach to identity security, said Meuser, who sits on the House Committee on Financial Services with Foster.\n&ldquo;They ask you your mother&rsquo;s maiden name, things like that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sort of rudimentary compared to what could be done and is being done successfully elsewhere.&rdquo;\n\nPandemic benefits distributed by the federal government in 2020 demonstrated the shortcomings of the U.S.&rsquo;s current system of ID verification and payments, Foster said, explaining how hackers intercepted as much as $300 billion in benefits payments to U.S. taxpayers.\n&ldquo;And that did not happen in countries that had a secure digital ID,&rdquo; he said.\nIn those countries, Foster said, people eligible for government benefits logged into their phones to authenticate their bank account information, with funds sent directly to that account holder.\n&ldquo;That stopped the North Korean hackers cold, because they can steal a million passwords, but unless they also steal a million cellphones and can do the biometric login on those stolen cell phones, they&rsquo;re out of business,&rdquo; he contended.\n\nOne big challenge for digital ID efforts &ndash; or what Foster termed &ldquo;something that sort of smells like a national ID card&rdquo; &ndash; is that people on the left and right sides of the political spectrum object vociferously, he noted.\n&ldquo;The vast majority of people in the middle just want a system that is reasonably secure and reasonably private and very trustworthy,&rdquo; Foster said. &ldquo;People are sick and tired of spending the afternoon on hold, changing all of their credit cards and magazine subscriptions because someone&rsquo;s stolen their numbers.&rdquo;\nRecommended Reading\nPayment players offer fraud fixes\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is one of the Top AI and Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. On December 8, Evercore ISI lifted the price target on the company’s stock to $325 from $300, while keeping an “Outperform” rating on the company’s stock. As per the analyst, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s upcoming Siri 2.0, powered by Gemini, is expected to act as a catalyst for potential upside in profits and valuation. The strategic launch has been planned for March 2026.\nIn a different update, Citi raised the price objective on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s stock to $330, hinting at stronger-than-expected momentum for the iPhone 17 cycle, along with a healthier upgrade pool moving ahead into 2026 and 2027. Notably, the firm expects iPhone upside in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s December and March quarters, amidst iPhone 12 and 13 users entering the company’s upgrade window. Also, Citi raised its earnings estimates to reflect iPhone 17 strength.\n\nThe firm’s analyst expects further tailwinds due to the company’s shift to WMCM (Wafer-level Multi-Chip Module) packaging in 2026. This can enable efficiency gains and place future devices for heavier on-device AI workloads. Furthermore, the firm bases the new target on a ~33x multiple of 2027 earnings. According to Citi, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s margin profile, services mix, and balance sheet tend to justify the premium.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

These updates create new options for developers to distribute apps on alternative app marketplaces and to process app payments for digital goods and services outside of Apple In-App Purchase. Across these changes, Apple has worked to reduce new privacy and security risks the law creates to provide users in Japan the best and safest experience possible.\n\nThe MSCA’s requirements for alternative app marketplaces and app payments open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, and privacy and security risks. Apple has worked with Japanese regulators to introduce protections from new threats — including important safeguards for younger users. These protections include Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization process for app marketplaces, and requirements that help protect children from inappropriate content and scams.\nWhile these safeguards do not eliminate the new risks, they are essential to Apple’s work to ensure iOS remains the best, most secure mobile platform available in Japan. Apple will continue to engage with regulators on strengthening protections for iOS users.\nDevelopers can learn about the new capabilities on the Apple Developer Support page and can integrate them into their apps beginning today as part of the iOS 26.2 release.\n\nNew Options for Developers to Distribute Apps on iOS in Japan\nThe App Store® — where every app is reviewed to meet the App Store’s high bar for privacy and security — remains the best place for iOS users in Japan to discover and download the apps they love. This includes App Store features that protect users against fraud and scams and empower parents to ensure their kids have age-appropriate experiences.\nWith the MSCA’s new requirements, developers will also have the option to distribute iOS apps in Japan using alternative app marketplaces other than the App Store. Alternative app marketplaces will have to be authorized by Apple and will need to meet ongoing requirements to serve developers and users. However, apps downloaded outside the App Store will not benefit from the same protections Apple provides through App Review, introducing new risks for apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content not allowed on the App Store.\n\nStory Continues\nTo reduce some of these new risks, Apple will conduct a baseline review — called Notarization — that applies to all iOS apps and focuses on basic functionality and protecting users from serious threats. This Notarization process involves a combination of automated checks and human review, and helps ensure apps function as promised and are free of known malware, viruses, or other security threats. However, Notarization is less comprehensive than the App Review process that applies to all apps on the App Store.\n\nDevelopers can learn more about operating or distributing from alternative app marketplaces on the new Apple Developer Support page .\nNew Options for Payments in App Store Apps on iOS\nOn the App Store, users in Japan can continue to use Apple In-App Purchase to buy digital goods and services, manage subscriptions, request refunds, and view their payment history.\nTo comply with the MSCA, Apple is sharing tools that enable developers to offer more ways for users to purchase digital goods and services in apps on the App Store. For their iOS apps distributed on the App Store in Japan, developers will be able to include an alternative payment processing method in their app and/or link users to a website to complete a transaction.\nThese alternative payment options will always be presented alongside Apple In-App Purchase, so that users in Japan are clear on when they are transacting through Apple. When users choose to pay with Apple In-App Purchase, they’ll continue to receive familiar protections and tools like refund support, subscription management, and Report a Problem. App Store users’ purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using Apple In-App Purchase.\n\nFor apps that use alternative payment processing or link users to the web for transactions, Apple will not be able to issue refunds and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud. Users may need to share their payment information with additional parties, which can introduce new privacy and security risks.\nUpdated Business Terms for iOS Apps in Japan\nTo reflect these options for app distribution and payment processing, Apple is also sharing updated business terms for developers’ iOS apps in Japan. These business terms reflect the many ways Apple creates value for developers’ apps, whether or not they use the App Store and/or Apple In-App Purchase.\nUnder the business terms for iOS apps in Japan, Apple will continue to only charge a commission on the sale of digital goods and services. The new terms include:\n\nApp Store commission : iOS apps on the App Store will pay a reduced commission of either 10 percent for the vast majority of developers — including members of the Small Business Program, Video Partner Program, Mini Apps Partner Program, and for subscriptions following their first year — or 21 percent on transactions for digital goods and services. The App Store commission reflects the value of the tools, technology, and services that enable developers to create apps, in addition to App Store distribution, discovery, and ongoing services.\nApple payment processing fee : In their iOS apps on the App Store, developers can process payments using Apple In-App Purchase for an additional 5 percent fee.\nStore services commission : iOS apps on the App Store will pay a commission of 15 percent on transactions for digital goods and services made on a website linked to by the developer’s app. Developers in the programs mentioned above, and subscriptions following their first year, will pay a reduced rate of 10 percent.\nCore Technology Commission : iOS apps distributed outside of the App Store will pay a 5 percent commission on the sale of digital goods and services, including paid apps. The Core Technology Commission compensates Apple for the tools, technologies, and services that enable developers to build and share their apps with iOS users.\n\nUnder these new business terms, developers that sell digital goods and services in Japan will pay Apple the same or less than they do today. Developers that do not sell digital goods and services will continue not to pay Apple any commissions or fees.\nImpacts to Kids’ Online Safety\nApple created the App Store to be a safe place for kids, where parents are empowered to ensure their children have age-appropriate experiences and have the tools they need to keep their children safe online. That’s why Apple has created industry-leading features like age ratings, Content & Privacy Restrictions, content filters, Ask to Buy, and powerful controls that help parents choose how children use their devices.\nWith the changes introduced under the MSCA, the new options for alternative distribution and payment methods may expose children to new risks. For instance, apps downloaded from outside the App Store may include illicit and objectionable content, and they will not undergo the same rigorous review process Apple employs to evaluate apps made for children on the App Store. For instance, similar regulatory changes in Europe have enabled types of apps that were previously unavailable on iOS, including pornography apps.\n\nIn an effort to reduce new risks of fraud or scams targeting children, Apple has worked with regulators in Japan to preserve some guardrails, including:\nApps in the Kids category on the App Store will not include links to websites to complete transactions, to reduce the risk of fraud or scams targeting children.\nFor users under 18 years old , all apps from the App Store that use alternative payment processing or link to a website for transactions must include a parental gate that requires younger users to involve their parent or guardian before making a purchase.\nFor users under 13 years old, apps from the App Store cannot link to websites for transactions to protect against the risk of scams that target younger kids.\nApple is also working to provide developers using alternative payments with a new API so they can enable parents to monitor and approve purchases made outside of Apple In-App Purchase.\n\nDevelopers must also continue to provide age ratings for their apps, whether their app is distributed on the App Store or an alternative app marketplace.\nApple will continue innovating to meet the evolving risks to kids’ safety online by building on the powerful tools and features it makes available today — like Child Accounts, web content filters, app restrictions, monitoring tools like Screen Time and Family Sharing, Communication Safety, and Communication Limits, which help parents shape who their children communicate with and shield them from inappropriate content.\nAdditional Updates to iOS\nAlongside the new app distribution and payment options, Apple has introduced additional controls and choices for users in Japan with the release of iOS 26.2. These include:\n\nA browser choice screen and search engine choice experience , giving users in Japan new ways to pick their preferred browser and search engine.\nDefault controls for navigation apps and app marketplaces.\nAcross these controls, users can review and adjust their choices at any time in Settings.\nFor developers, Apple is sharing tools in addition to the new options for alternative distribution and app payments, including:\nNew options for developers of browser apps to use alternative browser engines other than WebKit, with strict security and privacy requirements.\nA new API that enables developers of voice-based conversational apps to provide users the option to launch their app with the iPhone® side button.\nA process to request interoperability with core technologies in iPhone and iOS.\n\nApple is providing detailed resources to help developers understand the options now available for their apps in Japan, which they can access from the Apple Developer Support page .\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple’s six software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV.

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the Next $4 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:50 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Alphabet's market cap has come out of nowhere to surpass Microsoft's.\nMassive investments in its technology and the release of Gemini 3 have dramatically changed perceptions about the Google parent.\nAlphabet has the second-lowest P/E ratio in the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nMany investors were shocked when Nvidia became the first company to achieve a $4 trillion market cap . The competition for the world's largest market cap was long a contest between Apple and Microsoft , so to see Nvidia emerge out of nowhere likely came as a surprise.\nNow, the question is, which company is the next to achieve a $4 trillion market cap? Today, Apple has already achieved that, but instead of Microsoft (which previously reached that point before retreating), I believe another emerging company will be the next one to reach this milestone. Here's why.\nThe next $4 trillion company Today, the stock most likely to reach $4 trillion and stay above that point is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . Currently, its market cap is at $3.7 trillion, surpassing Microsoft's current $3.5 trillion market cap.\nThat choice may come as a surprise to some investors. As recently as spring 2025, the Google parent's market cap was under $2 trillion.\nAlphabet stock had long been smaller than many of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, as the rise of ChatGPT weighed on the stock. When GPT-4 came out in 2023, investors soured on Google Search, and its market share had fallen below 90% for the first time in decades.\nAt that point, not only did ChatGPT offer more thorough and concise results, but it bypassed the advertising ecosystem that had long served as the primary source of the Google parent's revenue.\n\nThe company released Google Gemini later that year. Still, Gemini did not initially stand out from the likes of Claude, Grok, Copilot, and numerous other AI platforms trying to unseat ChatGPT.\nAlso, investors should remember that Alphabet has long worked to reduce its dependence on advertising for revenue. In recent years, Google Cloud has claimed an increasing share of the revenue. Still, even though Alphabet was an early pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI), these efforts did not seem to impress investors.\nWhat changed? However, Alphabet has long benefited from a massive level of liquidity and considerable free cash flows. In late 2024, it pledged to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures (capex) in 2025, later raising that to the $91 billion-$93 billion range.\nMuch of that spending has gone into improving legacy products. Search now incorporates AI-driven results, and Google Cloud offers upgraded infrastructure, multimodality AI models, and new tools for developers. Additionally, AI should help to make Waymo a source of revenue as it seeks to compete in the autonomous driving space.\n\nStory continues\nNonetheless, it seems to be the release of Gemini 3 in November that has captured the most attention recently. With improved reasoning, coding, and multimodal understanding, some analysts claim it is \"better than ChatGPT.\"\nWith that, the stock is up more than 60% over the last year, and more than 110% from its April low. Not surprisingly, almost half of that increase has occurred since October.\nMoreover, despite these gains, it is the second-cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. Its P/E ratio of around 30 is undercut only by Meta Platforms , a stock trading at 28 times earnings. That comparative discount could give investors all the more reason to continue buying stock in the Google parent.\nAlphabet at $4 trillion (and beyond) Between the relatively low valuation and the newfound success of Gemini 3, Alphabet appears likely to reach $4 trillion next.\nUltimately, investors like winners in cutting-edge technologies, and amid Alphabet's massive investments, having Gemini 3 perceived as \"better than ChatGPT\" positions Alphabet stock for higher moves.\n\nAdditionally, the AI pioneer is aggressively applying the technology to Google Cloud, and its efforts with Waymo could begin to bear fruit soon. As investors notice the stock as undervalued relative to peers, it continues to benefit from numerous tailwinds.\nAmid such successes, Alphabet may not only reach $4 trillion, but could challenge Apple and Nvidia for the world's largest market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 2 AI Darlings Will Be Worth $5 Trillion or More in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Nvidia's growth is expected to be rapid in 2026.\nAlphabet could see its valuation increase and strong growth continue to cross the $5 trillion mark.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nCurrently, there are no stocks with a $5 trillion market cap or greater. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is valued at $4.3 trillion, and was recently valued at over $5 trillion before pulling back. Following up Nvidia are Apple at $4 trillion, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) at $3.7 trillion, and Microsoft at $3.5 trillion. These are the only real candidates that can be worth $5 trillion or more, as Amazon is the fifth-largest company in the world at $2.6 trillion, which means its stock would have to more than double to breach the $5 trillion threshold.\nSo, of these four, which ones could be worth $5 trillion or more in 2026? I think there are only two real answers, and one may surprise you.\nReaching the $5 trillion valuation threshold won't be easy for one of these stocks It should come as no surprise that I think Nvidia will cross the $5 trillion valuation threshold in 2026. It's still growing at a rapid pace thanks to its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPU) technology stack. Demand for artificial intelligence computing power in data centers isn't slowing down, and it is shouldn't for some time. Nvidia believes global data center capital expenditures will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from $600 billion in 2025. Should that come to fruition, Nvidia would be a monster performer over the next five years, and 2026 is shaping up to be another phenomenal year.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs, although he didn't elaborate on how far in the future they are sold out. Regardless, demand outpaces supply for its GPUs, which allows it to maintain high prices and lofty profit margins. This will fuel Nvidia's growth in 2026, and Wall Street analysts are expecting 48% growth again in fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027) after rising a projected 63% in fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026).\nWith growth like that, it won't take a whole lot for Nvidia to reach the $5 trillion threshold in 2026.\nHowever, it will take a bit more effort from Alphabet.\nAlphabet was a bit of a laggard in the AI arms race because competitors launched generative AI tools before it did. Furthermore, the initial release of its model was bad and caused several PR nightmares. However, Alphabet has addressed those issues and is now one of the leading providers of generative AI. In addition, Alphabet's core Google search business was spared from being broken up due to monopoly concerns earlier this year, and its future is now much clearer than it was just six months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nSince July 1, Alphabet's stock has been on fire, rising about 80%. However, for Alphabet's stock to be worth $5 trillion, it must rise at least 35% from today's levels.\nCan it do that?\nAlphabet's earnings growth has been impressive in recent quarters There are a few ways for a stock to rise: growing revenue and earnings, or an increase in valuation. Both of these are reasonable actions for a share price to rise, and Alphabet will likely need a boost from both to cross the $5 trillion threshold. In Q3, revenue rose 16% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 35%. If Alphabet can keep up its EPS growth, then it could cross the $5 trillion threshold with growth alone. However, I think it could also use some help in the valuation department.\nDespite growing at the same pace or faster than Apple or Microsoft, Alphabet trades at a discount from a price-to-earnings perspective.\nShould Alphabet's stock receive a 35 times trailing earnings valuation, that would result in 14% growth alone.\nAlphabet will need all the help it can get to reach a $5 trillion valuation by the end of 2026, but I think it can do it. Even if it doesn't, I think it could easily reach that level by 2027.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Fueled by strong demand for anything tied to artificial intelligence (AI) , investors steadily bought stocks and pushed the Nasdaq-100 index to several new all-time highs.\nWhile the \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks helped lead the way higher, 2026 may not be a repeat. If you're looking to invest in tech, it may be time to look beyond just Nvidia , Microsoft , and Apple . While these have been terrific-performing companies for a long time, there are a number of opportunities within the sector that may be flying under the radar.\nIn particular, undervalued areas of the tech sector could see better performance. The mega-cap companies, as well as chip stocks, have really gotten all the attention lately. Areas, such as software and digital payments, could enjoy renewed interest if investors begin seeking out more value-oriented stocks backed by healthy fundamentals.\nHere are three tech ETFs that I believe could outperform in the coming year.\nInvesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: RSPT) invests in all of the big large-cap tech companies, but removes the concentration factor. It equally weights the roughly 70 tech stocks within the S&P 500 and rebalances quarterly to ensure it maintains its diversified exposure.\n\nRSPT is a great way to invest in the tech stocks that have led the market over the past several years, but broaden out the exposure in case the mega-cap names begin to underperform. We've already seen some hints that investors are worried about Magnificent Seven valuations. This ETF allows you to invest in the long-term tech narrative while mitigating some of that idiosyncratic risk.\nTop holdings currently include Western Digital , Micron Technology , and Teradyne .\nAmplify Digital Payments ETF Think of the one thing that almost every person does at least once a day (and probably multiple times): buy something! Years ago, people would pay for these purchases using cash or a check. Today, everybody uses credit cards or some form of digital payment, such as PayPal .\nThe Amplify Digital Payments ETF (NYSEMKT: IPAY) invests in all the major companies that provide payment services. Its top three holdings -- American Express , Visa , and MasterCard -- are all major credit card issuers, but other companies within the top 10 reflect how the entire sector is evolving. PayPal is more of a traditional online payment platform. Global Payments is a payment processor and software provider. Coinbase Global is a cryptocurrency trading platform.\n\nStory Continues\nThe transaction processing space is already a big cash flow generator. Adding the next-generation fintech evolution to it provides a great long-term growth opportunity.\niShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF Ever since coming out of the 2022 bear market, software has been a tech laggard. The AI boom had investors gravitating toward semiconductor stocks, leaving certain segments of the sector underbought and unloved.\nWithin the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGV) , there are a lot of high-quality companies with strong revenue growth and solid margins that could finally see some of that value get unlocked in 2026. Top 10 holdings include Palantir Technologies , Salesforce , Intuit , and ServiceNow alongside industry heavyweight Microsoft.\n\nSoftware is intriguing because it covers so many areas within tech. IGV is essentially an investment in cloud computing, enterprise automation, cybersecurity, and AI productivity tools. There's constant demand for performance improvement and staying ahead of the latest threats. That makes a lot of these companies steady cash flow generators that can actually add some stability to a portfolio.\nWith software lagging behind the Nasdaq-100 in 2025, there's some catch-up potential in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amplify ETF Trust - Amplify Digital Payments ETF right now?

      "Content": "Dear BlackBerry Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for December 18\n\nAnushka Mukherji\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:44 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BB\n\nAAPL\n\nOnce a household name in smartphones, BlackBerry (BB) famously lost its grip on the booming mobile market to Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone and Android-powered rivals. After walking away from handset manufacturing altogether, the company reinvented itself as a software-driven player focused on Internet of Things (IoT) and cybersecurity solutions. Even as competition in the cybersecurity software space continues to heat up, BlackBerry stock has still managed a respectable run in 2025, albeit with some volatility, supported by solid financial performance that has helped keep investor confidence intact.\n\nThat optimism was reinforced in September, when BlackBerry delivered a strong fiscal 2026 second-quarter earnings report, highlighted by particularly robust results from its QNX segment, which quickly caught the market’s attention. Now, the company is preparing to report its third-quarter earnings on Dec. 18, and Wall Street is heading into the release expecting meaningful gains in the upcoming quarter. With that backdrop, here’s a closer look at what lies ahead for BlackBerry.\nMore News from Barchart While AI Panic Struck Applied Digital (APLD) Stock, the Smart Money Has a Different View\nJPMorgan Says to Sell NVDA March $160 Puts. Should You Actually?\nCathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock. Should You?\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nAbout BlackBerry Stock Founded in 1984, BlackBerry built its legacy as a pioneer of secure mobile communication, once dominating the smartphone market with its iconic keyboard devices. Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, the company has since exited the handset business completely and reinvented itself as a software-first enterprise focused on mission-critical technologies. Today, BlackBerry supports enterprises and governments with intelligent software and services that keep the world running behind the scenes.\n\nThe company’s high-performance foundational software empowers top automakers and industrial leaders to build transformative applications, open up new revenue opportunities, and introduce innovative business models, while maintaining the highest standards of safety, security, and reliability. Its QNX operating system is a key revenue engine, embedded in millions of vehicles worldwide and increasingly central to next-generation automotive and industrial systems.\nAlongside this, BlackBerry’s cybersecurity business delivers endpoint protection, secure communications, and threat intelligence to enterprises and governments, positioning the company as a behind-the-scenes enabler of safety, security, and connectivity in an increasingly digital world. The company is currently valued at a market capitalization of roughly $2.6 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nAfter surging an impressive 32.34% over the past year, BlackBerry’s rally has lost some steam more recently as investors weigh uncertainties around its ongoing shift toward cybersecurity and IoT, along with renewed debate over the company’s long-term direction. Even so, the stock has held up well in 2025, rising a solid 12.04% for the year, just a notch below the broader S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 14.49% gain during the same stretch.\nA Look Inside BlackBerry’s Q2 Performance On Sept. 25, BlackBerry delivered a standout second-quarter earnings report that showcased clear operational progress and marked its second consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. The results exceeded expectations across the board and sparked a strong market reaction, with the stock surging nearly 9% on the day of the announcement, followed by another 6.7% gain on Sept. 26.\n\nFor the quarter, BlackBerry reported revenue of $129.6 million, up 3% year-over-year (YOY), comfortably topping Wall Street’s $122 million forecast and landing above management’s own guidance. Strength was evident across BlackBerry’s key businesses, led by its QNX division, which focuses on embedded software for automotive and IoT applications. QNX generated $63.1 million in revenue, representing a robust 15% YOY increase and coming in ahead of guidance.\nAlso, the segment delivered an impressive 32% adjusted EBITDA margin, while its adjusted gross margin remained flat at a healthy 83%, highlighting the durability and profitability of the platform. The company’s Secure Communications segment, which includes UEM, SecuSUITE, and AtHoc, also posted solid results, generating $59.9 million in revenue during the quarter.\n\nImportantly, Secure Communications' annual recurring revenue (ARR) continued to trend higher, rising both YOY and sequentially to $213 million, signaling improving momentum and revenue visibility. Profitability further strengthened BlackBerry’s investment case. The company posted GAAP earnings of $0.02 per share, a sharp reversal from a loss of $0.03 per share in the year-ago quarter.\nOn an adjusted basis, earnings came in at $0.04 per share, well ahead of Wall Street’s $0.01 estimate. Additionally, BlackBerry returned $20 million to shareholders through the repurchase of roughly five million common shares during the quarter, while total cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term investments declined $18.4 million sequentially to $363.5 million.\n\nDear BlackBerry Investors, Mark Your Calendars for Dec. 18 Looking ahead to the third quarter, BlackBerry’s management has laid out an upbeat outlook. The company expects revenue to come in between $132 million and $140 million, with the fast-growing QNX segment projected to deliver $66 million to $70 million in revenue. Meanwhile, Secure Communications revenue is forecast to land in the $60 million to $64 million range. On the bottom line, BlackBerry sees adjusted earnings of $0.02 to $0.04 per share, signaling continued progress on profitability.\n\nWith that backdrop, the former smartphone pioneer is set to report its third-quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday, Dec. 18, and anticipation is clearly building. Options markets are pricing in a sizable move of 10.18% around the earnings release, reflecting heightened investor interest. Looking further out, analysts covering the stock expect third-quarter earnings of $0.03 per share, which would represent a striking 200% YOY improvement and underscore the momentum behind BlackBerry’s turnaround.\nHow Are Analysts Viewing BlackBerry Stock? Despite the buzz around BlackBerry’s upcoming earnings, Wall Street’s overall tone remains somewhat cautious. The stock currently carries a consensus “Hold” rating, reflecting a wait-and-see stance among analysts. Of the seven analysts covering the name, just one is bullish enough to rate it a “Strong Buy,” while the other six are sitting on the sidelines with “Hold” recommendations.\nRegardless, room for upside is still possible. The average price target of $5.06 points to a potential gain of 19.34% from current levels. At the same time, the most optimistic Street estimate pegs the stock at $6, implying upside of up to 41.51% if BlackBerry delivers on expectations.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Investors Love Warren Buffett, So Why Aren’t They Listening to His Warning?\n\nRich Duprey\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:31 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nBRK-B\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nQuick Read Warren Buffett has been a net seller of stocks for 12 straight quarters. Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK-A , BRK-B ) now holds a record $382B in cash.\nBerkshire reduced its Apple stake from 50% of the portfolio to 20% over the past year.\nThe Buffett Indicator sits at 223%, signaling extreme overvaluation at 77% above trend line.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nWarren Buffett's remarkable success over six decades has turned Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE:BRK-A )( NYSE:BRK-B ) into a phenomenon with something close to a cult following. Since assuming the helm of Berkshire in the mid-1960's, the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has delivered better than 5 million percent returns, about 20% annually or twice those of the S&P 500 over the period.\nEvery year, thousands of investors travel to Omaha for the annual shareholder meeting, often called the \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" to hear Buffett share his insights on investing and business. As Buffett's long tenure as CEO nears its end -- he plans to step down by the end of the year -- many fans continue to admire him.\nYet, despite their adoration, investors appear to be ignoring the warning he has been giving about the stock market.\n\nBuffett's Actions Speak Louder Than Words Now, Buffett has not issued any explicit warnings about an impending market crash. He hasn't said, don't buy stocks. However, his portfolio moves raise clear concerns.\nFor three consecutive years -- 12 straight quarters -- Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of stocks. The company sold more equities than it bought, with net sales reaching billions of dollars in recent periods. This pattern has built a record cash pile of approximately $382 billion.\n\nBuffett has made occasional purchases, including new stakes in tech names, but few major aggressive bets. For example, he has unloaded shares in Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) reducing his stake from about half of the portfolio down to 20%, but he bought over 5 million shares in UnitedHealth Group ( NYSE:UNH ) in the second quarter this year.\nAnalysts interpret this cash buildup as preparation for opportunities when prices drop, indicating he is uncomfortable with current market valuations.\nA Classic Value Approach in Action This strategy aligns with Buffett's core value investing philosophy of not overpaying for stocks. As he put it, \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\" By holding massive cash reserves, Berkshire positions itself to deploy capital advantageously during downturns and buy numerous \"wonderful\" stocks.\n\nStory continues\nInvestors may question how to identify overvaluation today. While AI-driven gains have propelled stocks --and stock valuations -- higher, echoing past tech booms, many of these companies are supported by genuine demand growth that continues to grow.\nBuffett, though, has provided investors with guidance through key metrics. In a 2001 Fortune article, he described the ratio of total U.S. stock market capitalization to GDP as \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\"\n\nA Persistent Red Flag Known as the Buffett Indicator, this metric divides total market cap -- often using the Wilshire 5000 as a proxy -- by U.S. GDP. Readings above 100% indicate potential overvaluation, and below that -- around 70% to 80% -- undervaluation. It should be noted that Buffett has since backed away from relying solely on one measure, instead using a more holistic approach to determine valuation. However, even Buffett himself can't be ignoring the flashing red lights of what the Buffett Indicator is signaling today.\n\nCurrent readings are at record highs. Today, the Wilshire 5000 shows a total market capitalization of around $68.7 trillion while U.S. GDP currently sits around $30.5 trillion, or about 223% -- some 77% above its trend line. Historically, levels above 200% have signaled extreme overvaluation and \"playing with fire,\" as Buffett once warned. Even adjusted versions exceed the long-term averages near 100%.\nThese figures indicate stocks have far outpaced economic output, raising the risk of a correction if growth or earnings fail to justify prices.\nKey Takeaway Every sign points to Buffett viewing the market as extremely overvalued, prompting his shift to cash. His consistent net selling over three years and record hoard underscore patience for better entry points. Investors who ignore Buffett's warnings do so at their own peril.\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Apple Plans Major iPhone Expansion as Global Sales Accelerate\n\nMoz Farooque ACCA\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:51 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nApple Inc. ( AAPL , Financials ) is expanding its iPhone lineup as worldwide sales show signs of improvement. Early indicators suggest the iPhone 17 is performing well across several regions, including China, giving Apple room to push for growth over the next two years.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with APP.\nIs AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nCurrently, Apple sells five iPhone models globally, though industry watchers expect that number to rise by 2027. Reports citing internal roadmaps and supply-chain sources suggest Apple could introduce as many as seven models by that time, though the company has not officially confirmed such an expansion and the final lineup remains subject to change.\nOne of the most anticipated developments is Apple's first foldable iPhone, widely rumored to arrive in September 2026. According to supply-chain and concept reports, the device may unfold to roughly the size of an iPad mini, representing Apple's most significant iPhone design shift in years. That said, Apple has not confirmed the form factor, specifications, or final design.\n\nLooking further ahead, Apple is also expected to mark the iPhone's 20th anniversary in 2027. Concept leaks and analyst speculation point to a bold redesign, potentially featuring a near-edge-to-edge display, but these descriptions are based on rumors rather than official disclosures .\nApple's push to broaden its product range reflects intensifying competition and rising expectations around on-device AI features, including a more capable Siri. With the iPhone still accounting for roughly half of Apple's revenue, the stakes remain high.\nAs Apple prepares for its next major product cycle, investors will closely watch upcoming product events for clarity on how much of this reported roadmap ultimately becomes reality.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Services Rides on Apple TV and Arcade: What's Ahead for Apple Stock?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:37 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nDIS\n\nApple AAPL has been riding on a strong Services business, driven by strong Apple TV content and an expanding Apple Arcade game portfolio. In fiscal 2025, the Services business accounted for 26.2% of net sales with revenues growing 14% year over year, better than 13% year-over-year growth in fiscal 2024. Strong Apple TV content and an expanding Apple Arcade game portfolio have been catalysts for the Services business over the past couple of fiscal years.\n\nApple’s endeavor to continuously expand its Arcade game portfolio is expected to keep subscribers engaged in the upcoming holiday season. The latest farming expansion, which is massive, is expected to keep players engrossed with Sneaky Sasquatch . SpongeBob: Patty Pursuit 2 , PowerWash Simulator , Cult of the Lamb Arcade Edition, Subway Surfers+ and NARUTO: Ultimate Ninja STORM+ are the new games that joined Apple Arcade in December. Cozy Caravan , Sago Mini Jinja’s Garden , True Skate+ and Potion Punch 2+ are the new games set to join in January 2026.\n\nApple’s focus on expanding sports content is noteworthy. Beginning in 2026, all Major League Soccer (MLS) games will be available to stream for Apple TV subscribers at no additional cost. Apple TV has become the exclusive new broadcast partner for Formula 1 in the United States in 2026 under a five-year partnership. The introduction of Apple TV and the Peacock bundle from Oct. 20 is expected to drive subscriber base.\n\nApple Faces Tough Competition in Streaming Market AAPL is facing stiff competition from the likes of Disney DIS and Netflix NFLX in the streaming space.\n\nDisney’s streaming services — Disney+ and Hulu — now reach 191 million subscribers. The launch of the standalone ESPN DTC service on Aug. 21, 2025, marks a major milestone in repositioning Disney’s ESPN as a fully digital sports powerhouse. Content investments in Marvel and Star Wars franchises are driving strong box office results for Disney.\n\nNetflix has set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, supported by a diversified content strategy, including international programming, live events, and gaming initiatives. For the fourth quarter, Netflix projects $11.96 billion in revenue with 16.7% growth and a 23.9% operating margin, featuring major releases including Stranger Things' final season and NFL Christmas games. Netflix raised its full-year free cash flow forecast to $9 billion from $8-8.5 billion.\n\nAAPL’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Apple shares have jumped 39.7% in the past six-month period, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 22.2%.\n\nStory Continues\nApple Stock Beat Sector in 6 Months\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe AAPL stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/earnings of 32.98X compared with the broader sector’s 27.76X.

      "Content": "My Surprising Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Pick for 2026\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Investors have become impatient with the lack of immediate results from Amazon's increased spending.\nAmazon is adding more computing capacity to Amazon Web Services.\nAdvertising was Amazon's fastest-growing segment in the third quarter.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nThe \" Magnificent Seven \" is the name given to the group of Nvidia , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , Meta , Tesla , and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . These seven companies are bundled together because they have driven much of the stock market's gains in recent years. As of Dec. 15, they are seven of the world's top nine most valuable companies and represent nearly 35% of the S&P 500 .\nSo far this year, every \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has produced double-digit returns except for one: Amazon.\nOnce the face of growth stocks, Amazon has lagged over the past year, frustrating its investors along the way. Despite that retreat, Amazon may be positioned to bounce back in 2026.\nWhy has Amazon's stock been lagging? There hasn't been one issue that's caused Amazon's underperformance. It's more a combination of factors. First, Amazon has spent a lot of money this year, with capital expenditures (capex) of around $90 billion through the first nine months of 2025.\nGiven how much Amazon has been spending (mostly on AI infrastructure), investors have been wanting more to show for it -- especially when it comes to Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth. With many of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks making big splashes in AI, some people viewed Amazon as falling behind in the race.\nAmazon's heavy spending has weighed on its free cash flow, and that's not something investors typically like without seeing more immediate results. Add in how expensive Amazon's stock has been, and there was little room for error in many investors' eyes.\nAWS is positioning itself for the future AWS may not have been producing the results that we've grown used to seeing over the years, but investors jumping ship seems like a premature overreaction (which is no surprise if you know investors). Yes, AWS has been losing market share to Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, but it's still the world's largest cloud platform by far.\n\nCloud platforms are, and will continue to be, crucial to AI training and scaling. That's why Amazon has been focusing so much on building out more infrastructure and adding computing capacity. It has added more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months and plans to double its capacity through 2027.\n\nStory Continues\nThis investment is noteworthy because, according to calculations from investment bank Oppenheimer , each incremental gigawatt of capacity could add $3 billion in revenue. The high capex might be weighing on Amazon's financials right now, but it's poised to pay off in the long term.\nAmazon has an underrated profit machine There's no doubt that AWS is Amazon's profit engine, accounting for most of its operating income. However, advertising is a high-margin business that has been growing steadily over the past couple of years.\nOn one hand, Amazon has access to data from its millions of customers and Prime members, making it more effective at helping advertisers with targeted ad campaigns. They know what customers buy, when they buy it, what they watch, what they listen to, what they browse, and other information that allows advertisers to target with greater precision.\nOn the other hand, Amazon's massive reach means it has plenty of places to set these ads. Whether it's online, when you search for a specific product, stream something on Prime Video, watch Twitch, or listen to music, there's no shortage of real estate for advertisers looking to reach potential customers. Amazon also announced that it recently struck partnerships that allow its advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix , Spotify , and SiriusXM .\n\nIn the third quarter, Amazon's advertising services revenue grew 24% to $17.7 billion, outpacing its revenue from subscriptions ($12.5 billion). Beyond revenue growth, advertising is a high-margin business that can help Amazon boost its overall profitability. I expect the momentum to continue in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Why Sam Altman Sees Apple and Not Google as its Top AI Rival\n\nJoey Frenette\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:03 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nQuick Read Sam Altman views Apple as OpenAI’s top AI rival despite Google’s recent Gemini 3.0 momentum.\nApple pays only $1B annually to use Gemini and plans to integrate it into Siri in 2026.\nApple’s Gemini-powered Siri could become the default iPhone AI option over ChatGPT.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nOpenAI's top boss, Sam Altman, has been quite busy of late responding to Google Gemini 3.0 with a \"code red\" of sorts. And while the latest ChatGPT 5.2 seems to be a worthy rival, questions linger as to whether OpenAI is about to lose its AI lead to the likes of Google and its parent company, Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ). Arguably, the torch has already passed after Gemini 3.0 garnered spectacular feedback while powering impressive App Store downloads.\nThough Google has made massive ground over the past year, I still think it's a tad too early in the game to deem Google as the winner of the AI race, even though Gemini 3.0's strong launch has made a case for switched chatbots. While Google is an AI force to be reckoned with, I found it quite interesting that Altman expressed his view that it's Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), a firm it's partnered up with to offer ChatGPT via Apple Intelligence, as opposed to Google, which could be the most significant AI rival, at least over the long term, for the GPT-maker.\n\nSam Altman is right to acknowledge Apple's AI abilities Sure, such a comment seems laughable for now, especially given where Apple Intelligence currently stands in the AI race. However, as we head into 2026, Apple is going to be launching what could be its biggest AI offering to date: Siri with a Gemini boost. Of course, in the longer term, it might be more about Apple's dominance in software and hardware that makes Apple a serious contender in the AI war.\n\nThough it may seem far-fetched to think that the Cupertino giant is a bigger threat than the likes of Google, which has all the right tools in place to extend its lead in the race, I certainly wouldn't doubt Apple CEO Tim Cook and company as they look to learn from the mistakes of other tech titans to offer an AI experience that's simply better than what most other firms are currently offering. In a prior piece, I shone a bright light on the great deal that Apple was getting to use Gemini.\nJust $1 billion per year to use Gemini and add to it seems like a great deal that only Apple has the leverage to make. The most exciting thing, I believe, is what else Apple adds on top of Gemini. As the AI experience becomes more about what's added on top of a large language model (LLM), it will be very interesting to see how Apple's take on AI will be in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nApple's big AI upgrades are coming. It might be the biggest AI story of 2026 My guess is the Gemini experience will be made that much richer with Apple's polishings added on top. Either way, Apple users are going to get a premium and more exclusive AI product pretty much for free. And that might power a device refresh cycle, the likes of which we may not have witnessed since the COVID lockdown days. Personally, I think Apple's new Gemini-powered Siri could be a hit. And it might cause further competitive pressures for OpenAI.\n\nOf course, ChatGPT is likely to stick around as an option for iPhone users, but if it's not the default option, things could have the potential to get very sticky for OpenAI as it looks to fight off a new threat in Apple, as it continues to do its best to keep up with Google and Gemini. Add the OpenAI device that former Apple CDO Jony Ive has been working on into the equation, and Apple stands out as a top foe in AI consumer hardware.\nAnd with OpenAI also looking to make strides in AI chips, Apple and its M-series chips also stand out as a top rival. If Apple's Siri upgrade goes well, perhaps it's M-series chips in Apple's Private Cloud Compute and A-series chips on the edge that we'll all be using as we stay in that Apple ecosystem.\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle.

So what effect has that been having?\n00:30 Yang\nWell, I mean, first of all, I mean, we we will be looking very closely at the Micron earnings, especially because they've announced recently that they will be winding down the crucial business unit which caters to consumer electronic segment and smartphones. Uh will be the first to get hit.\n00:53 Yang\nNow, come, zooming out a bit. You, when we look at the key memory components such as DRAM, prices have gone up 70% in this quarter, and we've we're projecting it to go up another 40% next quarter. So, what that directly means is that the build cost or bill of materials for smartphones, they have already increased 20 to 30% for, you know, the low-end devices below $200.\n01:29 Yang\nBut even for think of the flagship devices from from Apple, from Samsung, even those prices have will be going up 10 to 15 um percent. Now, what is the compounding effect, right? It means that costs are going up. And then, you know, companies have to make a tough decision, will they bite the the bullet and take the um, take take the additional cost or will they choose, which in our opinion is a likely case, pass through the the cost to consumers.\n02:07 Yang\nAnd in an environment where um prices are high, inflation isn't really coming down yet, it's going to be a tough decision for consumers whether they're going to upgrade or whether they're going to postpone. And in our, in our understanding, through our consumer surveys, they're very likely to to postpone and that means it's leads to our our latest forecast that the smartphone shipments for the global market next year is going to be coming down 2.1%.\n02:44 Yang\nAnd that is a big um delta from uh from what has happened in this year, which the market grew 3%. So a a swing of 5% is going to be painful for all industry players in the smartphone industry.\n03:00 Speaker A\nYang, when's the last time there was a decline in shipments year over year?\n03:04 Yang\nWell, I mean, the last time we had a big decline was in 2022, 23, when obviously on the onset of the the Ukraine war, you had inflation and uh central banks hiking rates. So, of course, that, you know, there was also the compounded effect of a massive amount of pent up demand working from home. So there was a lot of um device refreshes ahead of it.\n03:41 Yang\nSo, entering into that cycle, you had a lot of um supply chain pains, but on the demand side, it created. So, luckily, and in looking at what's going to turn out next year, we see demand remaining fairly resilient, and that's mainly because the trading environment has been fairly stable. I mean, the growth engines, emerging markets, you look at big markets like India, Southeast Asia, they're still on a growth trajectory.\n04:16 Yang\nUm the US, you know, China, Europe remaining stable, and let's not forget, um US, China, um the the one year uh trade war or tech war truce. And that kind of paves a stable environment for our industry. So thankfully, we're not get going to get a demand collapse. But yeah, I mean, on the, who knows what happens in a year's time when, you know, we uh we hopefully get out of the memory squeeze cycle, but then geopolitics could rear its ugly tail again.\n05:08 Speaker A\nYes, most definitely. And who knows also the AI build out what other kind of knock on effects it will have. And Mandeep, I want to bring you back to to pose that question to you because we just heard Yang talking about the higher prices of memory chips, um and the effect that could have smartphones, but I'm also curious for the AI build out itself. Um, you know, are we going to see price volatility in all of the things needed to go into that build out and have the major players really insured their supply or are we going to see a lot of volatility there as well?\n06:01 Mandeep\nYeah, I mean, you could see, you know, supply shortages and certain components at a given point of time, but to my mind, you know, the buildout is more or less uh you know, certain in the sense like that three trillion number in aggregate spending through 2030 does sound very plausible given what we have seen in terms of the intent around AI investments and uh frankly speaking, the ROI that people are seeing when it comes to the generative AI use cases, whether it's coding agents or customer service.\n07:00 Mandeep\nSo from that perspective, you know, the buildout will take place. It's just a question of whether, you know, the neo clouds uh aren't able to raise funding at a given point of time because of concerns around excessive leverage or, you know, there could be some component shortages, which is why CoreWeave had to push out its data center going live last quarter. So all those are part of the build out, but there is no doubt that, you know, uh companies are committed when it comes to uh deploying AI and and they do need the compute uh which is pretty much uh a requirement when it comes to uh doing inferencing uh on these large language models.\n07:53 Speaker A\nYeah.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The stock market is being powered by 10 stocks that are fueling AI bubble fears\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nUpdated Wed, December 17, 2025 at 6:28 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\n^SPX\n\nGOOG\n\nIf you're in the \"stock market is in a bubble\" camp, look no further than the composition of the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nThe top 10 stocks now account for roughly 32% of S&P 500 earnings and over 41% of total market capitalization — levels not seen since at least 1980, according to new data from Barclays strategist Venu Krishna.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been the primary driver of this market power concentration. Those seven companies — Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Apple ( AAPL ) — are essentially powering the artificial intelligence boom.\nThese stocks are up on average 21% this year compared to a 15% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data. Alphabet is the top performer with an advance of 62% amid optimism on its new Gemini 3 model.\nIn turn, the valuation of the S&P 500 has reached a level even most bulls would agree is on the rich side. Krishna's work reveals the S&P 500 is trading at the 91st percentile relative to its 10-year valuation history.\n\"Complacency\" could ignite an AI bubble, Deutsche Bank strategist Adrian Cox told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (video above).\nRead more: How AI, unemployment, and interest rates could shape the stock market and your investments next year\nIndeed, complacency appears to have settled in, despite the risks investors had to endure this year.\nRemember the \"Liberation Day\" tariff spectacle in April? The S&P 500 tanked 4.8% the day after President Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on April 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped a staggering 1,679 points.\n\nTariffs are now in effect, though they are not as severe as first advertised.\nAnd more recently, disappointments from AI darlings CoreWeave ( CRWV ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) have begun to call into question the near-term outlook for the AI trade.\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation in 2026 in the AI trade,\" Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye said on Opening Bid .\nAlphabet is Essaye's top AI pick for 2026, though he acknowledges there are likely to be winners and losers from the Magnificent Seven complex next year.\n\"I think companies like Oracle that [are] not overextended financially but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that is tied to open AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" Essaye added. \"There's going to be some pretty serious bifurcation. We've seen it in the last, say, two months of 2025. I think that gets worse in 2026.\"\n\nStory Continues\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "Can Apple close the AI gap in 2026? Morgan Stanley weighs in\n\nSam Boughedda\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:05 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nMS\n\nGOOG\n\nInvesting.com -- Morgan Stanley believes Apple could make progress in artificial intelligence distribution in 2026, but warned the company is still likely to lag peers in core AI capabilities despite an anticipated overhaul of Siri.\nIn a note led by analyst Erik Woodring, the bank said Apple “will become a leading distributor of AI technologies with a Siri re-release in spring 2026,” supported by closer collaboration with external partners such as Google’s Gemini.\n\nThe bank added that these partnerships, rather than in-house development, are expected to be the main driver of Apple’s AI strategy next year.\nHowever, Woodring struck a cautious tone on Apple’s competitive position, saying the company “will remain less relevant in the game of AI in the coming year.”\nIt is believed that Apple’s relatively conservative AI investment over the past two to three years means it will take time to catch up with rivals, even if Apple Intelligence improves through third-party large language models.\nWoodring argued that Apple Intelligence has yet to meaningfully accelerate iPhone upgrade cycles.\nDespite strong consumer interest, the firm estimated that replacement cycles lengthened in fiscal 2025, with shipment growth driven more by an ageing installed base than by new AI features.\n\nThat could begin to change with a Siri relaunch expected in spring 2026, when Apple is likely to integrate a customised Gemini model to deliver more advanced functionality.\nThe bank noted that Apple is stepping up AI spending, including higher operating expenses and capital investment, but said execution risks remain.\nMorgan Stanley feels monetisation is likely to come later, with a paid Apple Intelligence tier “as early as 2027,” once adoption and user engagement are established.\nRelated articles\nCan Apple close the AI gap in 2026?

      "Content": "Warner Bros will urge shareholders to reject hostile bid as Trump attacks Paramount\n\nUna Hajdari\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 4:54 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nORCL\n\nWarner Bros Discovery is expected to recommend that shareholders vote against a hostile takeover bid from Paramount Global, according to reporting from several news outlets, dealing a blow to Paramount’s massive $108bn (€92.2bn) attempt to take over the rival studio. Euronews has reached out to Warner for further comment.\n\nThis comes after Paramount announced it was planning to go to Warner Bros' shareholders directly in early December with an all-cash $30 per-share offer — bypassing the board after the studio rejected several of its acquisition proposals. Netflix, on the other hand, is proposing $27.75 per share in cash and stock.\nSince the acquisition battle heated up, Warner Bros stock has been trading closer to $30 per share, shooting up from around $24 per share earlier this month.\nWhy is Warner Bros so hot right now? The battle for Warner Bros has become a test of who will dominate the US media industry.\nWhoever acquires the company would gain access to an extensive film and studio content library licensed under Warner Bros, as well as HBO content and the DC Comics franchise, which includes legacy characters such as Batman and Superman.\n\nThe company's share price was widely considered to be undervalued as the company became bogged down by heavy debt and intense competition from Netflix, Amazon, and Apple.\nOn 5 December, Netflix made a formal offer for Warner Bros Discovery, which the company’s board agreed to support and which included HBO Max and HBO, after a high-stakes months-long bidding war.\nIn a statement, the streaming giant confirmed the mammoth $82.7bn (€71bn) deal, which is being framed as a bringing together of \"two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,” Warner Bros CEO and president David Zaslav said at the time.\nIf Warner Bros does break its current agreement with Netflix, it will owe the rejected streamer a $2.8bn (€2.4bn) fee.\n\nEven so, Paramount still faces a number of hurdles before it can claim victory over Netflix, with critics notably questioning the financing of the offer.\nRelated\nWarner Bros Discovery weighs sale after 'unsolicited' buyer interest\nParamount goes hostile in bid for Warner Bros, challenging Netflix\nNetflix wins battle for Warner Bros as HBO joins streaming giant’s empire\nIs Trump's son-in-law involved? President Donald Trump weighed in publicly on the Warner Bros sale a week ago, arguing that the news network CNN should be sold as part of any transaction involving its parent company. He criticised the network’s current leadership as “corrupt or incompetent”, insisting CNN be divested to secure broader political balance in their coverage.\n\nStory Continues\nParamount’s acquisition proposal included acquiring cable and broadcast news assets currently owned by Warner Bros. This sparked worries among some lawmakers and observers that editorial coverage could shift, particularly with regard to reporting on the Trump administration.\nBillionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is one of the principal financial backers of Paramount Skydance’s hostile bid, providing a large portion of the equity that underpins the offer and helping to secure other investors. His son, David Ellison, is chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance.\n\nThat affiliation — coupled with the Ellisons’ friendship with Donald Trump and their role as major Republican donors — has led some analysts to believe that the Skydance bid is not merely a commercial offer but also a play for political influence.\nJared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, or more specifically his private equity firm Affinity Partners, was initially listed as a backer of Paramount’s hostile takeover bid. The firm has since pulled out of the financing consortium.\nIn a not-so-atypical turnaround, Trump criticised Paramount on Tuesday evening, claiming that he was not actually as cosy with Paramount as it may have seemed. Paramount owns CBS, a station that ended production of 'The Late Show' earlier this year. When the programme's cancellation was announced, some suggested the decision linked to host Stephen Colbert's criticism of the Trump administration. At the time, CBS said it was \"purely a financial decision\".\n\nThe axing of the 33-year-old show came just days after Colbert publicly criticised Paramount for settling a $16mn (€13.7mn) lawsuit with Donald Trump at a time when the company was seeking regulatory approval for its Skydance merger.\n“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that '60 Minutes' has treated me far worse since the so-called 'takeover', than they have ever treated me before,” Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday night. “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n'60 Minutes' is a news show produced by CBS and was the subject of the $16mn defamation case settled earlier this year. Trump claimed that producers edited an interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris in a way that was deliberately deceptive.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Alphabet a Top Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy for 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet's rise in 2025 is due to low expectations entering the year.\nAlphabet could open a new business unit in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the best big tech stocks to own in 2025. Its stock has risen 65% so far in 2025, outperforming nearly all of its big tech peers, like Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , and even Nvidia . However, after a great 2025, some investors may be a bit more concerned about what 2026 will hold. After all, it isn't easy to follow up a strong year with another.\n\nIf you look into the reasons why Alphabet's stock had a great 2025, it's clear that it frees the stock up to have another strong 2026, although it will be difficult to be as impressive as 2025 was. I think this makes Alphabet a great buy heading into 2026, and I'd expect Alphabet to emerge as the second-largest company in the world, behind Nvidia.\nAlphabet faced several doubts heading into 2025 To understand why Alphabet's 2025 was so successful, we need to rewind the clock to the start of 2025. Then, there were several question marks surrounding Alphabet's business. Alphabet's core business is the Google Search engine, and there were questions about its future in the generative AI (artificial intelligence) world. Many thought that Google's best days were behind it, and slipping market share didn't help that opinion.\n\nFurthermore, there was a pending court case questioning the status of Google as a monopoly. Investors didn't know what Alphabet's business would look like in the future, as it could be broken up. As a further negative mark against Alphabet, it was losing the AI race. Competing models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and other models like Perplexity and Claude far outperformed Gemini.\nInvestors were very skeptical of Alphabet's future, and there was heavy bearish sentiment on the stock. At its low point in April, Alphabet's stock traded for less than 14 times forward earnings . That's value stock territory, and showcased the market's negative outlook on Alphabet's future.\nBut then, everything changed.\nSlowly, all of the question marks surrounding Alphabet's stock were answered, and the results were incredibly positive.\n\nAlphabet received positive news regarding its monopoly court case in September. It wouldn't be broken up, although it did have to make a few minor concessions. The fear that Google Search would be dethroned ended after AI overviews became incorporated into each result. This hybrid approach of traditional search and generative AI turned out to be a great compromise and has maintained Google's place at the top of the search engine market. Google's generative AI model, Gemini, also emerged as a leader in its industry. It was such a threat to OpenAI's dominance that it called a \"code red\" due to Gemini's improvements.\n\nStory Continues\nWith all of those problems being resolved, Alphabet's stock was free to be valued at the same level as its tech peers. Now, it trades for around 30 times forward earnings.\nWhile this isn't necessarily cheap, it places Alphabet on a level playing field and allows its business results to shine in 2026.\nAlphabet's 2026 is shaping up to be a good one On top of those questions being answered, another positive one was asked: What if Alphabet sold its in-house computing unit on the open market? Alphabet has developed a custom AI computing unit known as the tensor processing unit (TPU) with Broadcom . This unit was only sold to Alphabet, and could be rented by other clients through its cloud computing network, Google Cloud. However, Alphabet may consider selling these computing units outright to Meta Platforms . That would open up a new business unit for Alphabet in 2026, leading to further growth.\n\nIf this business unit takes off and Alphabet can continue growing its core business at a strong rate (its revenue rose 16% in Q3, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 35%), Alphabet will be in store for a great 2026. While returns won't be as explosive due to its higher starting valuation, I think its growth will allow it to be a market-beating stock in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Warren Buffett Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Trillion-Dollar AI Stock Up 12,180% Since Its IPO\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nBRK.A\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points During the third quarter, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway continued to sell Apple stock and started a new position in Alphabet.\nApple is well-positioned to monetize consumer adoption of artificial intelligence, but the stock is expensive at its current price.\nAlphabet has opportunities to monetize artificial intelligence across its digital advertising, cloud computing, and autonomous driving businesses.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) had about $267 billion invested across 41 U.S. stocks as of the third quarter. Those totals changed very little from the previous quarter, but Buffett (and his fellow investment managers) made some trades worth exploring:\nBerkshire sold 41.7 million shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . it remains the largest holding at 21% of the portfolio, but Buffett has slashed the position by 74% in two years.\nBerkshire bought 17.8 million shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . It is a relatively small position at 2% of the portfolio, but still noteworthy because Buffett has traditionally avoided technology stocks.\nAlphabet stock has returned 12,180% since its 2004 IPO and its $3.7 trillion market value makes it the third-largest company in the world. That Berkshire only recently started a position teaches a valuable lesson: It's alright to buy a stock that you initially overlooked, even if its share price has increased substantially.\nHere's what investors should know.\n1. Apple Apple reported encouraging financial results in the September quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Total revenue increased 8% to $102 billion driven by strong sales growth in the iPhone, Mac, and services segments. Non-GAAP net income increased 13% to $1.85 per diluted share due to modest operating margin expansion and continued share buybacks.\n\nThe investment thesis for Apple centers on its dominance in smartphones and its strong presence in other consumer electronics verticals. Design expertise spanning hardware and software has helped the company build a loyal consumer base willing to pay premium prices. iPhones accounted for 43% of smartphone sales in the September quarter, and Apple's installed base exceeds 2.35 billion devices.\nThat so many people have Apple devices means the company is ideally positioned to monetize consumer adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Last year, Apple introduced a suite of generative AI capabilities (called Apple Intelligence) for newer devices. They are currently free, but the company plans to introduce paid AI features in the next few years, according to Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\nNevertheless, Apple has a valuation problem. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 10% annually in the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 36 times earnings look very expensive. Those values give a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 3.6, and readings above 2 are typically considered overvalued. I think Apple is a great company, but the stock is not worth the current price.\n\n2. Alphabet Alphabet reported solid third-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 16% to $102 billion, an acceleration from 15% growth in the same quarter last year. GAAP earnings rose 35% to $2.87 per diluted share. CFO Anat Ashkenazi noted strong demand for AI infrastructure, specifically highlighting the adoption of custom chips and Gemini models.\n\nThe investment thesis for Alphabet centers on dominance in digital advertising, a position the company hopes to reinforce with artificial intelligence. Conversion rates have improved (i.e., more clicks) since Alphabet introduced AI Max for Search Campaigns earlier this year, and query volumes have increased since it added generative AI features to Google Search.\nMeanwhile, industry analysts rank Google Cloud as a leader in large language models, AI application development tools, and conversational AI tools. Google has also developed custom AI chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that have been adopted by Apple and Anthropic, among other noteworthy clients. Meta Platforms may deploy TPUs in its own data centers in 2027, according to The Information.\n\nFinally, Alphabet's autonomous driving subsidiary Waymo could eventually be a major source of revenue. It already offers commercial robotaxi services in six U.S. cities: Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, Atlanta, and Miami. Waymo will launch in four new cities across Texas and Florida in the coming weeks. And the company is testing its vehicles in another dozen cities.\nWall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase at 16% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 30 times earnings look reasonable. Those values give a PEG ratio of 1.9, which is far more attractive than Apple's PEG ratio of 3.6. Investors should consider buying a small position in Alphabet stock today.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?
