Apple CEO Tim Cook, who sits on Nike's board, bought 50,000 shares, increasing his holding by 90%. Former eBay and Intel CEO Robert Holmes Swan acquired 8,700 shares, increasing his holding by 24%.\nNike made this insider purchase following a challenging year. The corporation has lost almost half its market value in three years and is on course for its fourth straight annual decrease as shares plummet 19% in 2025. Despite Hill's brand repositioning, weak Chinese sales and tariff concerns have hurt profitability.\nAnalysts are cautiously hopeful about a rebound. The average 12-month price target monitored by LSEG implies 26% upside due to rising global demand and a better direct-to-consumer business strategy.\nInvestors see Nike's recent leadership moves and insider acquisitions as a sign that management is optimistic about 2026's revival.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

They were stunned at this year's meeting when Buffett announced he would step down as CEO of the investment giant at year's end.

But I think the the the ultimate process here is that the market is broadening out. So, you know, a lot of people should be actually reallocating now. Maybe not today, you know, on a few of the last trading days in the uh in the sessions here, but, you know, from a tax consequence standpoint. But I think, you know, you have an opportunity in the forward, you know, months coming forward here in 2024, whether it's January that you make a decision to kind of come out of those and reallocate. But I think I think the the point is is that you should. Don't just let those run because that could be a problem as we go forward.\n00:54 Speaker A\nWhere do you reallocate to?\n00:58 Speaker B\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I I haven't been a big proponent over the years of international. I think, you know, one out of every 10 years that you know, they've outperformed and we get seven out of 10 on the uh broader markets of out performance. So I like to stay US. So, you know, my thought is is that they've had a good run. They may continue it a little bit into 2024, but, you know, the dollar may, you know, not strengthen, but not go down as much as it has, so that may take a little of the air out of those wings. So I'm thinking, you know, take a little out of international, look at the small caps, dollar cost average in, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping a little cash on the sidelines coming into the front part of the year and just uh hold my nose and buy some of the dips when they happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Before Siri's launch, investors are worried about Apple's innovation pipeline.\nApple will provide free AI, unlike subscription-based competitors, therefore its upside depends on hardware sales.

Nvidia and Apple are among firms pouring many billions of dollars into chips, servers and data centres.\nAI-related spending is soaring worldwide, and is expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion by 2025, according to US research firm Gartner, and over $2 trillion in 2026 -- nearly two percent of global GDP.\nTaiwan's dominance of the chip industry has long been seen as a \"silicon shield\" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China -- which claims the island is part of its sovereign territory -- and an incentive for the United States to defend it.\nBut the threat of a Chinese attack has fuelled concerns about potential disruptions to global supply chains and has increased pressure for more chip production beyond Taiwan's shores.\n\nChinese fighter jets and warships encircled Taiwan during live-fire drills this week aimed at simulating a blockade of the democratic island's key ports and assaults on maritime targets.\nTaipei, which slammed the two-day war games as \"highly provocative and reckless\", said the manoeuvre failed to impose a blockade on the island.\nTSMC has invested in chip fabrication facilities in the United States, Japan and Germany to meet soaring demand for semiconductors, which have become the lifeblood of the global economy.\nBut in an interview with AFP this month, Taiwanese Deputy Foreign Minister Francois Chih-chung Wu said the island planned to keep making the \"most advanced\" chips on home soil and remain \"indispensable\" to the global semiconductor industry.\njoy-amj/abs\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook Just Bought $3 Million of Nike Stock. Should You Load Up on NKE Too?\n\nEbube Jones\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:53 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nNike (NKE) has spent most of 2025 trying to rebuild investor trust after several disappointing quarters left the stock far below its earlier highs and trailing the broader consumer group. Shares are down more than 26% off their 52‑week high, even after a recent rebound.\nThen, on Dec. 22, a regulatory filing revealed that Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, Nike's lead independent director since 2016, purchased 50,000 Class B shares at an average price of $58.97. It was a $2.95 million open-market buy that nearly doubled his stake to approximately 105,000 shares.\n\nMore News from Barchart Micron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMicron Stock Stole the Show in 2025.

Sign Up Now!\n\nNKE stock reacted right away, jumping between 2% and 5% in premarket and early regular-session trading on Dec. 24. It was Cook's largest open-market purchase of Nike shares in years, and it landed at a moment when the global footwear market is expected to generate roughly $500 billion in revenue in 2025, with an annual growth rate of 5.52% through 2030. That contrast makes the point clear: the bigger issue for Nike has been execution, not a lack of demand for shoes globally.\nWith an insider like Cook putting nearly $3 million of his own money into a beat-up stock, the key question is straightforward: Is this a real sign Nike's turnaround under CEO Elliott Hill is starting to work, and should retail investors follow his lead? Let’s find out.\n\nWhat the Financials Reveal Nike is the world’s largest athletic footwear and apparel brand, and it runs a mixed business model. It sells through wholesale partners while also pushing more sales through its own direct‑to‑consumer channels, including its digital platforms.\nEven with the brand’s global reach, the stock has struggled. Over the past 52 weeks, shares have slipped 19%, down 13% in the past three months, but in the last five trading days, they’re up 6%.\nOn valuation, Nike currently trades at a forward P/E of 38.16x. That is more than double the consumer discretionary sector average of 17.83x, which means the market is still pricing Nike like a higher-quality name with stronger long-term potential than the average stock in its group. Dividends have been more consistent. Nike yields 1.61% annually, the most recent dividend was $0.41 per share, and the company has raised its payout for 23 straight years. At the same time, a 93.69% forward payout ratio suggests there is not much extra room for big dividend increases right now.\n\nLa historia continúa\nIn its fiscal 2026 second quarter, results were mixed. Revenue rose 1% year-over-year (YoY) to $12.4 billion, but gross margin fell 300 basis points to 40.6% due to higher tariffs in North America. Net income dropped 32% to $0.8 billion, and EPS came in at $0.53. Wholesale revenue increased 8%, but Nike Direct revenue fell 9%, highlighting the pressure points Nike is still working through as it tries to protect profits while keeping sales moving.\n\nWhat’s Powering Nike’s Next Chapter Nike’s boldest bet right now is Project Amplify, a powered footwear system built with robotics firm Dephy that aims to help people run and walk more easily. The setup includes a lightweight motor, a drive belt, and a rechargeable cuff battery, all paired with a carbon-fiber–plated running shoe to support natural ankle and lower-leg movement. More than 400 athletes have taken part so far, logging over 2.4 million steps across nine prototypes, and some described it as feeling like “a second set of calf muscles.”\n\nAt the same time, Nike is pushing into neuroscience-based footwear with its Mind Series, which includes the Mind 001 mule and Mind 002 sneaker. These shoes were developed over 10 years by Nike’s Mind Science Department, and each shoe has 22 separate foam nodes that work like small pistons to increase underfoot feedback and stimulate key sensory areas of the brain. Norwegian soccer legend and Nike-sponsored athlete Erling Haaland tested them and said the design helps him feel calmer and more balanced before playing. The Mind Series is set to launch globally in January 2026.\nAnalyst Calls and the Road Ahead For the current quarter ending February 2026, analysts expect earnings per share of $0.36 versus $0.54 a year ago, which would be a 33.33% YoY drop. For the following quarter in May 2026, the estimate is $0.26 versus $0.14, which would be an 85.71% jump. Looking at the full fiscal year, the consensus calls for $1.57 in EPS for fiscal 2026, down 27.31% from $2.16 last year.\n\nJefferies stuck with its “Buy” rating and $115 price target on Dec. 18, pointing to “ongoing progress” in North America and EMEA, where Nike’s innovation push and distribution reset are showing up most clearly.\nA day later, Bank of America analyst Lorraine Hutchinson cut her target from $84 to $73 but kept a “Buy” rating. She said progress in North America and running has been “encouraging,” but she also flagged weaker-than-expected China trends and margin guidance that “didn’t include the improvement we expected.”\nZooming out, the overall Wall Street view lines up with Cook’s nearly $3 million vote of confidence. The 35 analysts surveyed rate the stock a consensus “Moderate Buy,” and the average price target of $76.60 suggests about 25.7% upside from the current share price.\n\nConclusion Cook’s $3 million buy is a strong confidence signal, but it is not a green light for everyone to blindly load up on NKE. Especially with earnings still projected to be under pressure and the stock trading at a rich multiple versus its sector. For investors who can tolerate volatility and give the turnaround time, adding gradually makes more sense than chasing a quick pop because the upside case depends on execution across Direct, margins, and the China reset. Most likely, shares chop around near term as the market waits for cleaner fundamentals, but the direction skews higher over the next 12 months if Nike delivers even modest margin stabilization and the innovation pipeline translates into demand.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Apple is an Analyst Favorite, But AAPL Stock Has Been Flat - Shorting Puts Is the Best Play\n\nMark R. Hake, CFA\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:48 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nShorting out-of-the-money (OTM) put options in Apple, Inc. ( AAPL ) stock has clearly been the best play over the last month. This is because AAPL has been in a small trading range over the last month. The average analyst price target is over 5% higher, but my price target is $325, 19% above today's price.\n\nAAPL is trading at $272.93 in morning trading on Dec. 30. AAPL has ranged from a Nov. 7 low of $268.47 to a Dec. 2 closing peak of $286.19.\nMore News from Barchart Micron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMicron Stock Stole the Show in 2025.

Sign Up Now!\nAAPL Stock Price Targets I discussed Apple stock's value and shorting puts in a Dec. 1 Barchart article, “ Apple Stock Looks Cheap Here Based on Strong FCF - Shorting OTM Put Options Has Worked .”\nI showed that AAPL could be worth $325 per share based on its strong free cash flow (FCF) and FCF margins. Since then, analysts have raised their revenue estimates, so one could argue that the price target (PT) could be even higher.\n\nMoreover, analysts now estimate AAPL is worth $287.17 (Yahoo! Finance), $290.85 (Barchart), and $285.20 (AnaChart). That works out to a survey average of $287.74 , or +5.4% higher than today's price.\nThe point is that the PT range is between $287 and $327, or at least $306 , about +12% over today's price.\nThat's not a table-thumping amount. So, one way to potentially play the stock is to set a lower potential buy-in point and collect income while waiting.\nWhy Shorting OTM Puts Works Here I discussed shorting the $265.00 and $270.00 put option strike prices expiring Jan. 2, 2026, (this Friday) in the Dec. 1, 2025, Barchart article.\nAt the time, the premiums received by a short-seller of these put contracts were $2.27 and $3.40, respectively. Today, the premiums have dropped to $0.13 and $0.61, respectively.\n\nIn other words, the short-put play has worked. It might make sense to do this again by rolling the trade over to a new monthly expiration period.\nFor example, the Jan. 30, 2026, expiry period shows that the $260.00 put contract has a $2.70 midpoint premium. That works out to a one-month yield of 1.04% (i.e., $2.70/$260).\nIn other words, in return for an obligation to buy AAPL stock at a price almost 5% below today's price, the investor gets to make a 1% monthly income yield.\n\nStory Continues\nThat works out to a 12%+ annualized expected return (ER).\nThis ER is the same as the expected upside return from holding AAPL stock over the next year (12%) - see above.\nNote, there is only a low 23% chance that AAPL will actually fall to $260.00, according to its delta ratio. So, some less risk-averse investors might be willing to buy longer-dated in-the-money (ITM calls.\n\nThat way, these investors can gain exposure to AAPL's upside on a leveraged basis on a longer-term basis. Moreover, shorting OTM puts helps pay for this upside.\nBuying ITM AAPL Calls For example, look at the July 17, 2026, expiry period. It shows that the $260.00 call option trades for about $30, or $3,000.\nThe point is that an investor who collects $270 in short-put income for 7 months (although there is no guarantee) could potentially accumulate $1,890. That would reduce the call option cost to just $1,110.\nSo, let's say that AAPL rises to $300 by July. That means the intrinsic value of the July 17, 2026, $260 call option would be $40 (i.e., $300-$260), or $4,000 per call contract.\n\nTherefore, the investor has a potential profit of $2,890 ($4,000 - $1,110).\nGiven that the investor had to invest approximately $26,000 each month to generate the $270 monthly income (i.e., $260 x 100 shares per put contract), the ROI is:\n$2,890/$26,000 = +11.11% over 7 months\nThat works out to almost a 20% annualized compounded expected return (i.e., +19.79% ). (For you nerds, here is how that is calculated: 1.1111^(12/7) -1 = 1.1111^1.714 -1=1.1979-1=0.1979).\nThe point is that this is a leveraged, slightly more risky way to play AAPL for a higher expected return. For example, if AAPL stays flat, the call option premium will deflate, and the investor could end up with a capital loss.\nSummary and Conclusion The truth is that if AAPL rises to $300, the value of the ITM $160 calls will be higher than $40 due to extrinsic value. That would allow the investor to sell these calls at an even better ER.\nThe bottom line here is that AAPL stock looks undervalued on a long-term basis. Shorting OTM puts is a relatively defensive way way to gain income and set a lower potential buy-in point.\nInvestors willing to take on more risk can use that income to buy in-the-money (ITM) call options in longer-dated periods. That way, they can gain a leveraged expected return, with greater risk.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

      "Content": "Samsung’s First Trifold Phone Is Expensive and Half-Baked\n\nVlad Savov\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:00 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: SSNLF\n\nGOOG\n\nXIACF\n\nAAPL\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Nearly seven years in, the foldable smartphone era has been a letdown — but you can’t say that hardware makers haven’t tried.\nSamsung Electronics Co. became the first major player in 2019 to get in on the trend, and has kept at it since, releasing four new folding phones in 2025 alone, most recently the Galaxy Z TriFold. That device, which is available in South Korea to start and coming soon to the US, has two screens, two folds and a price of roughly $2,500 — about what it would cost to buy two high-end smartphones.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nTrifolds are an emerging subcategory of foldables, first attempted by Huawei Technologies Co. last year, that can take the form of both a smartphone and a widescreen tablet that’s well suited for watching videos. The convenience of having both in one gadget is supposed to overshadow the fact you could purchase both an iPhone Pro Max and iPad Pro for less.\nBut after a week of testing one of the first Galaxy Z TriFold units available in Seoul, it’s clear that this experimental phone is also held back by some unique design flaws that make it even less polished than regular — dare I say, normal — foldables. The price alone, and the engineering complexity that necessitates it, cements the device’s status as a niche item, all but ensuring it won’t resonate beyond early adopters and tech enthusiasts.\nSamsung’s latest launch is especially daring considering how little sales success it’s had in this segment. The category, which also includes models from heavyweights like Google and Huawei, still accounts for less than 2% of global phone sales, according to IDC data. Apple Inc. has so far sat out the fad, though it’s expected to release a folding iPhone in 2026. That makes the new year a pivotal time for the entire sector.\nTradeoffs Everywhere\nSamsung designed the TriFold to be folded up like a wallet, with creases splitting it into three sections when you’re holding the device in tablet mode. If the user begins to fold it incorrectly — by closing the right side before the left, for instance — the phone quickly warns them with on-screen notifications and physical vibrations. (Over a week of showing the handset to friends and colleagues, I found that most people do, in fact, initially get it wrong.)\n\nBut there’s no denying it’s sturdy. Samsung’s years of foldable engineering work show up in the TriFold’s construction. The device, which is the size of a 6.5-inch phone when shut, has zero gaps between its three sections and feels reassuringly dense and rigid in the hand. The hinges similarly exhibit the right amount of resistance and snap when opening and closing, and Samsung has slimmed every panel down to effectively the height of the necessary USB-C port.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile the phone is slimmer in most spots than the iPhone Air and many iPads, Samsung achieved that feat by pushing all the camera hardware into a large and heavy additional module. The TriFold’s back has both a camera bump and three lenses that protrude further out, undermining the broader emphasis on thinness.\nThe result is that the device feels lopsided both in the hand and when you place it on a flat surface. The fundamental premise of a foldable tablet like the TriFold is that the user gets the largest possible screen to use on the move in a pocketable form factor. But the experience is compromised when the weight is as imbalanced as it is here. The poor ergonomics made me not want to hold up the device to watch much video, even though the aspect ratio on the inner display is actually well suited for it. And it’s not as if there’s a built-in kickstand to give the user a break.\nThe 10-inch interior screen is also more prone to glare and reflections than other smartphone displays. Oppo's Find N5 foldable from earlier this year is vastly superior in this respect, proof that it’s possible to do better even with a flexible panel.\nMaking matters worse is some poor camera performance. Low-light photos appear grainy and dull, lacking the sharpness achieved by even midrange Android smartphones such as the $630 Xiaomi 17 or $799 Google Pixel 10. Samsung threw in additional selfie cameras on the big inner screen — which makes sense for video calls — as well as on the exterior. The latter is superfluous since the handset can already use the main camera in concert with the outside screen.\n\nAnother issue stems from the semi-circular bumps at the top and bottom of each hinge, which interfere with multitasking gestures when you’re using the screen in landscape mode. They also make swiping to the side in portrait mode awkward.\nSamsung also hasn’t solved a problem that’s endemic to foldables: the visible crease that occurs where the screen bends. Because the TriFold folds in two places, it has two such creases, and they remain apparent. While they’re more subtle from certain angles when the screen is on, you’ll always feel the creases as you’re swiping around. For all the improvements that Samsung and rivals like Huawei have made, this lingering design flaw presents a challenge to selling such devices at sky-high prices: That segment of the consumer market rarely accepts compromises.\n\nBut tradeoffs and imperfections define the experience of using the Galaxy Z TriFold. Samsung swaps the typical fingerprint sensor embedded in the display for one built into the power button on the side. It’s slower, less precise and less comfortable to use than what the vast majority of Android phones offer, including Samsung’s more conventional handsets. The folding design also precluded Samsung from putting the speakers on the sides, which means they offer less stereo separation than you’d get on a dedicated tablet.\n\nThe TriFold’s advantages over a regular handset — the large 10-inch display and good-for-a-smartphone audio quality — would be better served by an outsized battery to power them. Instead, the rather modest 5,600 milliampere-hour battery can trigger the smartphone equivalent of range anxiety, forcing users to choose between using the device as intended or conserving power. Gaming and video playback are particularly draining: Any extensive sessions are often cut short by battery depletion warnings that more conventional smartphones wouldn’t succumb to until hours later.\nIn comparison, recent Chinese flagships like Xiaomi Corp.’s 17 Pro Max and Oppo’s Find X9 Pro both offer bigger 7,500mAh batteries, offering consumers a reason to consider sticking with conventional non-folding phones.\nRecharging speeds are also slower compared with the Chinese competition. Samsung has equipped the TriFold with 45-watt wired and 15-watt wireless charging, while Vivo’s non-folding X300 Pro, for example, reaches 90 watts wired and 40 watts wirelessly, and has a larger battery to boot.\n\nWith this phone, Samsung made an attempt to optimize the software to take advantage of the larger screen. Using the company’s DeX software, which has been tweaked for this particular hardware type, you can also run a desktop-like experience directly on the large inner display. (Other Samsung phones must be plugged into an external monitor to activate DeX mode.) In DeX, the TriFold can operate as many as four distinct workspaces that can each run five apps simultaneously.\nBeyond that, the software experience feels half-baked, and not fully tailored for this new hardware type. Popular apps like Instagram are not all optimized, with Instagram Reels displaying in only one half of the screen when viewed in landscape. Meanwhile, the ability to run apps side by side has been standard on foldable devices for years, and is still of limited utility, so Samsung only deserves modest credit for implementing it here.\n\nSamsung has added the ability to start an activity on the exterior display and continue it on the inside by opening the TriFold to reveal the larger screen. However, that trick doesn’t work in reverse. For example, after picking a destination on Google Maps with the device open, the user can’t simply close the device and still see the route on the smaller screen.\nThe foldable proposition has always been reminiscent of the one that Apple offered with the original iPhone: pay an exceptionally high price and accept worse durability and battery life for the privilege of a futuristic design with a much larger screen. The problem for foldables is that standalone tablets already offer bigger displays at a much lower cost with very few design tradeoffs.\n\nSamsung’s pricey Galaxy Z TriFold doesn’t advance the foldable category in a meaningful way, serving mainly to underscore how great the engineering and design challenges are. Even more basic foldables, such as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, have only just begun to offer user experiences that come close to matching conventional smartphones.\nAdding an extra crease to a device for the sake of innovating and maximizing screen real estate means those devices will, for now, be more expensive and less refined. The adventurous shoppers keen to try out a first-generation foldable device will be better served waiting to see what Apple has to offer when it makes its long-awaited debut in this space.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The economic guru may have stepped down as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO at the end of 2025, but he has such a long track record of successful investments that many still see his perspective as invaluable financial advice. The value of Berkshire Hathaway stock is roughly 5.5 million times more than it was in 1964, so it's no wonder Buffett is a financial celebrity that financial experts respect . A large part of this company's returns came from significant investments in companies like American Express, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and Apple.\n\nDespite Apple making for a particularly sound investment on Buffett's part, many may be surprised to learn Berkshire Hathaway actually sold $10.6 billion in Apple stock in the first three quarters of 2025, according to 24/7 Wall Street . The company initially purchased Apple stock in early 2016, and the investment has paid off handsomely: Buying $1,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago would have resulted in a nearly 583% total return as of 2025, according to Benzinga . But as always, Buffett has his reasons for such a drastic reduction in his company's Apple holdings: Some have to do with the shifting value of Apple stock specifically, while others concern the market at large.",

You’re honest about it. You make mistakes and you accept responsibility for those mistakes.”\nHoward is in line to succeed his father as Berkshire chairman.\n\nThrough it all, Buffett championed the art of value investing, as taught to him by mentor Benjamin Graham. The philosophy is rooted in an unwillingness to overpay for investments.\nThe \"Buffett Indicator\" takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual US GDP. It rose to fame following a 2001 Fortune Magazine article written by Buffett and longtime Fortune writer and Buffett insider Carol Loomis.\n\n\"The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know,\" Buffett explained in the article. \"Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\"\nThe indicator is at valuation levels never seen before, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. It suggests that stocks are long overdue for a healthy pullback in early 2026.\nPicking apart the numbers, the Buffett Indicator stands at about 221.4% — up a sharp 22% from April 30, per data from GuruFocus. The indicator has never been at a higher level dating back to the earliest data from GuruFocus in 1970.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) has shot up nearly 17% on the year amid major optimism surrounding the earnings potential of AI-related companies and the effect the technology will have on profits. Analysts in turn have scrambled to upwardly revise their profit forecasts on companies, supporting higher stock prices.\nFor his part, Buffett has bet on the AI future by maintaining stock investments in Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and more recently, Alphabet ( GOOGL ).\nWherever the stock market goes from here, one thing can't be questioned: Buffett's impact on investing.\n\nLeer más\n\"I think Warren Buffett's the GOAT of capitalism,\" Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me on Opening Bid (video above) in October. \"There's so much guidance and wisdom that we've had from Warren over the years.\"\nBerkshire purchased Brooks in 2006.

The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing.

      "Content": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nApple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has lost 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $2.65 per share, indicating a change of +10.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.11 points to a change of +8.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 indicates a change of +12.4% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $137.51 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $451.74 billion and $489.78 billion estimates indicate +8.5% and +8.4% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Apple reported revenues of $102.47 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.9%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $1.64 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $101.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.25%. The EPS surprise was +6.94%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nApple is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Consequently, TrendForce has reduced its 2026 global projection for notebook shipments to a 5.4% YoY decrease, totaling around 173 million units. This shift indicates a more conservative approach by brands toward inventory management, promotions, and product setups in response to increasing cost pressures.\nIf memory price increases do not significantly slow down by the second quarter of 2026 and brands cannot pass on higher costs, the demand for entry-level and consumer notebooks might decline further. In this scenario, full-year 2026 shipments could turn more pessimistic, decreasing by as much as 10.1% YoY.\n\nTrendForce notes that the notebook market relies heavily on supply-chain relationships, product offerings, channel strategies, and enterprise demand. Brands that maintain long-term, stable partnerships with major memory suppliers, have a higher proportion of commercial and mid-to-high-end products, and mature channel and pricing management, are better equipped to withstand current memory price increases and ensure shipment stability.\nApple serves as a prime example. Despite increasing memory costs, its integrated supply chain and robust pricing power allow for greater flexibility in adjusting its product lineup. Additionally, Apple's substantial and steady procurement volumes, along with a clear product release schedule and highly predictable demand planning, facilitate securing priority cooperation with memory suppliers.\n\nAmid a tough market environment, Apple aims to introduce a 12.9-inch model in spring 2026 targeting the entry-to-mid-range segment. Although the timing isn't perfect, ongoing supply chain efficiencies, scale benefits, and competitive pricing should help the product attract buyers, boosting market penetration and sustained shipment performance.\nFor Lenovo, the leading notebook vendor by volume worldwide, MSRP hikes might be unavoidable. Nevertheless, its scale benefits and strong supply chain might help limit price increases, offering more flexibility in managing costs and possibly allowing it to grow its market share despite market trends.\n\nStory continues\nTrendForce further notes that the increase in memory prices will also reduce panel demand in 2026, leading to an estimated 7.9% YoY drop in total notebook panel shipments. LCD panels will experience even sharper declines due to both weakening notebook demand and the growing adoption of OLED technology.\nAlthough OLED notebook panels are still expected to grow in 2026 as brands expand their OLED model offerings, the rising cost of memory components, which may be reflected in higher end prices, could reduce consumer demand and lead to a slowdown in OLED panel shipment growth.\nFor more information on reports and market data from TrendForce's Department of Display Research, please click here , or email the Sales Department at DR_MI@trendforce.com\nFor additional insights from TrendForce analysts on the latest tech industry news, trends, and forecasts, please visit https://www.trendforce.com/news/\nAbout TrendForce\nTrendForce is a global provider of the latest development, insight, and analysis of the technology industry.

Analysts led by Dan Ives noted growing demand from CIOs, signaling a potential inflection point for the Redmond tech giant.\n\nIs PLTR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nPalantir is also on the radar, with steady traction across government and commercial contracts suggesting the company could scale significantly in the AI era. CrowdStrike is expected to benefit as cybersecurity needs expand alongside AI adoption, positioning its platform for broader enterprise growth.\nOn the consumer side, Tesla's ambitions in autonomous driving and robotics are expected to unlock more AI-driven value, while Apple can leverage its 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones to monetize AI features over the next few years.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple Inc. AAPL, Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO and IBM Corp. IBM.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nTop Research Reports for Apple, Cisco & IBM\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc. and IBM Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here >>>\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is benefiting from strong growth in its Services revenues. The company now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The new iPhone 17 series is expected to drive top-line growth. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy.\n\nApple expects the December quarter&rsquo;s (first-quarter fiscal 2026) net sales to grow between 10% and 12% on a year-over-year basis. The company expects iPhone sales to grow in double digits year over year. The Mac segment is expected to face a tough year-over-year comparison, and Services are expected to grow at the 2025 rate.\n\nHowever, gross margin is expected to be 47-48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, including a tariff impact of $1.4 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> )\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past six months (+14% vs. +13.6%). The company&rsquo;s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. An increase in recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Splunk's acquisition enhances the company&rsquo;s recurring revenue base.\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco&rsquo;s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco&rsquo;s security portfolio.\n\nNetworking sales benefited from strong demand for AI infrastructure and campus networking solutions. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers were strong driven by high double-digit order growth in hyperscalers. However, stiffening competition is a headwind.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>> )\n\nIBM&rsquo;s shares have gained +4.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry&rsquo;s gain of +47.8%. The company is betting big on the Watsonx platform, which is likely to be its core technology platform for AI capabilities. The company&rsquo;s focus on quantum technology for solutions to complex problems beyond the reach of classical computing is a tailwind.\n\nIBM is benefiting from a surge in demand for heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has led to sustainable growth through advanced technology and deep consulting expertise.\n\nHowever, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Macroeconomic headwinds are worrisome. IBM&rsquo;s acquisition spree has also escalated integration risks, while its high debt level is burdensome.\n\n(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>> )\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

This volatility leads to big swings in stock prices that have worked in their favor recently - over the past six months, the industry has returned 16.3% and beat the S&P 500 by 4.6 percentage points.\nNevertheless, this stability can be deceiving as many companies in this space lack recurring revenue characteristics and ride short-term fads. Keeping that in mind, here is one resilient consumer stock at the top of our wish list and two that may face trouble.\n\nTwo Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Sell: Paramount (PSKY) Market Cap: $14.82 billion\nOwner of Spongebob Squarepants and formerly known as ViacomCBS, Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) is a major media conglomerate offering television, film production, and digital content across various global platforms.\nWhy Are We Out on PSKY?\nScale is a double-edged sword because it limits the company’s growth potential compared to its smaller competitors, as reflected in its below-average annual revenue increases of 3.2% for the last five years\nCapital intensity will likely ramp up in the next year as its free cash flow margin is expected to contract by 5 percentage points\nEroding returns on capital from an already low base indicate that management’s recent investments are destroying value\n\nAt $13.51 per share, Paramount trades at 14.6x forward P/E. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including PSKY in your portfolio, it’s free for active Edge members .\nXponential Fitness (XPOF) Market Cap: $301.4 million\nOwner of CycleBar, Rumble, and Club Pilates, Xponential Fitness (NYSE:XPOF) is a boutique fitness brand offering diverse and specialized exercise experiences.\nWhy Should You Sell XPOF?\n2.5% annual revenue growth over the last two years was slower than its consumer discretionary peers\nLow free cash flow margin of 2.3% for the last two years gives it little breathing room, constraining its ability to self-fund growth or return capital to shareholders\nDiminishing returns on capital from an already low starting point show that neither management’s prior nor current bets are going as planned\n\nXponential Fitness’s stock price of $8.35 implies a valuation ratio of 14x forward P/E. To fully understand why you should be careful with XPOF, check out our full research report (it’s free for active Edge members) .\nOne Consumer Discretionary Stock to Watch: Apple (AAPL) Market Cap: $4.05 trillion\nCreator of the iPhone and App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Do We Watch AAPL?\nApple's revenue base is so large because nearly everyone in the U.S. has an iPhone, but this is a double-edged sword. Growth must now come from upgrades, a harder pitch that has resulted in sluggish top-line performance recently.\nStill, Apple's devices have endured for decades, speaking to its brand, design ethos, and technological chops. Its success is rare in the world of consumer electronics, which is fraught because of commoditization, competition, and obsolescence risk.\nThe company may not have the best gross margin because of its hardware orientation, but it still manages to produce elite operating and free cash flow margins. This shows it doesn’t need over-the-top marketing campaigns to convince people to buy its products.\n\nApple is trading at $273.53 per share, or 33.3x forward price-to-earnings. Is now a good time to buy? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nHigh-Quality Stocks for All Market Conditions The market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 5 Strong Momentum Stocks for this week . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\nStocks that made our list in 2020 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-small-cap company Comfort Systems (+782% five-year return).

      "Content": "Warren Buffett gifts us 5 secrets for investing success, as he hands off Berkshire’s reins this week\n\nLawrence A. Cunningham\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nAs Warren Buffett exits his CEO role at Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A BRK.B, many will revisit his investing milestones — including his purchases of stakes in American Express AXP, See’s Candies, Coca-Cola KO and Apple AAPL — and his prudent pearls of investor wisdom: margin of safety, circle of competence, look-through earnings.\n\nBut two points matter most. First, Buffett is not disappearing; he remains Berkshire’s chairman. Second, his experience and lessons are as valuable today as ever, whatever the world’s volatility and distractions bring.\nMost Read from MarketWatch Strategy’s stock falls to fresh lows after using more share sales to buy bitcoin\nMicrosoft’s business is on fire. So how can its stock break from its curse?\nBuffett’s legacy isn’t stock picks or pithy statements — it’s a system Buffett’s greatest achievement is not beating the market, impressive as that is. It’s designing, in Berkshire, a decision‑making system that has minimized errors, resisted pressure and aligned incentives over decades.\nThat system matters as much now as it always has. Markets move faster, information is cheaper and noisier, and attention is commoditized. That may sound like a description of our moment, but it could have been written at almost any point in Buffett’s lifetime.\n\nThe hardest problems investors face — judgment, discipline, temperament — have not changed. Buffett understood this early. His response was not to chase speed or complexity but to build structures that reduce mistakes, personally and institutionally.\nBuffett’s enduring lessons for investors 1. Time is an asset: Buffett treated time as an asset — not a variable to manage around. Compounding rewards patience only if investors avoid self‑inflicted interruptions — unnecessary losses early, premature gains later.\nBuffett taught me this firsthand in 1997 when he urged me to self‑publish “The Essays of Warren Buffett.” In the short term, the book was a mountain of work. Over three decades, the payoff has compounded far beyond what any publishing contract could have delivered.\n\nIn an America dominated by quarterly guidance and real‑time dashboards, such a mindset is rare and valuable. Algorithms may trade in milliseconds, but businesses still create value over years.\n2. Value incentives and trust over forecasts: Buffett spent far less energy predicting macroeconomic outcomes than understanding people. He focused on incentives — how managers are paid, how boards behave, how capital is allocated — because incentives shape outcomes more reliably than projections.\nThat perspective is just as relevant today, as investors assess founder control, pay practices and corporate governance — just as they always have.\n\nStory Continues\nThe enduring lesson: Before asking what a company will do, ask about the character of its leaders and how they are rewarded.\n3. Simplicity is a discipline, not naïveté: Buffett avoided complexity not because he lacked skill, but because he recognized its dangers. Complexity obscures risk, dilutes accountability and creates false confidence. Look back at Enron, Theranos or certain corners of today’s markets.\n\nIn investing, complexity often signals not insight but confusion — or worse. Models grow elaborate precisely when reliability is lowest.\nThe enduring lesson: If you cannot explain an investment plainly, you probably do not understand it well enough to own it.\n4. Institutional patience beats individual brilliance: Berkshire Hathaway was designed to reduce the odds of bad decisions. Decentralized operations, a strong balance sheet, modest leverage and a culture of trust all served one purpose: preserving judgment under stress.\nIndividual investors cannot replicate Berkshire, but they can borrow from its logic — by setting rules in advance, limiting forced decisions and resisting the urge to constantly “do something.”\nThe enduring lesson: that the best investing systems protect you from yourself.\n\n5. Temperament remains the most mispriced asset : Buffett never claimed to be the smartest person in the room. He claimed to be among the most consistent. Emotional control — remaining rational when others are euphoric or fearful — is Buffett’s sharpest edge.\nTh​is edge has always been valuable, and it will remain so. In financial markets saturated with commentary and instant feedback, temperament deserves an even greater premium.\nThe enduring lesson: Intelligence is common; emotional discipline is scarce.\nWhat investors should write on a notecard These are not slogans but constraints — designed to limit damage rather than promise brilliance. They have worked across history, in all markets, and the best investors will recognize their relevance today despite the seeming novelty of the age.\nBuffett’s most relevant passage One passage from Buffett’s 1994 letter to Berkshire shareholders captures the durability of his philosophy better than any summary: “We will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts, which are an expensive distraction for many investors and businessmen,” Buffett wrote. “Thirty years ago, no one could have foreseen the huge expansion of the Vietnam War, wage and price controls, two oil shocks, the resignation of a president, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a one-day drop in the Dow of 508 points, or treasury bill yields fluctuating between 2.8% and 17.4%. But, surprise — none of these blockbuster events made the slightest dent in Ben Graham’s investment principles [nor render Buffett’s practices unsound].”\n\nIf Buffett were updating that passage today, his list would change, but the conclusion would not. “Thirty years ago,” he might say, “no one could have foreseen the impeachments of two presidents, the attacks of Sept. 11 and the wars that followed, the dot-com bubble and collapse, the freezing of credit markets and the ‘Great Recession,’ a global pandemic, mortgage rates swinging from under 2% to double digits, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, trade wars — or artificial intelligence.”\nNone of those political and economic events made a dent in Buffett’s timeless principles. And, 30 years from now, investors will surely compile a different list of shocks — only to reach the same conclusion.\nMore: These are the secrets to Buffett’s investment success, according to this billionaire investor\nPlus: Berkshire’s Buffett is stepping down. Why little will change and why that’s OK.\nMost Read from MarketWatch It’s time for a retirement checkup: 5 easy ways to stay on track\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why One Fund Ditched Viper Energy in a $12 Million Exit Amid a 20% Stock Slide\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Michigan-based Nemes Rush Group sold 319,503 shares of Viper Energy in the third quarter.\nThe position was worth an estimated $12.18 million as of the previous period.\nThe move marked an exit for Nemes Rush, which reported holding no VNOM shares as of September 30.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nOn November 13, Michigan-based Nemes Rush Group disclosed it sold out its entire position in Viper Energy (NASDAQ:VNOM) , reducing holdings by 319,503 shares worth an estimated $12.18 million.\nWhat Happened According to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing dated November 13, Nemes Rush Group sold all 319,503 shares of Viper Energy (NASDAQ:VNOM) during the third quarter. The estimated transaction value was approximately $12.18 million based on average quarterly pricing.\nWhat Else to Know The fund's VNOM stake previously comprised 1.33% of reportable AUM.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ:AVGO: $55.44 million (5.5% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:AAPL: $52.14 million (5.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:MSFT: $42.41 million (4.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:GOOGL: $38.28 million (3.8% of AUM)\nNASDAQ:NVDA: $37.42 million (3.7% of AUM)\n\nAs of Monday, Viper Energy shares were priced at $38.48, down 20% over the past year and well underperforming the S&P 500, which is instead up about 15.5% in the same period.\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.19 billion\nNet income (TTM)\n$243.66 million\nDividend yield\n5.5%\nPrice (as of Monday)\n$38.48\n\nCompany Snapshot Viper Energy owns and manages mineral interests in oil and natural gas properties, primarily in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale\nThe company generates revenue from royalties on hydrocarbon production\nIt operates as a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy\nViper Energy focuses on acquiring and managing mineral rights in key U.S. oil and gas basins, enabling participation in upstream production economics while minimizing capital expenditures and operational risks. The company’s business model is based on collecting royalties from operators extracting oil and gas on its acreage.\n\nFoolish Take What makes this exit worth watching is not the size of the sale but what it signals about investor tolerance for volatility in income-focused energy plays. Viper Energy is not a growth stock -- it’s a royalty business designed to convert commodity exposure into cash flow, dividends, and buybacks. That model has worked operationally, but the share price recently has not worked out so well.\n\nIn the third quarter, Viper produced more than 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and generated $165 million in pro forma cash available for distribution. It returned 85% of that cash to shareholders through a $0.58 combined base and variable dividend and $90 million in buybacks. That translated into an annualized yield north of 6% at recent prices. At the same time, reported results showed a net loss driven by non-cash impairment charges tied to asset transfers, not underlying operating weakness.\n\nFor a diversified fund, trimming or fully exiting a sub 2% position after a sharp drawdown can be a portfolio hygiene move rather than a fundamental call, and that may be what long-term investors should most keep in mind here.\n\nStory Continues\nGlossary Assets under management (AUM): The total market value of investments managed by a fund or investment firm.\n13F reportable assets: Securities that institutional investment managers must disclose quarterly to the SEC if over a certain threshold.\nLiquidated: Sold off an entire investment position, reducing holdings to zero.\n\nDividend yield: Annual dividends paid by a company divided by its share price, shown as a percentage.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): Financial data covering the most recent 12 consecutive months.\nMineral interests: Ownership rights to minerals (like oil or gas) beneath land, often generating royalties.\nRoyalties: Payments made to mineral rights owners based on production or revenue from resource extraction.\nUpstream production: The exploration and extraction phase of oil and gas operations, before refining or distribution.\nCapital expenditures: Funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property or equipment.\nOperational risks: Potential losses resulting from failed internal processes, systems, or external events.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Despite an explosive year-to-date rally, they’re going for just over 3x sales at the time of writing, versus more than 35x for Nvidia.\nWall Street Disagrees with Newman on Intel Wall Street analysts do not entirely agree with Newman’s constructive view on Intel stock, though.\nThe consensus rating on INTC shares remains at “Hold” only with the mean target of nearly $37 already in line with the price at which they are trading currently.\n\nStory Continues\nThis article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) and IBM Corp. (IBM).

The company is benefiting from strong growth in its Services revenues. The company now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The new iPhone 17 series is expected to drive top-line growth. Expanding capabilities of AI Intelligence is noteworthy.\n\nApple expects the December quarter&rsquo;s (first-quarter fiscal 2026) net sales to grow between 10% and 12% on a year-over-year basis. The company expects iPhone sales to grow in double digits year over year. The Mac segment is expected to face a tough year-over-year comparison, and Services are expected to grow at the 2025 rate.\n\nHowever, gross margin is expected to be 47-48% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, including a tariff impact of $1.4 billion. Increasing regulatory headwinds and tariffs are a concern.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>> )\n\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the past six months (+14% vs. +13.6%). The company&rsquo;s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. An increase in recurring revenue base bodes well for investors. Splunk's acquisition enhances the company&rsquo;s recurring revenue base.\n\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco&rsquo;s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and making it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco&rsquo;s security portfolio.\n\nNetworking sales benefited from strong demand for AI infrastructure and campus networking solutions. Product orders from service provider and cloud customers were strong driven by high double-digit order growth in hyperscalers. However, stiffening competition is a headwind.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>> )\n\nIBM&rsquo;s shares have gained +4.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry&rsquo;s gain of +47.8%. The company is betting big on the Watsonx platform, which is likely to be its core technology platform for AI capabilities. The company&rsquo;s focus on quantum technology for solutions to complex problems beyond the reach of classical computing is a tailwind.\n\nIBM is benefiting from a surge in demand for heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has led to sustainable growth through advanced technology and deep consulting expertise.\n\nHowever, weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Macroeconomic headwinds are worrisome. IBM&rsquo;s acquisition spree has also escalated integration risks, while its high debt level is burdensome.\n\n(You can read the full research report on IBM here >>> )\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC), Rollins, Inc.

      "Content": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Although nine publicly traded American companies have achieved a valuation of $1 trillion or more, only four have graduated into the $3 trillion club.\nAmazon is an incredibly diverse technology company, with a dominant market position in industries like e-commerce, cloud computing, and more.\nThe tech titan could join the $3 trillion club in 2026 thanks to a combination of its attractive valuation and its strong earnings growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nNine publicly traded American companies are worth $1 trillion or more, but only four have graduated into the exclusive $3 trillion club so far: Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , and Microsoft .\nI think Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could join them by the end of 2026 thanks to the accelerating revenue growth in its cloud computing division, and the surging profits in its legacy e-commerce business. The company has a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion as I write this, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a 21% return over the next year if it does cross the $3 trillion milestone.\nRead on, and let's consider Amazon's growth prospects in the year ahead.\nAll eyes on Amazon Web Services Amazon's potential pathway to the $3 trillion club next year starts with its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It used to be a place where businesses would simply store data and host their critical digital applications, but it has evolved to become the center of Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAWS operates state-of-the-art data centers and it rents the computing capacity to AI developers who don't have the financial resources to build their own infrastructure. These data centers are filled with advanced AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia , but Amazon also designed its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium. Top developers like Anthropic are using hundreds of thousands of the latest Trainium2 chips, which offer up to 40% better price performance than competing hardware when training AI models.\nThen there is the AWS Bedrock platform, where businesses can access hundreds of completed AI models from third-parties including Anthropic and Meta Platforms . Developing models from scratch is time consuming and expensive, so using a ready-made solution can help businesses achieve their AI goals much faster.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), which was up 20% year over year. That was the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, which highlights the platform's incredible AI-driven momentum. But it gets better, because AWS has a whopping $200 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online, so the strong top-line results are likely to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's earnings continue to crush Wall Street's estimates The $33 billion in third-quarter revenue that AWS brought in accounted for just 18% of Amazon's total revenue of $180 billion. However, the cloud business is the company's most profitable by far, contributing 65% of its total operating income. E-commerce is actually Amazon's largest source of revenue, but its profit margins are very thin because its Amazon.com site focuses on selling a high volume of products at low prices.\n\nHowever, Amazon is pushing to improve profitability in its e-commerce business by boosting efficiency and implementing new technologies. In 2023, it broke its U.S. logistics network into eight distinct regions, so now the products in each fulfillment center are specific to their geographic region. As a result, orders travel shorter distances to reach customers, which brings down packing and shipping costs.\nAmazon also uses AI-powered software like Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers, which uses computer vision to identify defective products before they ship. This reduces returns and refunds, creating further cost savings.\nThe accelerating growth at AWS combined with improved efficiency in the e-commerce business is driving a huge increase in Amazon's overall profit. The company generated earnings of $5.22 per share during the first three quarters of 2025, which was a whopping 42% jump from the same period in 2024. Plus, Amazon's earnings have beaten Wall Street's consensus estimates in every single quarter of 2025, by an average of 22%.\n\nHow Amazon can cross the $3 trillion milestone in 2026 Amazon stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.8 as I write this. That's roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so Amazon stock is basically sitting at fair value relative to its peers in the tech sector.\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate earnings of $7.86 per share in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6.\nAssuming Wall Street is right, Amazon stock would have to climb by 11% next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 32.8, lifting its market cap to $2.75 trillion. But remember, the company has a habit of beating Wall Street's expectations.\nIf its 2026 earnings beat the consensus estimate by 22% like they have so far in 2025, then its stock could be poised for a 35% gain next year instead. That would catapult its market value to a whopping $3.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, even an earnings beat of just 9% next year would be enough to see Amazon join the $3 trillion club. Given the incredible momentum across its e-commerce business and AWS, I think that's an achievable target.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Apple Is Likely to Return to Double-Digit Revenue Growth in Fiscal 2026 -- and the Stock Looks Like a Buy\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 9:01 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nKey Points Apple guided for double-digit revenue growth in fiscal Q1.\nThe latest iPhone lineup is off to an excellent start.\nApple's lucrative services business is already growing at a double-digit rate, and management expects the segment's strong growth to persist in fiscal 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nBetween the end of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) annual sales volume essentially went nowhere. In fact, it even declined slightly over that two-year stretch. But the company's latest results, combined with its upbeat outlook for its important holiday quarter, suggest this era of suppressed sales may be ending.\nIn its fourth-quarter 2025, Apple reported $102.5 billion in revenue, up 8% year over year, helped by robust iPhone revenue growth and double-digit growth in services. Even more, Apple guided for its revenue growth rate to accelerate in fiscal Q1 -- a critical period that includes the holiday season.\nI believe this acceleration in Apple's business is a sign of an enduring pick-up in its business that ultimately makes the stock attractive today.\nA holiday-quarter outlook that sets the tone Setting the stage for what is likely to be a strong fiscal 2026 for the iPhone maker, Apple chief financial officer Kevan Parekh said during its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call that it expects revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year to rise 10% to 12% year over year, with iPhone revenue growing at a double-digit rate.\n\nNot only is Apple's holiday quarter typically its biggest, but it also marks the first full quarter of sales of the company's latest iPhone lineup, so it arguably sets the stage for how the latest iPhone line can drive sales during the entire fiscal year. And with management specifically calling out an expectation for iPhone sales to grow at a double-digit rate during the period, this provides even more reason to be confident in Apple's momentum headed into fiscal 2026.\n2 more key catalysts While Apple's iPhone gets the most headline attention, the company's services segment is arguably just as important to the tech company 's growth story. The segment, which boasts high-margin revenue from Apple's share of third-party app sales and subscriptions, the company's native services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV, and Apple Care, and more, posted 15% year-over-year growth in fiscal Q4. And, looking to fiscal Q1, management said it expects its services revenue to continue growing at a double-digit rate.\nJust how lucrative is Apple's services segment? Its gross margin came in at 75.3% in fiscal Q3 -- more than double the 36.2% gross profit margin that Apple's product segment boasted during the quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nFurther, there's a recurring nature to Apple's services business that investors love. As the company's installed base of active devices expands and as those users become more active over time, Apple can benefit from monetizing its users via recurring payments tied to Apple's ecosystem -- even during periods when hardware demand isn't robust.\n\nAnd then there's another major tailwind that could help Apple's business in the coming years: AI (artificial intelligence). Unlike tech peers like Microsoft and Alphabet , Apple isn't spending wild sums on capital expenditures to fund expansions in AI-capable data center infrastructure. But that doesn't mean it won't benefit from AI. The company could benefit from it in several ways, including increased demand for high-performing technology devices providing users with access to cloud-based AI features, and potentially even from entirely new product categories that emerge in the coming years, ultimately enabled by AI.\nWith all of this said, investors do seem to already be pricing an anticipated reacceleration in Apple's business. The stock's valuation is not cheap. Shares currently command a price-to-earnings ratio of about 37 and a forward price-to-earnings of 33.\n\nBut given the powerful brand that Apple boasts, the intense loyalty of its customer base, and the potential of AI leading to an unusually large wave of device upgrades over the coming years, I believe the tech giant deserves this valuation.\nOf course, no investment is without risk. Apple's heavy reliance on iPhone is a tailwind during good times for the flagship device, but it can weigh on its business when iPhone sales weaken. Further, there's always competition aiming to capture a slice of Apple's lucrative hardware markets. For these reasons, investors should be careful about how they size any position in the stock. Ultimately, however, I do think the tech stock looks attractive today -- even when considering the risks.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now?

      "Content": "Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nEllie Diamond\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: FIG\n\nSTLA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAAPL\n\nThere are countless articles and profiles of entrepreneurs who dropped out of college. Fortune magazine recently featured several, including Figma CEO Dylan Field and Scale founder Lucy Guo, the world’s youngest self-made billionaire woman, who built her own fortune.\nInnovators like these young people make the news because they’re inspiring, intelligent and innovative. They’re also exceptional. which can make them unrealistic role models, according to Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon. He advises aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from experience before striking out on their own.\n\nThe Exception, Not the Rule In October 2025, two entrepreneurs took the stage at Italian Tech Week in Turin. One was John Elkann, the chair and executive director of automaking giant Stellantis [ 3 ]. During his interview with Bezos, Elkann asked what he thought of the ideal of the prodigy entrepreneur.\nThese are personalities such as Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Steve Jobs. Each became hugely successful after rejecting the conventional pathway to success: a college education and years of climbing the ladder .\n\nElkann didn’t take this route, and neither did Bezos. They have great respect for those who did, but Bezos is quick to point out that it shouldn’t be an expectation.\n“It is possible to be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college and be a great entrepreneur ,” he said. “We have famous examples of that. But these people are the exception.”\nThe numbers back him up. A Clifford-Lewis Private Wealth study found that among the top 0.1% of rapidly growing new businesses, the founder’s average age was 45 at startup. Based on its data, Clifford-Lewis estimates that entrepreneurs have a much higher chance of success at 30 than at 20.\nSee Next: I Asked ChatGPT How To Build Wealth for the Rest of Trump’s Term: Here’s Its Plan\nTrending Now: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too\n\nThe Value of Professional Experience Bezos started Amazon at age 30. He had graduated from Princeton University in 1986 and worked at several Wall Street companies, including Fitel and Bankers Trust. In 1990, he became the youngest-ever vice president of hedge fund D.E. Shaw. He opened Amazon in July 1995 at age 31.\nBezos said these 10 years of working for others improved Amazon’s chances of success . He gained hands-on experience leading a growing company, and these skills helped him guide Amazon through its early days of explosive growth. In only two years, he took the company public, with an initial public offering price of $18 per share.\n\nStory Continues\nBezos now counsels young aspiring entrepreneurs to follow a similar path. As he said in Turin:\n“I always advise young people, go work at a best-practices company where you can learn a lot of basic, fundamental things: how to hire really well, how to interview, etc. There’s a lot of stuff you would learn in a great company, and there’s still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it”.\n\nBezos believes that these early career lessons do what pure inspiration and talent cannot: They teach young entrepreneurs how to do things right from day one. This knowledge supports better decision-making, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on growth.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Apple CEO Tim Cook Just Gave Nike Investors 3 Million Reasons to Cheer\n\nBram Berkowitz, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Apple CEO Tim Cook has been a member of Nike's board of directors for two decades.\nCook just made one of his largest open-market purchases of Nike stock.\nThis comes as Nike attempts a bold turnaround plan.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\nIt's been tough sledding for the iconic sports apparel company Nike (NYSE: NKE) , which has seen its stock shed roughly 19% this year and over 57% in the past five years. Retail brands like Nike have been challenged by rising competition in the space, more price-sensitive consumers, and macro challenges, among others.\nNike has also acknowledged strategic mistakes, including an overemphasis on online promotions and a lack of product innovation. Recently, however, Apple 's CEO Tim Cook, who has been on Nike's board of directors for about two decades, gave Nike investors 3 million reasons to cheer.\nTim Cook doubles down on Nike Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings recently revealed that Cook purchased 50,000 shares of Nike at an average price of $58.97 per share, totaling nearly $3 million. Cook made the purchases on the open market, and the move nearly doubles his stake in the company. According to MarketWatch, these purchases are also Cook's first market buys since 2005, not including equity-based compensation or purchases associated with derivatives.\n\nInsider buys indicate bullishness, and shares jumped after the SEC filings were made public. As the CEO of Apple, Cook possesses keen business acumen and carries more recognition than the typical board member, so it makes sense that his purchases are being received positively. They also come as Nike is attempting a large turnaround plan that has struggled to gain momentum thus far.\nNike recently reported earnings results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. The actual earnings results came in strong when the company reported $0.53 earnings per share on revenue of $12.4 billion, both of which came in ahead of Wall Street estimates. However, the stock got crushed after management delivered disappointing guidance, especially as it pertains to its business in China, which is viewed as a key market for the company.\n\nDuring the company's earnings call, Nike CFO Matthew Friend told analysts that headwinds in Greater China and challenges with Nike's Converse brand are expected to persist for the remainder of its fiscal year 2026. Tariffs are another headwind impacting the company.\nNike is guiding for revenue in the third fiscal quarter to decline in the low single-digit percentage range, with performance in China and Converse similar to that in the second quarter. Nike's CEO Elliott Hill, who was pulled out of retirement to lead the company toward the end of 2024, described the company's turnaround plan as being in the \"middle innings.\"\n\nStory Continues\nCan Nike figure it out? Nike's turnaround plans involve an intense refocus on athletes, the brand, and product innovation. Under Hill, the company has seen positive traction regarding its new product lines, which is reflected in improved revenue for the North American business. However, the company is also dealing with headwinds outside of its control, due to tariffs.\n\nChina is likely the biggest challenge for Nike right now. The company needs to determine how to better connect with consumers in terms of its brand and products, as well as how to most efficiently reach them in China. Nike is making changes in the region, but investors will likely need to see more proof that the strategy is working.\nI don't think Nike is necessarily going to rally overnight, and this is likely a position that will require plenty of patience. That said, some very big names like Cook are now showing confidence in the name, and investors can collect a dividend with a nearly 2.75% yield as they wait. Long-term-minded investors can certainly start nibbling on the stock if they're interested.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nike right now? Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nLeer más\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

If you received an Apple gift card over the holidays and are exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.\nWith its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.\n\nDespite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you’re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice.\nWhile the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more.\nAlthough it’s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller.\nOf course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it’s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need.\n\nWe’ll walk you through the similarities and differences between the two smart watches to help inform your decision.\nSimilarities between the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch SE 3 Differences between the Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch SE 3\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

At this share price, Meta now trades in the same range where companies such as Apple , Nvidia , and Tesla previously announced forward stock splits .\nWhile Meta has never executed a forward stock split since going public, the company's rising share price and growing earnings power have meaningfully increased the probability of a split in 2026.\nStock splits don't change the value of any investor's holdings, but here's why a Meta stock split could prove beneficial for investors, if it were to enact one.\n\nUpside drivers Although stock splits do not change a company's fundamentals, they tend to improve liquidity and broaden the investor base as they lower the per-share price (while increasing the number of shares), which can support higher trading activity and market valuation over time. While the availability of fractional shares has reduced some barriers to entry in stocks with high nominal share prices, research suggests that many retail investors still prefer owning full shares.\n\nAccording to data from Bank of America 's Research Investment Committee, companies that split their stock reported an average total return of 25.4% in the 12 months following the split announcement, more than double the 11.9% average return of the benchmark S&P 500 index in the same time frame. Hence, Meta's stock could see an incremental upside from improved liquidity and broader participation following a stock split.\nMeta reaches almost 3.5 billion people daily across its family of apps, giving it unmatched global scale and pricing power in digital advertising. Management has also guided for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, mainly for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nThese investments are already showing results. Meta's AI-driven ad tools are improving ad targeting efficiency and advertiser returns on ad spend. The company is also expanding its addressable market with newer ad surfaces, including on WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nHence, for long-term investors, a potential stock split could serve as an accelerator on top of the company's robust fundamentals, which can drive up its share prices in the coming months. I think Meta could be a stock-split stock that could make investors rich.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

They show up when skepticism turns casual — when stocks stop being debated and start being dismissed. That's the backdrop against which Apple Inc ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook 's purchase of Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ) shares is suddenly getting serious attention .\n\nEarlier this year, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) found its footing just as public commentary around the stock turned openly mocking, including a high-profile jab from Tim Walz . The remark didn't cause the bottom — but it coincided with a moment when pessimism appeared fully priced in. Tesla didn't explode higher overnight. It simply stopped going down. And that was the tell.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nPeak Skepticism Setup Nike now sits in a similarly uncomfortable place. The stock has spent months under pressure from margin concerns, inventory cleanups, and questions around consumer demand. Expectations are low. Sentiment is thin. The narrative has grown tired. The shares are down over 18% YTD.\nThat's what makes Tim Cook's personal purchase of roughly $3 million worth of Nike shares stand out. Not the size — the timing.\n\nWhy This Buy Matters Cook isn't a Nike insider. He isn't required to buy. And he isn't known for tactical trades. When someone with his profile steps into a struggling consumer name, markets naturally ask whether downside risk is becoming asymmetric.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThis isn't a call that Nike's problems are solved. Execution still matters, and fundamentals will ultimately decide the outcome. But selective, high-profile buying tends to show up closer to inflection points than to peaks.\nTesla's Quiet Lesson Tesla's bottom earlier this year offered a simple reminder: markets often turn when confidence looks misplaced and skepticism sounds effortless. Nike may not follow the same script — but Tim Cook's move suggests the risk-reward conversation has shifted.\nAnd when that happens, the story usually changes before the stock does.\nRead Next:\nBuffett's Secret to Wealth?

      "Content": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: ASML vs. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points ASML's equipment is essential to producing the world's most advanced semiconductors.\nTSMC has effectively leveraged ASML's equipment to produce the world's most advanced chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) are arguably the two most essential artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the hardware space. TSMC is well known for being the foundry of choice for Nvidia , Apple , and other top semiconductor companies.\n\nHowever, TSMC's success is not possible without ASML. It uses the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines built by ASML to manufacture the world's most advanced chips.\nThis creates a harder job for investors trying to discern which stock is more likely to make the highest long-term gains. Although both companies are critical to this process, investors need to take a closer look to see which is the more suitable stock for them to own.\nThe case for ASML Investors should remember one thing about ASML. Despite ASML's importance, only a tiny client base is interested in its EUV machines, which can cost as much as $400 million each. Worse, political concerns bar what equipment it can sell to countries like China, further adding to that limitation.\nNonetheless, companies such as Samsung and Intel are among the companies buying EUV machines. Additionally, ASML operates in the deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) market. Although the market has more competitors, it also allows it to earn business from foundry companies that produce other types of chips.\n\nFurthermore, such costly equipment needs periodic maintenance. With that, the Netherlands-based company runs a thriving maintenance business that accounts for more than one-third of ASML's revenue.\nAmid the growth in AI, its machines are more in demand, so much so that ASML earned almost 23 billion euros ($27 billion) in revenue in the first nine months of 2025, a yearly increase of 21%.\nAlso, ASML limited expense growth, leading to a net income of 6.8 billion euros ($7.9 billion), a 39% rise from year-ago levels. With the rising profits, the stock is up by almost 50% over the last year.\nInvestors should also note the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. While that is above the S&P 500\naverage of 31, it closely approximates the company's average over the last five years. Considering the demand in AI, such a valuation is unlikely to deter investors from bidding the stock price higher over time.\n\nWhy investors might consider TSMC However, with a larger client base, investors might find TSMC stock more appealing. They might also like its dominance.\n\nStory Continues\nAs mentioned, TSMC makes the world's most advanced chips. While companies like Samsung and Intel have attempted to compete, TSMC's dominant market share continues to grow. As of the second quarter of 2025, that market share reached 70%, giving the company a tremendous competitive advantage.\nThis arguably makes TSMC's biggest threat operating in Taiwan, an island that has dealt with periodic threats of an invasion by China. Since Chinese companies also depend on its chips, the threat could be overblown. Still, it was concerning enough that Warren Buffett reversed a decision by his lieutenants to invest Berkshire Hathaway 's capital in the company.\n\nThat threat has not stopped TSMC's growth. The $87 billion in revenue TSMC earned in the first nine months of 2025 rose 36% compared to the same period last year.\nAlso, like with ASML, expenses grew more slowly than revenue. Still, with other comprehensive losses weighing on the bottom line, its comprehensive income of $35 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 increased by 30% year over year. If not including those losses, net income would have grown by 52%.\nAmid the rising demand and income, TSMC stock is up by almost 50% over the last year. Also, with a 30 P/E ratio, it is cheaper than ASML and trades at a valuation that closely matches the S&P 500 average.\nStill, TSMC has tended to trade at a discount, and for that reason, it is above its average earnings multiple of 25 over the last five years. That makes it unclear whether TSMC is a better bargain, or whether investors feel the geopolitical concerns justify the discounted multiples of the past.\n\nASML or TSMC? Considering these similarities, investors will likely win by choosing either or both stocks. However, choosing between the two probably comes down to risk tolerances.\nTSMC offers similar revenue and stock price growth at a lower valuation. Hence, if one is comfortable with the geopolitical risk, it might make sense to lean more toward TSMC.\n\nConversely, if one feels as Buffett does about the geopolitical concerns, ASML is probably the more suitable choice, as most of its manufacturing takes place far away from geopolitical hotbeds.\nUltimately, investors have the choice between two critical AI hardware stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market. Thus, this is one case where they should assess their risk tolerances and act accordingly.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Apple (AAPL)’s the Only One That Maintains High Consumer Product Satisfaction, Says Jim Cramer\n\nRamish Cheema\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 9:24 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nWe recently published 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar . Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nCramer has remained an ardent defender of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) regardless of the share price performance. The CNBC TV host sticks to his mantra of ‘own it, don’t trade it’ when it comes to the stock. Recently, his optimism has also been met by Wall Street analysts. For instance, investment bank Morgan Stanley raised Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s share price target to $315 from $305 on December 17th and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. Morgan Stanley explained that the reason behind the price target bump was an increased fiscal year 2027 earnings estimate to $9.83 from $9.55. It added that rising prices for memory chips could reduce Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s margins. On the same day, Jefferies raised the price target to $283.36 from $246.99 and kept a Hold rating on the shares. As per Jefferies, when it comes to memory chip prices, the fact that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) charges premium prices can help it buffer against possible impacts to the gross margins. As Cramer praised FedEx for moving into the business-to-consumer segment, he added that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was an example of a firm that had excelled in the consumer space:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The decision lets Apple keep selling its Series 9 and Ultra 2 devices, even though Masimo says they use its blood-oxygen sensor technology without permission.The action is based on a ruling by the International Trade Commission in 2023 that protected Masimo's patents on light-based pulse oximetry. In response, Apple released a software update that moved certain blood-oxygen computations to the iPhone that was linked with the watch. Earlier this year, U.S. Customs authorities allowed importation of the upgraded devices because of the change.Masimo said that the Customs decision was wrong and that Apple's remedy didn't fix the alleged violation. But Judge Ana Reyes turned down Masimo's request for an injunction, noting that the firm had not completed the legal requirements to stop imports.The ITC has started a fresh evaluation of the case, which means that there might be further decisions in the future. As of today, U.S. shops still have Apple's smartwatches in stock as we move into 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nIn a letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he once wrote that “the best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return (1).”\n\"The worst business to own,\" Buffett continued, \"is one that must, or will, do the opposite — that is, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low rates of return.\"\nHalfway through 2025, Buffett announced his decision to retire from his longtime post as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year (2). As of this writing, he ranks tenth on the Forbes real-time billionaires index, with a net worth of $148.1 billion (3).\nHere are some great examples of his advice — and holdings — in action.\nApple (AAPL) Buffett’s largest holding is Apple, the iPhone maker based in Cupertino, California. While Berkshire has been famously dumping shares of the company since 2024, Apple still makes up 20.5% of Berkshire’s portfolio, more than any other single holding (4).\nThe iPhone’s continued popularity, alongside solid high-margin segments for its services and software makes Apple an attractive investment.\n\nMost tellingly, Apple’s return on invested capital (ROIC) is currently sitting around 47% (5). That’s exactly the kind of capital efficiency that Buffett described as the hallmark of a great investment. It means for every dollar Apple reinvests into the business, it earns nearly half of it back in profit annually. That’s Buffett’s investing principle in full force.\nRobinhood offers a simple and convenient way to invest like Buffett in a wide variety of stocks, ETFs and options.\nThe platform provides commission-free investing in companies like Apple — meaning you won’t pay any extra fees to invest with Robinhood. It’s an easy and cost-effective way to add some of Buffett’s favorite stock picks to your portfolio .\n\nStory Continues\nNew Robinhood customers can get a free stock once they sign up and link their bank account to the app.\nYour stock reward can range from $5 to $200 , and you can pick from top American companies like Apple.",

      "Content": "Lukewarm AI Plays Can Catch Up in 2026\n\nJoey Frenette\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nQuick Read Apple stock gained only 12% in 2025 versus over 18% for the S&P 500.\nApple has spent significantly less on AI than its Magnificent Seven peers.\nA major Gemini-powered Siri update is scheduled for Spring 2026.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe heaviest hitters of the AI trade cooled off in the final quarter of 2025. As we breeze through Santa Claus rally season (it seems to be on the table this year), the big question is what's next for the AI trade. Undoubtedly, there's still a lot of nerves out there over the latest wave of volatility, which may very well be the start of a painful, drawn-out move lower.\nAs to whether we're in an AI bubble, though, remains a mystery. It'll probably be the big question going into the new year. With a recent wave of relief powering hard-hit AI stocks higher in the last few sessions, it seems like AI fears might be in an even bigger bubble than the AI stocks themselves.\nAI bubble or not, there's still value in big tech Either way, there's no denying that there are questionable valuation metrics on more than a handful of AI innovators. In short, we're closing off a great year with AI stocks and gold (as well as silver) on a high note, though things do seem to feel \"toppy,\" even though recent volatility has been shrugged off with the bull back in the driver's seat. At this juncture, I think it's a bit lazy to dismiss anything involved in the AI space as being a bubble.\n\nYou really don't have to look far for decent valuations across the stack. Whether you're interested in a \"pick and shovels\" kind of play with the GPU makers, or if you're more into the data center buildout, there are still somewhat reasonable prices of entry to be had, especially with the names that are still down a great deal from their prior highs.\nOf course, certain Magnificent Seven innovators may be some of the bigger, more obvious bargains in the AI scene today. And they might be skating to where the puck is going into 2026, as they invest in their own AI chip capabilities while looking to position themselves to profit from various emerging trends within AI.\nNotably, the productization of AI and the hyper-personalization of AI could both effectively monetize the technology. In this piece, we'll look at a \"lukewarm,\" underperforming mega-cap stock that's well-positioned to seize such opportunities in the new year.\n\nStory Continues\nApple Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) is up a rather unimpressive 12% on the year. It's an okay gain, but a market-tailing one nonetheless, with the S&P 500 up over 18%. Of course, shares of Apple have been a big winner if you bought at the post-Liberation Day lows. Still, Apple has not been all too magnificent, especially compared to some of its Mag Seven rivals, many of which investors would consider to be further along in AI.\n\nIn any case, Apple hasn't really spent as much on AI as its peers, which might make the shares a relative outperformer once those inevitable AI corrections (or worse) hit. In a prior piece, I went as far as to say that Apple stock would be spared, even rewarded, if an AI spending bubble were to let out some of its air. With shares tumbling close to 5% after briefly hitting new highs of $286 per share, it seems like Apple shareholders need more time to digest the latest run-up.\nThe stock doesn't appear cheap at more than 36.7 times trailing P/E. But, at the same time, 2026 has a ton to look forward to in AI (big Gemini-powered Siri update coming Spring 2026), new products (a home hub or wall tablet?), and beyond. Undoubtedly, it was mostly a boring, less eventful year for Apple in 2025, unless, of course, we're talking about the heated sales of the iPhone 17, which surprised many.\n\nCould Apple be the king of AI monetization? As we go into 2026 with strength in iPhone sales intact and shares in a 5% \"mini correction,\" I think there's a good setup to ring in the new year right. Personally, I'd look for that coming Siri update to serve as an example that AI can, in fact, lead to massive profits.\nFor Apple, it'll probably be in the form of device sales, as a significant product update cycle looks to play out in 2026. If Apple's AI sells while it keeps spending in check, perhaps Apple could rise as the king of AI monetization.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "QCOM Rides on Strength in Premium Handset Market: Will it Sustain?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n2454.TW\n\nAAPL\n\nSSNLF\n\nQualcomm Incorporated ( QCOM ) generated about $6.96 billion in handset revenues in the latest quarter, with a year-over-year increase of 14% and an estimated $27.8 billion in fiscal 2025, contributing roughly 63% of the total company’s revenues. Qualcomm’s strong handset revenues are driven by its increased customer demand for Snapdragon-powered premium Android smartphones.\n\nQualcomm faces strong competition from rivals like MediaTek, especially in mid-range and budget smartphones, which puts pressure on its market share and pricing. U.S.-China trade tensions have reduced companies' handset demand to a great extent. Qualcomm's handset business experienced ongoing challenges as global smartphone demand slowed down day by day. Moreover, major handset manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, are moving toward in-house chip development. This is a major challenge for Qualcomm.\nTo overcome challenges in the smartphone business, Qualcomm is focusing on premium Snapdragon chips to stay competitive in flagship devices. Qualcomm recently launched the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, offering high-speed performance, advanced AI, improved graphics, and enhanced camera capabilities for flagship smartphones from global brands like iQOO , Honor, ASUS, OnePlus, and Vivo.\n\nPer a report from Precedence Research, the global 5G chipset market is expected to reach $126.4 billion by 2030 from $18.7 billion in 2022, with a CAGR of 27%, indicating strong underlying growth potential for Qualcomm’s handset segment in the near future. QCOM’s continuous innovation in powering flagship devices with cutting-edge features helps to boost its handset revenues, maintain leadership in the premium segment, and drive future revenue growth.\nOther Tech Companies Focused on Handset Chip Development Qualcomm faces competition from Apple, Inc. ( AAPL ) and Broadcom, Inc. ( AVGO ). Apple recently launched the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and upgraded Vision Pro, all powered by their M5 chip. Apple’s iPhone 17 series uses the A19 chip, and the iPhone Air features the A19 Pro chip, both offering faster performance, better graphics, and advanced AI capabilities. These recent chips strengthen Apple’s position in the smartphone market and reduce its reliance on third-party suppliers.\n\nBroadcom recently launched Wi Fi 8 chips for smartphones and connected devices, improving speed, reliability, and efficiency. Broadcom, by providing essential smartphone components like Wi Fi, Bluetooth, and RF chips for major brands, remains important in the handset market. The company also focuses on affordable LTE chips for emerging markets, helping OEMs bring affordable smartphones to countries like India.\n\nStory Continues\nQCOM’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Qualcomm shares have gained 11.1% over the past year compared with the industry ’s growth of 35.3%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/earnings ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 14.26 forward earnings, lower than 34.54 for the industry.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 2% to $12.15 over the past 60 days, while those for 2026 have risen 3.4% to $12.60.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQualcomm stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens News of the day for Dec. 26, 2025\n\nTerry Lane\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:47 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GC=F\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^DJI\n\nStock futures were trending lower in early trading Friday following a fifth straight session of major market index gains in holiday-shortened trading Wednesday; gold and silver continued their record streak to hit new all-time highs; Nvidia agreed to buy assets from AI startup Groq; federal regulators are probing a door release issue in one Tesla model; Nike shares continued to climb after Apple CEO Tim Cook’s major stock purchase.\n\nHere's what investors need to know today.\nStock Futures Point Lower Stock futures pointed lower in premarket trading after the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average set new closing records in Wednesday's holiday-shorted trading session, when the major market indexes moved higher for a fifth straight session. Futures associated with the Dow were lower by nearly 0.2% in early trading, while those tied to the S&P 500 were fractionally lower. Futures tracking the Nasdaq crept higher. U.S. benchmark crude oil futures were at nearly $58.50 a barrel as the commodity stayed near two-week highs. Bitcoin traded at $88,600, higher than the $87,400 it hit on Wednesday. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a range of consumer loans, were at 4.14%, ticking higher from Wednesday’s levels.\n\nGold, Silver Extend Streak of Highs Gold and silver again touched record highs on Friday as the precious metals continued to see their prices rise. Gold futures were trading around $4543.50 an ounce after earlier pressing as high as $4561.60. Silver futures were at $75.67 an ounce recently after earlier reaching a new high of $75.84. Precious metals continued to add value in December, with silver rising by more than 27% this month and gold adding more than 6%. Silver has more than doubled in value this year, while gold is up by more than 70%. Investors have been pouring into the safe-haven assets as investors anticipate lower interest rates and central banks have been adding to their holdings.\n\nNvidia to Buy Assets from AI Startup Groq Nvidia ( NVDA ) has made a deal with artificial intelligence startup Groq, according to news reports and a post on the startup’s site. Groq in a statement said that Nvidia entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement for the startup’s inference technology.“The agreement reflects a shared focus on expanding access to high-performance, low cost inference,” it said. CNBC reported that the deal include an asset purchase worth $20 billion in cash, citing Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led a $750 million fundraising round for the startup.The move comes as AI stocks have been moving higher to end the year. Nvidia shares were higher by 0.6% in premarket trading.\n\nStory continues\nFederal Regulators Probe Tesla Door Release Issue The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it earlier this week opened an investigation into Tesla ( TSLA ) after it received a petition saying the mechanical door release for the 2022 Tesla Model 3 wasn’t easily accessible. “The petition cites allegations that the mechanical door release is hidden, unlabeled, and not intuitive to locate during an emergency,” the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation said. The issue is expected to affect about 179,000 vehicles. The NHTSA had opened other investigations into Tesla , including a probe on electronic door lock issues with a different model. Tesla shares ticked higher in premarket trading.\nNike Shares Continue Rise After Apple CEO Stock Purchase Nike ( NKE ) shares continued to rise in premarket trading after the athletic apparel maker helped lead stocks higher in Wednesday’s session. Nike shares gained 4.6% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook, a member of Nike's board, bought nearly $3 million worth of the company’s stock. Despite the surge, Nike shares are lower by 20% so far this year. Nike shares were higher by nearly 0.4% in premarket trading.\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Sign up now!\n\nIn Wednesday’s trading session, Wall Street’s three main equity benchmarks closed higher, with the S&P 500 posting a new record high. Nike (NKE) climbed over +4% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 and Dow after a regulatory filing revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook purchased 50,000 shares of the footwear maker. Also, some chip stocks advanced, with Micron Technology (MU) rising more than +3% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 and Lam Research (LRCX) gaining over +1%. In addition, Dynavax (DVAX) jumped more than +38% after Sanofi agreed to acquire the vaccine maker for about $2.2 billion. On the bearish side, Intel (INTC) fell about -0.5% after Reuters reported that Nvidia had paused a test of using Intel’s manufacturing process to make advanced chips.\n\nThe Labor Department’s report on Wednesday showed that the number of Americans filing for initial jobless claims in the past week fell by -10K to 214K, compared with the 224K expected.\nAs traders digested the latest economic data, they maintained their view that the Fed will deliver two quarter-point rate cuts next year. Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in an 84.5% probability of no rate change and a 15.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at January’s monetary policy meeting.\n“The stock market is finally starting to eke out some gains for December after a choppy few weeks, and just in time for the market’s Santa Claus rally, which we expect to take place in its typical format,” said Paul Stanley at Granite Bay Wealth Management.\nA Santa Claus rally refers to the consistent gains observed in the stock market over the final five trading days of December and the first two trading days of January. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has delivered an average return of 1.3%, posting gains 78% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.\n\nIn other news, China’s foreign ministry said on Friday it imposed sanctions on 10 individuals and 20 U.S. defense firms, including Boeing’s St. Louis unit, over arms sales to Taiwan. The measures freeze any assets the companies and individuals hold in China and prohibit domestic organizations and individuals from doing business with them.\n\nStory Continues\nThe U.S. economic data slate is empty on Friday.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.151%, up +0.51%.\nMost major markets in Europe remain closed today for holidays.\nAsian stock markets today closed in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.10%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.68%.\n\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index reversed earlier losses and closed higher today, extending its winning streak to eight sessions. Gold mining stocks outperformed on Friday as gold prices climbed to a new record high. Steel stocks also advanced after China said on Friday it will continue to regulate crude steel output and ban the addition of illegal new capacity from 2026 to 2030. At the same time, technology stocks retreated as investors took profits following recent strong gains. Meanwhile, the benchmark index logged its strongest week in two months, and analysts expect the upward momentum to continue, supported by a strengthening yuan. The yuan posted its strongest official close in 2-1/2 years on Thursday and hovered just shy of the psychologically important 7-per-dollar level on Friday. The currency appreciation “is expected to whet foreign appetite for yuan assets, push up valuations and increase interbank liquidity,” according to Huatai Securities. In other news, Goldman Sachs Research’s Xinquan Chen said China’s central bank has hinted at potential monetary easing in the months ahead, noting that the PBOC adopted a measured easing tone in its fourth-quarter MPC meeting’s statement. In corporate news, Sichuan Swellfun Co. fell over -1% after the spirits maker denied media reports of a potential takeover by a rival firm. Investors now look ahead to China’s November industrial profits data, scheduled for release on Saturday, which will provide insight into how companies are coping with excess-capacity pressures.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher today, led by gains in technology and healthcare stocks. The benchmark index notched a second consecutive weekly gain. Government data released on Friday showed that core consumer inflation in Japan’s capital eased in December as food cost pressures moderated, but remained above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target, keeping the central bank on course for further monetary tightening. The data supports the BOJ’s view that core inflation will dip below its 2% target in the coming months as cost pressures ease, before picking up again in a more demand-driven manner that would justify further rate hikes. The BOJ is expected to raise rates in July and December of 2026, according to a research note from two members of Barclays’ FICC Research. Separate data showed that Japan’s monthly industrial output fell more than expected in November amid the continued drag from U.S. tariffs, though companies expect output to rebound soon. In addition, data showed that retail sales growth slowed in November but was roughly in line with expectations. Meanwhile, Japan’s cabinet on Friday approved a record initial budget of about $785 billion for the next fiscal year, seeking to balance Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s proactive fiscal stance with concerns over ballooning debt by capping new bond issuance. New government bond issuance will increase only marginally from this year’s 28.6 trillion yen to 29.6 trillion yen. Notably, Japan’s finance ministry will issue the smallest amount of super-long government bonds in 17 years in the next fiscal year. The issuance plan helped push super-long JGB yields lower on Friday. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +15.98% to 21.77.\n\nThe Japanese December Tokyo Core CPI rose +2.3% y/y, weaker than expectations of +2.5% y/y.\nThe Japanese November Industrial Production (preliminary) fell -2.6% m/m, weaker than expectations of -1.9% m/m.\nThe Japanese November Retail Sales rose +1.0% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.9% y/y.\nThe Japanese November Unemployment Rate was 2.6%, in line with expectations.\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nNvidia (NVDA) rose about +0.7% in pre-market trading after agreeing to a licensing deal with AI startup Groq.\nChip stocks are edging higher in pre-market trading. Micron Technology (MU) is up over +1%, and ON Semiconductor (ON) is up about +0.5%.\nGold mining stocks advanced in pre-market trading after gold prices climbed to a record high, with Freeport-McMoran (FCX) rising over +3% and Newmont (NEM) gaining more than +1%.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) climbed more than +5% in pre-market trading after the South Korean e-commerce company said all customer data leaked in the breach had been deleted by the suspect.\nBiohaven (BHVN) plunged over -14% in pre-market trading after its experimental treatment for depression failed to achieve the primary endpoint in a mid-stage study.\nYou can see more pre-market stock movers here\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Friday - December 26th\nNone.\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is one of the best performers on Wednesday.\nNike Inc. jumped by 4.64 percent on Wednesday to close at $60 apiece after an Apple executive nearly doubled his stake in the company.\nIn a regulatory filing, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) said that Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., acquired $2.9 million worth of new shares in the company.\n\nCook is currently an independent director and now owns a little more than 105,000 shares in Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE).\nThe purchase reflected strong confidence in the stock, despite posting dismal earnings performance in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and posting lower sales guidance for the next quarter.\nIn the second quarter, the athletic fashion maker said that net income declined by 32 percent to $792 million from $1.16 billion in the same period last year.\nRevenues were flat at $12 billion due to sales declines in China, Asia Pacific, and Latin America, which were primarily offset by growth in the North American region.\nRegions with a high quality of life, including safety and healthcare, often become a magnet for new residents.\nLooking ahead, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) expects revenues for the third quarter to drop by low single digits, falling below analyst expectations of modest growth, on expectations that its operations in China, alongside higher tariffs, would continue to dampen sales.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NKE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "Italian Competition Authority fines Apple EUR 98M over app tracking\n\nTipRanks\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:25 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nThe Italian Competition Authority has issued a EUR 98M fine to Apple ( AAPL ) over ‘abuse of a dominant position’. The agency said, “The Authority found the App Tracking Transparency policy to restrict competition. The policy lays down the privacy rules imposed by the company on third-party developers of apps offered on the App Store. The Italian Competition Authority has imposed a 98,635,416.67 euro fine on Apple, Apple Distribution International and Apple Italia for abuse of a dominant position. Apple breached article 102 of the TFEU in the market for the supply to developers of platforms for the online distribution of apps to iOS users. In this market, Apple holds a super-dominant position through its App Store. The Authority conducted a complex investigation in coordination with the European Commission, other national competition authorities and the Italian Data Protection Authority. The Authority’s findings confirmed the restrictive nature – from a competition-law perspective – of the App Tracking Transparency policy, i.e. the privacy rules imposed by Apple for iOS devices, as of April 2021, on third-party developers of apps distributed through the App Store. In particular, third-party app developers are required to obtain specific consent for the collection and linking of data for advertising purposes through Apple’s ATT prompt. However, such prompt does not meet privacy legislation requirements, forcing developers to double the consent request for the same purpose. The Authority established that the terms of the ATT policy are imposed unilaterally and harm the interests of Apple’s commercial partners. The terms were also found to be disproportionate to the achievement of the company’s stated data protection objectives. Since user data are a key input for personalised online advertising, the double consent request that inevitably arises from the ATT policy, as implemented, restricts the collection, linking and use of such data.

      "Content": "Billionaires Are Buying an AI Stock That Could Be the Apple of the 2030s\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Meta recently debuted its first pair of augmented reality smart glasses, a stepping stone along a roadmap that leads to fully-immersive glasses powered by superintelligence.\nJust as smartphones have replaced personal computers for many tasks, Mark Zuckerberg says smart glasses will displace smartphones as our primary computing devices in the future.\nMeta dominates the nascent smart glasses market, and it could become a consumer electronics giant if it successfully integrates its devices with a superintelligence system.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) revolutionized mobile computing when it launched the first iPhone in 2007. Since then, smartphones have gradually become our primary computing devices, but it stands to reason that another technology could eventually fill that role.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is betting on smart glasses. The company currently earns the vast majority of its money by selling targeted ads across its social media properties. But smart glasses developed by its Reality Labs business unit could eventually become a major source of revenue, especially with assistance from its Superintelligence Labs unit.\nThe following hedge fund billionaires, all of whom outperformed the S&P 500 over the past three years, bought shares of Meta Platforms in the third quarter.\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management added 793,500 shares. Meta Platforms is his eighth-largest holding, excluding options.\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors added 1.4 million shares. Meta Platforms is his fourth-largest holding, excluding options.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management added 355,900 shares. Meta Platforms is his largest holding.\nHere's what investors should know.\nWhy Meta Platforms could be the Apple of the 2030s In September, Meta Platforms launched its first augmented reality (AR) smart glasses, which feature a built-in display on the right lens. The glasses, called Meta Ray-Ban Display, also integrate the artificial intelligence assistant Meta AI. While analysts do not anticipate earthshaking sales, they do see the product as an important stepping stone toward the Orion glasses.\n\nMeta first announced Orion in 2024 and is reportedly working toward a product launch in 2027. Orion smart glasses will have a built-in display on both lenses, creating a true holographic experience that blends the digital and physical worlds. Meta eventually plans to pair Orion with a superintelligence system, an AI assistant that surpasses human intelligence and can teach itself.\n\"Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote earlier this year. \"Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices.\"\n\nStory Continues\nZuckerberg does not mean we will abandon smartphones in the future. Instead, he thinks AR smart glasses (paired with superintelligence) will be our go-to devices. For instance, personal computers are still very useful, but smartphones have replaced them for various tasks. Zuckerberg thinks smart glasses will displace smartphones in much the same way.\n\nImportantly, Meta has been investing in smart glasses for years, and Zuckerberg says the company is \"several years ahead\" of its closest competitors. Indeed, Meta accounted for 73% of smart glasses shipments in the first half of 2025, up from 66% in the second half of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research.\nIf everything comes together as Zuckerberg expects -- meaning AI smart glasses become our primary computing devices, and Meta maintains its leadership position in the market -- Orion could be as successful as the iPhone, if not more so. In that scenario, Meta could become the Apple of the 2030s as it evolves into a consumer electronics giant.\nWhy Meta Platforms stock is worth buying today In the near term, the investment thesis for Meta Platforms centers on its status as the second-largest ad tech company, a position derived from its dominance in social media. Facebook and Instagram generate consumer data on a large scale, creating a network effect that makes Meta's content recommendation and ad targeting engines increasingly effective over time.\n\nMeta Platforms has invested in artificial intelligence to reinforce that network effect. New AI-powered recommendation and ranking systems are deepening user engagement and improving ad conversion rates (i.e., more clicks) by showing people more relevant content across its social media properties. Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan writes, \"Meta is a digital advertising juggernaut poised to increase its market share.\"\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842.50 per share. That implies 26% upside from its current share price of $665.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

The telecom giant was on a hot streak in the early days of the smartphone era. If you had invested $10,000 in Verizon stock near the end of 2005, activated the dividend reinvestment program (DRIP), and left it alone for the next 10 years, you'd have a market-beating $27,400 in your pocket.\nThe good old days are over But the smartphone frenzy slowed down over the years, though Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) managed to build one of the world's largest market caps around the iPhone.\nVerizon's soaring sales growth cooled off. Smaller rival T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) stole millions of Verizon's mobile subscribers. The company continued to generate impressive cash flows despite several rounds of expensive network infrastructure upgrades .\n\nBut the old magic was gone. If you started a new $10,000 Verizon investment on Dec. 22, 2015, you'd have $4,650 in total returns today for a total value of $14,650. That's better than sticking the cash under your pillow for a decade, but far behind the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) posting a $40,220 total-return value over the same span.\nSo, should you buy Verizon today? Verizon remains a solid dividend stock, fueled by generous cash flows. The dividend yield stands at 6.9% today -- one of the 10 highest yields in the S&P 500.\nTherefore, the stock may make sense for dividend-hungry income investors, but it seems unable to maintain its value over the long haul. Perhaps I'll change my tune in a couple of decades, as retirement approaches, but I'm not buying Verizon stock today. At this rate, I'm not even sure that Verizon will be a leading telecom competitor in 20 years (or even 10).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?

The new iOS openings in Japan and Brazil appear meaningful symbolically but do not yet transform the overall investment case.\n\nThe Brazilian settlement that opens iOS to third party app stores and alternative payments sits at the heart of that risk.

To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here .\nHappy Wednesday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Dec. 24, 2025. This post recaps the market day after the abbreviated holiday session.\n\nUpdate: 1:00 p.m ET Closing Bell The U.S. market is now closed. The market is shut early for Christmas Eve, but it still managed to hand bulls one more present ahead of the holiday: green, green, green.\n\nThe Dow (+0.60%) led among major indexes as 28 of the index's 30 components rose today; one declined and one was flat. Nike Inc. (+5.1%) saw the largest strides as Apple CEO Tim Cook bought shares in the beleaguered footwear giant. The index set a new record today at 48,731.16.\n\nThe S&P 500 (+0.32%) set a record close of its own, closing out the market at 6,932.05. Only 111 of the index's components were in decline today, with a wide variety of firms pitching in to lift the index -- and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (+0.22%).\n\nRounding out the pack, the Russell 2000 (+0.20%) closed out the day by reversing some of yesterday's declines. The small cap index fell yesterday amid worries that fast GDP growth could derail hopes for the Fed's 2026 rate cuts.\n\nThe market will be shut tomorrow to observe Christmas Day. However, here are some of the more consequential events and insights that marked today's abbreviated trading session:\nToday's Movers & Shakers Among firms with at least a $2 billion market cap , Edgewise Therapeutics (+25.2%) was the best-performing stock on the U.S. markets today, lifted by news that it completed a phase two trial for its clinical-stage heart disease drug. It was joined by a field of healthcare and technology names, including Travere Therapeutics (+13.9%), UiPath (+7.5%), and others.\nOn the other end of the market, some of the excesses of the retail trade fell back to Earth on Wednesday. AST SpaceMobile (-8.6%), Hycroft Mining (-8%), and D-Wave Quantum (-5.5%) led up a list of equities which have made our midday movers list in recent days, largely due to a bump in excitement around space, mining, quantum computing, and other popular trades.\nEconomic Data + Events Before peacing out for the Christmas holiday, investors were also treated to a small handful of economic readouts to close out the week in data.\nChief among them were jobless claims for last week. They were bifurcated, as they have been as of late: While initial claims declined (+214K, down from +224K in the previous week), continuing claims rose (+1.923 million, up from +1.885 million).\n\nStory Continues\nHere is a short digest of today's economic data:\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 24, 2025, where it first appeared in the Latest Business & Market News section.

      "Content": "1 Top Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist Before the Nasdaq Soars Higher in 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^IXIC\n\nKey Points Tech stocks have performed well in 2025, and Apple has benefited from this broader rally, thanks to the strong demand for its latest iPhones and the improving services business.\nApple's top-line growth is poised to accelerate in 2026.\nA massive installed base of users on older iPhones can help Apple outgrow the broader smartphone market in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nTechnology stocks have delivered a resilient performance in 2025, which is evident from the 21% jump in the Nasdaq Composite index this year as of this writing. I call the sector's performance resilient because tech stocks have been under stress at certain times this year owing to various factors.\nFrom the potential fallout of the Trump administration's tariffs to concerns about heavy artificial intelligence (AI) spending turning into a bubble, there have been times when investors have panicked and hit the sell button. However, the strong growth that tech companies have been reporting this year has helped them overcome the negatives.\nThe good part is that the strong spending on AI infrastructure is set to drive the stock market higher over the next couple of years. According to JPMorgan, the S&P 500 index's average earnings growth could be between 13% and 15% for \"at least the next two years,\" thanks to the \"AI supercycle.\" As a result, it won't be surprising to see Nasdaq stocks jumping higher in the new year.\nHere's a closer look at an important Nasdaq stock that can ride the broader market's rally and deliver solid gains to investors.\nThis tech giant could do better than the industry it operates in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has rallied impressively in recent months, jumping 58% since hitting a 52-week low in the first week of April. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock's impressive rise can be attributed to the healthy demand for its latest iPhones and the improving traction of the services business.\n\nApple ended its latest fiscal year 2025 (ended on Sept. 27) with $416.1 billion in revenue, up by 6.4% from the prior year. Earnings increased by 23% from the prior year to $7.46 per share. Analysts are expecting its top-line growth to accelerate to almost 9% in the current fiscal year to just over $453.1 billion.\nYou may be surprised to see that analysts are upbeat about Apple's prospects in a year when the high cost of smartphone memory chips is likely to weigh on the industry. Memory manufacturers are scrambling to meet the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips deployed in data centers, which is why they are allocating more capacity to this niche.\n\nStory Continues\nAs a result, the shortage of smartphone memory chips could lead to a 7% increase in smartphone prices next year, according to Counterpoint Research. The research firm estimates that smartphone shipments could decline by 2.1% next year. Apple, however, is expected to grow despite these headwinds. It is easy to see why that's the case.\n\nApple was the second-largest player in the global smartphone market with a share of 18.2% at the end of the third quarter, which means that it has both scale and purchasing power on its side. This gives Apple the ability to negotiate favorable prices with component suppliers. Additionally, the cheapest iPhone that Apple sells is priced at $599, which is higher than the average smartphone average selling price (ASP) of $465.\nSo, Apple can absorb the potential price increases and continue to maintain its healthy share of the smartphone market. Throw in the fact that the company's latest iPhone 17 models are experiencing healthier demand than last year's lineup, thanks to a huge installed base of users on older devices, and it is easy to see why Apple is likely to outperform the broader smartphone market in 2026.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush estimates that more than 315 million iPhones are at least four years old. Apple is expected to ship 234 million iPhone units this year. The number of users in an upgrade window indicates that it could witness a substantial jump in its shipments in 2026. Moreover, Apple is expected to launch a foldable smartphone next year, a move that could give it a nice shot in the arm.\nThe foldable smartphone market is poised to grow by 30% next year, according to IDC. Apple, therefore, will be making a smart move by diving into this space since a foldable phone can contribute toward a bigger jump in its revenue than what analysts are estimating.\nApple's impressive rally is set to continue in 2026 Apple trades at 9.8 times sales right now. That isn't very expensive as compared to the U.S. technology sector's price-to-sales ratio of 8.6. Importantly, Apple can sustain the slight valuation premium next year as well, considering the potential acceleration in growth.\nLet's say Apple's top line grows by 10% next year to $458 billion and it trades at 10 times sales. Its market cap could hit $4.6 trillion. That would be a 14% increase from its current market cap. However, Apple's ability to outperform the market's growth expectations thanks to the catalysts discussed above could help it easily deliver bigger gains, which is why buying this Nasdaq stock hand over fist looks like the smart thing to do right now.\n\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now?

THIS VERSION HAS BEEN AMENDED TO REFLECT THE CORRECT FIGURE. Nike shares climbed about 5.5% in Wednesday morning trading after Apple CEO Tim Cook doubled his personal stake in the sportswear giant. That's according to a regulatory filing. Cook sits on Nike's board and now owns about $6 million worth of stock. The purchase appears to be a vote of confidence in the turnaround efforts of Nike CEO Elliot Hill. It comes days after the company reported weaker quarterly margins and weak sales in China. That's despite Hill's attempt to lift demand with fresh marketing plans and innovation focused on running and sports while phasing out lagging lifestyle brands. The CEO has also tried to mend ties with wholesalers like Dick's Sporting Goods... to try and put the brand in front of shoppers as competition heats up with rivals. However, Hill's plan is putting strain on Nike's margins, now in decline for over a year, and its efforts to get back on top in China are faltering. Nike's shares have slumped nearly 13% since it reported results on December 18 and are on track for the fourth straight year of declines.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Apple's Tim Cook Drove Nike Stock Higher Today\n\nHoward Smith, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:29 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Apple's Tim Cook nearly doubled his stake in Nike.\nThat vote of confidence has investors thinking Nike stock has bottomed.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\nNike (NYSE: NKE) shares surged on this holiday-shortened trading day. It might not be for a reason you would think, though. The global footwear and apparel maker has had a rough year. Even amid great overall market returns, Nike shares have plunged 20% this year.\n\nMost recently, the shares dropped sharply after the company reported fiscal 2026 second-quarter results. But shares are popping today after lead independent director, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, just nearly doubled his stake in Nike with a purchase of 50,000 shares.\nAfter rising as much as 5.6% this morning, Nike shares closed today higher by 4.7%.\nIs Tim Cook calling a bottom? Nike recently reported a mixed quarter, but investors were spooked by a significant 17% drop in its China sales. That sent Nike shares sharply lower after the report, closing near a 52-week low. A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing yesterday showed Nike's lead independent director -- and Apple CEO -- Tim Cook scooped up shares on the dip.\n\nCook purchased 50,000 shares, bringing his total direct holdings to 105,480 shares, valued at approximately $6.3 million.\nThat vote of confidence has also prompted investors to jump into Nike stock today. There are also fundamental reasons to like Nike stock. While China sales slumped last quarter, sales in North America jumped 9%, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), revenue increased 3%.\nIt's not surprising to see some investors following Tim Cook's lead, thinking Nike is in the early stages of a turnaround that could make the stock a market-beater in the coming months.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nike right now? Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

( AAPL , Financials ) has agreed to open its iOS ecosystem in Brazil , allowing third-party app stores and alternative payment methods as part of a settlement with the country's antitrust regulator.\nIs AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nBrazilian competition body CADE said its internal panel accepted Apple's proposal, ending a three-year dispute. Apple will allow developers to connect to other websites and utilize outside payment methods for in-app sales under the arrangement.\nOnce developers must comply, the modifications will take effect. CADE gave Apple 105 days to comply with the new standards or risk a 150 million reais ($27 million) penalties. The deal lasts three years.\nApple will comply with the judgment but warned that exposing iOS to outside app stores and payment systems might compromise user privacy and security. Though it cannot remove such dangers, the corporation has taken efforts to mitigate them.\nA 2022 lawsuit from MercadoLibre charged Apple of hindering competition in digital goods delivery and payments on iOS devices. MercadoLibre applauded the verdict but said it only partly addressed the need for more equitable guidelines.\nInvestors will see whether comparable regulatory pressure extends to other places, possibly changing Apple's App Store strategy.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
