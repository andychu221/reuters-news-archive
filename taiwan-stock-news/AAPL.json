      "Content": "From Tesla To Nike: Why Tim Cook's Buy Is Drawing Market Parallels\n\nSurbhi Jain\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:31 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNKE\n\nAAPL\n\nMarket bottoms rarely arrive with reassurance. They show up when skepticism turns casual — when stocks stop being debated and start being dismissed. That's the backdrop against which Apple Inc ‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook 's purchase of Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ) shares is suddenly getting serious attention .\n\nEarlier this year, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) found its footing just as public commentary around the stock turned openly mocking, including a high-profile jab from Tim Walz . The remark didn't cause the bottom — but it coincided with a moment when pessimism appeared fully priced in. Tesla didn't explode higher overnight. It simply stopped going down. And that was the tell.\nDon't Miss:\nThese five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nPeak Skepticism Setup Nike now sits in a similarly uncomfortable place. The stock has spent months under pressure from margin concerns, inventory cleanups, and questions around consumer demand. Expectations are low. Sentiment is thin. The narrative has grown tired. The shares are down over 18% YTD.\nThat's what makes Tim Cook's personal purchase of roughly $3 million worth of Nike shares stand out. Not the size — the timing.\n\nWhy This Buy Matters Cook isn't a Nike insider. He isn't required to buy. And he isn't known for tactical trades. When someone with his profile steps into a struggling consumer name, markets naturally ask whether downside risk is becoming asymmetric.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThis isn't a call that Nike's problems are solved. Execution still matters, and fundamentals will ultimately decide the outcome. But selective, high-profile buying tends to show up closer to inflection points than to peaks.\nTesla's Quiet Lesson Tesla's bottom earlier this year offered a simple reminder: markets often turn when confidence looks misplaced and skepticism sounds effortless. Nike may not follow the same script — but Tim Cook's move suggests the risk-reward conversation has shifted.\nAnd when that happens, the story usually changes before the stock does.\nRead Next:\nBuffett's Secret to Wealth?

      "Content": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: ASML vs. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points ASML's equipment is essential to producing the world's most advanced semiconductors.\nTSMC has effectively leveraged ASML's equipment to produce the world's most advanced chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) are arguably the two most essential artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the hardware space. TSMC is well known for being the foundry of choice for Nvidia , Apple , and other top semiconductor companies.\n\nHowever, TSMC's success is not possible without ASML. It uses the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines built by ASML to manufacture the world's most advanced chips.\nThis creates a harder job for investors trying to discern which stock is more likely to make the highest long-term gains. Although both companies are critical to this process, investors need to take a closer look to see which is the more suitable stock for them to own.\nThe case for ASML Investors should remember one thing about ASML. Despite ASML's importance, only a tiny client base is interested in its EUV machines, which can cost as much as $400 million each. Worse, political concerns bar what equipment it can sell to countries like China, further adding to that limitation.\nNonetheless, companies such as Samsung and Intel are among the companies buying EUV machines. Additionally, ASML operates in the deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) market. Although the market has more competitors, it also allows it to earn business from foundry companies that produce other types of chips.\n\nFurthermore, such costly equipment needs periodic maintenance. With that, the Netherlands-based company runs a thriving maintenance business that accounts for more than one-third of ASML's revenue.\nAmid the growth in AI, its machines are more in demand, so much so that ASML earned almost 23 billion euros ($27 billion) in revenue in the first nine months of 2025, a yearly increase of 21%.\nAlso, ASML limited expense growth, leading to a net income of 6.8 billion euros ($7.9 billion), a 39% rise from year-ago levels. With the rising profits, the stock is up by almost 50% over the last year.\nInvestors should also note the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. While that is above the S&P 500\naverage of 31, it closely approximates the company's average over the last five years. Considering the demand in AI, such a valuation is unlikely to deter investors from bidding the stock price higher over time.\n\nWhy investors might consider TSMC However, with a larger client base, investors might find TSMC stock more appealing. They might also like its dominance.\n\nStory Continues\nAs mentioned, TSMC makes the world's most advanced chips. While companies like Samsung and Intel have attempted to compete, TSMC's dominant market share continues to grow. As of the second quarter of 2025, that market share reached 70%, giving the company a tremendous competitive advantage.\nThis arguably makes TSMC's biggest threat operating in Taiwan, an island that has dealt with periodic threats of an invasion by China. Since Chinese companies also depend on its chips, the threat could be overblown. Still, it was concerning enough that Warren Buffett reversed a decision by his lieutenants to invest Berkshire Hathaway 's capital in the company.\n\nThat threat has not stopped TSMC's growth. The $87 billion in revenue TSMC earned in the first nine months of 2025 rose 36% compared to the same period last year.\nAlso, like with ASML, expenses grew more slowly than revenue. Still, with other comprehensive losses weighing on the bottom line, its comprehensive income of $35 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 increased by 30% year over year. If not including those losses, net income would have grown by 52%.\nAmid the rising demand and income, TSMC stock is up by almost 50% over the last year. Also, with a 30 P/E ratio, it is cheaper than ASML and trades at a valuation that closely matches the S&P 500 average.\nStill, TSMC has tended to trade at a discount, and for that reason, it is above its average earnings multiple of 25 over the last five years. That makes it unclear whether TSMC is a better bargain, or whether investors feel the geopolitical concerns justify the discounted multiples of the past.\n\nASML or TSMC? Considering these similarities, investors will likely win by choosing either or both stocks. However, choosing between the two probably comes down to risk tolerances.\nTSMC offers similar revenue and stock price growth at a lower valuation. Hence, if one is comfortable with the geopolitical risk, it might make sense to lean more toward TSMC.\n\nConversely, if one feels as Buffett does about the geopolitical concerns, ASML is probably the more suitable choice, as most of its manufacturing takes place far away from geopolitical hotbeds.\nUltimately, investors have the choice between two critical AI hardware stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market. Thus, this is one case where they should assess their risk tolerances and act accordingly.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nCramer has remained an ardent defender of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) regardless of the share price performance. The CNBC TV host sticks to his mantra of ‘own it, don’t trade it’ when it comes to the stock. Recently, his optimism has also been met by Wall Street analysts. For instance, investment bank Morgan Stanley raised Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s share price target to $315 from $305 on December 17th and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. Morgan Stanley explained that the reason behind the price target bump was an increased fiscal year 2027 earnings estimate to $9.83 from $9.55. It added that rising prices for memory chips could reduce Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s margins. On the same day, Jefferies raised the price target to $283.36 from $246.99 and kept a Hold rating on the shares. As per Jefferies, when it comes to memory chip prices, the fact that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) charges premium prices can help it buffer against possible impacts to the gross margins. As Cramer praised FedEx for moving into the business-to-consumer segment, he added that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was an example of a firm that had excelled in the consumer space:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The decision lets Apple keep selling its Series 9 and Ultra 2 devices, even though Masimo says they use its blood-oxygen sensor technology without permission.The action is based on a ruling by the International Trade Commission in 2023 that protected Masimo's patents on light-based pulse oximetry.

While Berkshire has been famously dumping shares of the company since 2024, Apple still makes up 20.5% of Berkshire’s portfolio, more than any other single holding (4).\nThe iPhone’s continued popularity, alongside solid high-margin segments for its services and software makes Apple an attractive investment.\n\nMost tellingly, Apple’s return on invested capital (ROIC) is currently sitting around 47% (5). That’s exactly the kind of capital efficiency that Buffett described as the hallmark of a great investment. It means for every dollar Apple reinvests into the business, it earns nearly half of it back in profit annually. That’s Buffett’s investing principle in full force.\nRobinhood offers a simple and convenient way to invest like Buffett in a wide variety of stocks, ETFs and options.\nThe platform provides commission-free investing in companies like Apple — meaning you won’t pay any extra fees to invest with Robinhood. It’s an easy and cost-effective way to add some of Buffett’s favorite stock picks to your portfolio .\n\nStory Continues\nNew Robinhood customers can get a free stock once they sign up and link their bank account to the app.\nYour stock reward can range from $5 to $200 , and you can pick from top American companies like Apple.",

That jump stood out because overall phone shipments in China barely grew, rising just 1.9% to 30.16 million units.

      "Content": "Lukewarm AI Plays Can Catch Up in 2026\n\nJoey Frenette\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nQuick Read Apple stock gained only 12% in 2025 versus over 18% for the S&P 500.\nApple has spent significantly less on AI than its Magnificent Seven peers.\nA major Gemini-powered Siri update is scheduled for Spring 2026.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe heaviest hitters of the AI trade cooled off in the final quarter of 2025. As we breeze through Santa Claus rally season (it seems to be on the table this year), the big question is what's next for the AI trade. Undoubtedly, there's still a lot of nerves out there over the latest wave of volatility, which may very well be the start of a painful, drawn-out move lower.\nAs to whether we're in an AI bubble, though, remains a mystery. It'll probably be the big question going into the new year. With a recent wave of relief powering hard-hit AI stocks higher in the last few sessions, it seems like AI fears might be in an even bigger bubble than the AI stocks themselves.\nAI bubble or not, there's still value in big tech Either way, there's no denying that there are questionable valuation metrics on more than a handful of AI innovators. In short, we're closing off a great year with AI stocks and gold (as well as silver) on a high note, though things do seem to feel \"toppy,\" even though recent volatility has been shrugged off with the bull back in the driver's seat. At this juncture, I think it's a bit lazy to dismiss anything involved in the AI space as being a bubble.\n\nYou really don't have to look far for decent valuations across the stack. Whether you're interested in a \"pick and shovels\" kind of play with the GPU makers, or if you're more into the data center buildout, there are still somewhat reasonable prices of entry to be had, especially with the names that are still down a great deal from their prior highs.\nOf course, certain Magnificent Seven innovators may be some of the bigger, more obvious bargains in the AI scene today. And they might be skating to where the puck is going into 2026, as they invest in their own AI chip capabilities while looking to position themselves to profit from various emerging trends within AI.\nNotably, the productization of AI and the hyper-personalization of AI could both effectively monetize the technology. In this piece, we'll look at a \"lukewarm,\" underperforming mega-cap stock that's well-positioned to seize such opportunities in the new year.\n\nStory Continues\nApple Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) is up a rather unimpressive 12% on the year. It's an okay gain, but a market-tailing one nonetheless, with the S&P 500 up over 18%. Of course, shares of Apple have been a big winner if you bought at the post-Liberation Day lows. Still, Apple has not been all too magnificent, especially compared to some of its Mag Seven rivals, many of which investors would consider to be further along in AI.\n\nIn any case, Apple hasn't really spent as much on AI as its peers, which might make the shares a relative outperformer once those inevitable AI corrections (or worse) hit. In a prior piece, I went as far as to say that Apple stock would be spared, even rewarded, if an AI spending bubble were to let out some of its air. With shares tumbling close to 5% after briefly hitting new highs of $286 per share, it seems like Apple shareholders need more time to digest the latest run-up.\nThe stock doesn't appear cheap at more than 36.7 times trailing P/E. But, at the same time, 2026 has a ton to look forward to in AI (big Gemini-powered Siri update coming Spring 2026), new products (a home hub or wall tablet?), and beyond. Undoubtedly, it was mostly a boring, less eventful year for Apple in 2025, unless, of course, we're talking about the heated sales of the iPhone 17, which surprised many.\n\nCould Apple be the king of AI monetization? As we go into 2026 with strength in iPhone sales intact and shares in a 5% \"mini correction,\" I think there's a good setup to ring in the new year right. Personally, I'd look for that coming Siri update to serve as an example that AI can, in fact, lead to massive profits.\nFor Apple, it'll probably be in the form of device sales, as a significant product update cycle looks to play out in 2026. If Apple's AI sells while it keeps spending in check, perhaps Apple could rise as the king of AI monetization.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "QCOM Rides on Strength in Premium Handset Market: Will it Sustain?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n2454.TW\n\nAAPL\n\nSSNLF\n\nQualcomm Incorporated ( QCOM ) generated about $6.96 billion in handset revenues in the latest quarter, with a year-over-year increase of 14% and an estimated $27.8 billion in fiscal 2025, contributing roughly 63% of the total company’s revenues. Qualcomm’s strong handset revenues are driven by its increased customer demand for Snapdragon-powered premium Android smartphones.\n\nQualcomm faces strong competition from rivals like MediaTek, especially in mid-range and budget smartphones, which puts pressure on its market share and pricing. U.S.-China trade tensions have reduced companies' handset demand to a great extent. Qualcomm's handset business experienced ongoing challenges as global smartphone demand slowed down day by day. Moreover, major handset manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, are moving toward in-house chip development. This is a major challenge for Qualcomm.\nTo overcome challenges in the smartphone business, Qualcomm is focusing on premium Snapdragon chips to stay competitive in flagship devices. Qualcomm recently launched the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, offering high-speed performance, advanced AI, improved graphics, and enhanced camera capabilities for flagship smartphones from global brands like iQOO , Honor, ASUS, OnePlus, and Vivo.\n\nPer a report from Precedence Research, the global 5G chipset market is expected to reach $126.4 billion by 2030 from $18.7 billion in 2022, with a CAGR of 27%, indicating strong underlying growth potential for Qualcomm’s handset segment in the near future. QCOM’s continuous innovation in powering flagship devices with cutting-edge features helps to boost its handset revenues, maintain leadership in the premium segment, and drive future revenue growth.\nOther Tech Companies Focused on Handset Chip Development Qualcomm faces competition from Apple, Inc. ( AAPL ) and Broadcom, Inc. ( AVGO ). Apple recently launched the new iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and upgraded Vision Pro, all powered by their M5 chip. Apple’s iPhone 17 series uses the A19 chip, and the iPhone Air features the A19 Pro chip, both offering faster performance, better graphics, and advanced AI capabilities. These recent chips strengthen Apple’s position in the smartphone market and reduce its reliance on third-party suppliers.\n\nBroadcom recently launched Wi Fi 8 chips for smartphones and connected devices, improving speed, reliability, and efficiency. Broadcom, by providing essential smartphone components like Wi Fi, Bluetooth, and RF chips for major brands, remains important in the handset market. The company also focuses on affordable LTE chips for emerging markets, helping OEMs bring affordable smartphones to countries like India.\n\nStory Continues\nQCOM’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Qualcomm shares have gained 11.1% over the past year compared with the industry ’s growth of 35.3%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/earnings ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 14.26 forward earnings, lower than 34.54 for the industry.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 2% to $12.15 over the past 60 days, while those for 2026 have risen 3.4% to $12.60.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nQualcomm stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Futures associated with the Dow were lower by nearly 0.2% in early trading, while those tied to the S&P 500 were fractionally lower. Futures tracking the Nasdaq crept higher. U.S. benchmark crude oil futures were at nearly $58.50 a barrel as the commodity stayed near two-week highs. Bitcoin traded at $88,600, higher than the $87,400 it hit on Wednesday. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a range of consumer loans, were at 4.14%, ticking higher from Wednesday’s levels.\n\nGold, Silver Extend Streak of Highs Gold and silver again touched record highs on Friday as the precious metals continued to see their prices rise. Gold futures were trading around $4543.50 an ounce after earlier pressing as high as $4561.60. Silver futures were at $75.67 an ounce recently after earlier reaching a new high of $75.84. Precious metals continued to add value in December, with silver rising by more than 27% this month and gold adding more than 6%. Silver has more than doubled in value this year, while gold is up by more than 70%. Investors have been pouring into the safe-haven assets as investors anticipate lower interest rates and central banks have been adding to their holdings.\n\nNvidia to Buy Assets from AI Startup Groq Nvidia ( NVDA ) has made a deal with artificial intelligence startup Groq, according to news reports and a post on the startup’s site. Groq in a statement said that Nvidia entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement for the startup’s inference technology.“The agreement reflects a shared focus on expanding access to high-performance, low cost inference,” it said. CNBC reported that the deal include an asset purchase worth $20 billion in cash, citing Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led a $750 million fundraising round for the startup.The move comes as AI stocks have been moving higher to end the year. Nvidia shares were higher by 0.6% in premarket trading.\n\nStory continues\nFederal Regulators Probe Tesla Door Release Issue The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it earlier this week opened an investigation into Tesla ( TSLA ) after it received a petition saying the mechanical door release for the 2022 Tesla Model 3 wasn’t easily accessible. “The petition cites allegations that the mechanical door release is hidden, unlabeled, and not intuitive to locate during an emergency,” the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation said. The issue is expected to affect about 179,000 vehicles. The NHTSA had opened other investigations into Tesla , including a probe on electronic door lock issues with a different model. Tesla shares ticked higher in premarket trading.\nNike Shares Continue Rise After Apple CEO Stock Purchase Nike ( NKE ) shares continued to rise in premarket trading after the athletic apparel maker helped lead stocks higher in Wednesday’s session. Nike shares gained 4.6% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook, a member of Nike's board, bought nearly $3 million worth of the company’s stock. Despite the surge, Nike shares are lower by 20% so far this year.

The 10-year T-note yield rose two basis points to 4.15%.\n\nMore News from Barchart As the FDA Approves a Wegovy Pill, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold Novo Nordisk Stock?\nThis Dividend Giant Yielding 4.5% Is Wall Street’s Top Telecom Pick for 2026\nHave a MERRY Christmas With These 9 Unusually Active Options\nTired of missing midday reversals?

Sign up now!\n\nIn Wednesday’s trading session, Wall Street’s three main equity benchmarks closed higher, with the S&P 500 posting a new record high. Nike (NKE) climbed over +4% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 and Dow after a regulatory filing revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook purchased 50,000 shares of the footwear maker. Also, some chip stocks advanced, with Micron Technology (MU) rising more than +3% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 and Lam Research (LRCX) gaining over +1%. In addition, Dynavax (DVAX) jumped more than +38% after Sanofi agreed to acquire the vaccine maker for about $2.2 billion. On the bearish side, Intel (INTC) fell about -0.5% after Reuters reported that Nvidia had paused a test of using Intel’s manufacturing process to make advanced chips.\n\nThe Labor Department’s report on Wednesday showed that the number of Americans filing for initial jobless claims in the past week fell by -10K to 214K, compared with the 224K expected.\nAs traders digested the latest economic data, they maintained their view that the Fed will deliver two quarter-point rate cuts next year. Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in an 84.5% probability of no rate change and a 15.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at January’s monetary policy meeting.\n“The stock market is finally starting to eke out some gains for December after a choppy few weeks, and just in time for the market’s Santa Claus rally, which we expect to take place in its typical format,” said Paul Stanley at Granite Bay Wealth Management.\nA Santa Claus rally refers to the consistent gains observed in the stock market over the final five trading days of December and the first two trading days of January. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has delivered an average return of 1.3%, posting gains 78% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.\n\nIn other news, China’s foreign ministry said on Friday it imposed sanctions on 10 individuals and 20 U.S. defense firms, including Boeing’s St. Louis unit, over arms sales to Taiwan. The measures freeze any assets the companies and individuals hold in China and prohibit domestic organizations and individuals from doing business with them.\n\nStory Continues\nThe U.S. economic data slate is empty on Friday.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.151%, up +0.51%.\nMost major markets in Europe remain closed today for holidays.\nAsian stock markets today closed in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.10%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.68%.\n\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index reversed earlier losses and closed higher today, extending its winning streak to eight sessions. Gold mining stocks outperformed on Friday as gold prices climbed to a new record high. Steel stocks also advanced after China said on Friday it will continue to regulate crude steel output and ban the addition of illegal new capacity from 2026 to 2030. At the same time, technology stocks retreated as investors took profits following recent strong gains. Meanwhile, the benchmark index logged its strongest week in two months, and analysts expect the upward momentum to continue, supported by a strengthening yuan. The yuan posted its strongest official close in 2-1/2 years on Thursday and hovered just shy of the psychologically important 7-per-dollar level on Friday. The currency appreciation “is expected to whet foreign appetite for yuan assets, push up valuations and increase interbank liquidity,” according to Huatai Securities. In other news, Goldman Sachs Research’s Xinquan Chen said China’s central bank has hinted at potential monetary easing in the months ahead, noting that the PBOC adopted a measured easing tone in its fourth-quarter MPC meeting’s statement. In corporate news, Sichuan Swellfun Co. fell over -1% after the spirits maker denied media reports of a potential takeover by a rival firm. Investors now look ahead to China’s November industrial profits data, scheduled for release on Saturday, which will provide insight into how companies are coping with excess-capacity pressures.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher today, led by gains in technology and healthcare stocks. The benchmark index notched a second consecutive weekly gain. Government data released on Friday showed that core consumer inflation in Japan’s capital eased in December as food cost pressures moderated, but remained above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target, keeping the central bank on course for further monetary tightening. The data supports the BOJ’s view that core inflation will dip below its 2% target in the coming months as cost pressures ease, before picking up again in a more demand-driven manner that would justify further rate hikes. The BOJ is expected to raise rates in July and December of 2026, according to a research note from two members of Barclays’ FICC Research. Separate data showed that Japan’s monthly industrial output fell more than expected in November amid the continued drag from U.S. tariffs, though companies expect output to rebound soon. In addition, data showed that retail sales growth slowed in November but was roughly in line with expectations. Meanwhile, Japan’s cabinet on Friday approved a record initial budget of about $785 billion for the next fiscal year, seeking to balance Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s proactive fiscal stance with concerns over ballooning debt by capping new bond issuance. New government bond issuance will increase only marginally from this year’s 28.6 trillion yen to 29.6 trillion yen. Notably, Japan’s finance ministry will issue the smallest amount of super-long government bonds in 17 years in the next fiscal year. The issuance plan helped push super-long JGB yields lower on Friday. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +15.98% to 21.77.\n\nThe Japanese December Tokyo Core CPI rose +2.3% y/y, weaker than expectations of +2.5% y/y.\nThe Japanese November Industrial Production (preliminary) fell -2.6% m/m, weaker than expectations of -1.9% m/m.\nThe Japanese November Retail Sales rose +1.0% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.9% y/y.\nThe Japanese November Unemployment Rate was 2.6%, in line with expectations.\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nNvidia (NVDA) rose about +0.7% in pre-market trading after agreeing to a licensing deal with AI startup Groq.\nChip stocks are edging higher in pre-market trading. Micron Technology (MU) is up over +1%, and ON Semiconductor (ON) is up about +0.5%.\nGold mining stocks advanced in pre-market trading after gold prices climbed to a record high, with Freeport-McMoran (FCX) rising over +3% and Newmont (NEM) gaining more than +1%.\n\nCoupang (CPNG) climbed more than +5% in pre-market trading after the South Korean e-commerce company said all customer data leaked in the breach had been deleted by the suspect.\nBiohaven (BHVN) plunged over -14% in pre-market trading after its experimental treatment for depression failed to achieve the primary endpoint in a mid-stage study.\nYou can see more pre-market stock movers here\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Friday - December 26th\nNone.\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is one of the best performers on Wednesday.\nNike Inc. jumped by 4.64 percent on Wednesday to close at $60 apiece after an Apple executive nearly doubled his stake in the company.\nIn a regulatory filing, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) said that Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., acquired $2.9 million worth of new shares in the company.\n\nCook is currently an independent director and now owns a little more than 105,000 shares in Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE).\nThe purchase reflected strong confidence in the stock, despite posting dismal earnings performance in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and posting lower sales guidance for the next quarter.\nIn the second quarter, the athletic fashion maker said that net income declined by 32 percent to $792 million from $1.16 billion in the same period last year.\nRevenues were flat at $12 billion due to sales declines in China, Asia Pacific, and Latin America, which were primarily offset by growth in the North American region.\nRegions with a high quality of life, including safety and healthcare, often become a magnet for new residents.\nLooking ahead, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) expects revenues for the third quarter to drop by low single digits, falling below analyst expectations of modest growth, on expectations that its operations in China, alongside higher tariffs, would continue to dampen sales.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NKE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "Italian Competition Authority fines Apple EUR 98M over app tracking\n\nTipRanks\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:25 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nThe Italian Competition Authority has issued a EUR 98M fine to Apple ( AAPL ) over ‘abuse of a dominant position’. The agency said, “The Authority found the App Tracking Transparency policy to restrict competition. The policy lays down the privacy rules imposed by the company on third-party developers of apps offered on the App Store. The Italian Competition Authority has imposed a 98,635,416.67 euro fine on Apple, Apple Distribution International and Apple Italia for abuse of a dominant position. Apple breached article 102 of the TFEU in the market for the supply to developers of platforms for the online distribution of apps to iOS users. In this market, Apple holds a super-dominant position through its App Store. The Authority conducted a complex investigation in coordination with the European Commission, other national competition authorities and the Italian Data Protection Authority. The Authority’s findings confirmed the restrictive nature – from a competition-law perspective – of the App Tracking Transparency policy, i.e. the privacy rules imposed by Apple for iOS devices, as of April 2021, on third-party developers of apps distributed through the App Store. In particular, third-party app developers are required to obtain specific consent for the collection and linking of data for advertising purposes through Apple’s ATT prompt. However, such prompt does not meet privacy legislation requirements, forcing developers to double the consent request for the same purpose. The Authority established that the terms of the ATT policy are imposed unilaterally and harm the interests of Apple’s commercial partners. The terms were also found to be disproportionate to the achievement of the company’s stated data protection objectives. Since user data are a key input for personalised online advertising, the double consent request that inevitably arises from the ATT policy, as implemented, restricts the collection, linking and use of such data. As a result, such double consent requirement is harmful to developers, whose business model relies on the sale of advertising space, as well as to advertisers and advertising intermediation platforms.”\n\nClaim 70% Off TipRanks This Holiday Season Unlock hedge fund-level data and powerful investing tools for smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis and maximize your portfolio's potential\nPublished first on TheFly – the ultimate source for real-time, market-moving breaking financial news.

      "Content": "Billionaires Are Buying an AI Stock That Could Be the Apple of the 2030s\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Meta recently debuted its first pair of augmented reality smart glasses, a stepping stone along a roadmap that leads to fully-immersive glasses powered by superintelligence.\nJust as smartphones have replaced personal computers for many tasks, Mark Zuckerberg says smart glasses will displace smartphones as our primary computing devices in the future.\nMeta dominates the nascent smart glasses market, and it could become a consumer electronics giant if it successfully integrates its devices with a superintelligence system.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) revolutionized mobile computing when it launched the first iPhone in 2007. Since then, smartphones have gradually become our primary computing devices, but it stands to reason that another technology could eventually fill that role.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is betting on smart glasses. The company currently earns the vast majority of its money by selling targeted ads across its social media properties. But smart glasses developed by its Reality Labs business unit could eventually become a major source of revenue, especially with assistance from its Superintelligence Labs unit.\nThe following hedge fund billionaires, all of whom outperformed the S&P 500 over the past three years, bought shares of Meta Platforms in the third quarter.\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management added 793,500 shares. Meta Platforms is his eighth-largest holding, excluding options.\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors added 1.4 million shares. Meta Platforms is his fourth-largest holding, excluding options.\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management added 355,900 shares. Meta Platforms is his largest holding.\nHere's what investors should know.\nWhy Meta Platforms could be the Apple of the 2030s In September, Meta Platforms launched its first augmented reality (AR) smart glasses, which feature a built-in display on the right lens. The glasses, called Meta Ray-Ban Display, also integrate the artificial intelligence assistant Meta AI. While analysts do not anticipate earthshaking sales, they do see the product as an important stepping stone toward the Orion glasses.\n\nMeta first announced Orion in 2024 and is reportedly working toward a product launch in 2027. Orion smart glasses will have a built-in display on both lenses, creating a true holographic experience that blends the digital and physical worlds. Meta eventually plans to pair Orion with a superintelligence system, an AI assistant that surpasses human intelligence and can teach itself.\n\"Personal superintelligence that knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them will be by far the most useful,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote earlier this year. \"Personal devices like glasses that understand our context because they can see what we see, hear what we hear, and interact with us throughout the day will become our primary computing devices.\"\n\nStory Continues\nZuckerberg does not mean we will abandon smartphones in the future. Instead, he thinks AR smart glasses (paired with superintelligence) will be our go-to devices. For instance, personal computers are still very useful, but smartphones have replaced them for various tasks. Zuckerberg thinks smart glasses will displace smartphones in much the same way.\n\nImportantly, Meta has been investing in smart glasses for years, and Zuckerberg says the company is \"several years ahead\" of its closest competitors. Indeed, Meta accounted for 73% of smart glasses shipments in the first half of 2025, up from 66% in the second half of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research.\nIf everything comes together as Zuckerberg expects -- meaning AI smart glasses become our primary computing devices, and Meta maintains its leadership position in the market -- Orion could be as successful as the iPhone, if not more so. In that scenario, Meta could become the Apple of the 2030s as it evolves into a consumer electronics giant.\nWhy Meta Platforms stock is worth buying today In the near term, the investment thesis for Meta Platforms centers on its status as the second-largest ad tech company, a position derived from its dominance in social media. Facebook and Instagram generate consumer data on a large scale, creating a network effect that makes Meta's content recommendation and ad targeting engines increasingly effective over time.\n\nMeta Platforms has invested in artificial intelligence to reinforce that network effect. New AI-powered recommendation and ranking systems are deepening user engagement and improving ad conversion rates (i.e., more clicks) by showing people more relevant content across its social media properties. Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan writes, \"Meta is a digital advertising juggernaut poised to increase its market share.\"\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842.50 per share. That implies 26% upside from its current share price of $665.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "If You'd Invested $10,000 in Verizon Communications 10 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:53 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: VZ\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points A $10,000 Verizon investment in 2015 would be worth just $14,650 today, badly trailing the S&P 500.\nThe same investment made in 2005 grew to $27,400 by 2015, beating the market.\nThe stock may suit dividend-focused income investors, but long-term growth seekers should look elsewhere.\n10 stocks we like better than Verizon Communications ›\n\nBear with me for a second; I'd like to start this overview with a quick history lesson.\nVerizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) was a hot tamale in 2015. The telecom giant was on a hot streak in the early days of the smartphone era. If you had invested $10,000 in Verizon stock near the end of 2005, activated the dividend reinvestment program (DRIP), and left it alone for the next 10 years, you'd have a market-beating $27,400 in your pocket.\nThe good old days are over But the smartphone frenzy slowed down over the years, though Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) managed to build one of the world's largest market caps around the iPhone.\nVerizon's soaring sales growth cooled off. Smaller rival T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) stole millions of Verizon's mobile subscribers. The company continued to generate impressive cash flows despite several rounds of expensive network infrastructure upgrades .\n\nBut the old magic was gone. If you started a new $10,000 Verizon investment on Dec. 22, 2015, you'd have $4,650 in total returns today for a total value of $14,650. That's better than sticking the cash under your pillow for a decade, but far behind the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) posting a $40,220 total-return value over the same span.\nSo, should you buy Verizon today? Verizon remains a solid dividend stock, fueled by generous cash flows. The dividend yield stands at 6.9% today -- one of the 10 highest yields in the S&P 500.\nTherefore, the stock may make sense for dividend-hungry income investors, but it seems unable to maintain its value over the long haul. Perhaps I'll change my tune in a couple of decades, as retirement approaches, but I'm not buying Verizon stock today. At this rate, I'm not even sure that Verizon will be a leading telecom competitor in 20 years (or even 10).\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now? Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Verizon Communications wasn’t one of them.

Find out which 37 stocks are leading the charge .\nApple Investment Narrative Recap To own Apple, you need to believe its ecosystem can keep turning a mature iPhone base into steadily growing, high‑margin services and software income. The biggest near term catalyst is how effectively Apple layers AI features like SHARP 3D imaging across hardware and services, while the key risk is mounting regulatory pressure on its App Store model. The new iOS openings in Japan and Brazil appear meaningful symbolically but do not yet transform the overall investment case.\n\nThe Brazilian settlement that opens iOS to third party app stores and alternative payments sits at the heart of that risk. It directly touches Apple’s most profitable Services revenue stream while testing whether the company can defend its security and privacy pitch as regulators push for more competition. How Apple balances compliance with preserving App Store economics will be central to how investors assess its next phase of AI and services driven growth.\nYet behind the AI headlines, investors should be aware that escalating app store regulation could...\nRead the full narrative on Apple (it's free!)\nApple's narrative projects $477.4 billion revenue and $133.6 billion earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "Stock Market Today: 'Santa Rally' Brings New Records for Dow and S&P 500 On Christmas Eve\n\nNoah Weidner\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:23 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nThis live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market. To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here .\nHappy Wednesday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Dec. 24, 2025. This post recaps the market day after the abbreviated holiday session.\n\nUpdate: 1:00 p.m ET Closing Bell The U.S. market is now closed. The market is shut early for Christmas Eve, but it still managed to hand bulls one more present ahead of the holiday: green, green, green.\n\nThe Dow (+0.60%) led among major indexes as 28 of the index's 30 components rose today; one declined and one was flat. Nike Inc. (+5.1%) saw the largest strides as Apple CEO Tim Cook bought shares in the beleaguered footwear giant. The index set a new record today at 48,731.16.\n\nThe S&P 500 (+0.32%) set a record close of its own, closing out the market at 6,932.05. Only 111 of the index's components were in decline today, with a wide variety of firms pitching in to lift the index -- and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (+0.22%).\n\nRounding out the pack, the Russell 2000 (+0.20%) closed out the day by reversing some of yesterday's declines. The small cap index fell yesterday amid worries that fast GDP growth could derail hopes for the Fed's 2026 rate cuts.\n\nThe market will be shut tomorrow to observe Christmas Day. However, here are some of the more consequential events and insights that marked today's abbreviated trading session:\nToday's Movers & Shakers Among firms with at least a $2 billion market cap , Edgewise Therapeutics (+25.2%) was the best-performing stock on the U.S. markets today, lifted by news that it completed a phase two trial for its clinical-stage heart disease drug. It was joined by a field of healthcare and technology names, including Travere Therapeutics (+13.9%), UiPath (+7.5%), and others.\nOn the other end of the market, some of the excesses of the retail trade fell back to Earth on Wednesday. AST SpaceMobile (-8.6%), Hycroft Mining (-8%), and D-Wave Quantum (-5.5%) led up a list of equities which have made our midday movers list in recent days, largely due to a bump in excitement around space, mining, quantum computing, and other popular trades.\nEconomic Data + Events Before peacing out for the Christmas holiday, investors were also treated to a small handful of economic readouts to close out the week in data.\nChief among them were jobless claims for last week. They were bifurcated, as they have been as of late: While initial claims declined (+214K, down from +224K in the previous week), continuing claims rose (+1.923 million, up from +1.885 million).\n\nStory Continues\nHere is a short digest of today's economic data:\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 24, 2025, where it first appeared in the Latest Business & Market News section.

      "Content": "1 Top Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist Before the Nasdaq Soars Higher in 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^IXIC\n\nKey Points Tech stocks have performed well in 2025, and Apple has benefited from this broader rally, thanks to the strong demand for its latest iPhones and the improving services business.\nApple's top-line growth is poised to accelerate in 2026.\nA massive installed base of users on older iPhones can help Apple outgrow the broader smartphone market in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nTechnology stocks have delivered a resilient performance in 2025, which is evident from the 21% jump in the Nasdaq Composite index this year as of this writing. I call the sector's performance resilient because tech stocks have been under stress at certain times this year owing to various factors.\nFrom the potential fallout of the Trump administration's tariffs to concerns about heavy artificial intelligence (AI) spending turning into a bubble, there have been times when investors have panicked and hit the sell button. However, the strong growth that tech companies have been reporting this year has helped them overcome the negatives.\nThe good part is that the strong spending on AI infrastructure is set to drive the stock market higher over the next couple of years. According to JPMorgan, the S&P 500 index's average earnings growth could be between 13% and 15% for \"at least the next two years,\" thanks to the \"AI supercycle.\" As a result, it won't be surprising to see Nasdaq stocks jumping higher in the new year.\nHere's a closer look at an important Nasdaq stock that can ride the broader market's rally and deliver solid gains to investors.\nThis tech giant could do better than the industry it operates in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has rallied impressively in recent months, jumping 58% since hitting a 52-week low in the first week of April. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock's impressive rise can be attributed to the healthy demand for its latest iPhones and the improving traction of the services business.\n\nApple ended its latest fiscal year 2025 (ended on Sept. 27) with $416.1 billion in revenue, up by 6.4% from the prior year. Earnings increased by 23% from the prior year to $7.46 per share. Analysts are expecting its top-line growth to accelerate to almost 9% in the current fiscal year to just over $453.1 billion.\nYou may be surprised to see that analysts are upbeat about Apple's prospects in a year when the high cost of smartphone memory chips is likely to weigh on the industry. Memory manufacturers are scrambling to meet the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips deployed in data centers, which is why they are allocating more capacity to this niche.\n\nStory Continues\nAs a result, the shortage of smartphone memory chips could lead to a 7% increase in smartphone prices next year, according to Counterpoint Research. The research firm estimates that smartphone shipments could decline by 2.1% next year. Apple, however, is expected to grow despite these headwinds. It is easy to see why that's the case.\n\nApple was the second-largest player in the global smartphone market with a share of 18.2% at the end of the third quarter, which means that it has both scale and purchasing power on its side. This gives Apple the ability to negotiate favorable prices with component suppliers. Additionally, the cheapest iPhone that Apple sells is priced at $599, which is higher than the average smartphone average selling price (ASP) of $465.\nSo, Apple can absorb the potential price increases and continue to maintain its healthy share of the smartphone market. Throw in the fact that the company's latest iPhone 17 models are experiencing healthier demand than last year's lineup, thanks to a huge installed base of users on older devices, and it is easy to see why Apple is likely to outperform the broader smartphone market in 2026.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush estimates that more than 315 million iPhones are at least four years old. Apple is expected to ship 234 million iPhone units this year. The number of users in an upgrade window indicates that it could witness a substantial jump in its shipments in 2026. Moreover, Apple is expected to launch a foldable smartphone next year, a move that could give it a nice shot in the arm.\nThe foldable smartphone market is poised to grow by 30% next year, according to IDC. Apple, therefore, will be making a smart move by diving into this space since a foldable phone can contribute toward a bigger jump in its revenue than what analysts are estimating.\nApple's impressive rally is set to continue in 2026 Apple trades at 9.8 times sales right now. That isn't very expensive as compared to the U.S. technology sector's price-to-sales ratio of 8.6. Importantly, Apple can sustain the slight valuation premium next year as well, considering the potential acceleration in growth.\nLet's say Apple's top line grows by 10% next year to $458 billion and it trades at 10 times sales. Its market cap could hit $4.6 trillion. That would be a 14% increase from its current market cap. However, Apple's ability to outperform the market's growth expectations thanks to the catalysts discussed above could help it easily deliver bigger gains, which is why buying this Nasdaq stock hand over fist looks like the smart thing to do right now.\n\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Nike shares jump after Apple CEO Cook doubles stake to $6 million\n\nReuters Videos\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:50 AM PST\n\nIn this video: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nSTORY: EDITORS PLEASE NOTE: A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS REPORT PUT THE WORTH OF TIM COOK'S SHARES IN NIKE AT $6 BILLION, WHEN THEY ARE VALUED AT $6 MILLION. THIS VERSION HAS BEEN AMENDED TO REFLECT THE CORRECT FIGURE. Nike shares climbed about 5.5% in Wednesday morning trading after Apple CEO Tim Cook doubled his personal stake in the sportswear giant. That's according to a regulatory filing. Cook sits on Nike's board and now owns about $6 million worth of stock. The purchase appears to be a vote of confidence in the turnaround efforts of Nike CEO Elliot Hill. It comes days after the company reported weaker quarterly margins and weak sales in China. That's despite Hill's attempt to lift demand with fresh marketing plans and innovation focused on running and sports while phasing out lagging lifestyle brands. The CEO has also tried to mend ties with wholesalers like Dick's Sporting Goods... to try and put the brand in front of shoppers as competition heats up with rivals. However, Hill's plan is putting strain on Nike's margins, now in decline for over a year, and its efforts to get back on top in China are faltering. Nike's shares have slumped nearly 13% since it reported results on December 18 and are on track for the fourth straight year of declines.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Apple's Tim Cook Drove Nike Stock Higher Today\n\nHoward Smith, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:29 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Apple's Tim Cook nearly doubled his stake in Nike.\nThat vote of confidence has investors thinking Nike stock has bottomed.\n10 stocks we like better than Nike ›\nNike (NYSE: NKE) shares surged on this holiday-shortened trading day. It might not be for a reason you would think, though. The global footwear and apparel maker has had a rough year. Even amid great overall market returns, Nike shares have plunged 20% this year.\n\nMost recently, the shares dropped sharply after the company reported fiscal 2026 second-quarter results. But shares are popping today after lead independent director, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, just nearly doubled his stake in Nike with a purchase of 50,000 shares.\nAfter rising as much as 5.6% this morning, Nike shares closed today higher by 4.7%.\nIs Tim Cook calling a bottom? Nike recently reported a mixed quarter, but investors were spooked by a significant 17% drop in its China sales. That sent Nike shares sharply lower after the report, closing near a 52-week low. A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing yesterday showed Nike's lead independent director -- and Apple CEO -- Tim Cook scooped up shares on the dip.\n\nCook purchased 50,000 shares, bringing his total direct holdings to 105,480 shares, valued at approximately $6.3 million.\nThat vote of confidence has also prompted investors to jump into Nike stock today. There are also fundamental reasons to like Nike stock. While China sales slumped last quarter, sales in North America jumped 9%, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), revenue increased 3%.\nIt's not surprising to see some investors following Tim Cook's lead, thinking Nike is in the early stages of a turnaround that could make the stock a market-beater in the coming months.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?

That's according to a regulatory filing. Cook sits on Nike's board and now owns about $6 billion worth of stock. The purchase appears to be a vote of confidence in the turnaround efforts of Nike CEO Elliot Hill. It comes days after the company reported weaker quarterly margins and weak sales in China. That's despite Hill's attempt to lift demand with fresh marketing plans and innovation focused on running and sports while phasing out lagging lifestyle brands. The CEO has also tried to mend ties with wholesalers like Dick's Sporting Goods... to try and put the brand in front of shoppers as competition heats up with rivals. However, Hill's plan is putting strain on Nike's margins, now in decline for over a year, and its efforts to get back on top in China are faltering. Nike's shares have slumped nearly 13% since it reported results on December 18 and are on track for the fourth straight year of declines.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Apple CEO Tim Cook\n\nAaron Rennie\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:39 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NKE\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Takeaways Shares of Nike rose Wednesday, helped by news of a buy from Apple CEO Tim Cook, a member of the company's board.\nCook bought at average prices near $59, well below Wall Street analysts' consensus price target around $80.\nA vote of confidence from the leader of one big brand is helping the shares of another today.\n\nShares of Nike ( NKE ) climbed on Wednesday's holiday-shortened trading session —the shares were recently up about 4.5%, leading all gainers on the S&P 500—following an expression of support from Apple CEO Tim Cook.\nWhy This Matters to Investors As a general rule, investors sell shares when they think they have better uses for the money—and those reasons can be hard to divine. The other side of that coin is that investors only buy shares when they think they're poised to rise. That's why watching the trades of people associated with a particular company is part of many investors' strategies.\n\nA regulatory filing revealed that Cook, a member of Nike's board for two decades, bought nearly $3 million worth of Nike stock on Monday, acquiring 50,000 shares—a rough doubling of his stake—at a weighted average price of $58.97, not far off Friday's close.\nEven with today's surge, Nike shares have lost about 20% of their value this year. The company is about a year into a turnaround launched by CEO Elliot Hill, and while management believes it's made substantial progress investors are still wary .\nWhatever investors may think of the shares, Wall Street analysts are generally positive. The mean price target as tracked by Visible Alpha is around $80, substantially above recent prices closer to $60.\n\"We think consensus estimates are bottoming and see several catalysts that could drive healthier growth,\" Bank of America analysts wrote recently. \"We expect gradual progress on innovation will begin to offset the sell down of older styles.\"\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

According to a Form 4 filing released late Tuesday, Cook bought 50,000 shares on Monday at an average price of $58.97, investing close to $3 million after Nike's results for its second fiscal quarter unsettled investors.

The decision gives a boost to the administration’s campaign to restrict immigration and push demand for US workers. The US Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the proposal, can appeal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nHowell rejected the Chamber’s argument that Trump doesn’t have the power to impose the fee, finding that his proclamation was issued under “an express statutory grant of authority to the President.”\nCongress has given the president broad authority that he used to address “in the manner he sees fit, a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security,” she wrote.\nDaryl Joseffer, the Chamber’s executive vice president, said in a statement the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive.\n“We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations,” Joseffer said.\n\nThe Chamber, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, argued in its October lawsuit that raising the fee is unlawful because it overrides federal immigration law and exceeds the fee-setting authority afforded by Congress.\nA group of 19 state attorneys general also is challenging Trump’s proclamation. Their lawsuit focuses on the projected impact to the public sector, particularly in the fields of health care and education, that also rely on the H-1B visa program. A separate suit was filed by a global nurse-staffing agency.\nThe ruling Tuesday, a so-called summary judgment that doesn’t require a trial, doesn’t have an impact on the other lawsuits, meaning another judge could still block the new visa fee in the months to come. The other cases include a suit filed in Massachusetts earlier this month by more than a dozen mostly Democratic-led states, as well as a suit filed in October in California by a global nurse-staffing agency and several unions.\nBoth of the other cases are also being handled by Obama appointees, and neither judge has yet ruled on any requests for injunctions against the rule. A hearing in the California case is set for Feb. 12 in Oakland. The dispute is likely to ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court.\n\nStory Continues\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of employment-based immigration, allowing companies in the US to hire college-educated foreign workers for specialized occupations. In September, Trump signed a proclamation to increase the application fee to discourage companies from abusing a program that he claimed displaces US workers.\n\nIt’s a stark shift from America’s historical stance toward immigration. Since its founding, the US has welcomed people from diverse countries and economic backgrounds who come to the US in search of a better life and more freedom.\nYet while Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have mused about the prospects of a windfall for the US Treasury that could total $100 billion or more, immigration attorneys have cautioned that an increase in cost of this magnitude would cause major disruptions that would be likely very expensive to the US economy.\n“This puts a chilling effect on America’s employers,” said Michael Wildes, a managing partner at the New York-based immigration law firm Wildes and Weinberg PC. “How can you make America great by taking away the talent pool?” Wildes noted that “it’s a limiting law in that America will skip a beat. There will be a generation of talent out there in the world that will go to other countries. We will be missing an opportunity and that is foolhardy.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said it will replace the lottery for choosing H-1B visa applicants with a weighted selection to overcome wage arbitrage and incentivize American employers “to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers.” There are also proposals being considered to impose a wage floor.\nH-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but are used primarily in the tech industry. Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. are among the companies with the greatest number of H-1B visas, according to the US government.\nThe visa fees will shape hiring efforts, but affect some jobs and companies more than others, said Alexis DuFresne, founder of recruiting firm Archer Search Partners, which specializes in recruitment for alternative financial asset managers.\n\nFor “superstars” in highly-paid, specialized roles, or for jobs that generate a lot of revenue, organizations will be willing to pay the $100,000 fee, she said.\nBut the high cost will change how people making hiring decisions approach looking for employees in more run-of-the-mill jobs, DuFresne said. “If you’re going to search, you’re going to tell the search people ‘Don’t look globally for me. Look domestically for me,’” she said of such common jobs.\nLikewise, organizations with offices around the world will be able to respond to the recruitment costs by shifting where they hire, according to DuFresne. “The firms that it’s going to affect the most are the smaller firms,” she said.\nThe tech industry has been adapting to changes in US immigration rules for a while now as political currents shift.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google is taking steps to help move employees off of H-1B visas and onto more permanent status. The company recently told staff it will be “ramping up” PERM applications next year for eligible employees, Business Insider reported, taking a crucial step to securing a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\nBeyond the US tech companies, the action also hits India hard, as Indians have been the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In addition to the extra costs that Indian IT companies will bear for thousands of employees on such visas, the ongoing unpredictability has unnerved many Indian professionals working in US tech, finance, health care and other industries, especially after the recent mass postponement of work-visa appointments.\n\nThe case is Chamber of Commerce vs. US Department of Homeland Security, 25-cv-03675, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).\n--With assistance from Jake Bleiberg, Erik Larson and Patrick Howell O'Neill.\n(Updates with expert comments in 14th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Tech Stock Warren Buffett Wishes He'd Bought\n\nLyle Daly, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nBRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Warren Buffett never invested in Microsoft, which has been one of the most successful tech stocks.\nHe elected not to buy shares because of his friendship with Bill Gates, who also served on Berkshire's board of directors.\nBuffett wanted to avoid the appearance of impropriety.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nWarren Buffett will step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, and his track record is unimpeachable.\nBut even a legendary investor like Buffett has missed out on some opportunities. Based on comments he has made, a tech stock he would've liked to have bought is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- and there's a surprising reason why he didn't.\nWhy Warren Buffett never invested in Microsoft Microsoft has been one of the largest companies in the world for decades. At Berkshire's 2018 annual meeting, an audience member asked Buffett why he never bought shares, especially considering Berkshire's investments in Apple .\nHe answered that in the earlier years, he simply missed out (in his own words, \"the answer's stupidity\"). Buffett's investment strategy is to only invest in what you understand, and he has been selective with tech businesses.\n\nHowever, Buffett also explained that \"it would just be a mistake for Berkshire to buy Microsoft\" because of his friendship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who also served on Berkshire's board of directors. If Berkshire invested in Microsoft before a better-than-expected earnings report or any other positive news, outside observers might speculate that Gates had shared information with Buffett.\nMicrosoft would've been a great stock for Berkshire's portfolio, as it's up 798% over the last 10 years (as of Dec. 18). The S&P 500 has appreciated 241% over the same time period. Along with outperforming the market, Microsoft has also delivered six consecutive quarters of revenue growth, in part because of its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.\n\nFor Buffett, it was more important to avoid the appearance of impropriety than to invest in Microsoft. Even without Microsoft, Berkshire's portfolio includes numerous strong businesses across various market sectors.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $504,239 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,159,896 !*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 985 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500.

The automation software firm will take the place of Synovus Financial, with the change scheduled to become effective before the opening bell on Friday, January 2.\nAst Spacemobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) rises 2.3% after the company successfully launched its largest-ever satellite from India.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement?

Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

Users can register with an email address or log in directly through Apple accounts, then bind international bank cards including UnionPay, Visa, and Mastercard issued outside China's mainland. The app displays real-time exchange rates for over 160 currencies.\nFor online payments, \"Nihao China\" connects to over 300 platforms spanning train tickets via 12306, food delivery through Meituan and Ele.me (Taobao Shangou), hotel bookings on Ctrip, and shopping on JD.com.\nFor in-store scenarios, the app integrates UnionPay, Alipay, and WeChat Pay acceptance networks, allowing users to scan all QR codes with one app in over 1,000 service scenarios.\nThe app also facilitates tax refunds in major cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with plans to gradually expand the service to cover all tax refund scenarios for international visitors across China, delivering a more efficient and convenient refund experience.\n\nSeamless Mobility Across China\nThe app covers metro systems in 43 major Chinese cities and public bus networks across over 1,760 county-level regions, creating a rail-plus-bus payment network. No need to purchase separate transit cards—simply tap and go.\nThe English map helps to locate nearby ATMs, currency exchange points, and other essential services based on your location.\nSmart Tools, Zero Language Barriers\nReal-time translation supports Chinese-English conversation, with smart recognition added for Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Russian. In-app page translation ensures smooth navigation in your native language.\nThe app's smart assistant goes beyond translation, answering questions about attractions, transportation, and dining while providing customized route planning that combines public transit, walking, and other travel modes.\n\nUpcoming Enhancements and Service Expansion\nThe app will continue to evolve with upcoming features including integrated visa services such as application guidance, appointment booking, and status tracking; virtual SIM card activation for instant mobile data upon arrival; and one-tap reservations for popular museums and scenic spots including the National Museum of China.\n\nStory Continues\nBuilding a More Inclusive Payment Ecosystem for International Travelers\nBeyond the \"Nihao China\" app, to date, over 200 million UnionPay cards and over 200 UnionPay-partner wallets issued outside China's mainland could pay seamlessly across 183 countries and regions worldwide, especially in China.\n\nIn addition, UnionPay has introduced over 10 million SplendorPlus Cards with 59 issuers in 20 international markets, offering benefits across five categories of selected merchants, including airport VIP lounges, transportation, tourist attractions, culture, arts and cuisine for those who travel, study, or work in China.\nUnionPay remains committed to improving its acceptance network, products, and services to create a more user-friendly and secure payment experience for international visitors.\n\nView original content: https://www.prnewswire.com/apac/news-releases/nihao-china-app-launches-as-an-all-in-one-solution-for-international-visitors-302649202.html\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Here's what could be in store in 2026\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:40 PM PST\n\nIn this video: AAPL\n\n2025 was a big year for Apple ( AAPL ). Investors experienced some angst early in the year when concerns arose that the tech giant might be missing out on the AI revolution. However, new product launches and some AI features were enough to send the stock to new highs toward the end of the year.\nYahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley takes a look at Apple's wild ride and what may lie ahead in 2026 .\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Josh\n2025 turned out to be quite the milestone year for Apple, and despite some turbulence, the tech giant has set itself up for its biggest change in years. Yahoo Finances's Dan Howley joins us now with more. Dan.\n00:10 Dan Howley\nThat's right, Josh. This is a huge year for Apple. Not only did they post record revenue, uh they sold their newest iPhone, seeing huge numbers as far as sales go uh so far. And oh yeah, they hit a $4 trillion dollar market cap. The only other company to do that, Nvidia. Uh and they're, you know, kind of playing a little closer to Nvidia now than when Nvidia was at $5 trillion. Um, but what's a trillion between friends, really. Uh, some of the things that the company did though really didn't have to do with one of the biggest issues that they have, AI. Uh that seems to be pushed off until next year. They did have their head of AI retire. They're bringing in more folks. Uh they did see a number of other C suite retirements, whether that was uh their legal counsel or their head of government affairs. And it seems as though for the most part, what this is doing as far as the year goes is teeing up for a post Tim Cook Apple. Now, there was that Financial Times report uh a month ago, basically saying that Cook was ready to retire sometime in early 2026. Then Bloomberg's Mark German said that's not exactly the case. Uh regardless, he is approaching retirement age. Uh and so the company is clearly thinking about what that would look like. And so they've reportedly been grooming John Ternus, one of their uh VPs of hardware engineering to be the the next CEO. He's the top contender, doesn't necessarily mean he will absolutely be the next CEO, but he's being kind of groomed for that position and really Apple kind of giving us a a sense of, you know, this is going to be a uh transition, uh transitional era and this is how we're going to handle it. kind of piecemeal. as people kind of take off, we'll fill in those slots. Uh but it won't be kind of uh all at once approach. And you know, for for a company like Apple that's remarkably stable despite being so large, it can feel a little odd seeing so many departures uh at once or or throughout the year, but the experts that I spoke to say, this is really the best course of action for this company.\n02:18 Josh\nLet me ask you, Dan, you know, Apple's engine is still the iPhone. You know, in 2026, what do you think innovation is going to look like there? You know, what can we expect? You know, is it, is it form factor changes? Is it foldables or revamped Siri? Like what do you think next year Tim Cook has to introduce to keep that engine humming?\n02:44 Dan Howley\nYeah, I mean, the the big rumor is that there will be a foldable iPhone for 2026. and kind of the iPhone Air was seen as kind of teeing that up. Uh you know, showing off that they could put their uh the goods inside of a smaller package. Uh you know, there's been different reports saying that the Air hasn't sold as well as, you know, the Pro or the Pro Max or the base 17, which is a remarkably good phone for the price. Uh but it appears as though that that is what the Air was, kind of a an appetizer almost and the the foldable will be the main course. Now, there's been obviously Samsung with their own foldable phones over time. They have their Fold 7, which is an incredible phone for what you get. It is priced relatively high. Uh and you can imagine that a foldable iPhone would probably have the same kind of price premium. So, you know, for the iPhone itself, that's kind of what we're looking for in 2026.\n03:42 Josh\nDan, great to have you as always.

      "Content": "Apple spent 2025 setting itself up for the future — and its biggest moves weren't about AI\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nSSNLF\n\nIt’s been quite a year for Apple ( AAPL ). The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ).\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta ( META ) Reality Labs' new design studio .\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times , Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\nCook is steering a $4 trillion behemoth Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nStory Continues\nCook's decisions drove Apple's stock price ever higher. As a result, the company's market cap has increased from $1 trillion in 2018 to a whopping $4 trillion in 2025.\nRevenue has also continued its steady upward pace, with Apple reporting $416 billion in total sales for its fiscal 2025, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nApple is also reportedly preparing some of the biggest changes in years to its iPhone lineup in 2026. According to Gurman , the company will roll out a foldable iPhone, a first for Apple, in the latter half of the year.\n\nThat could help further goose already record iPhone sales. Apple is also reportedly preparing a new low-cost MacBook model, which would open up the company to a broader customer segment.\nAnd while it may not have the same margins as a high-powered MacBook Pro, a lower-cost MacBook could still help draw more customers to Apple's services, driving increased revenue over the long run.\n\nNew challenges ahead If Ternus is chosen to succeed Cook, he'll inherit an Apple at the peak of its power. While smartphone sales have slowed over time, the company is reaping the benefits of its massive install base, which still upgrades devices every few years and increasingly subscribes to Apple's various services.\n\nBut he'll also have to navigate his share of headaches. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting some kind of movement on Apple's AI strategy. And though the company is making progress on its AI rollout, it still needs to showcase its next-generation version of Siri.\nHe'll also have to prepare to take on the likes of Meta, Google, and Samsung ( 005930.KS ) in the smart glasses space. Meta already has two smart glasses on the market, and Google and Samsung are each working on their own intelligent eyewear.\nFor now, though, Cook is still Apple's CEO. We'll just have to see if that changes in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Will Google Pass Nvidia in 2026 as the World’s Biggest Company?\n\nOmor Ibne Ehsan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 10:25 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nQuick Read Google (GOOG) now leads AI software after overtaking Microsoft. Google is less than $200B away from surpassing Apple as the world’s second-largest company.\nGoogle holds four of the top 10 AI models on LLMArena. OpenAI’s best model ranks eighth.\nMeta is negotiating billions in purchases of Google’s TPUs. Anthropic already bought 1 million TPUs from Google instead of buying from Nvidia (NVDA).\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) as the world's second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street.\nThere are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI \"replacing\" the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals.\n\nLet's take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026.\nGoogle is firing on all cylinders Google was supposed to \"die\" after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can.\nThen, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI \"Bard\" rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in \"code red\" mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards.\n\nIf you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI's sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each.\nIf you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI's GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn't spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) have gone into net debt.\nWhy Google's search business will never be replaced If Google's rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated.\nAs for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with.\n\nIn contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it.\nNvidia's AI GPUs at risk? Software isn't Alphabet's only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia's near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient.\nMeta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth \"billions of dollars,\" with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia's coffers instead.\n\nThe threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google's AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating.\nCould Google become the biggest company in 2026? I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world's largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030.\n\nNvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\n\nSubhasree Kar\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 8:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nApple (AAPL) has just dropped a game-changing artificial intelligence (AI) model that’s got Wall Street buzzing. The tech titan is racing to gain ground in the AI revolution, unveiling a breakthrough called SHARP that can instantly turn ordinary 2D photos into lifelike 3D images. The stock’s allure is shifting from phones and wearables to intelligent software and machine learning innovation.\n\nSHARP uses a neural network to generate a 3D Gaussian representation in under a second on a standard GPU, enabling real-time, high-resolution rendering at over 100 frames per second. The model supports accurate, metric camera movements and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across datasets, highlighting Apple’s advancing capabilities in AI-driven 3D visualization.\nMore News from Barchart Will Tesla Stock Lose Its ‘Elon Musk Premium’ After the SpaceX IPO?

Sign up now!\n\nWhile this breakthrough can meaningfully strengthen Apple’s long-term growth story, is the stock a buy at current levels?\nAbout Apple Stock California-based Apple continues to stand as a forward-looking company and a worldwide leader in hardware, software, and services. Its portfolio spans iconic devices like the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, alongside widely used platforms such as the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+. The company currently boasts a market cap of $4.1 trillion and Magnificent Seven (MAGS) status.\n\nApple’s stock has delivered a notable performance over the past year, but it remains somewhat muted compared to the highest-growth tech peers. The stock has gained 6.48% over the past 52 weeks and 8.2% year-to-date (YTD).\nAdditionally, it reached a fresh 52-week high of $288.62 on Dec. 3, propelled by optimism around solid iPhone sales momentum, aggressive advancements in AI integration, and robust financial forecasts for the holiday season.\nThe stock is trading at a premium at 33.73 times forward earnings, compared to the sector median and its historical average.\nSteady Q4 Results Apple released its fiscal Q4 2025 results on Oct. 30, for the quarter ended Sept. 27. The company reported total revenue of $102.5 billion, representing an 8% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Its earnings per share (EPS) came to $1.85, up 13% on an adjusted basis from the prior year and ahead of expectations. AAPL reported total revenue of $416.2 billion for the full year, representing 6.4% growth YOY.\n\nStory Continues\nIn terms of business segments, the iPhone division generated approximately $49 billion in revenue for the quarter, marking a 6.1% increase and accounting for nearly half of the company’s quarterly sales. Mac revenue rose about 12.7% to $8.7 billion, while iPad revenue was essentially flat at about $7 billion. The Wearables, Home & Accessories segment also saw flat performance, around $9 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the Services segment achieved an all-time high of $28.8 billion, growing about 15.1% YOY.\nApple now projects revenue growth of 10% to 12% in the holiday quarter (December quarter), driven by an anticipated double-digit increase in iPhone revenue. It expects December revenue to be “best ever” for iPhone. Gross margin for the period is expected to range between 47% to 48%, while Apple also noted ongoing investments in AI and product development, highlighting that while hardware continues to anchor the business, services and ecosystem strength remain a central focus.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Apple Stock? Analysts covering Apple predict its EPS to rise by 10.4% YOY to $2.65 in the first quarter. Further, the consensus estimate of $8.11 for fiscal 2026 indicates an increase of 8.7% YOY, before improving by around 12.5% annually to $9.12 in fiscal 2027.\nRecently, Jefferies raised its price target on Apple to $283.36 from $246.99 while maintaining a “Hold” rating, citing the company’s ability to withstand rising memory costs due to its high pricing power. The firm expects some volume and margin pressure in 2026 but believes a higher iPhone 18 average selling price (ASP) will help offset the impact.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Apple to $315 from $305 and maintained an “Overweight” rating. The firm also pointed to improved iPhone shipment assumptions and continued AI investment, maintaining a favorable risk-reward outlook.\nApple stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Out of 40 analysts covering the tech giant, 21 recommend a “Strong Buy,” three give a “Moderate Buy,” 14 analysts stay cautious with a “Hold” rating, one “Moderate Sell,” and one has a “Strong Sell” rating.\nWhile the average analyst price target of $290.85 suggests an upside of 7.34%, its Street-high target price of $350 suggests as much as 29.17% upside ahead.\nOn the date of publication, Subhasree Kar did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

( AAPL , Financials ) is seeing shorter lead times for its iPhone 17 lineup as supply catches up with demand, according to new channel checks from J.P. Morgan. Analyst Samik Chatterjee said average global wait times declined roughly three days in the firm's 15th week of tracking, bringing delivery estimates to about three days similar to levels seen during last year's iPhone 16 cycle.\n\nIs AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe report indicates that Apple has largely achieved parity between demand and supply toward year-end, a pattern typical of previous product cycles. In the U.S., delivery times for all iPhone 17 models now average two days, while China and Europe show similar improvements, with most configurations available for immediate in-store pickup.\nChatterjee, who maintains an Overweight rating on Apple, said the easing lead times point to stable production and continued strong consumer demand through fiscal second-quarter 2026. That trend could help sustain higher iPhone unit sales and revenue for the remainder of the model's cycle.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Google started the year behind in the AI race. It ended 2025 on top.\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:03 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nCRM\n\nGoogle ( GOOG , GOOGL ) entered 2025 in a difficult position. While its stock price rose 36% in 2024, the company was still largely perceived by Wall Street as playing second (or third) fiddle to OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) in the AI race.\nFast-forward to today, and Google is stealing the show, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has declared a \"code red\" emergency as the company works to match Google's latest Gemini 3 AI models. It's an interesting twist, given that Google declared its own code red after ChatGPT hit the market in 2022.\n\nGoogle is also catching up to OpenAI in the key monthly active user (MAU) metric.\nThen there are Google chip wins. In October, Claude developer Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) announced it was expanding its plan to use Google's AI chips, including using up to 1 million processors , to power its AI software.\nGoogle is also in talks to provide its chips to Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta ( META ) to run its AI products, according to The Information .\nIt all added up to a strong 2025 for the search giant, setting it up for continued success in the year ahead.\n\"Google will be the best performing Mag 7 stock in CY26,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster wrote in a Dec. 11 investor note.\n\"Google is in the strongest position when it comes to a fully integrated AI stack,\" he wrote. \"Gemini is a leading model, its user base is expanding faster than OpenAI's, Search is integrating AI effectively with ads reportedly on the way, and [Google Cloud Platform] continues to hold its ground in the infrastructure buildout cycle.\"\n\nGoogle's AI wins pile up Google counts its AI revenue as part of its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) business. According to the company, that has given GCP a significant boost. In Q3, Google said its GCP revenue grew 34% year over year to $15.1 billion . It rose 32% in the prior quarter.\nThe number of new customers to the GCP jumped 34%.\n\n\"Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins, and backlog,” CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call.\nAccording to Pichai, Google signed more deals worth more than $1 billion in its third quarter than it did in the previous two years combined. More than 70% of the company's existing cloud customers are using its AI services, he added.\nThe company has also more deeply intertwined its AI capabilities with Google Search, launching its ChatGPT-like AI Mode for all US users in May at the Google I/O conference and dropping ads into AI Overviews in search.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle has also managed to win over social media users with its Nano Banana AI image app, which went viral in August. Then came the biggest bomb: Gemini 3.\nAnnounced in November , Gemini 3 immediately won praise from users, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who said he was ditching ChatGPT after using the app for Gemini 3.\n\nGemini 3 sent shockwaves through the AI industry, unseating GPT-5.1 as the leading AI model across several categories.\nGoogle's user base is also growing. According to TD Cowen's John Blackledge, a survey of roughly 2,500 US consumers found that Gemini's MAU penetration ramped faster than ChatGPT's from July to October.\nGemini MAU penetration was 24% in July and climbed to 26% in October. Google's AI Mode also improved from 18% to 19%. ChatGPT, however, saw its MAU penetration decline from 36% to 35% in the same time period.\n\nMarket intelligence firm Sensor Tower says that both apps continue to see significant growth, with global MAU up 180% and 125% for ChatGPT and Gemini, respectively. But like TD Cowen, Sensor Tower found that ChatGPT's MAU grew roughly 15% between August and December. Gemini was up 30%, thanks in part to its Nano Banana image editing app.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that Gemini is also available on all newer Android devices, making it far easier to access than ChatGPT, which requires users to navigate to a website or download the ChatGPT app.\nGoogle's other beats AI wasn't the only bright spot for Google in 2025. While the company lost its second antitrust case in April, with a judge finding it holds an illegal monopoly through its online advertising business, its legal issues weren't all bad.\nIn September, a judge declined to force Google to give up its Chrome browser after he found the company holds an illegal monopoly over the search market.\nThe judge also allowed Google to continue to make payments to \"distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google Search, Chrome, or GenAI products.\"\nThat means the company can continue to pay Apple upwards of $20 billion a year to make Google Search the default search option on its iPhone and other devices.\n\nOutside of its legal dramas, Google has also made major strides with self-driving car company Waymo. The firm expanded its availability to other cities — including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando — and began offering freeway driving around San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.\nGoogle also showed off its prototype smart glasses and a new Samsung VR headset, both of which use software based on a version of Android called Android XR, which was developed by Google and Samsung.\nLook for that and more in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Buffett’s $24 Billion Selling Spree: The 6 Stocks Berkshire Hathaway Dumped\n\nOmor Ibne Ehsan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 6:02 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nBRK-B\n\nBRK.A\n\n^GSPC\n\nDVA\n\nQuick Read Buffett sold over $24B in stocks during the first nine months of the year including $10.6B in Apple.\nHe reduced his Bank of America stake by $1.92B in Q3 but still holds $29.3B worth of shares.\nBuffett sold $1.2B of VeriSign to keep his ownership below 10% and avoid regulatory obligations.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nInvestors began to notice that Warren Buffett began being more conservative with the stock market three years ago, and that streak has continued even as the S&P 500 hit new peaks and beyond. He sold Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Bank of America ( NYSE:BAC ) , VeriSign ( NASDAQ:VRSN ) , DaVita ( NYSE:DVA ) , D.R. Horton ( NYSE:DHI ) , and Nucor ( NYSE:NUE ) as of Q3 2025. In the first 9 months of this year alone, he sold over $24 billion worth of stocks.\nBuffett did not offer an in-depth explanation for selling these stocks and largely missed out on the broader AI rally. He said that he does not see many opportunities in the market right now.\nIn other words, he believes the market is overvalued and is okay waiting until it cools off. He can then pounce and buy more on the cheap. Buffett is also due to retire as CEO at the end of this month. Greg Abel will assume his role, and some believe Buffett is building up a cash pile for Abel.\n\nAnyhow, let's take a look at the 6 stocks he dumped in Q3 2025, along with Buffett's likely motives for doing so.\nApple (AAPL) Berkshire Hathaway has been aggressively trimming its AAPL position since Q4 2023. With the exception of Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, Berkshire has sold AAPL shares every single quarter since then.\nBuffett only had positive things to say about Apple and its CEO, so the issue is unlikely to be Apple itself. It is more likely that he sees the broader market as overvalued and is taking profits.\n\nBuffett is sticking to his principle of reducing equity exposure whenever he feels the stock market is overheated. Apple happens to be his largest holding, so it only makes sense that he takes profits here.\nIn Q3, he sold $10.6 billion worth of AAPL stock.\nBank of America (BAC) Bank of America is another company Warren Buffett has had a long history with. He saved the bank in 2011 with a $5 billion investment as the ripple effects of 2008 weakened it. Back then, he made comments about how he liked the profit-generating abilities of the franchise and wanted to hold that investment for the long term.\nHe has stayed true to that commitment, but his BAC holdings have swelled to the point where it makes sense to start taking profits.\n\nStory Continues\nHe has been selling every single quarter since Q3 2024.\nHe sold $1.92 billion worth of BAC stock in Q3 2025, though his holdings are still worth $29.3 billion.\nVeriSign (VRSN) VeriSign is an internet infrastructure business. It has been one of Buffett's most profitable investments. He started loading up aggressively in late 2012 through mid-2014. Back then, VRSN traded ~$40 per share.\nHe made another timely buy in Q4 2024, where the average closing price was ~$200.\nThe stock ballooned to $266.93, and he almost timed the top by selling $1.2 billion worth of it. This was to keep his ownership below 10%. If his ownership crossed that threshold, it would involve Berkshire with regulatory obligations.\n\nDaVita (DVA) Buffett has a long history with this kidney disease treatment company, but he hasn't added to it since Q4 2014. Shares have been slowly climbing in the past decade, but have lagged the broader market.\nRecent performance has been quite good, and Buffett has been taking profits since the start of this year.\n\nHe sold $217 million worth of DVA stock in Q3 2025.\nD.R. Horton (DHI) D.R. Horton is America's largest homebuilder. DHR stock makes sense as interest rates are coming down, with many believing homebuilding is set to pick up speed significantly.\nBuffett, however, ran for the exits. He bought in Q3 2023, and homebuilding stocks went on to do quite well until late 2024. They've been quite slow since, and even rate cuts haven't spurred a considerable rally.\n\nHe sold $199 million worth of DHI stock in Q3 2025. Again, the sale was timely, with the stock sliding down since. Buffett no longer has any DHI shares in his portfolio.\nNucor (NUE) Nucor is a steel producer and recycler. NUE stock has been one of the most interesting names in the past, with sudden, sharp rallies as American steel companies were put under the spotlight multiple times in the past few years.\nBooming steel prices drove NUE stock to record highs in 2021. Buffett was uninvolved back then, but bought in Q1 2025 and Q2 2025 as the rally cooled. The stock then reversed course, and Buffett is now starting to take profits.\n\nHe sold 3.1% of his stake in NUE, worth ~$29 million.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Why Oura CEO doesn't think OpenAI's device will kill the iPhone\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:18 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nSSNLF\n\nGRMN\n\nListen and subscribe to Opening Bid Unfiltered on Apple Podcasts , Amazon Music , Spotify , YouTube , or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\nIf OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) is poised to unveil a device that's an Apple ( AAPL ) iPhone killer in 2026 to support its AI ambitions, Oura CEO Tom Hale thinks it could have a long way to go to drive mass appeal.\n\n\"We've all had [Amazon] Alexa devices in our lives, and they're fascinating, ... but it's also kind of latent in the sort of bandwidth for information,\" Hale said in a new episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (see video above or listen below). \"I'm fascinated by conversations that you have with OpenAI or any of the models like Gemini. ... At the same time, it's not the perfect user interface for every kind of computing activity you might consult.\"\n\nHale added that he doesn't think the iPhone will go away, just as the iPhone didn't fully replace laptops or desktops.\n\"It's just another form factor for computing,\" he said. \"I think that's where the device goes, and I think that we'll have a cloud of wearables that'll be tuned to whatever your use case is.\"\n\nA possible hardware product from OpenAI — the winner of this year's Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award — has generated buzz and interest, with good reason.\nThis past spring, the company snapped up Io, a startup run by Apple design alum Jony Ive, in a $6.5 billion all-equity deal. Ive worked on design for the iPhone with Steve Jobs while at Apple.\nOpenAI's possible handheld device is \"expected to be pocket-sized, screenless and contextually aware,\" according to Builtin.com . It was described as \"gathering information from its surroundings and experiences through built-in cameras and microphones.\"\nSome speculate that the device, which likely won't be a phone or a wearable like a watch, could resemble an iPod Shuffle worn around the user's neck. It will run OpenAI's updated models and is expected to communicate with a user's existing devices and ecosystems, eliminating the need to replicate technology, according to BuiltIn.\n\nThe outlook for OpenAI's hardware push was thought to have hit a snag this month.\nCEO Sam Altman issued a company-wide \"code red\" memo, which explained that OpenAI would delay projects in its pipeline to focus on its primary product, ChatGPT.\nBut OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told Yahoo Finance that a hardware device by Ive is still in the cards.\n\"It's coming,\" Friar said. \"The hardware is still very much coming.\"\n\nStory Continues\nWatch more from the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast\n\nWhy driverless tractor trailers are coming sooner than you think\n\nHilton CEO on AI: 'Everybody has a plan until you get punched in the face'\n\n'We needed to go to work': Hilton CEO details how a winning offering evolved\n\nTo be sure, the battle to analyze your health data has arguably never been fiercer.\nThe Apple Watch has sold tens of millions of units, all of which are collecting health data. Whoop ( WHOO.PVT ) is eyeing an IPO. Not to mention, there are an array of other major players in the wearables space, such as Samsung ( 005930.KS ) and Garmin ( GRMN ).\n\nOura is the maker of the popular health tracking ring.\nThe company recently raised $900 million from a series of investors. The proceeds are being earmarked for international expansion and perhaps a foray into payments, with a ring that is still tethered to your smartphone of choice.\n\"There's a lot of pretty interesting use cases around identity and payments for us to explore,\" Hale said. \"We don't have any features on this in the market as of yet, but I think it's a pretty interesting place for us to get to.\"\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "Nvidia vs Alphabet: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Nvidia and Alphabet are set to be the top-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks in 2025.\nNvidia is expected to continue seeing strong growth in 2026 as AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up.\nThe network effect of Apple's vertical AI model should really start to shine through next year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe two top-performing \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks in 2025 were Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . As of this writing, Nvidia's stock is up around 30%, while Alphabet has turned in a 60% gain.\nLet's see which stock is poised to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Nvidia Where artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending heads, Nvidia's stock is likely to follow. The company is the dominant player in the space with its graphics processing units (GPUs), and while competition has increased, no one is close to unseating the king. It still has a wide moat with its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code has been written, while its recent acquisition of SchedMD will only help widen its software moat.\nMeanwhile, its NVLink interconnect system helps prevent vendor mixing and matching because it's a proprietary system that lets its GPUs quickly pass along data and pool memory, allowing an AI cluster to act as a single powerful unit.\nMeanwhile, the setup for the company looks attractive heading into 2026. All the major cloud computing companies have discussed ramping up data center capex spending next year, which bodes well for it. At the same time, the U.S. just gave it the green light to start selling its H200 chip to commercial Chinese customers, reopening a big market for it. In addition, large customer OpenAI is close to closing $100 billion in new funding, which should help it with its aggressive AI data center buildout.\n\nOn top of that, Nvidia's stock is attractively valued, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 23 times 2026 analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 0.7 times. Positive PEGs below 1 are generally viewed as undervalued.\nThe case for Alphabet Alphabet's biggest advantage is that it is the one major hyperscaler (owner of large data centers) that isn't largely reliant on Nvidia. The company developed its own custom AI chips over a decade ago, and today most of its internal workloads are run on its tensor processing units (TPUs). That has given the company both a cost advantage with its cloud computing business, as well as with training its Gemini large language model (LLM) and running AI inference.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Cloud has been a huge growth driver for Alphabet, and that should only continue in 2026 as the unit has been capacity-constrained. Alphabet has been spending aggressively, which should result in Google Cloud's growth accelerating. Alphabet also made an under-the-radar move the past couple of years with its chips that could lead to big growth.\n\nTPUs were originally designed for Google Cloud's TensorFlow framework, but Alphabet shifted its chips to be more framework agnostic, including supporting the popular PyTorch framework. This move allows it to rent out its TPUs to other companies. Anthropic is one of the first companies to jump on this opportunity, agreeing to deploy $21 billion in TPUs. Morgan Stanley has estimated that for every 500,000 TPUs deployed, Alphabet will generate around $13 billion in annual revenue. It's currently projecting the company will rent out 5 million TPUs in 2027 and 7 million in 2028.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has trained its top-tier Gemini model on its TPUs, while it also runs inference with them. This gives it a significant cost advantage over competitors like OpenAI, allowing it to continue investing more money in its model and further improve it.\n\nIt also has the advantage of being able to integrate Gemini throughout its products, making them better. It essentially has what can be referred to as a \"surface advantage,\" bringing AI to the places where people already are, rather than relying on stand-alone apps and third-party integrations. These advantages should just continue to grow and drive revenue in 2026 and beyond.\nThe verdict I think Nvidia and Alphabet should both have strong years in 2026. Both stocks are attractively valued with forward P/Es of 23 times and 27 times, respectively, and both should produce strong revenue growth.\nHowever, of the two, I think Alphabet's stock will once again outperform in 2026. It has a more durable business (it's less cyclical and doesn't rely on heavy customer capex spending), and I think the network effects of its model will really start to shine through next year, powering the stock higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

United States Steel became the first $1 billion enterprise on the planet in 1901, and 117 years later, in 2018, iPhone maker Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion milestone.\nEight other U.S. companies have since joined Apple in the trillion-dollar club, including Nvidia , Alphabet , Amazon , and Tesla . It looked as though Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) was set to join them back in September as its market capitalization peaked at $940 billion, but following a 41% decline in its stock price since then, the company is now valued at just $550 billion.\nRecent stock price performance aside, artificial intelligence (AI) developers are lining up to rent access to Oracle's data center infrastructure, which is fueling a surge in the company's revenues. Could it be only a matter of time before this tech titan charts a path back toward $1 trillion?\nA leader in AI infrastructure Most AI development happens inside large, centralized data centers fitted with tens of thousands of advanced parallel processors -- many of them graphics processing units ( GPUs ) supplied by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . It can cost billions of dollars to build a single data center, and since most businesses don't have that kind of money to dedicate to such endeavors, they rent computing capacity from specialized operators like Oracle instead.\n\nOracle's data center infrastructure is among the best in the industry. It uses proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology that moves data between chips and devices more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since most AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, even minor increases in processing speed can result in major cost savings over time.\nOracle's data centers also offer significant scale, enabling developers to tap into clusters of over 131,000 GPUs, which is enough to handle even the most advanced AI workloads.\nMoreover, it's bringing capacity online at a rapid pace. As of the conclusion of its fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ended Nov. 30), Oracle had 147 data center regions up and running with 64 more in the pipeline. OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are just a few of the tech juggernauts using Oracle's infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nOracle's cloud infrastructure revenue is soaring Oracle generated $16.1 billion in total revenue during its fiscal 2026 second quarter, which was a modest 14% increase from the prior-year period. But revenue from its cloud infrastructure segment, specifically, soared by 66% to a record $4.1 billion.\nThe cloud infrastructure unit could be growing its sales even faster, but Oracle simply can't build data centers fast enough to meet demand. That's why the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) rocketed by a whopping 438% year over year to $523 billion during the quarter. RPO is like an order backlog, because it reflects the value of signed contracts with customers for services that haven't been delivered yet.\n\nAround $300 billion of Oracle's RPO is reportedly from one customer, OpenAI, which creates concentration risk. OpenAI is still a fairly young company, and it doesn't have anywhere close to $300 billion in cash on hand. Unless it becomes a raging financial success, this enormous commitment might never convert into revenue for Oracle.\nSkepticism about this deal is part of the reason Oracle stock has plummeted in the past few months. The company has around $108 billion in debt, and it's taking on even more to fund the construction of more data centers. The possibility that one of its top customers might never have the money to rent all of the capacity it has requested is spooking investors.\nWill Oracle join the $1 trillion club? Oracle generated earnings of $5.32 per share over the last four quarters on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, which gives its stock a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.1. That is a premium to the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so even though Oracle stock has tumbled, it still isn't cheap.\nFrom its market cap of about $550 billion today, Oracle's stock would have to soar by 82% for the company to join the $1 trillion club. If we assume Oracle's P/E ratio remains exactly where it is right now, the company would have to nearly double its earnings per share to justify that type of share price gain. If its P/E ratio declines further, it will have an even steeper mountain to climb.\n\nOracle's AI business is growing at a lightning-fast pace right now, so there's a good chance the company will join the $1 trillion club at some point, but it probably won't be the next member inducted. Several other U.S. companies are much closer to the mark: Walmart has a market cap of $911 billion, and JPMorgan Chase is also in range at $872 billion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?

      "Content": "BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 IBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\n\nAmin Ayan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nIBIT\n\nBLK\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nBlackRock has placed its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund among its three biggest investment themes for 2025, ranking the product alongside Treasury bills and US mega-cap technology stocks.\nKey Takeaways:\nBlackRock named its spot Bitcoin ETF a top 2025 investment theme alongside Treasurys and big tech.\nIBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\nThe fund now leads rivals by a wide margin, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios.\n\nThe world’s largest asset manager said its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) together with an ETF tracking short-term Treasurys and another linked to the so-called “Magnificent 7” group of US tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla.\nBlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Pulls $25B in Inflows Despite Bitcoin’s 2025 Pullback IBIT has drawn more than $25 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to market data, ranking sixth among all ETFs by inflows despite posting a negative return in 2025.\nThe performance comes as Bitcoin has slid roughly 30% from its October peak, a drawdown that has not deterred investor demand.\n\nNate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said BlackRock’s decision to spotlight IBIT shows the firm remains comfortable backing Bitcoin through market cycles.\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed that view, noting that if the fund can attract $25 billion in a weaker year, the upside during a stronger market could be significantly larger.\nThe latest inflows add to the roughly $37 billion IBIT attracted in 2024, bringing total net inflows since launch to about $62.5 billion, according to Farside Investors.\nThat figure puts IBIT well ahead of competitors, with flows more than five times larger than those of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, its closest rival.\nBlackRock has continued to build out its crypto-linked ETF lineup beyond spot Bitcoin exposure. In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The flip side though is that these lofty expectations make them particularly susceptible to drawdowns when market sentiment shifts.\nDetermining whether a company’s quality justifies its price causes headaches for nearly all investors, which is why we started StockStory - to help you separate the real opportunities from the speculative ones. That said, here are two high-flying stocks to hold for the long term and one with big downside risk.\n\nOne High-Flying Stock to Sell: LifeStance Health Group (LFST) Forward P/E Ratio: 30.5x\nWith over 6,600 licensed mental health professionals treating more than 880,000 patients annually, LifeStance Health (NASDAQ:LFST) provides outpatient mental health services through a network of clinicians offering psychiatric evaluations, psychological testing, and therapy across 33 states.\n\nWhy Does LFST Worry Us?\nSmaller revenue base of $1.37 billion means it hasn’t achieved the economies of scale that some industry juggernauts enjoy\nLacking free cash flow generation means it has few chances to reinvest for growth, repurchase shares, or distribute capital\nPush for growth has led to negative returns on capital, signaling value destruction\nAt $7.06 per share, LifeStance Health Group trades at 30.5x forward P/E. If you’re considering LFST for your portfolio, see our FREE research report to learn more .\nTwo High-Flying Stocks to Watch: Apple (AAPL) Forward P/E Ratio: 33.4x\nCreator of the iPhone and App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.\nWhy Is AAPL Interesting?\nApple's revenue base is so large because nearly everyone in the U.S. has an iPhone, but this is a double-edged sword. Growth must now come from upgrades, a harder pitch that has resulted in sluggish top-line performance recently.\nStill, Apple's devices have endured for decades, speaking to its brand, design ethos, and technological chops. Its success is rare in the world of consumer electronics, which is fraught because of commoditization, competition, and obsolescence risk.\nThe company may not have the best gross margin because of its hardware orientation, but it still manages to produce elite operating and free cash flow margins. This shows it doesn’t need over-the-top marketing campaigns to convince people to buy its products.\nApple’s stock price of $270.80 implies a valuation ratio of 33.4x forward price-to-earnings. Is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our in-depth research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\n\nStory continues\nJFrog (FROG) Forward P/S Ratio: 13.3x\nNamed after the amphibian that continuously evolves from egg to tadpole to adult, JFrog (NASDAQ:FROG) provides a platform that helps organizations securely create, store, manage, and distribute software packages across any system.\nWhy Will FROG Beat the Market?\nBillings have averaged 22.9% growth over the last year, showing it’s securing new contracts that could potentially increase in value over time\nWell-designed software integrates seamlessly with other workflows, enabling swift payback periods on marketing expenses and customer growth at scale\nImpressive free cash flow profitability enables the company to fund new investments or reward investors with share buybacks/dividends\n\nJFrog is trading at $68.14 per share, or 13.3x forward price-to-sales. Is now the right time to buy? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nHigh-Quality Stocks for All Market Conditions The market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 5 Strong Momentum Stocks for this week . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\nStocks that made our list in 2020 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-micro-cap company Tecnoglass (+1,754% five-year return).

Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Alphabet\n\nRobert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Alphabet were criticized for their AI results to date, but they are turning that around.\nApple delivered record revenue in its 2025 fiscal year and brought on new AI leadership.\nAlphabet's application of AI is driving growth across its businesses, such as increased usage of its search engine.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nTech titans Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) were rivals during the rise of the smartphone era. However, the arrival of a new technological marvel, artificial intelligence (AI) , has led to the pair teaming up.\nNews reports indicate Apple is going to license Alphabet's Gemini AI model to power its Siri voice assistant at a cost of $1 billion annually. This would be a win for Alphabet, whose stock has been a boon for shareholders as the share price soared nearly 60% in 2025 through Dec. 18. In that time, Apple stock was up about 9%.\nThat said, Apple shares hit an all-time high of $288.62 on Dec. 3, despite previous media perceptions that it's an AI laggard. So, which of these tech goliaths will prove the superior investment amid the age of AI? Let's dig into both companies to find out.\nApple's steady AI push Apple proved the AI revolution is a marathon, not a sprint, when it wrapped up its 2025 fiscal year, ended Sept. 27, with record revenue, despite a choppy push into artificial intelligence. The company reported sales of $416.2 billion, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nThis result was helped by record revenue of $102.5 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, which contributed to strong 13% year-over-year growth in diluted earnings per share to $1.85. The performance shows Apple didn't need a splashy AI solution to sell products.\n\nHowever, the company realizes its artificial intelligence offerings must continue to improve. It brought in new AI leadership in December, replacing its head of AI strategy with Amar Subramanya. Subramanya comes to Apple with years of experience helping Microsoft and Alphabet build their artificial intelligence capabilities. About this switch, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said, \"We believe that this was a major reset ... to get Apple on the right track when it comes to AI.\"\nEven so, the company is already viewed as a rival in the AI space. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, called Apple a major competitor. He sees hardware that supports AI, rather than software, as the battleground for artificial intelligence leadership.\nIn this regard, Apple is making strides. In October, it released the M5 chip, which was designed to deliver the kind of powerful computing performance needed to support AI on its devices.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet's intensified AI focus Like Apple, fellow tech titan Alphabet was seen as struggling to succeed in artificial intelligence after early stumbles in the space. The Google parent made changes to its organization last year to improve its AI approach.\nThis effort culminated in the November launch of the company's Gemini 3, its most advanced AI yet. The new artificial intelligence model can pick up subtle clues, allowing it to better understand the intent behind a user's Google search.\n\nWhile Gemini 3's impact won't be known until Q4 results are announced in 2026, the company is already benefiting from its AI efforts to date. According to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, \"AI is driving an expansionary moment for Search,\" explaining that the AI embedded in Google \"is already driving incremental total query growth for Search.\"\nConsequently, Google search revenue hit $56.6 billion in Q3, an increase from $49.4 billion in 2024. This helped Alphabet grow Q3 sales by 16% year over year to $102.3 billion.\nThat's just the start. AI acts as the brains behind many Alphabet products, including its self-driving car business, Waymo. Here, \"Waymo clearly is scaling up, particularly in 2026,\" Pichai said. Its service is expanding to London next year, adding to its Tokyo operations, which were Waymo's first steps internationally.\n\nPicking between Apple and Alphabet stocks Apple and Alphabet still have many years of growth to look forward to in the hot field of artificial intelligence. The AI industry is projected to achieve a phenomenal 25-fold expansion within a decade, growing from $189 billion in 2023 to $4.8 trillion by 2033.\nGiven their proven revenue growth in the face of AI competition, such as ChatGPT, investing in both companies is ideal. But if you had to choose one, Alphabet has an edge over Apple when it comes to share price valuation.\nHere's a look at each stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which reflects what investors are paying for every dollar of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.\nAlphabet's earnings multiple has been lower than Apple's throughout 2025 and continues to be so despite a rise in its P/E ratio over recent weeks. This makes it a better value over the iPhone maker.\nWith its new Gemini 3 AI model now live, Alphabet could see further strong sales growth in 2026 as it continues to expand its already promising AI capabilities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Apple (AAPL) Stock Slides as Market Rises: Facts to Know Before You Trade\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\nIn the latest close session, Apple (AAPL) was down 1.04% at $270.83. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.64%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.47%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.52%.\nHeading into today, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had gained 0.8% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.98% and the S&P 500's gain of 3%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Apple in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $2.65, signifying a 10.42% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $137.51 billion, up 10.62% from the year-ago period.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $8.11 per share and a revenue of $451.64 billion, signifying shifts of +8.71% and +8.53%, respectively, from the last year.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the business health and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.35% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Apple is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Apple has a Forward P/E ratio of 33.73 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 11.74.\n\nIt's also important to note that AAPL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.56. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Micro Computers industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.67.\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 199, which puts it in the bottom 20% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Ranking the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy for 2026. Here's My No. 7\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 11:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Apple revolutionized the smartphone industry in 2007 with the unveiling of the iPhone.\nThe consumer tech giant still gets about half of its annual revenue from iPhone sales.\nIt's also involved on the artificial intelligence front, running AI programs on local devices.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nThe Magnificent Seven grouping of stocks has been one of the biggest stories on Wall Street. Coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett in 2023, this collection represents seven high-performing tech companies that are among the most influential in the U.S. The name was derived from a 1960 Western film of the same name.\nCollectively, these companies comprise 34% of the S&P 500 , a remarkable percentage. Just let that sink in for a moment -- out of 500 stocks, these seven account for a full one-third of the market capitalization of the index.\nThat's why the Magnificent Seven stocks are watched so closely -- they have an outsize impact on the market, and they have been responsible for a lot of the market's success. Over the course of a decade, from 2015 to 2024, these companies experienced a gain of nearly 700%.\n\nThis is the first part of a seven-article series ranking the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026, in reverse order. All of these companies are excellent stocks to buy, but in ranking them, only one can be in the ignominious seventh spot.\nAs I'm looking at what to expect in the coming year, the smartphone giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is my seventh-rated Magnificent Seven stock to buy.\nAbout Apple stock Apple is a famed tech company that's best known for its revolutionary smartphone, the iPhone. Apple's iPhone provided internet access, phone service, texting, music, and access to Apple's App Store via a touchscreen interface -- something completely groundbreaking when the first models rolled out.\n\nApple's iPhone was unique compared to phones offered by Nokia , BlackBerry , and Motorola , and it changed the game for Apple stock. Shares jumped 133% in 2007, the year that the iPhone came out.\nToday, Apple still generates most of its revenue from iPhone sales, but it also manufactures personal computers, wearable devices, and tablets, and has a lucrative Services division that includes Apple Music, its streaming services, a payment network, and the App Store. For fiscal 2025, Apple had $416.1 billion in revenue, with half of that coming from iPhone sales.\nNet Sales by Category\nFiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 28, 2024)\nFiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 27, 2025)\nPercentage Change\niPhone\n$201.18 billion\n$209.58 billion\n4.17%\nMac\n$29.98 billion\n$33.71 billion\n12.44%\niPad\n$26.69 billion\n$28.02 billion\n4.98%\nWearables, home, and accessories\n$37.0 billion\n$35.69 billion\n-3.54%\nServices\n$96.17 billion\n$109.16 billion\n13.51%\n\nSource: Apple\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors surely would want to see brisker iPhone sales, but Apple's flagship product has been hampered in China -- sales in greater China fell 3.8% in 2025, as Apple has seen greater competition from Chinese-based companies that are now offering smartphones with 5G technology.\nFortunately, however, Apple is getting a huge boost from its lucrative Services segment, which has a higher profit margin than divisions that rely on hardware development and manufacturing.\nNet Sales\nFiscal 2025\nProfit Margin\nProducts\n$307.0 billion\n36.7%\nServices\n$109.16 billion\n75.4%\n\nSource: Apple.\nWhat to expect from Apple in 2026 Apple has a market cap of around $4 trillion, making it at this writing the second-biggest company in the world by that measure. And the stock is up 8% this year.\nThe company is involved in artificial intelligence (AI), although its efforts are not as noticeable as some others in the Magnificent Seven. It's developing advanced M-series chips designed to run large AI models on its MacBooks, iPads, and Apple Vision Pro.\n\nThe company's strategy involves running AI programs on local devices rather than in cloud environments to maintain user privacy, although it does have a system -- Private Cloud Compute -- where data is processed in the cloud on secure Apple silicon servers but not stored or shared by Apple.\nThe company is selling its iPhone 17, a new Apple Watch lineup, and the third-generation version of its AirPods, and is coming off a quarter where its earnings per share jumped 13% on a year-over-year basis.\nThe company is ending 2025 in a great place -- remember, this is not a bad company. It just has the bad luck of being at the bottom of the rankings of my Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026. It's not monetizing AI like some of its peers, unfortunately.\n\nBut it's still a strong buy in my books. You really can't go wrong with any of the Magnificent Seven stocks.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Success could persuade customers like Apple or Qualcomm to shift some production, analysts said, but longstanding ties to Taiwan's TSM ( NYSE:TSM ) complicate the pitch.\nInvestors say the next 12 to 18 months are critical: without a marquee external contract, Intel may struggle to justify continued heavy manufacturing investment.\nMarket watchers caution returns could be gradual even if technical milestones are met and shareholders.\n\nIs INTC Stock a Buy?

Sign Up Now!\nAmazon entered 2025 as a “top pick” for many brokerages—a distinction it had held for the previous couple of years. However, the stock failed to live up to expectations and is on track to underperform the broader markets by a wide margin. Notably, while Amazon shares outperformed in the preceding two years, riding the artificial intelligence (AI) mania, they underperformed in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn fact, over the last five years, AMZN is up just 43%, which is just about half of what the average S&P 500 Index constituent has delivered. Meanwhile, brokerages are quite bullish on the stock’s prospects, and BMO, TD Cowen, Wedbush, Truist, J.P. Morgan, and Evercore ISI have named Amazon as a “top idea” or equivalent for 2026.\nWhy Did Amazon's Stock Underperform in 2025? Barring brief periods, particularly following the Q3 2025 earnings release, Amazon stock underperformed peers this year. There’s a lot that’s making markets apprehensive, which is reflected in the stock’s price action. Here’s a brief overview:\nRising Competition : Amazon is facing competitive pressure from legacy brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart (WMT), as well as Temu and Shein, which have become popular with their ultra-low-cost merchandise.\nMarket Share Losses in AWS : While Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) growth has rebounded, it continues to lose market share to Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), which are growing at a much faster rate.\nCapex Taking a Toll on Cash Flows : The Amazon story was never about GAAP earnings, but the stellar cash flows that it generated. However, the burgeoning capex, particularly towards building the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, is taking a toll on the company’s free cash flows. Amazon’s trailing 12-month free cash flows plunged to $14.8 billion at the end of Q3 2025, while the corresponding numbers in 2024 and 2023 were $47.7 billion and $21.4 billion, respectively. While AI could drive Amazon’s growth and help the company lower costs, intermittent concerns over tech companies’ ability to monetize their AI investments have put pressure on their stock prices.\nImpact of AI : While AI would positively impact nearly all aspects of Amazon’s business, there are concerns that the rise of third-party AI shopping agents is a threat to Amazon’s lucrative and fast-growing digital advertising business.\n\nStory Continues\nAMZN Stock 2026 Forecast Brokerages are upbeat on Amazon’s forecast, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 56 analysts covering the stock. AMZN’s mean target price of $295.80 is 30% higher than the current price levels. The stock trades even below the most pessimistic target price of $230, while the Street-high target price of $360 represents a potential upside of 58%.\nShould You Buy Amazon Stock? While Amazon’s e-commerce growth in developed markets might have plateaued, the company should be able to bolster its growth. Amazon is doubling down on groceries and has even launched a private food brand, which would help it increase its total addressable market. Haul, which is Amazon’s platform to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, should also help the company earn additional revenues. Amazon's business-to-business (B2B) platform, Amazon Business, is another potential growth driver to watch, and it is already running at a multi-billion-dollar gross revenue run rate.\n\nPrime should also help drive Amazon’s growth next year, and we might even see the company hike prices. The company has started cracking down on Prime password sharing and should ramp up ads in 2026, which would help it increase its digital ad business.\nAMZN stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 31.7x, which looks quite tempting to me even as earnings growth might be tepid over the next couple of years on higher depreciation expenses emanating from the AI capex.\nI find Amazon among the best structural growth stories, as the company is a play on several high-potential sectors like e-commerce, cloud, streaming, digital advertising, and now even AI. I have been bullish on Amazon stock for quite some time, and while I did book some profits earlier this year, I have used the recent dip to add more shares.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: AMZN, META, AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOG.

      "Content": "How Caterpillar Crushed the Magnificent 7 in 2025 — And It’s Not Done Yet!\n\nRich Duprey\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nQuick Read Caterpillar ( CAT ) rose 61% in 2025 to become the top Dow performer. Caterpillar outpaced six of the seven Magnificent 7 tech stocks.\nCaterpillar’s Energy and Transportation segment drove gains with Q3 power generation sales up 31% from AI data center demand.\nCaterpillar raised guidance to 5% to 7% annual sales growth through 2030 with adjusted operating margins reaching 21% to 25% at $100B sales.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate market headlines in 2025, many of the stocks most closely tied to the technology -- the Magnificent 7 stocks of Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) -- have shown volatility or lagged.\nSix of the seven have experienced mixed or negative returns at points throughout the year, with broad concerns over valuations, sector rotations, and sustainability weighing on performance. In contrast, one unexpected name has outperformed six of the seven: Caterpillar ( NYSE:CAT ), the heavy equipment manufacturer. On a total return basis (capital appreciation plus dividends), Caterpillar trails only Alphabet by about one percentage point or so as of last Friday's close. Yet less than two weeks ago, Caterpillar was even ahead of Alphabet in year-to-date gains.\n\nSo, how is a traditional industrial company easily outpacing some of the world's largest tech giants?\nCaterpillar's Strong 2025 Performance Caterpillar has risen approximately 61% in 2025 compared to Alphabet's roughly 62 % gain, leaving the heavy equipment manufacturer just behind the tech behemoth and with the potential to surpass it by year-end.\nIt also stands as the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , edging out Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) in second place, and significantly outpacing the rest of the Magnificent 7, with only Nvidia, which has returned almost 35% this year, coming close.\n\nWhat Is Doing the Heavy Lifting for Caterpillar Caterpillar's outperformance stems from strong demand in its Energy and Transportation segment, particularly generators and power equipment for AI data centers and infrastructure. Partnerships like the one with Vertiv ( NYSE:VRT ) for data center power solutions have highlighted Caterpillar's role in supporting AI growth.\nEnduring global infrastructure spending and mining demand have also contributed, but the real standout has been in power generation and oil and gas, segments that saw sales rise 31% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nTariffs posed challenges earlier in the year, with estimated costs up to $1.8 billion in 2025, but the company mitigated impacts through cost controls and pricing adjustments. Still, inflation continues to weigh on margins, with consolidated operating profits slipping 3%.\nHowever, these drivers that carried Caterpillar higher in 2025 appear sustainable into 2026, with analysts pointing to ongoing AI-related power needs and potential infrastructure rebounds. The risks of tariff escalation and cyclical slowdowns in construction or mining remain present.\n\nKey Takeaway Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar often deliver the best returns when bought during downturns to capture upside as cycles recover. Caterpillar began rising in late 2022, gained strongly in 2023, and delivered about 24% returns in 2024. In 2025, shares faltered on tariff fears in April before doubling from those lows.\n\nAt this point in the cycle, Caterpillar remains a solid holding, with tailwinds from AI infrastructure and global demand likely continuing into next year and beyond. Their strength allowed management to raise guidance for the next five years.\nCaterpillar is now expecting 5% to 7% compound annual sales growth through 2030, adjusted operating margins of 15% to 19% at $60 billion in sales and 21% to 25% at $100 billion in sales, and $6 billion to $15 billion in free cash flow—a 20% to 50% increase over prior estimates. While valuations are elevated with the stock trading well above its five-year average across most metrics, the structural shift toward power generation supports further gains rather than an imminent peak.\nAI's strong tailwinds will likely carry Caterpillar stock beyond the typical cyclical decline, and though investors should monitor economic indicators and keep an eye on whether AI is truly in a bubble phase or not, taking profits now may be premature given the outlook.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is included among the 13 Top Tech Stocks Paying Consistent Dividends .\nOn December 17, Jefferies analyst Edison Lee lifted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s price target to $283.36 from $246.99 while maintaining a Hold rating on the stock. The firm boosted its iPhone shipment forecasts, raising Q1 estimates by 7% and FY26 projections by 3%. It also factored in a foldable iPhone starting in FY27. Jefferies said Apple’s premium pricing gives it a strong buffer against rising memory costs.\n\nIn other news, CNBC reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has assured investors it plans to roll out the next version of Siri, its AI-powered voice assistant. A lot is riding on the debut of a “more personal Siri,” especially as Apple has largely stayed on the sidelines of the AI push that accelerated after OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in late 2022.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) rarely shares details about its product roadmap, but Siri has been an exception. The company had initially planned to release the upgraded assistant in 2025. In March, though, Apple pushed back the launch, even after promoting the feature in ads, saying it would now arrive sometime in “the coming year.”\nCEO Tim Cook told investors in October that development work on Siri is moving along well.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "5 Stocks That Pay Out Dividends Like Apple\n\nJohn Csiszar\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nIn the not-too-distant past, you would be hard-pressed to find any technology company that paid a dividend. But in the modern market, many of the more mature tech companies have begun focusing more on direct returns to shareholders in the form of dividends.\nApple, the beloved tech company that is currently the 2nd-largest in the S&P 500 , pays an annual dividend of $1.04 per share as of November 2025. That means if you own 100 shares of Apple, the company will pay you $104 in cash every year.\n\nWhile that works out to a relatively meager 0.39% dividend yield, there’s lots of room for Apple to raise that payout over time thanks to its immense cash hoard. But keeping its yield relatively low also allows Apple to deploy its cash into more productive, growth-oriented areas like research and development.\nIf you’re on the hunt for companies matching Apple’s profile — top-tier businesses with predictable cash flow, solid track records and room for both capital appreciation and dividend growth — here’s a list of stocks that might fit the bill , with stock data sourced from Yahoo! Finance.\nBroadcom (AVGO) Annual dividend: $2.36\nDividend yield: 0.66%\nMarket cap: $1.687 trillion\nBroadcom is a tech/semiconductor name that may not be as much of a household name as Apple, but it’s still the 6th-largest company in the S&P 500 . The company pays a dividend yield about 50% higher than Apple while still offering tech-level growth.\n\nExplore More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nMeta Platforms (META) Annual dividend: $2.10\nDividend yield: 0.33%\nMarket cap: $1.573 trillion\nMeta Platforms is probably best known as the parent company of Facebook. Now the 8th-largest company in the S&P 500 , Meta didn’t begin paying dividends until 2024 , and its current yield is even lower than Apple’s 0.39%. But the company generates prodigious amounts of cash and is likely to follow the Apple model of starting slow and increasing dividends over time.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) Annual dividend: $1.64\nDividend yield: 2.27%\nMarket cap: $238.397 billion\nWhen it comes to tech stocks, Cisco Systems is one of the dividend leaders. Its yield is head-and-shoulders above that paid by most other tech stocks , including Apple. As the company now generates about 56% of its income on a subscription basis, its cash flow is more stable, allowing it to easily cover its higher dividend. Cisco’s solid 2.27% yield appeals to both income and growth investors alike.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Annual dividend: $3.64\nDividend yield: 0.72%\nMarket cap: $3.754 trillion\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft, currently the 3rd-largest company in the S&P 500 , has been a tech giant for decades. If you ever use a computer, you likely use at least one Microsoft product. The company generates immense amounts of revenue and has raised its dividend for 24 consecutive years, according to Dividend.com , in line with its increasing cash flow.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Annual dividend: $5.68\nDividend yield: 3.54%\nMarket cap: $145.371 billion\nIf you’re looking for a tech stock that pays a hefty dividend, Texas Instruments may be the answer. The chip maker may not be as flashy as consumer-oriented stocks like Apple, but its product is essential, providing it with stable cash flow and the ability to cover a high dividend yield. According to Morningstar , Texas Instruments was one of the first tech stocks to pay a dividend, starting way back in 1985.\n\nComparison: Dividend Aristocrats While it’s admirable that the big tech companies listed above pay cash dividends, these stocks are typically screened out by traditional dividend investors. The S&P 500 as a whole has a dividend yield of 1.17% , meaning the most well-known tech stocks on this list, like Apple and Microsoft, pay sub-market yields. For “big-game” dividend hunters, solid companies that pay yields of 2.5% or more, like Texas Instruments, are usually the target.\n\nThe so-called “dividend aristocrats” are companies that have not only paid but also increased their dividends annually for at least 25 years. Names on this list tend to be in the consumer and industrial sectors, according to SureDividend . Many are companies that provide products that you may use on a daily basis, such as Coca-Cola , PepsiCo , Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson . By way of comparison, those stocks currently pay dividend yields of 2.89%, 3.99%, 2.91% and 2.76%, respectively. Other well-known companies, such as Target and Hormel Foods , pay significantly higher dividends of 5.03% and 5.24%, respectively.\nThe Bottom Line Building a portfolio involves more than just picking stocks by their dividend yield. You have to consider the overall balance of your portfolio in terms of growth and income, and risk and reward. For most investors, simply picking the stocks on this list and owning them all isn’t a sound strategy.\nPure dividend investors, for example, will likely prefer companies like Target, PepsiCo or Procter & Gamble, which offer slow growth but high dividends. But others may prefer companies like Apple and Microsoft, which focus on higher growth but still pay dividends that are likely to grow over time. Either way, this list should serve as a starting point for your research, not a sample portfolio.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nNearly 1 in 3 Americans Hit by a Costly Holiday Scam, Norton Survey Shows -- How To Avoid This\nHere's What the Average Social Security Payment Will Be in Winter 2025\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\nThe Easiest Way to Score $250 for Things You Already Do\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : 5 Stocks That Pay Out Dividends Like Apple\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\n\nOpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”\n\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs : a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1 OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X , that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing . He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nOpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product . The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API , which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’ OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information . One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nChatGPT can directly edit your code The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools , including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025 . ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.\n\nFebruary 2025 OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X , Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’ OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nJanuary 2025 OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”\nChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders . For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’ OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.\n\nFAQs: What is ChatGPT?

      "Content": "CDW Price Target Reduced as Morgan Stanley Analyst Turns More Selective on IT Hardware Exposure\n\nVardah Gill\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: CDW\n\nAAPL\n\nDELL\n\nCDW Corporation (NASDAQ: CDW ) is included among the 13 Top Tech Stocks Paying Consistent Dividends .\nPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on Unsplash\nOn December 17, Morgan Stanley cut its price target on CDW Corporation (NASDAQ:CDW) to $177 from $191. The firm kept its Overweight rating. In its year-ahead view on IT hardware, Morgan Stanley said it prefers companies tied to cloud spending, product refresh cycles like Apple, and businesses with more differentiated assets. It is steering away from names with heavy memory exposure, including Dell and HP. The analyst stated that the firm is becoming more cautious regarding memory-linked stocks overall.\n\nCDW Corporation’s (NASDAQ:CDW) third-quarter results demonstrated why the company continues to stand out. The business generated $5.7 billion in net sales, up 4% from last year. Gross profit climbed 5% to $1.3 billion. That kind of steady growth tends to matter more in a mixed IT spending environment.\nManagement pointed to strengths across several areas. Government and education customers benefited from CDW’s deep experience in those markets. Small business was a bright spot, delivering double-digit growth in both revenue and gross profit. Demand for AI workstations among smaller firms picked up during the quarter. The corporate segment also held up well. Revenue rose at a mid-single-digit pace, while gross profit grew in the low single digits. Security and cloud projects led the way.\n\nLooking ahead, management reaffirmed its 2025 outlook. CDW Corporation (NASDAQ:CDW) expects the US IT market to grow in the low single digits and believes it can outperform by 200 to 300 basis points. Gross profit in the second half of the year is still expected to be slightly higher than the first half, though the split should be less balanced than the historical 48% and 52% pattern. Gross margins in 2025 are expected to stay roughly in line with 2024.\nCDW Corporation (NASDAQ:CDW) is an American multi-brand provider of IT products and services. It serves customers across business, government, education, and healthcare.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CDW as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

So I just think it's a lack of sellers. I I'm not nearly as bullish as as you are going into January, but for now, I just think it's a lack of sellers.\n00:32 Brian\nUh why not? What gives you pause, Tom?\n00:37 Tom\nUh just price. I mean, if you're, you know, I'm I'm a pretty, I've been a pretty active trader for a long time and price is kind of everything. I don't really think about anything, you know, beyond price. and sometimes you get to the point where you're like, hey, it it just becomes a pot odds play, Brian. Where is there more risk? Is there more risk to staying long or is there a better payout being short? That's all it is.\n01:04 Brian\nIs there underneath the surface of let's say Nvidia, Tom and some of those well-known uh AI plays? Are there other areas of the market in in AI that are that are breaking down that that are red flags to you?\n01:15 Tom\nNo, not yet. I mean, I mean the the small caps, the small cap AI stocks are trailing a little bit, but not really and there's a lot of stocks in the pipeline that, you know, also look good that might come out as IPOs in 2026. But for the most part, I think it's just, it's just the mega tech, the mega tech stocks. It's it's the it's the big, too big to fail companies. And I think in that sense, that's where the real risk is.\n01:33 Brian\nBrooke, I mentioned here at the top that uh AI is back in rally mode. I call out Nvidia, Microsoft, but if if you dig down a little deeper, it's not every one of these stocks have been rocking the past five or even 10 trading sessions.\n01:46 Brooke\nYeah, if you take a look, there are some companies that are definitely pulling back some momentum. For example, we do have Oracle moving higher today, up about 1.2%, but if you take a look over the month, it's down about 2%. Over the past six months, down about 5% as we make our way into year end. And also, in addition to that, to take a look at some of the players that did go public this year. Take for example, we have uh another one like Core Weave moving higher today up about 3.5%. On the flip side, that stock up nearly 20% year uh or rather in the past month alone as we make our way into the end of the year. I think that investors are really trying to see how exactly they could still get into this this tech rally, still find those spots that maybe have been underperformers as of late in fear that they might miss out. I think we're seeing a bit of FOMO as we make our way into the later days and the last few days of this year's trading session.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "If You Think Apple Trading For 36x Earnings Is Nuts, You Can Bet Against Them With AAPD ETF\n\nAustin Smith\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nQuick Read Apple trades at 36x earnings but underperformed the S&P 500 by over 2 percentage points in the past year.\nAAPD offers -1x daily inverse exposure to Apple with a 0.01% expense ratio and $18.9M in assets.\nDaily rebalancing causes AAPD returns to deviate from simple inverse performance over periods longer than one day.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nApple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) trades at 36x earnings while delivering just 10% returns over the past year. If you're skeptical that the 4t tech giant can continue this performance into 2026, the Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares ( NASDAQ:AAPD ) is an inverse ETF that provides -1x daily exposure to Apple's price movements.\nBut there are some things to consider first.\nApple's Current Valuation Metrics Apple's valuation metrics show a forward P/E of 33x and a trailing P/E of 36x, these are premium multiples for a company that hasn't had a blockbuster product in years. The company's most recent fiscal year showed earnings growth following two years of near-stagnation.\nRetail sentiment data from Reddit supports this 'richly valued' view, and our data shows bearish sentiment scores in the 32-38 range on r/wallstreetbets while r/stocks hovers around neutral.\n\nHow AAPD Works AAPD provides -1x daily inverse exposure to Apple's stock price through derivatives. The ETF carries a 0.01% expense ratio and holds $18.9 million in assets under management.\nThis infographic illustrates how the AAPD ETF provides inverse daily exposure to Apple stock, detailing its mechanics, suitable use cases for short-term bearish strategies, and a breakdown of its pros and cons for investors.\nThe ETF resets its exposure each day through daily rebalancing. Returns over periods longer than one day will deviate from a simple inverse of Apple's performance due to compounding effects. Direxion's daily fact sheet provides updated performance data showing how compounding affects returns.\n\nThe ETF's asset base of $18.9 million affects liquidity characteristics. Daily volume and bid-ask spreads widen during Apple's earnings announcements when volatility increases.\nNote that while this can help you profit if Apple shares decline, it is not the type of ETF to own for long periods and perhaps confusingly will not create the inverse returns of Apple's shares in the long run due to daily rebalancing.\nBut if you believe Apple's best days are behind it and that shares will under-perform in 2026, it's worth looking at.\n\nStory Continues\nComparison to TSLQ The Tradr 2X Short TSLA Daily ETF ( NASDAQ:TSLQ ) offers -2x leveraged inverse exposure to Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ). TSLQ holds $315 million in assets under management, providing deeper liquidity than AAPD. TSLQ carries a 1.17% expense ratio and doubled leverage, which amplifies both gains and losses while accelerating compounding effects.\n\nThe products differ in leverage structure, liquidity profile, and cost. AAPD provides unleveraged -1x inverse exposure while TSLQ provides -2x leveraged inverse exposure.\nInterest rates and equity risk premiums represent macro factors affecting inverse ETF performance, while Apple's Services growth and iPhone pricing represent company-specific factors affecting AAPD's underlying exposure.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Only Seen Twice in 153 Years: History’s Clear Warning for the Stock Market in 2026\n\nDavid Beren\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nIt should go without saying that the S&P 500 has been riding high over the last few years and has delivered one of the most impressive runs in market history. Over the past three years, the index has surged a whopping 80%, driven in part by artificial intelligence, falling interest rates, and ongoing corporate earnings growth. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolio balances have reached levels that might have seemed all but impossible to achieve a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 surged 80% over three years. This has occurred only twice before in 153 years.\nPrevious instances (1920s and 1990s) both preceded market crashes of 49% to 89%.\nThe S&P 500 forward P/E sits around 21 to 22. This is roughly 40% above historical averages.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnfortunately, any exceptional performance like this in the market comes with something of a warning label. A three-year gain of this kind of magnitude with the S&P 500 has only occurred twice in the last 153 years of stock market performance. The first, the 1920s bull market, and the late 1990s tech boom both ended in devastating fashion with the Great Depression and the dot-com bust.\nThankfully, history doesn't always guarantee repetition, but it does signal that a pattern could be forming in the sense that markets performing this well for this long could be a giant warning sign for investors. As 2026 gets closer, understanding what happened in the last two instances now just feels like understanding basic risk management.\nThe S&P 500's Ultra-Rare 3-Year Surge: What History Predicts If you look closely, the 80% gain over the last three years roughly translates to anywhere between a 21% and 27% annualized return, which is more than double the S&P 500's long-term average of approximately 10% in gains. The rarity of this occurrence cannot be overstated, considering it has only happened twice in the 153 years, with the 1927-1929 bull market rising 95% and the tech boom between 1995 and 1998 increased 85%.\n\nIf you're seeing giant warning signs today, it's because you know that what is taking place in the market today, performance-wise, is eerily familiar to what has happened before. In the 1920s, you had a market that boomed because of cars becoming more readily available, on top of electrification taking place across cities and non-cities alike. It was the promise of a new era, and the 1990s boom was driven by something similar, as the internet was being heralded as something that was going to transform everything we knew about technology, communication, and just about everything in between.\n\nStory Continues\nThe 80% surge between 2023 and 2025 is following the same pattern, and this is what is causing warning bells to go off. Unsurprisingly, AI is being heralded as the transforming technology, and valuations have expanded significantly as a result. This all feels very much like 1999, and AI is being labeled as the kind of technology that will change everything, just as the internet was heralded as something transforming, and electricity absolutely did transform everything. This all comes together with a clear message in that when the stock market delivers this kind of three-year performance, it precedes major reversals.\n\nAnalyzing the Historical Precedents for 2026 During the 1927 to 1929 surge, the market continued to climb well into September before it all came crashing down in October. The initial 48% decline happened between October and November, but the real impact was felt from the end of 1929 all the way toward the end of 1932, when the total market collapse took place, dropping the market by around 89% in total. Crazily enough, it would take 25 years before the market would return to its 1929 highs.\n\nFast forward to the 1995-1998 surge, the market continued to climb higher and higher through 1999 before it peaked in March 2020. The rest, as they say, is well-known history, as the dot com crash erased 49% of the S&P 500's value in just 2.5 years. The Nasdaq fell 78% and its overall recovery would take another seven years before returning to its starting levels.\nThe takeaway here is that there is a consistent pattern that was followed in both of these cases, in that the market didn't crash immediately after a three-year surge. The market rally actually, and surprisingly, as you look back, continued for an extra year, delivering even more gains before a severe decline. In 2026, the cautionary tale is that history suggests either the market delivers this year as one full of gains or one that shows indicators of a reversal. Suffice it to say, neither scenario paints a pretty picture, as even if investors get one more year of gains, the crash starts and wipes all the gains out.\n\nIs an AI Bubble Forming? The Biggest Risk Heading into 2026 If you have been watching the current level of AI enthusiasm, and who hasn't been, the parallels between today and previous tech bubbles are almost impossible to ignore. We are already seeing just how transformative AI can be, something that echoes what the country saw during the electrification of the 1920s and the internet in the 1990s. Sadly, real technology, no matter how transformative, doesn't always prevent bubbles. If anything, it actually enables a bubble to take place by trying to justify massive corporate valuations.\n\nThe biggest takeaway right now is that the signs of a bubble transformation are present, and they are present across multiple indicators. Valuations for AI-centric stocks are assuming nearly flawless execution and sustained growth continuing for years into the future. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) are all investing billions, tens of billions into AI infrastructure without a clear signal of what the return could be. As a result, the S&P 500's forward P/E is sitting around 21 to 22, approximately 40% above historical averages.\nIf you are a retail investor, and many of us are, this is something to be very aware of, as is options trading, which has seen its volume surge in AI stocks. Reddit, in particular, has come alive with discussion, especially on places like r/WallStreetBets, in a way that feels almost too familiar if you were on message boards during the dot-com era in 1999. On top of social media conversation, you also have companies adding \"AI\" anywhere they can in their core descriptions or even their company names to try and boost valuations. This closely mirrors when companies added \".com\" to their company names in the late 1990s to try to jump on a similar trend.\n\nThe bottom line is that any catalyst for a stock reversal could come from slower-than-anticipated AI adoption or even disappointing returns from AI investments. Add to all of these concerns over an economic slowdown resulting from tariffs, or even inflationary concerns, depending on how the Fed handles interest rates. This all comes together in what could be a perfect storm for either a massive buying shift or a major selling rally, and any instance of the latter is going to feed on itself as panic selling grabs hold until the bottom falls out.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Warren Buffett Departs With 64% of Berkshire Hathaway in 5 Stocks to Hold Forever\n\nLee Jackson\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:15 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nCVX\n\nMNST\n\nBRK-B\n\nKO\n\nIf any investor has stood the test of time, it is Warren Buffett, and with good reason. For years, the “Oracle of Omaha” has had a rock star-like presence in the investing world, and his annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( NYSE: BRK-B ) shareholders meeting draws thousands of loyal investors. They were stunned at this year's meeting when Buffett announced he would step down as CEO of the investment giant at year's end. While he will remain board chair and continue to have a voice in the day-to-day operations, his pre-announced successor, Greg Abel, will assume the CEO position at the end of the year.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( NYSE: BRK-B ) is up a solid 11.3% in 2025, but it trails the S&P 500’s 15.1% gain.\nSome across Wall Street have said that Berkshire Hathaway should start paying a dividend.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nLong-time investors and Buffett mavens know that he favors holding S&P 500 stocks forever. So it’s not surprising to report that, for all the success and stature Berkshire Hathaway has in the investment world, five top companies make up almost 64% of the fund's total holdings. While much more concentrated than most portfolio managers would ever consider, the strategy has worked for Berkshire Hathaway investors for years. It is likely to continue doing so in the future. The question many would ask, given his impending departure, is which stocks are likely to remain in the portfolio in the long term? We screened the portfolio, and these longtime stalwarts, which all pay dividends and make up the bulk of the portfolio, are likely to stay at the dance for decades to come.\n\nWhy do we cover Warren Buffett's stocks? There are few investors with the results and reputation that Buffett has garnered over the past 50 years. While investing has evolved over the past half-century, buying good companies with products and services recognized worldwide and paying dividends will always remain a timeless approach. There is also a good chance that Greg Abel will retain all of these gigantic positions.\n\nAmerican Express American Express Co.

Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model .\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation? We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$128.7b\nUS$138.8b\nUS$158.3b\nUS$171.7b\nUS$184.1b\nUS$194.1b\nUS$203.4b\nUS$212.3b\nUS$220.8b\nUS$229.2b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x14\nAnalyst x7\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 5.46%\nEst @ 4.80%\nEst @ 4.34%\nEst @ 4.02%\nEst @ 3.79%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3%\nUS$118.9k\nUS$118.4k\nUS$124.7k\nUS$124.9k\nUS$123.7k\nUS$120.5k\nUS$116.6k\nUS$112.4k\nUS$108.0k\nUS$103.5k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2t\n\nStory Continues\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 3.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV) = FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$229b× (1 + 3.3%) ÷ (8.3%– 3.3%) = US$4.7t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$4.7t÷ ( 1 + 8.3%) 10 = US$2.1t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.3t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$274, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nThe Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.085. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple\nSWOT Analysis for Apple Strength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Tech industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nLooking Ahead: Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

      "Content": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Apple Inc's Intrinsic Value\n\nGuruFocus News\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2025-12-22, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $169.17. It's currently trading at a price of $273.67. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -61.77%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$7.47\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 15.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n92.15\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n77.02\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n169.17\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $125.32. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -118.38%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: Berkshire Hathaway Will Stop Selling Apple Stock in 2026\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 12:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Apple went into the holiday quarter with improving revenue momentum.\nHighlighting Berkshire's confidence in Apple, the tech stock is still Berkshire's biggest holding.\nBerkshire's upcoming CEO handoff to Greg Abel could lead to a shift in strategies for the equity portfolio.\n10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) has spent the past two years trimming its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- a move that caught many investors off guard. That trend becomes even more interesting heading into 2026, when Warren Buffett is scheduled to hand the chief executive role to Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel.\nNotably, the selling doesn't necessarily mean Berkshire has soured on Apple's business. The cuts to the conglomerate's massive position in the iPhone are more likely a way to manage an oversized position. Further, Apple has been giving investors reasons to be upbeat; its latest guidance points to stronger growth during the holiday quarter.\nWhy should investors care? Apple remains Berkshire's biggest listed stock holding, and Abel will inherit a company that already has enormous financial flexibility. If Abel's looking for ways to deploy capital at Berkshire's scale, continuing to sell down a high-quality holding may not make sense now that the position has already been right-sized.\nUnderstanding Berkshire's Apple position Berkshire Hathaway reported owning 238.2 million shares of Apple as of Sept. 30. That was down from 280.0 million shares three months earlier.\nAt Berkshire's latest reported share count for its Apple position, and based on the value of Apple stock today, Berkshire's position in the iPhone maker is currently worth more than $65 billion. This is ahead of its second-largest holding, American Express , which is valued at about $57 billion. In addition, it represents about 20% of Berkshire's total equity portfolio.\n\nShowing just how big Berkshire's position in Apple stock is, it's even significant as a percent of the conglomerate's total market capitalization . With a market capitalization of about $1.07 trillion as of this writing, Apple stock represents about 6% of Berkshire's total market value.\nEmbracing tech stocks With Apple still sitting at the top of Berkshire's stock portfolio, it's difficult to believe managers at Berkshire are bearish on the tech company. A more practical reason for recent selling is concentration risk after years of compounding.\n\nSure, it wouldn't be surprising to see Berkshire sell more Apple shares in the fourth quarter of 2025, getting the position to an even 20% position (as a percent of Berkshire's total equity holdings) or slightly below it for the sake of risk management. But any selling beyond this level may be unlikely.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd Berkshire hardly looks like a business desperate for more liquidity. In its latest quarterly report, Berkshire said its insurance and other businesses held $354.3 billion in cash and U.S. Treasury bills. That kind of dry powder gives Abel flexibility, but it also creates pressure to find places to deploy capital that can still move the needle.\n\nWith this backdrop (a ton of cash and a need to deploy some of it productively), Abel may choose to hold onto whatever remaining shares Buffett leaves Berkshire with when he steps down at the end of the year.\nFurther, under new and younger management, Berkshire may be more prone to owning a higher percentage of tech stocks. In fact, Berkshire recently revealed a new stake in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . This position is now valued at more than $4 billion, putting it in Berkshire's top 10 holdings.\nApple's business is improving Perhaps the biggest reason Berkshire may opt to stop selling Apple stock next year is the Cupertino-based company's improving business.\nApple's most recent earnings report showed steady momentum before the company's biggest seasonal quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 rose 8% year over year to $102.5 billion.\n\nAnd management expects that growth rate to accelerate during the important holiday quarter. Apple chief financial officer Kevan Parekh said in the company's most recent earnings call that it expects revenue during the period to grow 10% to 12% year over year.\nThat outlook is also consistent with Apple CEO Tim Cook's recent comments on demand.\n\n\"At the aggregate level, we are thrilled with how iPhone has been received, and that's the reason that we're expecting double-digit growth in the current quarter,\" Cook said during the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call.\nNone of this, of course, guarantees Berkshire will stop selling. But I think, under Abel's leadership, there's a good chance it will.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

      "Content": "Meet the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Pays More Dividends Than Any Other S&P 500 Company. Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is one of the AI Stocks on the Market’s Radar . On December 17, Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $315.00 from $305.00 while maintaining an Overweight rating.\nAccording to the firm, the new $315 price target reflects an “unchanged 32x multiple on our new FY27 EPS of $9.83 (up from $9.55).” Earnings expectations for FY27 were raised on higher revenue from price hikes, a slightly higher iPhone shipment forecast, despite lower gross margins and an unchanged opex trajectory.\nOverall, the firm remains confident in Apple’s pricing power and AI investment payoff.\nApple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

At the time, it was the most valuable business in the world. What's impressive is that even coming off a massive starting base, this company has continued to grow. It now sports a market cap of more than $4 trillion (as of Dec. 20).\nThis means that long-term shareholders have benefited. If you'd invested $1,000 in this consumer discretionary stock 10 years ago, here's how much you'd have today.\nApple has been crushing the market A $1,000 starting sum to buy Apple shares in December 2015 would be worth $11,450 right now. This translates to a total return of 1,040%. That gain includes the dividend, which is a small payout today at $0.26 per quarter. However, the dividend has increased by 100% in the past 10 years.\nThe S&P 500 's total return during the same time period of 305% comes up well short of Apple's.\n\nFinancial results and valuation drive the stock Between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 27), Apple's revenue soared 78%, as it sold more of its popular hardware devices and saw its services segment grow rapidly. Net income rose 110% over that time. But valuation expansion was the biggest tailwind for the stock.\nLooking out at the next decade, Apple's more muted growth prospects mean that investors shouldn't expect past returns to repeat.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

You need a 'strong stomach': Dan Ives' strategy\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: PLTR\n\nCRWV\n\nAMD\n\nIVES\n\nMETA\n\nIn the AI trade, you \"can't just bet on one company,\" Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research, Dan Ives, tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting the importance of diversification for AI investors.\nWatch the video above to hear more about Ives' AI thesis and the 30 stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF ( IVES ).\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThere's another stock I want to ask you about, and that is CoreWeave, which as you know, has sold off pretty sharply. Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

      "Content": "Analysts Are Hot on the Foldable iPhone. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Before Apple’s Next Big Product Launch?\n\nAanchal Sugandh\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 8:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nApple (AAPL) is both one of the market's most influential stocks and one of the world's most valuable firms, making it difficult for investors to overlook. The company currently appears to be working on its next significant hardware development, with anticipation centered on a foldable iPhone set to emerge in the fall of 2026.\n\nMing-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, projects that shipments would only reach 3 million to 5 million units in 2026 before rapidly increasing to 20 million in 2027.\nMore News from Barchart Did Nvidia Just Lose Its Spot as Wall Street’s AI Chip Darling?

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nThe device's anticipated ultra-thin glass does increase execution risk because it is extremely prone to cracks and costs two to four times as much as regular glass, which puts pressure on margins despite premium pricing. Retail prices could exceed $2,000.\nHowever, if quality meets expectations, Apple's loyal customer base could continue to spur replacement demand. The book-style design might have a 7.8-inch internal display, a 5.5-inch exterior panel, Touch ID, dual lenses, and a stainless steel-titanium hinge.\nAmid this development, analysts are increasingly focused on Apple's foldable ambitions, making investors wonder if buying Apple's shares ahead of its next major product cycle makes strategic sense.\nAbout Apple Stock Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple designs and sells smartphones, computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories alongside a broad services portfolio. Its ecosystem spans iPhone, Mac, iPad, proprietary operating systems, digital content, cloud, payments, and subscription platforms.\nWith a market cap of $4 trillion, Apple continues to enjoy considerable confidence among investors. Its stock has gained 9.56% over the past 52 weeks, driven by a strong 39.2% rally in the last six months.\nMoreover, over the most recent three-month period, the company’s shares rose 11.47%, decisively outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index’s ($IUXX) 2.3% gain.\nMoreover, valuation metrics indicate that AAPL stock trades at 33.55 times forward adjusted earnings and 8.92 times forward sales, reflecting a clear premium to industry averages and signaling market expectations for sustained growth, strong margins, and durable competitive advantages.\n\nStory Continues\nAlso, Apple returns capital through dividends, maintaining a 12-year payout streak. The company pays $1.04 annually, yielding 0.38%, with the most recent $0.26 dividend distributed on Nov. 13 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 10.\nApple Surpasses Q4 Earnings On Oct. 30, Apple reported its Q4 2025 financial results, delivering another solid performance that exceeded expectations. Revenue rose 7.9% year-over-year (YOY) to $102.5 billion, topping Street forecasts of $101.2 billion, while EPS increased 90.7% from the previous year’s quarter to $1.85, ahead of the $1.73 consensus estimate.\n\nMarkets responded positively to the quarter, with management citing solid demand for both hardware and services. The successful rollout of the iPhone 17 lineup, resilient MacBook Air sales, and sustained momentum in services collectively contributed to performance.\nThe iPhone once again anchored growth. During the September quarter, iPhone revenue reached a record $49 billion, reflecting a 6% YOY increase. Strong uptake of the iPhone 16 and 17 models pushed Apple’s active installed base to an all-time high, reinforcing long-term monetization potential through upgrades, services, and ecosystem stickiness.\nAdditionally, Apple's Mac division generated significant gains. Revenue climbed 13% YOY to $8.7 billion, supported primarily by robust demand for the MacBook Air. At the same time, Services continued to emerge as a critical growth catalyst, generating a record $28.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up 15% YOY, with double-digit growth across both developed and emerging markets.\n\nLooking ahead, management has guided for a record December quarter, projecting 10% to 12% YOY revenue growth. Expectations rest on double-digit iPhone growth, continued services strength, expanded AI capabilities, and sustained R&D investment.\nAnalysts echo the confidence, forecasting fiscal 2026 Q1 EPS rising 10.4% YOY to $2.65. They forecast a full-year fiscal 2026 bottom line growing 8.7% to $8.11, followed by a further 12.5% rise to $9.12 in fiscal year 2027, supporting a durable long-term growth narrative.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Apple Stock? Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring recently lifted his price target on AAPL stock to $315 from $305 and reiterated a “Buy” rating, identifying the company as one of his preferred IT hardware stocks heading into 2026.\nThe optimism aligns closely with broader Wall Street sentiment. AAPL currently carries a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating. Among the 40 analysts covering the stock, 21 rate it “Strong Buy,” three assign “Moderate Buy,” 14 recommend “Hold,” while only one suggests “Moderate Sell” and one recommends “Strong Sell.”\nThe stock’s average price target of $290.85 represents potential upside of 6.3%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $350 implies potential gain of 27.9% from current levels, reflecting more bullish assumptions around Apple’s next growth cycle.\nOn the date of publication, Aanchal Sugandh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Intel stock soared in 2025. But the chipmaker still has a long road ahead.\n\nLaura Bratton\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBY\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nFor Intel ( INTC ), 2025 was an eventful year, but not one that necessarily changed its narrative .\nThe storied American chipmaker got a new CEO and won massive investments from the US government , Nvidia ( NVDA ), and SoftBank ( SFTBY ). Those developments helped push the stock up 86% for the year, ahead of gains for the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks and Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). At the same time, Intel's crucial manufacturing segment still lacks a major external customer — something it needs to make the cash-bleeding business viable.\n\n\"Intel's exiting the year with some optimism that they will be a relevant chip manufacturer in the US at some point in time ... and that was definitely an uncertain statement at the start of the year,\" MorningStar analyst Brian Colello told Yahoo Finance.\nAt the same time, he noted, \"There wasn't the massive sort of deal that really establishes Intel, either, in manufacturing.\"\n\nThe company's technology is largely responsible for the digital revolution and Silicon Valley's reputation as a global innovation hub: Intel invented the world's first microprocessors, or computer chips, and the x86 architecture, a critical blueprint for designing computer chips. Its co-founder Gordon Moore created Moore's Law, a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. The company has continued to make its own computer chips, even as the rest of the industry has gone \"fabless\" — outsourcing manufacturing to firms like Taiwan's TSMC ( TSM ).\n\nBut years of missteps and poor investment decisions put Intel's manufacturing segment behind TSMC, which in turn caused its products to lose their edge to competitors. As its chips — CPUs for servers, laptops, and desktops — have lost market share to rivals AMD and Arm ( ARM ), its manufacturing business has been stripped of the scale it needs to remain viable.\nFour years of an aggressive turnaround effort by former CEO Pat Gelsinger to revive Intel's manufacturing arm by opening it to outside customers sent investors fleeing. The massive amount of spending required to reboot the foundry, along with its uncertain success, spooked Wall Street.\nThe arrival of Lip-Bu Tan , who was named chief executive in March following the board's ousting of Gelsinger in late 2024, began to renew faith in the company's potential turnaround. While Intel's strategy remains mostly unchanged under Tan, analysts explained, investors have applauded his sober tone, cost-cutting measures, and wide-ranging industry connections.\n\nStory Continues\nThat tepid faith transformed into confidence when the US government made a rare $9 billion investment in the company — albeit funds Intel was supposed to get anyway from the Biden-era CHIPS Act — following Tan's tiff with President Trump over the CEO's business ties to China.\nOnshoring semiconductor manufacturing has been a focus of the US government since the pandemic highlighted the risk of a tech supply chain reliant on Taiwan. Escalating tensions with China, including the threat of a Taiwan invasion, have further intensified the sense of urgency.\n\n\"Semiconductors are not only economically important, they're actually important from a national security perspective,\" Technalysis analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \"Intel has by far the largest infrastructure in place as a true, real American company.\"\nMany critics believe the broader US turn toward state capitalism under Trump, exemplified by the Intel investment, raises questions about national security and the government's conflicting interests. But analysts say the US government's 10% stake in Intel could lead to various positive outcomes for the company, such as Intel having a say in trade policy that affects semiconductors. More importantly, the US could step in to incentivize or force a major company like Apple to use the chipmaker's foundry.\n\nA $2 billion investment from SoftBank and $5 billion from Nvidia further boosted investor sentiment on Intel stock. The cash infusion helped stem the company's steep losses as it figures out a path forward. Notably, though, the Nvidia deal didn't include an agreement for Intel's foundry business to manufacture the AI giant's chips.\n'Everything hinges on 14A' Intel's biggest potential customers for its foundry business — Nvidia, Apple ( AAPL ), and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) — are also, to some degree, competitors of its products arm and have longstanding relationships with TSMC. Not to mention, TSMC is building $165 billion worth of manufacturing capacity in the US, diminishing the geopolitical argument for those companies to use Intel to produce their chips.\nTo win those customers, Intel will need to prove that its latest generation manufacturing processes are up to snuff. The chipmaker's 18A process, a massive technological feat initially marketed to outside customers, is now being used primarily to make Intel's own products. Whether those products — Intel's upcoming Panther Lake chips for PCs and Clearwater Forest chips for data centers — succeed could help convince companies to use its next-generation processes called 18AP and 14A, analysts said.\n\nAlready, rumors have circulated that Apple could use Intel's manufacturing, specifically its 18AP process, for its lowest-end computer chips.\nIntel has 12 to 18 months to secure a big external customer for 14A in order for that process to continue as planned, BNB Paribas analyst David O'Connor estimated.\nHe called the process \"the crux of Intel being successful on the foundry business or not, or potentially even exiting manufacturing long term.\"\n\"Everything hinges on 14A and the success of that,\" O'Connor said.\nOther analysts gave longer timelines for when Intel would see a turnaround.\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said, \"It took 10 years to break it. Why would it take less than 10 years to fix it?\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Bluesky @laurabratton.bsky.social.

      "Content": "Why Warren Buffett Just Sold 15% of His Apple Stake and Is Putting Money Here Instead\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:51 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Apple still accounts for nearly 21% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio.\nBerkshire Hathaway finished the third quarter with over $320 billion in Treasury bills.\nBerkshire Hathaway is currently sitting on a record-breaking cash pile.\n10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\nAt the end of this year, Warren Buffett is finally retiring after leading Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) for more than six decades. In that time, Berkshire Hathaway has been one of the stock market's best-performing stocks, and its moves have attracted much investor interest, hoping to mimic its success in some sense.\n\nIn the third quarter, Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway made some notable moves that leave the next wave of leadership with a record-breaking cash pile of over $380 billion. We can't fully predict Berkshire Hathaway's direction post-Buffett, but its incoming CEO, Greg Abel, will have plenty of resources at his disposal.\nTrimming its largest holding For the past couple of years, Berkshire Hathaway has sold considerably more shares than it has bought. In the third quarter, it trimmed its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) by around 15%. The iPhone maker is still Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, accounting for 20.9% of its stock portfolio (just over 238 million shares), but it's a much smaller stake than it has historically been.\n\nThere are two key reasons why Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett made these moves. First, the company likely wants to take profits from its Apple stake while corporate tax rates are in its favor. There's no guarantee that corporate tax rates will change, but if they do, it's unlikely to be in corporations' favor.\nSecond, Apple's stock has become fairly expensive compared to its expected earnings growth. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 34, the third-highest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Berkshire Hathaway likely thinks the profit from Apple is better put elsewhere.\nWhere Berkshire Hathaway is putting money instead The main place Berkshire Hathaway has been putting its money is in U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills), which are short-term government debt backed by the U.S. Treasury. At the end of the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway held around $305 billion in T-bills. That means it purchased around $19 billion of them during the quarter.\nWith seemingly limited big-buck investment opportunities right now, stashing cash in T-bills makes sense because it allows Berkshire Hathaway to earn guaranteed income without taking on any risks. Right now, T-bills are paying out around 3.66%, meaning $305 billion worth would pay out around $11 billion annually. That's pure profit with virtually no effort required.\n\nStory Continues\nSince the cash isn't locked into longer-term T-bills, Berkshire Hathaway has plenty of liquidity and can access its cash fairly quickly if an opportunity were to become available.\nShould you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway right now? Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory Continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:25 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) innovations have been lackluster, but its ecosystem is as powerful as ever.\nAmazon is driving tremendous growth in its AWS cloud division thanks to strong AI demand.\nValuation should always play a part in proper investment analysis.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nWhen looking at stocks to buy, investor attention might go to the most dominant and well-known businesses out there. This will naturally lead to technology companies that have strong market positions, popular products and services, and perhaps a presence in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) come to mind. Over the long term, they have both been fantastic stocks to own, doing a great job compounding shareholder capital. And today, they command multitrillion-dollar market caps .\nBoth businesses have their own investment merits. But which is the best stock to buy right now?\nApple is moving slowly with AI, but the moat couldn't be wider The biggest knock on Apple in recent years has been its unhurried approach to AI. Major tech enterprises across the board are moving incredibly fast at building out the necessary infrastructure and software capabilities to position themselves to become leaders in the AI market.\nApple, in typical fashion, started out being cautious, as its usual strategy isn't to be first, but to be the best. However, the Apple Intelligence features on its smartphones aren't turning any heads. And an upgraded Siri launch has been delayed until next year.\n\nThat still doesn't take away from Apple's wide economic moat. The company's competitive position is supported by its strong brand, with Apple arguably being the most recognizable business on Earth. The brand resonates with consumers across the globe, thanks to the company's beautifully designed hardware and software offerings, superior user experience, and premium positioning. The elevated retail experience also has an impact.\nThe moat is also helped by Apple's powerful ecosystem . This combination of products and services is what makes the business truly one-of-a-kind. Customers are essentially locked in, with Apple being able to generate profits on its hardware devices, while also raking in high-margin revenue on its fast-growing services segment.\nThere are very few companies as financially sound as Apple. Its net profit margin has averaged 25.5% in the past five years. It collects massive amounts of free cash flow . And the balance sheet is clean, with $34 billion of net cash on the books (as of Sept. 27). This reduces risk for investors.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon has multiple growth drivers that will push it forward Amazon, on the other hand, is already atop the AI race. It's planning to spend a whopping $125 billion on capital expenditures this year to bolster its technical infrastructure. That's an easy capital allocation decision for the leadership team to make, as they are seeing robust demand from customers for AI-related products and services.\n\nThis shows up in Amazon Web Services (AWS), whose revenue shot up 20% year over year in Q3. This booming segment is also very profitable, bringing in trailing-12-month operating income of $43.8 billion.\nBesides cloud computing, which itself is poised to be a $2.4 trillion market worldwide in 2030, Amazon dominates online shopping. Nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce activity happens on its marketplace, giving it an advantageous position as buyer behavior keeps moving to digital channels.\nInvestors might not realize that Amazon reported $17.7 billion in digital ad sales in the third quarter, a major growth engine that is likely also producing high margins. Amazon also has a presence in streaming entertainment, autonomous driving, and healthcare.\n\nI believe Amazon is in a better position to increase its revenue and earnings power at a faster rate than Apple, thanks to those secular trends working in its favor. Valuation matters as well. Amazon stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 32.1 is below Apple's multiple of 36.6, given the former the upper hand.\nWith a time horizon looking out over the next five or 10 years, I view Amazon as the best stock to buy right now.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "OpenAI vs. Apple? Sam Altman is setting his sights on winning what could be an even higher-stakes AI battle\n\nAlyson Shontell\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 10:25 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAll eyes are on the Big Tech LLM race and, at least in the eyes of investors , it seems like Google (owned by Alphabet , No. 7) could run away with the win.\nGoogle’s Gemini has been steadily stealing buzz and AI traffic share over the last few months from OpenAI. And if there was any moat to be had in LLMs, it would seem like it would belong to the company with the biggest treasure chest of personal data on users. That almost indisputably would be Google, thanks to Android, YouTube , Search history, Maps, and Gmail. On top of that, the company has one of the top AI minds, Demis Hassabis, and Google cofounder Sergey Brin leading its troops toward dominance.\n\nPerhaps that’s why Sam Altman is setting his sights on winning what could be an even higher-stakes AI battle: creating the future mass AI consumer device. Altman feels that in the long term, his greatest foe will be Apple (No. 4), not Google, Meta (No. 22), or Amazon (No. 2). He recruited iPhone designer Jony Ive to OpenAI this May, and Ive has said the company’s secret device could be ready in the next two years.\nWhat will that device be like? If you ask Altman, he describes limitations with the mobile phone. First of all, it can be turned off. It also can’t scan the room around you and give you real-time context and know exactly when to deliver relevant information to you. He sounds more bullish about audio than visual as the primary means of communication. And he sees no reason why a device and an operating system should be sold separately, like Google and Android—a future device should come with the trademark LLM baked in, like iOS in an iPhone.\n\nThanks largely to that iPhone, Apple is generating tens of billions of dollars a year in cash flow that it can plow into new devices and armies of engineers to design them—two areas where OpenAI lags far behind. Then again, Apple seems ripe to be disrupted: As Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said on Joe Rogan’s podcast earlier this year, “They haven’t invented anything great in a while. It’s like Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later.”\nBut for now, OpenAI and its team are all about perfecting ChatGPT. For more on how Altman is planning to position OpenAI as a long-term hardware play, and how he’s combating fast-rising competition like Anthropic and Google in the short term, check out Fortune ’s reporting on what’s happening inside OpenAI as it battles its way through an eight-week code red.\nAlso, we’re taking a break for the holidays, so Fortune 500 Digest will be back in inboxes Jan. 10.

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is among the 14 Best S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Now . On December 15, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained an Overweight rating on the stock with a share price target of $305, a reaffirmation of an earlier update on October 31.\nThe adjustment follows Citi analyst Atif Malik lifting his price target on the iPhone-maker to $330 from $315 on December 9, while keeping a Buy rating on the shares.\nCiti sees an uptick in iPhone sales during the coming quarters, as it believes several old users of the smartphone, especially those who have iPhone 12 and 13, are due for an upgrade. Considering this factor, Citi said it was raising its earnings estimates for the company.\n\nEarlier in the month, on December 5, CLSA also hiked its price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $330 from $265, while keeping an earlier Outperform rating, citing a surge in iPhone sales, which is expected to drive revenue and earnings growth in FY26-27.\nAs of the close of business on December 17, Wall Street analysts have a Moderate Buy rating on the stock, with a one-year average share price target of $298.72, implying a 9% upside.\nIn other news, according to a report from The Information on Tuesday, Apple is planning to expand its iPhone product line to include seven variants by 2027.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned the company widespread acclaim and customer loyalty.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
