      "Content": "The stock market is being powered by 10 stocks that are fueling AI bubble fears\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nUpdated Wed, December 17, 2025 at 6:28 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\n^SPX\n\nGOOG\n\nIf you're in the \"stock market is in a bubble\" camp, look no further than the composition of the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nThe top 10 stocks now account for roughly 32% of S&P 500 earnings and over 41% of total market capitalization — levels not seen since at least 1980, according to new data from Barclays strategist Venu Krishna.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been the primary driver of this market power concentration. Those seven companies — Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Apple ( AAPL ) — are essentially powering the artificial intelligence boom.\nThese stocks are up on average 21% this year compared to a 15% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data. Alphabet is the top performer with an advance of 62% amid optimism on its new Gemini 3 model.\nIn turn, the valuation of the S&P 500 has reached a level even most bulls would agree is on the rich side. Krishna's work reveals the S&P 500 is trading at the 91st percentile relative to its 10-year valuation history.\n\"Complacency\" could ignite an AI bubble, Deutsche Bank strategist Adrian Cox told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (video above).\nRead more: How AI, unemployment, and interest rates could shape the stock market and your investments next year\nIndeed, complacency appears to have settled in, despite the risks investors had to endure this year.\nRemember the \"Liberation Day\" tariff spectacle in April? The S&P 500 tanked 4.8% the day after President Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on April 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped a staggering 1,679 points.\n\nTariffs are now in effect, though they are not as severe as first advertised.\nAnd more recently, disappointments from AI darlings CoreWeave ( CRWV ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) have begun to call into question the near-term outlook for the AI trade.\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation in 2026 in the AI trade,\" Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye said on Opening Bid .\nAlphabet is Essaye's top AI pick for 2026, though he acknowledges there are likely to be winners and losers from the Magnificent Seven complex next year.\n\"I think companies like Oracle that [are] not overextended financially but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that is tied to open AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" Essaye added. \"There's going to be some pretty serious bifurcation. We've seen it in the last, say, two months of 2025. I think that gets worse in 2026.\"\n\nStory Continues\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "Can Apple close the AI gap in 2026? Morgan Stanley weighs in\n\nSam Boughedda\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:05 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nMS\n\nGOOG\n\nInvesting.com -- Morgan Stanley believes Apple could make progress in artificial intelligence distribution in 2026, but warned the company is still likely to lag peers in core AI capabilities despite an anticipated overhaul of Siri.\nIn a note led by analyst Erik Woodring, the bank said Apple “will become a leading distributor of AI technologies with a Siri re-release in spring 2026,” supported by closer collaboration with external partners such as Google’s Gemini.\n\nThe bank added that these partnerships, rather than in-house development, are expected to be the main driver of Apple’s AI strategy next year.\nHowever, Woodring struck a cautious tone on Apple’s competitive position, saying the company “will remain less relevant in the game of AI in the coming year.”\nIt is believed that Apple’s relatively conservative AI investment over the past two to three years means it will take time to catch up with rivals, even if Apple Intelligence improves through third-party large language models.\nWoodring argued that Apple Intelligence has yet to meaningfully accelerate iPhone upgrade cycles.\nDespite strong consumer interest, the firm estimated that replacement cycles lengthened in fiscal 2025, with shipment growth driven more by an ageing installed base than by new AI features.\n\nThat could begin to change with a Siri relaunch expected in spring 2026, when Apple is likely to integrate a customised Gemini model to deliver more advanced functionality.\nThe bank noted that Apple is stepping up AI spending, including higher operating expenses and capital investment, but said execution risks remain.\nMorgan Stanley feels monetisation is likely to come later, with a paid Apple Intelligence tier “as early as 2027,” once adoption and user engagement are established.\nRelated articles\nCan Apple close the AI gap in 2026?

      "Content": "Warner Bros will urge shareholders to reject hostile bid as Trump attacks Paramount\n\nUna Hajdari\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 4:54 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nORCL\n\nWarner Bros Discovery is expected to recommend that shareholders vote against a hostile takeover bid from Paramount Global, according to reporting from several news outlets, dealing a blow to Paramount’s massive $108bn (€92.2bn) attempt to take over the rival studio. Euronews has reached out to Warner for further comment.\n\nThis comes after Paramount announced it was planning to go to Warner Bros' shareholders directly in early December with an all-cash $30 per-share offer — bypassing the board after the studio rejected several of its acquisition proposals. Netflix, on the other hand, is proposing $27.75 per share in cash and stock.\nSince the acquisition battle heated up, Warner Bros stock has been trading closer to $30 per share, shooting up from around $24 per share earlier this month.\nWhy is Warner Bros so hot right now? The battle for Warner Bros has become a test of who will dominate the US media industry.\nWhoever acquires the company would gain access to an extensive film and studio content library licensed under Warner Bros, as well as HBO content and the DC Comics franchise, which includes legacy characters such as Batman and Superman.\n\nThe company's share price was widely considered to be undervalued as the company became bogged down by heavy debt and intense competition from Netflix, Amazon, and Apple.\nOn 5 December, Netflix made a formal offer for Warner Bros Discovery, which the company’s board agreed to support and which included HBO Max and HBO, after a high-stakes months-long bidding war.\nIn a statement, the streaming giant confirmed the mammoth $82.7bn (€71bn) deal, which is being framed as a bringing together of \"two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,” Warner Bros CEO and president David Zaslav said at the time.\nIf Warner Bros does break its current agreement with Netflix, it will owe the rejected streamer a $2.8bn (€2.4bn) fee.\n\nEven so, Paramount still faces a number of hurdles before it can claim victory over Netflix, with critics notably questioning the financing of the offer.\nRelated\nWarner Bros Discovery weighs sale after 'unsolicited' buyer interest\nNetflix wins battle for Warner Bros as HBO joins streaming giant’s empire\nParamount goes hostile in bid for Warner Bros, challenging Netflix\nIs Trump's son-in-law involved? President Donald Trump weighed in publicly on the Warner Bros sale a week ago, arguing that the news network CNN should be sold as part of any transaction involving its parent company. He criticised the network’s current leadership as “corrupt or incompetent”, insisting CNN be divested to secure broader political balance in their coverage.\n\nStory Continues\nParamount’s acquisition proposal included acquiring cable and broadcast news assets currently owned by Warner Bros. This sparked worries among some lawmakers and observers that editorial coverage could shift, particularly with regard to reporting on the Trump administration.\nBillionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is one of the principal financial backers of Paramount Skydance’s hostile bid, providing a large portion of the equity that underpins the offer and helping to secure other investors. His son, David Ellison, is chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance.\n\nThat affiliation — coupled with the Ellisons’ friendship with Donald Trump and their role as major Republican donors — has led some analysts to believe that the Skydance bid is not merely a commercial offer but also a play for political influence.\nJared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, or more specifically his private equity firm Affinity Partners, was initially listed as a backer of Paramount’s hostile takeover bid. The firm has since pulled out of the financing consortium.\nIn a not-so-atypical turnaround, Trump criticised Paramount on Tuesday evening, claiming that he was not actually as cosy with Paramount as it may have seemed. Paramount owns CBS, a station that ended production of 'The Late Show' earlier this year. When the programme's cancellation was announced, some suggested the decision linked to host Stephen Colbert's criticism of the Trump administration. At the time, CBS said it was \"purely a financial decision\".\n\nThe axing of the 33-year-old show came just days after Colbert publicly criticised Paramount for settling a $16mn (€13.7mn) lawsuit with Donald Trump at a time when the company was seeking regulatory approval for its Skydance merger.\n“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that '60 Minutes' has treated me far worse since the so-called 'takeover', than they have ever treated me before,” Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday night. “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n'60 Minutes' is a news show produced by CBS and was the subject of the $16mn defamation case settled earlier this year. Trump claimed that producers edited an interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris in a way that was deliberately deceptive.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Alphabet a Top Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy for 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet's rise in 2025 is due to low expectations entering the year.\nAlphabet could open a new business unit in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the best big tech stocks to own in 2025. Its stock has risen 65% so far in 2025, outperforming nearly all of its big tech peers, like Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , and even Nvidia . However, after a great 2025, some investors may be a bit more concerned about what 2026 will hold. After all, it isn't easy to follow up a strong year with another.\n\nIf you look into the reasons why Alphabet's stock had a great 2025, it's clear that it frees the stock up to have another strong 2026, although it will be difficult to be as impressive as 2025 was. I think this makes Alphabet a great buy heading into 2026, and I'd expect Alphabet to emerge as the second-largest company in the world, behind Nvidia.\nAlphabet faced several doubts heading into 2025 To understand why Alphabet's 2025 was so successful, we need to rewind the clock to the start of 2025. Then, there were several question marks surrounding Alphabet's business. Alphabet's core business is the Google Search engine, and there were questions about its future in the generative AI (artificial intelligence) world. Many thought that Google's best days were behind it, and slipping market share didn't help that opinion.\n\nFurthermore, there was a pending court case questioning the status of Google as a monopoly. Investors didn't know what Alphabet's business would look like in the future, as it could be broken up. As a further negative mark against Alphabet, it was losing the AI race. Competing models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and other models like Perplexity and Claude far outperformed Gemini.\nInvestors were very skeptical of Alphabet's future, and there was heavy bearish sentiment on the stock. At its low point in April, Alphabet's stock traded for less than 14 times forward earnings . That's value stock territory, and showcased the market's negative outlook on Alphabet's future.\nBut then, everything changed.\nSlowly, all of the question marks surrounding Alphabet's stock were answered, and the results were incredibly positive.\n\nAlphabet received positive news regarding its monopoly court case in September. It wouldn't be broken up, although it did have to make a few minor concessions. The fear that Google Search would be dethroned ended after AI overviews became incorporated into each result. This hybrid approach of traditional search and generative AI turned out to be a great compromise and has maintained Google's place at the top of the search engine market. Google's generative AI model, Gemini, also emerged as a leader in its industry. It was such a threat to OpenAI's dominance that it called a \"code red\" due to Gemini's improvements.\n\nStory Continues\nWith all of those problems being resolved, Alphabet's stock was free to be valued at the same level as its tech peers. Now, it trades for around 30 times forward earnings.\nWhile this isn't necessarily cheap, it places Alphabet on a level playing field and allows its business results to shine in 2026.\nAlphabet's 2026 is shaping up to be a good one On top of those questions being answered, another positive one was asked: What if Alphabet sold its in-house computing unit on the open market? Alphabet has developed a custom AI computing unit known as the tensor processing unit (TPU) with Broadcom . This unit was only sold to Alphabet, and could be rented by other clients through its cloud computing network, Google Cloud. However, Alphabet may consider selling these computing units outright to Meta Platforms . That would open up a new business unit for Alphabet in 2026, leading to further growth.\n\nIf this business unit takes off and Alphabet can continue growing its core business at a strong rate (its revenue rose 16% in Q3, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 35%), Alphabet will be in store for a great 2026. While returns won't be as explosive due to its higher starting valuation, I think its growth will allow it to be a market-beating stock in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/548d9062-5289-3add-b1f2-76dfc457ce89/warren-buffett-sells-apple.html",
      "Content": "Warren Buffett Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Trillion-Dollar AI Stock Up 12,180% Since Its IPO\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nBRK.A\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points During the third quarter, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway continued to sell Apple stock and started a new position in Alphabet.\nApple is well-positioned to monetize consumer adoption of artificial intelligence, but the stock is expensive at its current price.\nAlphabet has opportunities to monetize artificial intelligence across its digital advertising, cloud computing, and autonomous driving businesses.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) had about $267 billion invested across 41 U.S. stocks as of the third quarter. Those totals changed very little from the previous quarter, but Buffett (and his fellow investment managers) made some trades worth exploring:\nBerkshire sold 41.7 million shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . it remains the largest holding at 21% of the portfolio, but Buffett has slashed the position by 74% in two years.\nBerkshire bought 17.8 million shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . It is a relatively small position at 2% of the portfolio, but still noteworthy because Buffett has traditionally avoided technology stocks.\nAlphabet stock has returned 12,180% since its 2004 IPO and its $3.7 trillion market value makes it the third-largest company in the world. That Berkshire only recently started a position teaches a valuable lesson: It's alright to buy a stock that you initially overlooked, even if its share price has increased substantially.\nHere's what investors should know.\n1. Apple Apple reported encouraging financial results in the September quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Total revenue increased 8% to $102 billion driven by strong sales growth in the iPhone, Mac, and services segments. Non-GAAP net income increased 13% to $1.85 per diluted share due to modest operating margin expansion and continued share buybacks.\n\nThe investment thesis for Apple centers on its dominance in smartphones and its strong presence in other consumer electronics verticals. Design expertise spanning hardware and software has helped the company build a loyal consumer base willing to pay premium prices. iPhones accounted for 43% of smartphone sales in the September quarter, and Apple's installed base exceeds 2.35 billion devices.\nThat so many people have Apple devices means the company is ideally positioned to monetize consumer adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Last year, Apple introduced a suite of generative AI capabilities (called Apple Intelligence) for newer devices. They are currently free, but the company plans to introduce paid AI features in the next few years, according to Bloomberg.\n\nStory Continues\nNevertheless, Apple has a valuation problem. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 10% annually in the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 36 times earnings look very expensive. Those values give a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 3.6, and readings above 2 are typically considered overvalued. I think Apple is a great company, but the stock is not worth the current price.\n\n2. Alphabet Alphabet reported solid third-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 16% to $102 billion, an acceleration from 15% growth in the same quarter last year. GAAP earnings rose 35% to $2.87 per diluted share. CFO Anat Ashkenazi noted strong demand for AI infrastructure, specifically highlighting the adoption of custom chips and Gemini models.\n\nThe investment thesis for Alphabet centers on dominance in digital advertising, a position the company hopes to reinforce with artificial intelligence. Conversion rates have improved (i.e., more clicks) since Alphabet introduced AI Max for Search Campaigns earlier this year, and query volumes have increased since it added generative AI features to Google Search.\nMeanwhile, industry analysts rank Google Cloud as a leader in large language models, AI application development tools, and conversational AI tools. Google has also developed custom AI chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that have been adopted by Apple and Anthropic, among other noteworthy clients. Meta Platforms may deploy TPUs in its own data centers in 2027, according to The Information.\n\nFinally, Alphabet's autonomous driving subsidiary Waymo could eventually be a major source of revenue. It already offers commercial robotaxi services in six U.S. cities: Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, Atlanta, and Miami. Waymo will launch in four new cities across Texas and Florida in the coming weeks. And the company is testing its vehicles in another dozen cities.\nWall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase at 16% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 30 times earnings look reasonable. Those values give a PEG ratio of 1.9, which is far more attractive than Apple's PEG ratio of 3.6. Investors should consider buying a small position in Alphabet stock today.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?

      "Content": "Fresh Look at Apple (AAPL) Valuation After a Steady Three-Month Share Price Climb\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 12:12 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nFresh look at Apple after a steady run Apple (AAPL) has quietly added around 15% over the past 3 months and is up about 13% this year, reflecting a steady climb that invites a closer look at what might be priced in now.\nSee our latest analysis for Apple.\nWith the share price now at $274.61 and a strong 90 day share price return helping to drive a robust five year total shareholder return, the message from the market is that momentum is still building rather than fading.\n\nIf Apple’s steady climb has you thinking about what else could be riding the same wave of innovation, it is worth exploring high growth tech and AI stocks as potential next ideas.\nWith Apple delivering solid revenue and profit growth alongside a decade defining product ecosystem, the question now is simple: is the stock still undervalued, or is the market already pricing in years of future expansion?\nMost Popular Narrative: 4.2% Undervalued With Apple closing at $274.61 against a narrative fair value near $287, the story leans toward modest upside grounded in long term earnings power.\nNew five year frameworks suggest earnings could potentially double between 2024 and 2030, driven by a broader devices roadmap, AI enabled features, and higher services penetration, which justifies using out year earnings in valuation work.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\nWant to see how steady, mid single digit growth assumptions, richer margins, and a punchy future earnings multiple all connect to that upside view? The full narrative explains the revenue path, profit profile, and valuation bridge behind this fair value estimate step by step.\nResult: Fair Value of $287 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, mounting regulatory pressure on App Store practices and potential weakness in future iPhone upgrade cycles could quickly challenge that modest undervaluation story.\nFind out about the key risks to this Apple narrative.\nAnother Angle on Valuation On earnings, Apple looks anything but cheap. The stock trades at about 36.2 times earnings versus 33.3 times peers and 21.9 times the broader tech sector, even though our fair ratio suggests closer to 38.3 times. Is that thin cushion enough if sentiment cools?\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own Apple Narrative If you see the story differently or want to stress test the assumptions with your own inputs, you can build a fresh view in just minutes: Do it your way .\nA great starting point for your Apple research is our analysis highlighting 2 key rewards and 2 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking for more investment ideas?
