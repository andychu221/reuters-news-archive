      "Content": "1 Stock I'd Buy Before Tesla in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Tesla is hovering around an all-time high despite its core automotive business posting poor results.\nNvidia’s high margins enable it to invest aggressively in research and development without draining its cash flows.\nNvidia is a far better value than Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been on a tear -- hitting an all-time high on Dec. 15 . Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Alphabet\n\nRobert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Alphabet were criticized for their AI results to date, but they are turning that around.\nApple delivered record revenue in its 2025 fiscal year and brought on new AI leadership.\nAlphabet's application of AI is driving growth across its businesses, such as increased usage of its search engine.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nTech titans Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) were rivals during the rise of the smartphone era. However, the arrival of a new technological marvel, artificial intelligence (AI) , has led to the pair teaming up.\nNews reports indicate Apple is going to license Alphabet's Gemini AI model to power its Siri voice assistant at a cost of $1 billion annually. This would be a win for Alphabet, whose stock has been a boon for shareholders as the share price soared nearly 60% in 2025 through Dec. 18. In that time, Apple stock was up about 9%.\nThat said, Apple shares hit an all-time high of $288.62 on Dec. 3, despite previous media perceptions that it's an AI laggard. So, which of these tech goliaths will prove the superior investment amid the age of AI? Let's dig into both companies to find out.\nApple's steady AI push Apple proved the AI revolution is a marathon, not a sprint, when it wrapped up its 2025 fiscal year, ended Sept. 27, with record revenue, despite a choppy push into artificial intelligence. The company reported sales of $416.2 billion, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nThis result was helped by record revenue of $102.5 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, which contributed to strong 13% year-over-year growth in diluted earnings per share to $1.85. The performance shows Apple didn't need a splashy AI solution to sell products.\n\nHowever, the company realizes its artificial intelligence offerings must continue to improve. It brought in new AI leadership in December, replacing its head of AI strategy with Amar Subramanya. Subramanya comes to Apple with years of experience helping Microsoft and Alphabet build their artificial intelligence capabilities. About this switch, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said, \"We believe that this was a major reset ... to get Apple on the right track when it comes to AI.\"\nEven so, the company is already viewed as a rival in the AI space. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, called Apple a major competitor. He sees hardware that supports AI, rather than software, as the battleground for artificial intelligence leadership.\nIn this regard, Apple is making strides. In October, it released the M5 chip, which was designed to deliver the kind of powerful computing performance needed to support AI on its devices.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet's intensified AI focus Like Apple, fellow tech titan Alphabet was seen as struggling to succeed in artificial intelligence after early stumbles in the space. The Google parent made changes to its organization last year to improve its AI approach.\nThis effort culminated in the November launch of the company's Gemini 3, its most advanced AI yet. The new artificial intelligence model can pick up subtle clues, allowing it to better understand the intent behind a user's Google search.\n\nWhile Gemini 3's impact won't be known until Q4 results are announced in 2026, the company is already benefiting from its AI efforts to date. According to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, \"AI is driving an expansionary moment for Search,\" explaining that the AI embedded in Google \"is already driving incremental total query growth for Search.\"\nConsequently, Google search revenue hit $56.6 billion in Q3, an increase from $49.4 billion in 2024. This helped Alphabet grow Q3 sales by 16% year over year to $102.3 billion.\nThat's just the start. AI acts as the brains behind many Alphabet products, including its self-driving car business, Waymo. Here, \"Waymo clearly is scaling up, particularly in 2026,\" Pichai said. Its service is expanding to London next year, adding to its Tokyo operations, which were Waymo's first steps internationally.\n\nPicking between Apple and Alphabet stocks Apple and Alphabet still have many years of growth to look forward to in the hot field of artificial intelligence. The AI industry is projected to achieve a phenomenal 25-fold expansion within a decade, growing from $189 billion in 2023 to $4.8 trillion by 2033.\nGiven their proven revenue growth in the face of AI competition, such as ChatGPT, investing in both companies is ideal. But if you had to choose one, Alphabet has an edge over Apple when it comes to share price valuation.\nHere's a look at each stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which reflects what investors are paying for every dollar of earnings based on the trailing 12 months.\nAlphabet's earnings multiple has been lower than Apple's throughout 2025 and continues to be so despite a rise in its P/E ratio over recent weeks. This makes it a better value over the iPhone maker.\nWith its new Gemini 3 AI model now live, Alphabet could see further strong sales growth in 2026 as it continues to expand its already promising AI capabilities.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Apple (AAPL) Stock Slides as Market Rises: Facts to Know Before You Trade\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\nIn the latest close session, Apple (AAPL) was down 1.04% at $270.83. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.64%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.47%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.52%.\nHeading into today, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had gained 0.8% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.98% and the S&P 500's gain of 3%.\n\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Apple in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $2.65, signifying a 10.42% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $137.51 billion, up 10.62% from the year-ago period.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $8.11 per share and a revenue of $451.64 billion, signifying shifts of +8.71% and +8.53%, respectively, from the last year.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the business health and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.35% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Apple is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Apple has a Forward P/E ratio of 33.73 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 11.74.\n\nIt's also important to note that AAPL currently trades at a PEG ratio of 2.56. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Computer - Micro Computers industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.67.\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 199, which puts it in the bottom 20% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here's My No. 7\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 11:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Apple revolutionized the smartphone industry in 2007 with the unveiling of the iPhone.\nThe consumer tech giant still gets about half of its annual revenue from iPhone sales.\nIt's also involved on the artificial intelligence front, running AI programs on local devices.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nThe Magnificent Seven grouping of stocks has been one of the biggest stories on Wall Street. Coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett in 2023, this collection represents seven high-performing tech companies that are among the most influential in the U.S. The name was derived from a 1960 Western film of the same name.\nCollectively, these companies comprise 34% of the S&P 500 , a remarkable percentage. Just let that sink in for a moment -- out of 500 stocks, these seven account for a full one-third of the market capitalization of the index.\nThat's why the Magnificent Seven stocks are watched so closely -- they have an outsize impact on the market, and they have been responsible for a lot of the market's success. Over the course of a decade, from 2015 to 2024, these companies experienced a gain of nearly 700%.\n\nThis is the first part of a seven-article series ranking the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026, in reverse order. All of these companies are excellent stocks to buy, but in ranking them, only one can be in the ignominious seventh spot.\nAs I'm looking at what to expect in the coming year, the smartphone giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is my seventh-rated Magnificent Seven stock to buy.\nAbout Apple stock Apple is a famed tech company that's best known for its revolutionary smartphone, the iPhone. Apple's iPhone provided internet access, phone service, texting, music, and access to Apple's App Store via a touchscreen interface -- something completely groundbreaking when the first models rolled out.\n\nApple's iPhone was unique compared to phones offered by Nokia , BlackBerry , and Motorola , and it changed the game for Apple stock. Shares jumped 133% in 2007, the year that the iPhone came out.\nToday, Apple still generates most of its revenue from iPhone sales, but it also manufactures personal computers, wearable devices, and tablets, and has a lucrative Services division that includes Apple Music, its streaming services, a payment network, and the App Store. For fiscal 2025, Apple had $416.1 billion in revenue, with half of that coming from iPhone sales.\nNet Sales by Category\nFiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 28, 2024)\nFiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 27, 2025)\nPercentage Change\niPhone\n$201.18 billion\n$209.58 billion\n4.17%\nMac\n$29.98 billion\n$33.71 billion\n12.44%\niPad\n$26.69 billion\n$28.02 billion\n4.98%\nWearables, home, and accessories\n$37.0 billion\n$35.69 billion\n-3.54%\nServices\n$96.17 billion\n$109.16 billion\n13.51%\n\nSource: Apple\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors surely would want to see brisker iPhone sales, but Apple's flagship product has been hampered in China -- sales in greater China fell 3.8% in 2025, as Apple has seen greater competition from Chinese-based companies that are now offering smartphones with 5G technology.\nFortunately, however, Apple is getting a huge boost from its lucrative Services segment, which has a higher profit margin than divisions that rely on hardware development and manufacturing.\nNet Sales\nFiscal 2025\nProfit Margin\nProducts\n$307.0 billion\n36.7%\nServices\n$109.16 billion\n75.4%\n\nSource: Apple.\nWhat to expect from Apple in 2026 Apple has a market cap of around $4 trillion, making it at this writing the second-biggest company in the world by that measure. And the stock is up 8% this year.\nThe company is involved in artificial intelligence (AI), although its efforts are not as noticeable as some others in the Magnificent Seven. It's developing advanced M-series chips designed to run large AI models on its MacBooks, iPads, and Apple Vision Pro.\n\nThe company's strategy involves running AI programs on local devices rather than in cloud environments to maintain user privacy, although it does have a system -- Private Cloud Compute -- where data is processed in the cloud on secure Apple silicon servers but not stored or shared by Apple.\nThe company is selling its iPhone 17, a new Apple Watch lineup, and the third-generation version of its AirPods, and is coming off a quarter where its earnings per share jumped 13% on a year-over-year basis.\nThe company is ending 2025 in a great place -- remember, this is not a bad company. It just has the bad luck of being at the bottom of the rankings of my Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026. It's not monetizing AI like some of its peers, unfortunately.\n\nBut it's still a strong buy in my books. You really can't go wrong with any of the Magnificent Seven stocks.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "‘Top Pick’ Amazon Had a Dismal Year: What’s AMZN Stock’s Forecast for 2026?\n\nMohit Oberoi\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 9:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nMSFT\n\nWith year-to-date (YTD) gains of a mere 3.6%, Amazon (AMZN) is set to underperform the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which is on track to deliver double-digit returns for the third consecutive year. Unless we see something dramatic over the next week, Amazon will end up as the worst-performing “Magnificent 7” constituent this year.\n\nWhile the coveted group did not have a roaring year with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META) underperforming the S&P 500 Index and Tesla (TSLA) only slightly nudging ahead following the recent rally, Amazon’s underperformance stands out.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nAnalysts Are Hot on the Foldable iPhone.

Sign Up Now!\nAmazon entered 2025 as a “top pick” for many brokerages—a distinction it had held for the previous couple of years. However, the stock failed to live up to expectations and is on track to underperform the broader markets by a wide margin. Notably, while Amazon shares outperformed in the preceding two years, riding the artificial intelligence (AI) mania, they underperformed in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn fact, over the last five years, AMZN is up just 43%, which is just about half of what the average S&P 500 Index constituent has delivered. Meanwhile, brokerages are quite bullish on the stock’s prospects, and BMO, TD Cowen, Wedbush, Truist, J.P. Morgan, and Evercore ISI have named Amazon as a “top idea” or equivalent for 2026.\nWhy Did Amazon's Stock Underperform in 2025? Barring brief periods, particularly following the Q3 2025 earnings release, Amazon stock underperformed peers this year. There’s a lot that’s making markets apprehensive, which is reflected in the stock’s price action. Here’s a brief overview:\nRising Competition : Amazon is facing competitive pressure from legacy brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart (WMT), as well as Temu and Shein, which have become popular with their ultra-low-cost merchandise.\nMarket Share Losses in AWS : While Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) growth has rebounded, it continues to lose market share to Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), which are growing at a much faster rate.\nCapex Taking a Toll on Cash Flows : The Amazon story was never about GAAP earnings, but the stellar cash flows that it generated. However, the burgeoning capex, particularly towards building the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, is taking a toll on the company’s free cash flows. Amazon’s trailing 12-month free cash flows plunged to $14.8 billion at the end of Q3 2025, while the corresponding numbers in 2024 and 2023 were $47.7 billion and $21.4 billion, respectively. While AI could drive Amazon’s growth and help the company lower costs, intermittent concerns over tech companies’ ability to monetize their AI investments have put pressure on their stock prices.\nImpact of AI : While AI would positively impact nearly all aspects of Amazon’s business, there are concerns that the rise of third-party AI shopping agents is a threat to Amazon’s lucrative and fast-growing digital advertising business.\n\nStory Continues\nAMZN Stock 2026 Forecast Brokerages are upbeat on Amazon’s forecast, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 56 analysts covering the stock. AMZN’s mean target price of $295.80 is 30% higher than the current price levels. The stock trades even below the most pessimistic target price of $230, while the Street-high target price of $360 represents a potential upside of 58%.\nShould You Buy Amazon Stock? While Amazon’s e-commerce growth in developed markets might have plateaued, the company should be able to bolster its growth. Amazon is doubling down on groceries and has even launched a private food brand, which would help it increase its total addressable market. Haul, which is Amazon’s platform to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, should also help the company earn additional revenues. Amazon's business-to-business (B2B) platform, Amazon Business, is another potential growth driver to watch, and it is already running at a multi-billion-dollar gross revenue run rate.\n\nPrime should also help drive Amazon’s growth next year, and we might even see the company hike prices. The company has started cracking down on Prime password sharing and should ramp up ads in 2026, which would help it increase its digital ad business.\nAMZN stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 31.7x, which looks quite tempting to me even as earnings growth might be tepid over the next couple of years on higher depreciation expenses emanating from the AI capex.\nI find Amazon among the best structural growth stories, as the company is a play on several high-potential sectors like e-commerce, cloud, streaming, digital advertising, and now even AI. I have been bullish on Amazon stock for quite some time, and while I did book some profits earlier this year, I have used the recent dip to add more shares.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: AMZN, META, AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOG.

      "Content": "How Caterpillar Crushed the Magnificent 7 in 2025 — And It’s Not Done Yet!\n\nRich Duprey\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nQuick Read Caterpillar ( CAT ) rose 61% in 2025 to become the top Dow performer. Caterpillar outpaced six of the seven Magnificent 7 tech stocks.\nCaterpillar’s Energy and Transportation segment drove gains with Q3 power generation sales up 31% from AI data center demand.\nCaterpillar raised guidance to 5% to 7% annual sales growth through 2030 with adjusted operating margins reaching 21% to 25% at $100B sales.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate market headlines in 2025, many of the stocks most closely tied to the technology -- the Magnificent 7 stocks of Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) -- have shown volatility or lagged.\nSix of the seven have experienced mixed or negative returns at points throughout the year, with broad concerns over valuations, sector rotations, and sustainability weighing on performance. In contrast, one unexpected name has outperformed six of the seven: Caterpillar ( NYSE:CAT ), the heavy equipment manufacturer. On a total return basis (capital appreciation plus dividends), Caterpillar trails only Alphabet by about one percentage point or so as of last Friday's close. Yet less than two weeks ago, Caterpillar was even ahead of Alphabet in year-to-date gains.\n\nSo, how is a traditional industrial company easily outpacing some of the world's largest tech giants?\nCaterpillar's Strong 2025 Performance Caterpillar has risen approximately 61% in 2025 compared to Alphabet's roughly 62 % gain, leaving the heavy equipment manufacturer just behind the tech behemoth and with the potential to surpass it by year-end.\nIt also stands as the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , edging out Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) in second place, and significantly outpacing the rest of the Magnificent 7, with only Nvidia, which has returned almost 35% this year, coming close.\n\nWhat Is Doing the Heavy Lifting for Caterpillar Caterpillar's outperformance stems from strong demand in its Energy and Transportation segment, particularly generators and power equipment for AI data centers and infrastructure. Partnerships like the one with Vertiv ( NYSE:VRT ) for data center power solutions have highlighted Caterpillar's role in supporting AI growth.\nEnduring global infrastructure spending and mining demand have also contributed, but the real standout has been in power generation and oil and gas, segments that saw sales rise 31% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nTariffs posed challenges earlier in the year, with estimated costs up to $1.8 billion in 2025, but the company mitigated impacts through cost controls and pricing adjustments. Still, inflation continues to weigh on margins, with consolidated operating profits slipping 3%.\nHowever, these drivers that carried Caterpillar higher in 2025 appear sustainable into 2026, with analysts pointing to ongoing AI-related power needs and potential infrastructure rebounds. The risks of tariff escalation and cyclical slowdowns in construction or mining remain present.\n\nKey Takeaway Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar often deliver the best returns when bought during downturns to capture upside as cycles recover. Caterpillar began rising in late 2022, gained strongly in 2023, and delivered about 24% returns in 2024. In 2025, shares faltered on tariff fears in April before doubling from those lows.\n\nAt this point in the cycle, Caterpillar remains a solid holding, with tailwinds from AI infrastructure and global demand likely continuing into next year and beyond. Their strength allowed management to raise guidance for the next five years.\nCaterpillar is now expecting 5% to 7% compound annual sales growth through 2030, adjusted operating margins of 15% to 19% at $60 billion in sales and 21% to 25% at $100 billion in sales, and $6 billion to $15 billion in free cash flow—a 20% to 50% increase over prior estimates. While valuations are elevated with the stock trading well above its five-year average across most metrics, the structural shift toward power generation supports further gains rather than an imminent peak.\nAI's strong tailwinds will likely carry Caterpillar stock beyond the typical cyclical decline, and though investors should monitor economic indicators and keep an eye on whether AI is truly in a bubble phase or not, taking profits now may be premature given the outlook.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

(NASDAQ:AAPL)’s price target to $283.36 from $246.99 while maintaining a Hold rating on the stock. The firm boosted its iPhone shipment forecasts, raising Q1 estimates by 7% and FY26 projections by 3%. It also factored in a foldable iPhone starting in FY27. Jefferies said Apple’s premium pricing gives it a strong buffer against rising memory costs.\n\nIn other news, CNBC reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has assured investors it plans to roll out the next version of Siri, its AI-powered voice assistant. A lot is riding on the debut of a “more personal Siri,” especially as Apple has largely stayed on the sidelines of the AI push that accelerated after OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in late 2022.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) rarely shares details about its product roadmap, but Siri has been an exception. The company had initially planned to release the upgraded assistant in 2025. In March, though, Apple pushed back the launch, even after promoting the feature in ads, saying it would now arrive sometime in “the coming year.”\nCEO Tim Cook told investors in October that development work on Siri is moving along well.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "5 Stocks That Pay Out Dividends Like Apple\n\nJohn Csiszar\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nIn the not-too-distant past, you would be hard-pressed to find any technology company that paid a dividend. But in the modern market, many of the more mature tech companies have begun focusing more on direct returns to shareholders in the form of dividends.\nApple, the beloved tech company that is currently the 2nd-largest in the S&P 500 , pays an annual dividend of $1.04 per share as of November 2025. That means if you own 100 shares of Apple, the company will pay you $104 in cash every year.\n\nWhile that works out to a relatively meager 0.39% dividend yield, there’s lots of room for Apple to raise that payout over time thanks to its immense cash hoard. But keeping its yield relatively low also allows Apple to deploy its cash into more productive, growth-oriented areas like research and development.\nIf you’re on the hunt for companies matching Apple’s profile — top-tier businesses with predictable cash flow, solid track records and room for both capital appreciation and dividend growth — here’s a list of stocks that might fit the bill , with stock data sourced from Yahoo! Finance.\nBroadcom (AVGO) Annual dividend: $2.36\nDividend yield: 0.66%\nMarket cap: $1.687 trillion\nBroadcom is a tech/semiconductor name that may not be as much of a household name as Apple, but it’s still the 6th-largest company in the S&P 500 . The company pays a dividend yield about 50% higher than Apple while still offering tech-level growth.\n\nExplore More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nMeta Platforms (META) Annual dividend: $2.10\nDividend yield: 0.33%\nMarket cap: $1.573 trillion\nMeta Platforms is probably best known as the parent company of Facebook. Now the 8th-largest company in the S&P 500 , Meta didn’t begin paying dividends until 2024 , and its current yield is even lower than Apple’s 0.39%. But the company generates prodigious amounts of cash and is likely to follow the Apple model of starting slow and increasing dividends over time.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) Annual dividend: $1.64\nDividend yield: 2.27%\nMarket cap: $238.397 billion\nWhen it comes to tech stocks, Cisco Systems is one of the dividend leaders. Its yield is head-and-shoulders above that paid by most other tech stocks , including Apple. As the company now generates about 56% of its income on a subscription basis, its cash flow is more stable, allowing it to easily cover its higher dividend. Cisco’s solid 2.27% yield appeals to both income and growth investors alike.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Annual dividend: $3.64\nDividend yield: 0.72%\nMarket cap: $3.754 trillion\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft, currently the 3rd-largest company in the S&P 500 , has been a tech giant for decades. If you ever use a computer, you likely use at least one Microsoft product. The company generates immense amounts of revenue and has raised its dividend for 24 consecutive years, according to Dividend.com , in line with its increasing cash flow.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Annual dividend: $5.68\nDividend yield: 3.54%\nMarket cap: $145.371 billion\nIf you’re looking for a tech stock that pays a hefty dividend, Texas Instruments may be the answer. The chip maker may not be as flashy as consumer-oriented stocks like Apple, but its product is essential, providing it with stable cash flow and the ability to cover a high dividend yield. According to Morningstar , Texas Instruments was one of the first tech stocks to pay a dividend, starting way back in 1985.\n\nComparison: Dividend Aristocrats While it’s admirable that the big tech companies listed above pay cash dividends, these stocks are typically screened out by traditional dividend investors. The S&P 500 as a whole has a dividend yield of 1.17% , meaning the most well-known tech stocks on this list, like Apple and Microsoft, pay sub-market yields. For “big-game” dividend hunters, solid companies that pay yields of 2.5% or more, like Texas Instruments, are usually the target.\n\nThe so-called “dividend aristocrats” are companies that have not only paid but also increased their dividends annually for at least 25 years. Names on this list tend to be in the consumer and industrial sectors, according to SureDividend . Many are companies that provide products that you may use on a daily basis, such as Coca-Cola , PepsiCo , Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson . By way of comparison, those stocks currently pay dividend yields of 2.89%, 3.99%, 2.91% and 2.76%, respectively. Other well-known companies, such as Target and Hormel Foods , pay significantly higher dividends of 5.03% and 5.24%, respectively.\nThe Bottom Line Building a portfolio involves more than just picking stocks by their dividend yield. You have to consider the overall balance of your portfolio in terms of growth and income, and risk and reward. For most investors, simply picking the stocks on this list and owning them all isn’t a sound strategy.\nPure dividend investors, for example, will likely prefer companies like Target, PepsiCo or Procter & Gamble, which offer slow growth but high dividends. But others may prefer companies like Apple and Microsoft, which focus on higher growth but still pay dividends that are likely to grow over time. Either way, this list should serve as a starting point for your research, not a sample portfolio.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nNearly 1 in 3 Americans Hit by a Costly Holiday Scam, Norton Survey Shows -- How To Avoid This\nHere's What the Average Social Security Payment Will Be in Winter 2025\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\nThe Easiest Way to Score $250 for Things You Already Do\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : 5 Stocks That Pay Out Dividends Like Apple\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\nIn 2025, OpenAI has battled the perception that it was ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek , all while the company has tried to shore up its relationship with Washington , pursued ambitious data center projects, and laid the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.\n\nOpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays In a series of posts on X , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote.\n\nMarch 2025 OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.\n\nOpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images . The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.\n\nOpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said .\n\nOpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.\n\nOpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported , citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.\n\nChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.\n\nOpenAI announces leadership updates Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products , according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.\n\nOpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels . The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch .\n\nOpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information . One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\n\nOpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”\n\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs : a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1 OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X , that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing . He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nOpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product . The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API , which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’ OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information . One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nChatGPT can directly edit your code The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools , including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025 . ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.\n\nFebruary 2025 OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X , Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’ OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nJanuary 2025 OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”\nChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders . For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’ OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.\n\nFAQs: What is ChatGPT?

      "Content": "CDW Price Target Reduced as Morgan Stanley Analyst Turns More Selective on IT Hardware Exposure\n\nVardah Gill\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: CDW\n\nAAPL\n\nDELL\n\nCDW Corporation (NASDAQ: CDW ) is included among the 13 Top Tech Stocks Paying Consistent Dividends .\nPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on Unsplash\nOn December 17, Morgan Stanley cut its price target on CDW Corporation (NASDAQ:CDW) to $177 from $191. The firm kept its Overweight rating. In its year-ahead view on IT hardware, Morgan Stanley said it prefers companies tied to cloud spending, product refresh cycles like Apple, and businesses with more differentiated assets. It is steering away from names with heavy memory exposure, including Dell and HP. The analyst stated that the firm is becoming more cautious regarding memory-linked stocks overall.\n\nCDW Corporation’s (NASDAQ:CDW) third-quarter results demonstrated why the company continues to stand out. The business generated $5.7 billion in net sales, up 4% from last year. Gross profit climbed 5% to $1.3 billion. That kind of steady growth tends to matter more in a mixed IT spending environment.\nManagement pointed to strengths across several areas. Government and education customers benefited from CDW’s deep experience in those markets. Small business was a bright spot, delivering double-digit growth in both revenue and gross profit. Demand for AI workstations among smaller firms picked up during the quarter. The corporate segment also held up well. Revenue rose at a mid-single-digit pace, while gross profit grew in the low single digits. Security and cloud projects led the way.\n\nLooking ahead, management reaffirmed its 2025 outlook. CDW Corporation (NASDAQ:CDW) expects the US IT market to grow in the low single digits and believes it can outperform by 200 to 300 basis points. Gross profit in the second half of the year is still expected to be slightly higher than the first half, though the split should be less balanced than the historical 48% and 52% pattern. Gross margins in 2025 are expected to stay roughly in line with 2024.\nCDW Corporation (NASDAQ:CDW) is an American multi-brand provider of IT products and services. It serves customers across business, government, education, and healthcare.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CDW as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

So I just think it's a lack of sellers. I I'm not nearly as bullish as as you are going into January, but for now, I just think it's a lack of sellers.\n00:32 Brian\nUh why not? What gives you pause, Tom?\n00:37 Tom\nUh just price. I mean, if you're, you know, I'm I'm a pretty, I've been a pretty active trader for a long time and price is kind of everything. I don't really think about anything, you know, beyond price. and sometimes you get to the point where you're like, hey, it it just becomes a pot odds play, Brian. Where is there more risk? Is there more risk to staying long or is there a better payout being short? That's all it is.\n01:04 Brian\nIs there underneath the surface of let's say Nvidia, Tom and some of those well-known uh AI plays? Are there other areas of the market in in AI that are that are breaking down that that are red flags to you?\n01:15 Tom\nNo, not yet. I mean, I mean the the small caps, the small cap AI stocks are trailing a little bit, but not really and there's a lot of stocks in the pipeline that, you know, also look good that might come out as IPOs in 2026. But for the most part, I think it's just, it's just the mega tech, the mega tech stocks. It's it's the it's the big, too big to fail companies. And I think in that sense, that's where the real risk is.\n01:33 Brian\nBrooke, I mentioned here at the top that uh AI is back in rally mode. I call out Nvidia, Microsoft, but if if you dig down a little deeper, it's not every one of these stocks have been rocking the past five or even 10 trading sessions.\n01:46 Brooke\nYeah, if you take a look, there are some companies that are definitely pulling back some momentum. For example, we do have Oracle moving higher today, up about 1.2%, but if you take a look over the month, it's down about 2%. Over the past six months, down about 5% as we make our way into year end. And also, in addition to that, to take a look at some of the players that did go public this year. Take for example, we have uh another one like Core Weave moving higher today up about 3.5%. On the flip side, that stock up nearly 20% year uh or rather in the past month alone as we make our way into the end of the year. I think that investors are really trying to see how exactly they could still get into this this tech rally, still find those spots that maybe have been underperformers as of late in fear that they might miss out. I think we're seeing a bit of FOMO as we make our way into the later days and the last few days of this year's trading session.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "If You Think Apple Trading For 36x Earnings Is Nuts, You Can Bet Against Them With AAPD ETF\n\nAustin Smith\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nQuick Read Apple trades at 36x earnings but underperformed the S&P 500 by over 2 percentage points in the past year.\nAAPD offers -1x daily inverse exposure to Apple with a 0.01% expense ratio and $18.9M in assets.\nDaily rebalancing causes AAPD returns to deviate from simple inverse performance over periods longer than one day.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nApple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) trades at 36x earnings while delivering just 10% returns over the past year. If you're skeptical that the 4t tech giant can continue this performance into 2026, the Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares ( NASDAQ:AAPD ) is an inverse ETF that provides -1x daily exposure to Apple's price movements.\nBut there are some things to consider first.\nApple's Current Valuation Metrics Apple's valuation metrics show a forward P/E of 33x and a trailing P/E of 36x, these are premium multiples for a company that hasn't had a blockbuster product in years. The company's most recent fiscal year showed earnings growth following two years of near-stagnation.\nRetail sentiment data from Reddit supports this 'richly valued' view, and our data shows bearish sentiment scores in the 32-38 range on r/wallstreetbets while r/stocks hovers around neutral.\n\nHow AAPD Works AAPD provides -1x daily inverse exposure to Apple's stock price through derivatives. The ETF carries a 0.01% expense ratio and holds $18.9 million in assets under management.\nThis infographic illustrates how the AAPD ETF provides inverse daily exposure to Apple stock, detailing its mechanics, suitable use cases for short-term bearish strategies, and a breakdown of its pros and cons for investors.\nThe ETF resets its exposure each day through daily rebalancing. Returns over periods longer than one day will deviate from a simple inverse of Apple's performance due to compounding effects. Direxion's daily fact sheet provides updated performance data showing how compounding affects returns.\n\nThe ETF's asset base of $18.9 million affects liquidity characteristics. Daily volume and bid-ask spreads widen during Apple's earnings announcements when volatility increases.\nNote that while this can help you profit if Apple shares decline, it is not the type of ETF to own for long periods and perhaps confusingly will not create the inverse returns of Apple's shares in the long run due to daily rebalancing.\nBut if you believe Apple's best days are behind it and that shares will under-perform in 2026, it's worth looking at.\n\nStory Continues\nComparison to TSLQ The Tradr 2X Short TSLA Daily ETF ( NASDAQ:TSLQ ) offers -2x leveraged inverse exposure to Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ). TSLQ holds $315 million in assets under management, providing deeper liquidity than AAPD. TSLQ carries a 1.17% expense ratio and doubled leverage, which amplifies both gains and losses while accelerating compounding effects.\n\nThe products differ in leverage structure, liquidity profile, and cost. AAPD provides unleveraged -1x inverse exposure while TSLQ provides -2x leveraged inverse exposure.\nInterest rates and equity risk premiums represent macro factors affecting inverse ETF performance, while Apple's Services growth and iPhone pricing represent company-specific factors affecting AAPD's underlying exposure.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Only Seen Twice in 153 Years: History’s Clear Warning for the Stock Market in 2026\n\nDavid Beren\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nIt should go without saying that the S&P 500 has been riding high over the last few years and has delivered one of the most impressive runs in market history. Over the past three years, the index has surged a whopping 80%, driven in part by artificial intelligence, falling interest rates, and ongoing corporate earnings growth. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolio balances have reached levels that might have seemed all but impossible to achieve a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 surged 80% over three years. This has occurred only twice before in 153 years.\nPrevious instances (1920s and 1990s) both preceded market crashes of 49% to 89%.\nThe S&P 500 forward P/E sits around 21 to 22. This is roughly 40% above historical averages.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnfortunately, any exceptional performance like this in the market comes with something of a warning label. A three-year gain of this kind of magnitude with the S&P 500 has only occurred twice in the last 153 years of stock market performance. The first, the 1920s bull market, and the late 1990s tech boom both ended in devastating fashion with the Great Depression and the dot-com bust.\nThankfully, history doesn't always guarantee repetition, but it does signal that a pattern could be forming in the sense that markets performing this well for this long could be a giant warning sign for investors. As 2026 gets closer, understanding what happened in the last two instances now just feels like understanding basic risk management.\nThe S&P 500's Ultra-Rare 3-Year Surge: What History Predicts If you look closely, the 80% gain over the last three years roughly translates to anywhere between a 21% and 27% annualized return, which is more than double the S&P 500's long-term average of approximately 10% in gains. The rarity of this occurrence cannot be overstated, considering it has only happened twice in the 153 years, with the 1927-1929 bull market rising 95% and the tech boom between 1995 and 1998 increased 85%.\n\nIf you're seeing giant warning signs today, it's because you know that what is taking place in the market today, performance-wise, is eerily familiar to what has happened before. In the 1920s, you had a market that boomed because of cars becoming more readily available, on top of electrification taking place across cities and non-cities alike. It was the promise of a new era, and the 1990s boom was driven by something similar, as the internet was being heralded as something that was going to transform everything we knew about technology, communication, and just about everything in between.\n\nStory Continues\nThe 80% surge between 2023 and 2025 is following the same pattern, and this is what is causing warning bells to go off. Unsurprisingly, AI is being heralded as the transforming technology, and valuations have expanded significantly as a result. This all feels very much like 1999, and AI is being labeled as the kind of technology that will change everything, just as the internet was heralded as something transforming, and electricity absolutely did transform everything. This all comes together with a clear message in that when the stock market delivers this kind of three-year performance, it precedes major reversals.\n\nAnalyzing the Historical Precedents for 2026 During the 1927 to 1929 surge, the market continued to climb well into September before it all came crashing down in October. The initial 48% decline happened between October and November, but the real impact was felt from the end of 1929 all the way toward the end of 1932, when the total market collapse took place, dropping the market by around 89% in total. Crazily enough, it would take 25 years before the market would return to its 1929 highs.\n\nFast forward to the 1995-1998 surge, the market continued to climb higher and higher through 1999 before it peaked in March 2020. The rest, as they say, is well-known history, as the dot com crash erased 49% of the S&P 500's value in just 2.5 years. The Nasdaq fell 78% and its overall recovery would take another seven years before returning to its starting levels.\nThe takeaway here is that there is a consistent pattern that was followed in both of these cases, in that the market didn't crash immediately after a three-year surge. The market rally actually, and surprisingly, as you look back, continued for an extra year, delivering even more gains before a severe decline. In 2026, the cautionary tale is that history suggests either the market delivers this year as one full of gains or one that shows indicators of a reversal. Suffice it to say, neither scenario paints a pretty picture, as even if investors get one more year of gains, the crash starts and wipes all the gains out.\n\nIs an AI Bubble Forming? The Biggest Risk Heading into 2026 If you have been watching the current level of AI enthusiasm, and who hasn't been, the parallels between today and previous tech bubbles are almost impossible to ignore. We are already seeing just how transformative AI can be, something that echoes what the country saw during the electrification of the 1920s and the internet in the 1990s. Sadly, real technology, no matter how transformative, doesn't always prevent bubbles. If anything, it actually enables a bubble to take place by trying to justify massive corporate valuations.\n\nThe biggest takeaway right now is that the signs of a bubble transformation are present, and they are present across multiple indicators. Valuations for AI-centric stocks are assuming nearly flawless execution and sustained growth continuing for years into the future. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) are all investing billions, tens of billions into AI infrastructure without a clear signal of what the return could be. As a result, the S&P 500's forward P/E is sitting around 21 to 22, approximately 40% above historical averages.\nIf you are a retail investor, and many of us are, this is something to be very aware of, as is options trading, which has seen its volume surge in AI stocks. Reddit, in particular, has come alive with discussion, especially on places like r/WallStreetBets, in a way that feels almost too familiar if you were on message boards during the dot-com era in 1999. On top of social media conversation, you also have companies adding \"AI\" anywhere they can in their core descriptions or even their company names to try and boost valuations. This closely mirrors when companies added \".com\" to their company names in the late 1990s to try to jump on a similar trend.\n\nThe bottom line is that any catalyst for a stock reversal could come from slower-than-anticipated AI adoption or even disappointing returns from AI investments. Add to all of these concerns over an economic slowdown resulting from tariffs, or even inflationary concerns, depending on how the Fed handles interest rates. This all comes together in what could be a perfect storm for either a massive buying shift or a major selling rally, and any instance of the latter is going to feed on itself as panic selling grabs hold until the bottom falls out.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Warren Buffett Departs With 64% of Berkshire Hathaway in 5 Stocks to Hold Forever\n\nLee Jackson\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:15 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nCVX\n\nMNST\n\nBRK-B\n\nKO\n\nIf any investor has stood the test of time, it is Warren Buffett, and with good reason. For years, the “Oracle of Omaha” has had a rock star-like presence in the investing world, and his annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( NYSE: BRK-B ) shareholders meeting draws thousands of loyal investors. They were stunned at this year's meeting when Buffett announced he would step down as CEO of the investment giant at year's end. While he will remain board chair and continue to have a voice in the day-to-day operations, his pre-announced successor, Greg Abel, will assume the CEO position at the end of the year.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( NYSE: BRK-B ) is up a solid 11.3% in 2025, but it trails the S&P 500’s 15.1% gain.\nSome across Wall Street have said that Berkshire Hathaway should start paying a dividend.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nLong-time investors and Buffett mavens know that he favors holding S&P 500 stocks forever. So it’s not surprising to report that, for all the success and stature Berkshire Hathaway has in the investment world, five top companies make up almost 64% of the fund's total holdings. While much more concentrated than most portfolio managers would ever consider, the strategy has worked for Berkshire Hathaway investors for years. It is likely to continue doing so in the future. The question many would ask, given his impending departure, is which stocks are likely to remain in the portfolio in the long term? We screened the portfolio, and these longtime stalwarts, which all pay dividends and make up the bulk of the portfolio, are likely to stay at the dance for decades to come.\n\nWhy do we cover Warren Buffett's stocks? There are few investors with the results and reputation that Buffett has garnered over the past 50 years. While investing has evolved over the past half-century, buying good companies with products and services recognized worldwide and paying dividends will always remain a timeless approach. There is also a good chance that Greg Abel will retain all of these gigantic positions.\n\nAmerican Express American Express Co.

      "Content": "Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Expensive For A Reason? A Look At Its Intrinsic Value\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nKey Insights Apple's estimated fair value is US$224 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nApple is estimated to be 22% overvalued based on current share price of US$274\nAnalyst price target for AAPL is US$288, which is 29% above our fair value estimate\nDoes the December share price for Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model .\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation? We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast 2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\nUS$128.7b\nUS$138.8b\nUS$158.3b\nUS$171.7b\nUS$184.1b\nUS$194.1b\nUS$203.4b\nUS$212.3b\nUS$220.8b\nUS$229.2b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x14\nAnalyst x7\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 5.46%\nEst @ 4.80%\nEst @ 4.34%\nEst @ 4.02%\nEst @ 3.79%\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3%\nUS$118.9k\nUS$118.4k\nUS$124.7k\nUS$124.9k\nUS$123.7k\nUS$120.5k\nUS$116.6k\nUS$112.4k\nUS$108.0k\nUS$103.5k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.2t\n\nStory Continues\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 3.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV) = FCF 2035 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$229b× (1 + 3.3%) ÷ (8.3%– 3.3%) = US$4.7t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV) = TV / (1 + r) 10 = US$4.7t÷ ( 1 + 8.3%) 10 = US$2.1t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.3t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$274, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nThe Assumptions We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.085. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple\nSWOT Analysis for Apple Strength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\nWeakness\nEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Tech industry.\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nLooking Ahead: Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

      "Content": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Apple Inc's Intrinsic Value\n\nGuruFocus News\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Apple Inc's ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2025-12-22, Apple Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $169.17. It's currently trading at a price of $273.67. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -61.77%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Apple Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$7.47\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 15.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n92.15\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n77.02\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n169.17\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $125.32. This valuation indicates that the Apple Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -118.38%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: Berkshire Hathaway Will Stop Selling Apple Stock in 2026\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 12:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Apple went into the holiday quarter with improving revenue momentum.\nHighlighting Berkshire's confidence in Apple, the tech stock is still Berkshire's biggest holding.\nBerkshire's upcoming CEO handoff to Greg Abel could lead to a shift in strategies for the equity portfolio.\n10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) has spent the past two years trimming its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- a move that caught many investors off guard. That trend becomes even more interesting heading into 2026, when Warren Buffett is scheduled to hand the chief executive role to Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel.\nNotably, the selling doesn't necessarily mean Berkshire has soured on Apple's business. The cuts to the conglomerate's massive position in the iPhone are more likely a way to manage an oversized position. Further, Apple has been giving investors reasons to be upbeat; its latest guidance points to stronger growth during the holiday quarter.\nWhy should investors care? Apple remains Berkshire's biggest listed stock holding, and Abel will inherit a company that already has enormous financial flexibility. If Abel's looking for ways to deploy capital at Berkshire's scale, continuing to sell down a high-quality holding may not make sense now that the position has already been right-sized.\nUnderstanding Berkshire's Apple position Berkshire Hathaway reported owning 238.2 million shares of Apple as of Sept. 30. That was down from 280.0 million shares three months earlier.\nAt Berkshire's latest reported share count for its Apple position, and based on the value of Apple stock today, Berkshire's position in the iPhone maker is currently worth more than $65 billion. This is ahead of its second-largest holding, American Express , which is valued at about $57 billion. In addition, it represents about 20% of Berkshire's total equity portfolio.\n\nShowing just how big Berkshire's position in Apple stock is, it's even significant as a percent of the conglomerate's total market capitalization . With a market capitalization of about $1.07 trillion as of this writing, Apple stock represents about 6% of Berkshire's total market value.\nEmbracing tech stocks With Apple still sitting at the top of Berkshire's stock portfolio, it's difficult to believe managers at Berkshire are bearish on the tech company. A more practical reason for recent selling is concentration risk after years of compounding.\n\nSure, it wouldn't be surprising to see Berkshire sell more Apple shares in the fourth quarter of 2025, getting the position to an even 20% position (as a percent of Berkshire's total equity holdings) or slightly below it for the sake of risk management. But any selling beyond this level may be unlikely.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd Berkshire hardly looks like a business desperate for more liquidity. In its latest quarterly report, Berkshire said its insurance and other businesses held $354.3 billion in cash and U.S. Treasury bills. That kind of dry powder gives Abel flexibility, but it also creates pressure to find places to deploy capital that can still move the needle.\n\nWith this backdrop (a ton of cash and a need to deploy some of it productively), Abel may choose to hold onto whatever remaining shares Buffett leaves Berkshire with when he steps down at the end of the year.\nFurther, under new and younger management, Berkshire may be more prone to owning a higher percentage of tech stocks. In fact, Berkshire recently revealed a new stake in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . This position is now valued at more than $4 billion, putting it in Berkshire's top 10 holdings.\nApple's business is improving Perhaps the biggest reason Berkshire may opt to stop selling Apple stock next year is the Cupertino-based company's improving business.\nApple's most recent earnings report showed steady momentum before the company's biggest seasonal quarter. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 rose 8% year over year to $102.5 billion.\n\nAnd management expects that growth rate to accelerate during the important holiday quarter. Apple chief financial officer Kevan Parekh said in the company's most recent earnings call that it expects revenue during the period to grow 10% to 12% year over year.\nThat outlook is also consistent with Apple CEO Tim Cook's recent comments on demand.\n\n\"At the aggregate level, we are thrilled with how iPhone has been received, and that's the reason that we're expecting double-digit growth in the current quarter,\" Cook said during the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call.\nNone of this, of course, guarantees Berkshire will stop selling. But I think, under Abel's leadership, there's a good chance it will.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

At the time, it was the most valuable business in the world. What's impressive is that even coming off a massive starting base, this company has continued to grow. It now sports a market cap of more than $4 trillion (as of Dec. 20).\nThis means that long-term shareholders have benefited. If you'd invested $1,000 in this consumer discretionary stock 10 years ago, here's how much you'd have today.\nApple has been crushing the market A $1,000 starting sum to buy Apple shares in December 2015 would be worth $11,450 right now. This translates to a total return of 1,040%. That gain includes the dividend, which is a small payout today at $0.26 per quarter. However, the dividend has increased by 100% in the past 10 years.\nThe S&P 500 's total return during the same time period of 305% comes up well short of Apple's.\n\nFinancial results and valuation drive the stock Between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 27), Apple's revenue soared 78%, as it sold more of its popular hardware devices and saw its services segment grow rapidly. Net income rose 110% over that time. But valuation expansion was the biggest tailwind for the stock.\nLooking out at the next decade, Apple's more muted growth prospects mean that investors shouldn't expect past returns to repeat.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?

Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

The company currently appears to be working on its next significant hardware development, with anticipation centered on a foldable iPhone set to emerge in the fall of 2026.\n\nMing-Chi Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, projects that shipments would only reach 3 million to 5 million units in 2026 before rapidly increasing to 20 million in 2027.\nMore News from Barchart Did Nvidia Just Lose Its Spot as Wall Street’s AI Chip Darling?

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nThe device's anticipated ultra-thin glass does increase execution risk because it is extremely prone to cracks and costs two to four times as much as regular glass, which puts pressure on margins despite premium pricing. Retail prices could exceed $2,000.\nHowever, if quality meets expectations, Apple's loyal customer base could continue to spur replacement demand. The book-style design might have a 7.8-inch internal display, a 5.5-inch exterior panel, Touch ID, dual lenses, and a stainless steel-titanium hinge.\nAmid this development, analysts are increasingly focused on Apple's foldable ambitions, making investors wonder if buying Apple's shares ahead of its next major product cycle makes strategic sense.\nAbout Apple Stock Headquartered in Cupertino, California, Apple designs and sells smartphones, computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories alongside a broad services portfolio. Its ecosystem spans iPhone, Mac, iPad, proprietary operating systems, digital content, cloud, payments, and subscription platforms.\nWith a market cap of $4 trillion, Apple continues to enjoy considerable confidence among investors. Its stock has gained 9.56% over the past 52 weeks, driven by a strong 39.2% rally in the last six months.\nMoreover, over the most recent three-month period, the company’s shares rose 11.47%, decisively outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index’s ($IUXX) 2.3% gain.\nMoreover, valuation metrics indicate that AAPL stock trades at 33.55 times forward adjusted earnings and 8.92 times forward sales, reflecting a clear premium to industry averages and signaling market expectations for sustained growth, strong margins, and durable competitive advantages.\n\nStory Continues\nAlso, Apple returns capital through dividends, maintaining a 12-year payout streak. The company pays $1.04 annually, yielding 0.38%, with the most recent $0.26 dividend distributed on Nov. 13 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 10.\nApple Surpasses Q4 Earnings On Oct. 30, Apple reported its Q4 2025 financial results, delivering another solid performance that exceeded expectations. Revenue rose 7.9% year-over-year (YOY) to $102.5 billion, topping Street forecasts of $101.2 billion, while EPS increased 90.7% from the previous year’s quarter to $1.85, ahead of the $1.73 consensus estimate.\n\nMarkets responded positively to the quarter, with management citing solid demand for both hardware and services. The successful rollout of the iPhone 17 lineup, resilient MacBook Air sales, and sustained momentum in services collectively contributed to performance.\nThe iPhone once again anchored growth. During the September quarter, iPhone revenue reached a record $49 billion, reflecting a 6% YOY increase. Strong uptake of the iPhone 16 and 17 models pushed Apple’s active installed base to an all-time high, reinforcing long-term monetization potential through upgrades, services, and ecosystem stickiness.\nAdditionally, Apple's Mac division generated significant gains. Revenue climbed 13% YOY to $8.7 billion, supported primarily by robust demand for the MacBook Air. At the same time, Services continued to emerge as a critical growth catalyst, generating a record $28.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up 15% YOY, with double-digit growth across both developed and emerging markets.\n\nLooking ahead, management has guided for a record December quarter, projecting 10% to 12% YOY revenue growth. Expectations rest on double-digit iPhone growth, continued services strength, expanded AI capabilities, and sustained R&D investment.\nAnalysts echo the confidence, forecasting fiscal 2026 Q1 EPS rising 10.4% YOY to $2.65. They forecast a full-year fiscal 2026 bottom line growing 8.7% to $8.11, followed by a further 12.5% rise to $9.12 in fiscal year 2027, supporting a durable long-term growth narrative.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Apple Stock? Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring recently lifted his price target on AAPL stock to $315 from $305 and reiterated a “Buy” rating, identifying the company as one of his preferred IT hardware stocks heading into 2026.\nThe optimism aligns closely with broader Wall Street sentiment. AAPL currently carries a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating. Among the 40 analysts covering the stock, 21 rate it “Strong Buy,” three assign “Moderate Buy,” 14 recommend “Hold,” while only one suggests “Moderate Sell” and one recommends “Strong Sell.”\nThe stock’s average price target of $290.85 represents potential upside of 6.3%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $350 implies potential gain of 27.9% from current levels, reflecting more bullish assumptions around Apple’s next growth cycle.\nOn the date of publication, Aanchal Sugandh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Intel stock soared in 2025. But the chipmaker still has a long road ahead.\n\nLaura Bratton\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBY\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nFor Intel ( INTC ), 2025 was an eventful year, but not one that necessarily changed its narrative .\nThe storied American chipmaker got a new CEO and won massive investments from the US government , Nvidia ( NVDA ), and SoftBank ( SFTBY ). Those developments helped push the stock up 86% for the year, ahead of gains for the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks and Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). At the same time, Intel's crucial manufacturing segment still lacks a major external customer — something it needs to make the cash-bleeding business viable.\n\n\"Intel's exiting the year with some optimism that they will be a relevant chip manufacturer in the US at some point in time ... and that was definitely an uncertain statement at the start of the year,\" MorningStar analyst Brian Colello told Yahoo Finance.\nAt the same time, he noted, \"There wasn't the massive sort of deal that really establishes Intel, either, in manufacturing.\"\n\nThe company's technology is largely responsible for the digital revolution and Silicon Valley's reputation as a global innovation hub: Intel invented the world's first microprocessors, or computer chips, and the x86 architecture, a critical blueprint for designing computer chips. Its co-founder Gordon Moore created Moore's Law, a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. The company has continued to make its own computer chips, even as the rest of the industry has gone \"fabless\" — outsourcing manufacturing to firms like Taiwan's TSMC ( TSM ).\n\nBut years of missteps and poor investment decisions put Intel's manufacturing segment behind TSMC, which in turn caused its products to lose their edge to competitors. As its chips — CPUs for servers, laptops, and desktops — have lost market share to rivals AMD and Arm ( ARM ), its manufacturing business has been stripped of the scale it needs to remain viable.\nFour years of an aggressive turnaround effort by former CEO Pat Gelsinger to revive Intel's manufacturing arm by opening it to outside customers sent investors fleeing. The massive amount of spending required to reboot the foundry, along with its uncertain success, spooked Wall Street.\nThe arrival of Lip-Bu Tan , who was named chief executive in March following the board's ousting of Gelsinger in late 2024, began to renew faith in the company's potential turnaround. While Intel's strategy remains mostly unchanged under Tan, analysts explained, investors have applauded his sober tone, cost-cutting measures, and wide-ranging industry connections.\n\nStory Continues\nThat tepid faith transformed into confidence when the US government made a rare $9 billion investment in the company — albeit funds Intel was supposed to get anyway from the Biden-era CHIPS Act — following Tan's tiff with President Trump over the CEO's business ties to China.\nOnshoring semiconductor manufacturing has been a focus of the US government since the pandemic highlighted the risk of a tech supply chain reliant on Taiwan. Escalating tensions with China, including the threat of a Taiwan invasion, have further intensified the sense of urgency.\n\n\"Semiconductors are not only economically important, they're actually important from a national security perspective,\" Technalysis analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \"Intel has by far the largest infrastructure in place as a true, real American company.\"\nMany critics believe the broader US turn toward state capitalism under Trump, exemplified by the Intel investment, raises questions about national security and the government's conflicting interests. But analysts say the US government's 10% stake in Intel could lead to various positive outcomes for the company, such as Intel having a say in trade policy that affects semiconductors. More importantly, the US could step in to incentivize or force a major company like Apple to use the chipmaker's foundry.\n\nA $2 billion investment from SoftBank and $5 billion from Nvidia further boosted investor sentiment on Intel stock. The cash infusion helped stem the company's steep losses as it figures out a path forward. Notably, though, the Nvidia deal didn't include an agreement for Intel's foundry business to manufacture the AI giant's chips.\n'Everything hinges on 14A' Intel's biggest potential customers for its foundry business — Nvidia, Apple ( AAPL ), and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) — are also, to some degree, competitors of its products arm and have longstanding relationships with TSMC. Not to mention, TSMC is building $165 billion worth of manufacturing capacity in the US, diminishing the geopolitical argument for those companies to use Intel to produce their chips.\nTo win those customers, Intel will need to prove that its latest generation manufacturing processes are up to snuff. The chipmaker's 18A process, a massive technological feat initially marketed to outside customers, is now being used primarily to make Intel's own products. Whether those products — Intel's upcoming Panther Lake chips for PCs and Clearwater Forest chips for data centers — succeed could help convince companies to use its next-generation processes called 18AP and 14A, analysts said.\n\nAlready, rumors have circulated that Apple could use Intel's manufacturing, specifically its 18AP process, for its lowest-end computer chips.\nIntel has 12 to 18 months to secure a big external customer for 14A in order for that process to continue as planned, BNB Paribas analyst David O'Connor estimated.\nHe called the process \"the crux of Intel being successful on the foundry business or not, or potentially even exiting manufacturing long term.\"\n\"Everything hinges on 14A and the success of that,\" O'Connor said.\nOther analysts gave longer timelines for when Intel would see a turnaround.\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said, \"It took 10 years to break it. Why would it take less than 10 years to fix it?\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Bluesky @laurabratton.bsky.social.

      "Content": "Why Warren Buffett Just Sold 15% of His Apple Stake and Is Putting Money Here Instead\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:51 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Apple still accounts for nearly 21% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio.\nBerkshire Hathaway finished the third quarter with over $320 billion in Treasury bills.\nBerkshire Hathaway is currently sitting on a record-breaking cash pile.\n10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\nAt the end of this year, Warren Buffett is finally retiring after leading Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) for more than six decades. In that time, Berkshire Hathaway has been one of the stock market's best-performing stocks, and its moves have attracted much investor interest, hoping to mimic its success in some sense.\n\nIn the third quarter, Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway made some notable moves that leave the next wave of leadership with a record-breaking cash pile of over $380 billion. We can't fully predict Berkshire Hathaway's direction post-Buffett, but its incoming CEO, Greg Abel, will have plenty of resources at his disposal.\nTrimming its largest holding For the past couple of years, Berkshire Hathaway has sold considerably more shares than it has bought. In the third quarter, it trimmed its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) by around 15%. The iPhone maker is still Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, accounting for 20.9% of its stock portfolio (just over 238 million shares), but it's a much smaller stake than it has historically been.\n\nThere are two key reasons why Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett made these moves. First, the company likely wants to take profits from its Apple stake while corporate tax rates are in its favor. There's no guarantee that corporate tax rates will change, but if they do, it's unlikely to be in corporations' favor.\nSecond, Apple's stock has become fairly expensive compared to its expected earnings growth. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 34, the third-highest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Berkshire Hathaway likely thinks the profit from Apple is better put elsewhere.\nWhere Berkshire Hathaway is putting money instead The main place Berkshire Hathaway has been putting its money is in U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills), which are short-term government debt backed by the U.S. Treasury. At the end of the third quarter, Berkshire Hathaway held around $305 billion in T-bills. That means it purchased around $19 billion of them during the quarter.\nWith seemingly limited big-buck investment opportunities right now, stashing cash in T-bills makes sense because it allows Berkshire Hathaway to earn guaranteed income without taking on any risks. Right now, T-bills are paying out around 3.66%, meaning $305 billion worth would pay out around $11 billion annually. That's pure profit with virtually no effort required.\n\nStory Continues\nSince the cash isn't locked into longer-term T-bills, Berkshire Hathaway has plenty of liquidity and can access its cash fairly quickly if an opportunity were to become available.\nShould you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory Continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:25 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) innovations have been lackluster, but its ecosystem is as powerful as ever.\nAmazon is driving tremendous growth in its AWS cloud division thanks to strong AI demand.\nValuation should always play a part in proper investment analysis.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nWhen looking at stocks to buy, investor attention might go to the most dominant and well-known businesses out there. This will naturally lead to technology companies that have strong market positions, popular products and services, and perhaps a presence in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) come to mind. Over the long term, they have both been fantastic stocks to own, doing a great job compounding shareholder capital. And today, they command multitrillion-dollar market caps .\nBoth businesses have their own investment merits. But which is the best stock to buy right now?\nApple is moving slowly with AI, but the moat couldn't be wider The biggest knock on Apple in recent years has been its unhurried approach to AI. Major tech enterprises across the board are moving incredibly fast at building out the necessary infrastructure and software capabilities to position themselves to become leaders in the AI market.\nApple, in typical fashion, started out being cautious, as its usual strategy isn't to be first, but to be the best. However, the Apple Intelligence features on its smartphones aren't turning any heads. And an upgraded Siri launch has been delayed until next year.\n\nThat still doesn't take away from Apple's wide economic moat. The company's competitive position is supported by its strong brand, with Apple arguably being the most recognizable business on Earth. The brand resonates with consumers across the globe, thanks to the company's beautifully designed hardware and software offerings, superior user experience, and premium positioning. The elevated retail experience also has an impact.\nThe moat is also helped by Apple's powerful ecosystem . This combination of products and services is what makes the business truly one-of-a-kind. Customers are essentially locked in, with Apple being able to generate profits on its hardware devices, while also raking in high-margin revenue on its fast-growing services segment.\nThere are very few companies as financially sound as Apple. Its net profit margin has averaged 25.5% in the past five years. It collects massive amounts of free cash flow . And the balance sheet is clean, with $34 billion of net cash on the books (as of Sept. 27). This reduces risk for investors.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon has multiple growth drivers that will push it forward Amazon, on the other hand, is already atop the AI race. It's planning to spend a whopping $125 billion on capital expenditures this year to bolster its technical infrastructure. That's an easy capital allocation decision for the leadership team to make, as they are seeing robust demand from customers for AI-related products and services.\n\nThis shows up in Amazon Web Services (AWS), whose revenue shot up 20% year over year in Q3. This booming segment is also very profitable, bringing in trailing-12-month operating income of $43.8 billion.\nBesides cloud computing, which itself is poised to be a $2.4 trillion market worldwide in 2030, Amazon dominates online shopping. Nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce activity happens on its marketplace, giving it an advantageous position as buyer behavior keeps moving to digital channels.\nInvestors might not realize that Amazon reported $17.7 billion in digital ad sales in the third quarter, a major growth engine that is likely also producing high margins. Amazon also has a presence in streaming entertainment, autonomous driving, and healthcare.\n\nI believe Amazon is in a better position to increase its revenue and earnings power at a faster rate than Apple, thanks to those secular trends working in its favor. Valuation matters as well. Amazon stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 32.1 is below Apple's multiple of 36.6, given the former the upper hand.\nWith a time horizon looking out over the next five or 10 years, I view Amazon as the best stock to buy right now.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "OpenAI vs. Apple? Sam Altman is setting his sights on winning what could be an even higher-stakes AI battle\n\nAlyson Shontell\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 10:25 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAll eyes are on the Big Tech LLM race and, at least in the eyes of investors , it seems like Google (owned by Alphabet , No. 7) could run away with the win.\nGoogle’s Gemini has been steadily stealing buzz and AI traffic share over the last few months from OpenAI. And if there was any moat to be had in LLMs, it would seem like it would belong to the company with the biggest treasure chest of personal data on users. That almost indisputably would be Google, thanks to Android, YouTube , Search history, Maps, and Gmail. On top of that, the company has one of the top AI minds, Demis Hassabis, and Google cofounder Sergey Brin leading its troops toward dominance.\n\nPerhaps that’s why Sam Altman is setting his sights on winning what could be an even higher-stakes AI battle: creating the future mass AI consumer device. Altman feels that in the long term, his greatest foe will be Apple (No. 4), not Google, Meta (No. 22), or Amazon (No. 2). He recruited iPhone designer Jony Ive to OpenAI this May, and Ive has said the company’s secret device could be ready in the next two years.\nWhat will that device be like? If you ask Altman, he describes limitations with the mobile phone. First of all, it can be turned off. It also can’t scan the room around you and give you real-time context and know exactly when to deliver relevant information to you. He sounds more bullish about audio than visual as the primary means of communication. And he sees no reason why a device and an operating system should be sold separately, like Google and Android—a future device should come with the trademark LLM baked in, like iOS in an iPhone.\n\nThanks largely to that iPhone, Apple is generating tens of billions of dollars a year in cash flow that it can plow into new devices and armies of engineers to design them—two areas where OpenAI lags far behind. Then again, Apple seems ripe to be disrupted: As Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said on Joe Rogan’s podcast earlier this year, “They haven’t invented anything great in a while. It’s like Steve Jobs invented the iPhone, and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later.”\nBut for now, OpenAI and its team are all about perfecting ChatGPT.

Considering this factor, Citi said it was raising its earnings estimates for the company.\n\nEarlier in the month, on December 5, CLSA also hiked its price target on Apple Inc.

      "Content": "Apple’s 3 biggest wins and 3 greatest failures of 2025\n\nMichael Grothaus\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nThe tech industry has endured another turbulent year, buffeted by the continued rise of artificial intelligence and the economic threats posed by President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Even the most prominent companies encountered challenges they never imagined they’d have to face. As 2025 comes to a close, here are Apple&#8217;s biggest wins and greatest failures of the year.\n\nMost Read from Fast Company\n\nThis $27 homebuilder says the Feds are cooking up something big to ‘address’ housing market affordability\nSequoia’s Shaun Maguire accused an innocent Palestinian of being the Brown shooter. Then he doubled down\nYes, the Trump administration is likely to buy more equity in more private companies in 2026\nApple’s biggest wins of 2025 iPhone 17 series\nWithout a doubt, Apple’s biggest win of 2025 is the iPhone 17 series , which includes the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. Myriad reports suggest that iPhone 17 series sales have exceeded both Apple’s and investors’ expectations.\nApple redesigned the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro this year, giving the former a much-improved display, a vastly better camera system, and longer battery life. The Pro versions got an all-new unibody design, the best cameras in an iPhone ever, and up to 39 hours of battery life.\n\nWhile these improvements are mainly iterative, they ticked the boxes that consumers care most about in their phones: camera and battery life. And those consumers have rewarded Apple for it. iPhone 17 sales have surged in the U.S. and, more importantly, in China , the world’s largest smartphone market after the USA. Apple’s iPhone sales were a key factor in the recovery of the company&#8217;s stock, after it got hammered earlier this year due to its possible exposure to Trump’s tariffs.\nLiquid Glass\nAfter the iPhone, Apple’s next most important product is iOS, the operating system that powers its handsets. This year, Apple made the rare move of completely revamping the look of that operating system with the introduction of the Liquid Glass design language in iOS 26. It was the first time the company had radically changed iOS&#8217;s look since 2013.\n\nWhile iOS 26’s Liquid Glass faced early criticism , as most visual overhauls do, Apple has continued to tweak the look and feel of the new design language. As a result, much of the online furor over the changes seems to have died down. More importantly, iOS 26&#8217;s new design gives Apple’s smartphone software a distinct look that immediately distinguishes it from Android. In the end, the software’s ability to mimic the way light bands and warps through glass has brought a level of fun and playfulness to Apple’s flagship product not seen since the days of Steve Jobs.\n\nStory Continues\nApple’s simplified branding\nThe final big win for Apple in 2025 is not a product or feature, but a branding strategy. As Apple’s product lineup has grown in recent years, its product names have become confusing, particularly when it comes to software and services. But this year, Apple decided to simplify things .\n\nPreviously, Apple&#8217;s operating systems were branded with different version numbers (iOS 18, macOS 15, watchOS 11, etc). Now they&#8217;re named after the upcoming year: iOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, iPadOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26. This streamlined naming structure makes it easy for users to determine whether their device is running the latest software.\nAnd Apple didn’t stop there. The company also mercifully decided to drop the overused plus sign from its streaming service’s name, too.\nApple’s greatest failures of 2025 iPhone Air\nWhile the iPhone 17 series may have been full of iterative updates this year (which consumers seem to have loved), Apple swung for the fences with another 2025 iPhone: the all-new iPhone Air. At just 5.6 millimeters, it is Apple&#8217;s thinnest iPhone ever. Yet multiple reports say that there has been hardly any demand for the company’s newest smartphone.\n\nThe main problems with the iPhone Air seem to be its subpar camera system and relatively short battery life. As the success of the iPhone 17 series teaches us, those are the two things customers care about most. Demand for the new device is so weak that Apple has reportedly cut production by more than 80%. Still, Apple may have already gotten what it really wanted: proof of concept that it could make an iPhone so thin that it could join two together to create the first dual-screen iPhone foldable .\nApple Intelligence\n2025 may have been a year of continued artificial intelligence progression across the tech industry, but Apple’s AI system, Apple Intelligence, hardly added any new AI features—not worthwhile ones, anyway. The company added some useful Live Translation features, but other than that, it mainly just enhanced Apple Intelligence with gimmicks that other AI systems have long been capable of, such as on-screen image recognition and new AI slop filters.\n\nThose hoping to see a revamped Siri that could compete with the likes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini will have to wait until 2026—or later. Yet I question how much consumers care about Apple lagging in the AI space, given that they can already run nearly any third-party AI app on their iPhone. Still, the lack of innovative AI advancements is a bad look for the company, which is otherwise the de facto innovation leader in the industry.\nApple Vision Pro M5\nOne area in which Apple has undoubtedly innovated in recent years is augmented reality, thanks to its groundbreaking Apple Vision Pro headset. In 2025, Apple announced the successor to the original Vision Pro, updated with the M5 Apple Silicon chip, which enables higher resolution and other display enhancements.\nYet Apple didn’t address the myriad other issues with the technologically impressive device, notably its heavy weight and eye-watering $3,499 price point. Because of this, the headset remains a niche product that is unappealing or financially out of reach to the average user.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.com\nSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "5 predictions for tech and AI in 2026 from mega-bull Dan Ives\n\nSamuel O'Brient\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:11 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nDan Ives, one of Wall Street's biggest tech bulls, released his predictions for 2026.\nHe thinks the AI revolution is just starting, and that investors shouldn't be spooked by bubble talk.\nIves sees big things coming from Tesla , Google, and Apple next year.\nDan Ives of Wedbush Securities unveiled his list of top predictions for the tech sector for 2026, and the outspoken tech bull isn't any less optimistic about what the new year holds.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he sees big things ahead for Tesla. Shares of Elon Musk's car company hit a record high this week, but Ives predicts even more gains to come.\nMore broadly, the analyst sees the AI story continuing to unfold in 2026, and urges investors to buckle in for another bullish year in the space.\n\"On one hand this is a 4th Industrial Revolution taking shape with the US leading China on tech for the first in 30 years...while on the other hand the trillions of dollars needed to reach the heights of enterprise/consumer AI Revolution have caused nervousness and doubters among investors,\" Ives said in a note on Friday.\nHere are Ives' biggest predictions for tech and AI in 2026.\nTesla rolls out robotaxis in 30 cities\nIves is as bullish as ever on Tesla and believes that the EV leader will expand its robotaxi reach in 2026.\n\"Tesla will successfully launch Robotaxis in over 30 cities in 2026 and start to scale volume production of Cybercabs,\" Ives predicts.\nThe EV maker still has its bears. Ross Gerber told Business Insider recently that he doesn't think Tesla can catch up in the self-driving car race as Waymo advances rapidly, but Ives remains steadfast in his conviction that Musk's company will win the driverless race.\nHe sees Tesla stock rising 26% in his base case and as much as 68% in his bull case.\nOracle advances in the AI data center market\nOracle has struggled recently after a lackluster earnings report that raised some questions about the strength of the AI trade. However, Ives isn't worried about the concern that the company is overspending on AI . He predicts a turnaround is coming for Oracle stock in 2026.\n\"Oracle successfully builds out its datacenter targets, starts to convert its massive RPO AI backlog and hits $250 per share in 2026 despite the dark negative sentiment on the stock today,\" he predicted.\nApple and Google will team up on AI\nTwo of the biggest names in tech are likely to team up in 2026 to help usher in the next phase of AI, according to Ives. He predicts that a joint venture between Apple and Google is coming, one that will help the iPhone maker catch up to competitors in the AI race.\n\nStory Continues\n\"Apple and Google will announce a formal AI partnership around Gemini that will finally cement a real AI strategy for Cupertino,\" Ives said. \"This will ultimately be a subscription service launched in the Apple network and lead to Apple achieving a $5 trillion market cap in 2026.\"\nNebius to be acquired\nAI infrastructure provider Nebius may be one of the next big winners of the AI arms race. The Dutch company is Ives' top pick to be acquired by a Big Tech hyperscaler in 2026. He named Microsoft , Alphabet and Amazon as likely candidates to swoop in and buy it.\nNebius stock is coming off an extremely strong 2025, with 212% year-to-date gains. Ives isn't the only pro who sees it as a likely winner. Market research firm Futurum Group named it among its picks for the top tech stocks for the next generation of AI.\nCybersecurity stocks will surge\nIves is also highly bullish on the cybersecurity industry, touting it as one of the tech market's highest performing subsectors. He named CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks as Wedbush's top picks in the space for the coming year.\nWhile Palo Alto Networks has struggled recently and is only up 2% year-to-date, CrowdStrike has spent the year trending upward with 41% gains. Cybersecurity industry experts have also flagged both stocks as likely winners set to capitalize on rising security demand.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia, Tesla dominate Dec. trading as 2025 options demand surges\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 1:48 PM PST\n\nIn this video: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nINTC\n\nCboe vice president of market intelligence Henry Schwartz joins Market Domination with Yahoo Finance Data and Markets Editor Jared Blikre to discuss the state of the options landscape.\nWatch the video above to hear Schwartz's outlook for the options market in 2026.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n2025 will be another record year for options volume, but how are retail traders gearing up for 2026 as the demand for leverage keeps surging? We're digging into all of this in today's options pit, sponsored by Tasty trade.\n00:15 Speaker A\nAnd Henry Schwartz, CBOE Vice President of Market Intelligence is here to discuss. Uh, let's talk about this surge in options demand. We were just talking offline. You said it's up what three times since uh COVID?\n00:32 Henry Schwartz\nYeah.\n00:33 Speaker A\nThat is incredible. So, what is this trend tell you?\n00:36 Henry Schwartz\nSo, I mean, this year we're going to see 15 billion option contracts trade. Uh if you go back to to just before COVID, it was about 4 billion contracts a year. So, and in fact, I've been doing the calculations. It looks like the 15 billionth contract will trade on Christmas Eve.\n00:52 Speaker A\nMhm.\n00:52 Henry Schwartz\nI think we should have a door prize or something. Let's see if we can figure out what trade.\n00:56 Speaker A\nThere might be some binary option futures betting markets that could uh take care of that.\n01:00 Henry Schwartz\nAbsolutely. Well, I mean, that that's actually kind of one of the big themes, right? As we've seen this the evolution of risk taking, betting, you know, there's a lot of different ways to discuss it. Um, you know, the the you know, COVID really or you know, that whole kind of market environment really changed the landscape for options trading. And basically, uh we saw growth of about 50% in 2020 and it has kept up and it is retail that is really driving most of that. You know, we continue to see, you know, a healthy institutional business. Uh we see, you know, we see, you know, the the big theme really for this year is kind of everything is just stronger. Across the board, no matter what asset classes you look at, if you're talking about index options like SPX or VIX. If you're talking about ETF options, which you know, we were just talking about kind of the explosion in in number of ETFs and single stock option flow, which is really, you know, primarily retail driven. And when you have a year like, you know, like we're seeing this year with, you know, basically the broad averages up, you know, between 15 and 20%, uh that just brings in more and more activity.\n02:08 Speaker A\nSo, I've been thinking about this and tell me if I'm just way offline here. But if we take it back to early late 2020, early 2021, that's when we had the whole Reddit GameStop phenomenon going on. Arguably, a lot of it was fueled with the stimulus checks, the stimmies. and next year is going to be a blockbuster record year for fiscal stimulus. Um there's going to be a lot of tax refunds and I'm just wondering, is there any way we could have some kind of a repeat of that, maybe not to the same extent, but do you think that we just get another surge, um perhaps just because people have more money to play with?\n02:46 Henry Schwartz\nI I mean, I think you have you have a lot of dynamics going on at the same time. You know, we do have a a a rate, you know, the rates are going down in the cycle, but you also do have some concerns about the labor market, you have concerns about, you know, just fundamental valuations. So there's a little bit of push and pull. I think, you know, that the the COVID situation and you know, zero interest rates and stimulus and meme stock, uh that that was such a perfect storm of just kind of\n03:28 Speaker A\nAgreed, perfect storm.\n03:29 Henry Schwartz\nexplosive bullish activity and and and retail were able to capitalize on it. You know, in a large part because they were at home and they kind of had the freedom to trade. You also had commissions that basically gone to zero just leading into that. So, everything came together and you know, a lot of these traders found each other and learned from each other on Reddit and on, you know, social media. Uh I don't know if 2026 is going to be quite the same. I think there's a little bit more kind of back and forth. Uh but you know, at least in terms of the options activity, you know, we continue to see new brokerage firms coming uh online. We see the existing brokerage firms, you know, innovating and and rolling out new platforms and doing some really interesting things. So, you know, I see the business, at least in the options world continuing to to do very, very well. And you know, in terms of assets, uh you know, I think that you have this environment now where, you know, the US has had an amazing run and there's a lot of people that say, oh, you know, I don't know, this is getting a little bit tired. Uh but at the same time, you you you know, every time we have a dip, uh,\n04:36 Speaker A\nAnd that's arguably better for options traders. I mean, option traders like volatility. I I I want to make sure we get to a couple other things here. The other is the rise of zero-dated options. And so that just gives more opportunities. Back in the day, you only had monthlies, so you had to wait every month. Then we had weeklies, then basically we have dailies now. And that has just increased uh this volume of options. Talk to me about some of the other innovations. I know CBOE has a bunch of new products, too.\n05:08 Henry Schwartz\nYeah, so the so we pioneered the zero DTE or the daily option option cycle starting 2022 and those are now about 2/3 of the activity uh in SPX and um and some of the big ETFs. Uh and there there's no signs of that slowing down. Uh we just rolled out the Mag 10 index, which is the Mag 7 plus uh Broadcom, uh AMD and Palantir. And you know, those 10 symbols together do about a third of the single stock option. Out of almost 4,000 single stocks. So you you can see how concentrated it is. That's what the trader, that's what the investing public really, really is interested in. They're following the stories, they're getting in and getting out of these stocks. And so the Mag 10 index which launched about a month ago, I'm very proud to say I was the very first trade in in Mag 10. and that option expired today and I made a little bit of money at it. Uh we actually have daily options coming in those just uh in two weeks. So that's, you know, and that's new, right? This this is the first time that that there's been a uh an index that's not quite as broad-based with the daily options on it as well. So, um you know, there's you know, the the industry just continues to keep innovating. You know, we see a lot of work going on in complex order execution, which is you know, basically about a third of the activity is customers trading one option against another, vertical spreads, calendar spreads, exactly. Uh and that you know, CBOE and all the other exchanges continue to kind of take steps to make that uh easier to do, add functionality. You can now trade flex options versus listed options, which is a kind of a special option that lets people pick their own expiration date and um and strike price and even exercise style.\n06:56 Speaker A\nAll right, Henry, we got to leave it there, but congratulations on your Mag 10 trade. I hope it pretends a bullish 2026. Thanks for joining us in studio here.\n07:05 Henry Schwartz\nAwesome.\n07:06 Speaker A\nAll right, we'll\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Visa, Mastercard make a global push for mobile wallets\n\nJohn Adams\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 10:40 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MA\n\nV\n\nAAPL\n\nKey insights : Visa and Mastercard are building mobile wallet scale through a series of partnerships.\nWhat's at stake : Both card networks say internal research is tracking popularity for mobile wallets.\nForward look : Apple's agreement with EU regulators to open its NFC technology will draw more wallet providers in the next year.\n\nAs 2025 winds to a close, Mastercard has advanced two partnerships designed to enable merchant access to mobile wallets in dozens of countries, joining rival Visa in building global distribution as consumers and merchants migrate more of their lives to smartphones.\nMastercard's December moves include a collaboration with TerraPay, a London-based cross-border payments company, to enable TerraPay's mobile wallet users to access more than 150 million Mastercard acceptance points for Near Field Communication-based payments.\nNFC is a key enabling technology for smartphone payments. Under regulatory pressure , Apple has agreed to ease access to NFC, which the tech giant traditionally controlled. This is expected to open the market to dozens of mobile wallets, creating a need for Visa and Mastercard to broaden their ability to support a range of new ones.\n\nMastercard's TerraPay partnership comes as the card brand plans to boost mobile wallet usage in Latin America via a joint venture with Telefonica, a Madrid-based telecom. Telefonica and Mastercard plan to launch a mobile wallet in Brazil and surrounding countries that could have an addressable market of up to 87 million consumers.\nMastercard's other recent collaborations include \"Pay like a local,\" a partnership between: Alipay and Mastercard to offer international travelers an option to make cashless payments in China; an integration with Alipay Wallet; and a contactless pay technology tie-up with Alipay.\n\"Collaborations with key ecosystem players like Terrapay play a key role in scaling the positive impact via their multiple wallet partners and simplifying the implementation process,\" said Prakriti Singh, executive vice president for core payments at Mastercard for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, in a statement.\n\nMobility\nSeventy percent of in-person Mastercard transactions are now contactless, the card network said, suggesting the popularity of mobile wallets is migrating from e-commerce to brick and mortar. Banks are also embracing mobile wallets. More than half of banks say at least 60% of their payment initiatives take a \"mobile first\" strategy, according to research from American Banker .\n\nStory Continues\nLike Mastercard, Visa has made a series of partnerships to scale its mobile wallet strategy.\n\nVisa recently announced a digital wallet partnership with BBVA in Spain that combines Visa's Token Service with the bank's payment technology to enable BBVA's mobile wallet. (A \"token\" in this case refers to digital payments security, not migrating services to a blockchain).\nOther Visa mobile wallet projects in the EU include an iOS/Android contactless mobile payment collaboration with Klarna; a Visa co-wallet with Vipps Mobile Pay in the Nordics; and a planned 2026 pilot with Bancomat, an Italian digital payments product.\n\n\"This will enable consumer choice, which is a big underlying issue for us and our strategy,\" Mathieu Altwegg, senior vice president and head of product and solutions for Europe at Visa, told American Banker.\nVisa also cited its own research, reporting mobile payments make up 59% of all e-commerce transactions in Europe, with growth on pace to reach 75% in the next four years. Thirty-two percent of European consumers only use mobile wallets for payments, according to the card brand.\n\"We're seeing demand for these wallets, both to pay online and for face to face transactions,\" he said.\nAltwegg did not directly address Apple's EU NFC settlement, but noted a proliferation of wallets. \"Being able to use different types of wallets will level the playing field,\" he said.\n\nCompetitive response\nIn Europe, the threat to the card networks is Europe's bank-led wallets that use direct bank transfers instead of card networks, according to Ron van Wezel, a strategic advisor for Datos Insights.\n\"Bank consortia provide digital wallets across Europe, launched through collaborative efforts between multiple banks,\" Van Wezel told American Banker, noting that common successful bank-led wallets for specific domestic markets include MobilePay in Denmark, Swish in Sweden, Vipps in Norway, and Bizum in Spain.\n\n\"They're direct bank account payment systems that compete with cards,\" Van Wezel said. \"When someone pays with these wallets, the money moves bank-to-bank via SEPA instant transfers, with no Visa, no Mastercard, and no interchange fees.\"\nThis is why the Apple/EU settlement matters so much, Van Wezel said, adding that these bank wallets couldn't work on Apple devices at the point-of-sale prior to Apple's EU settlement.\n\"They're direct bank account payment systems that compete with cards,\" Van Wezel said. \"When someone pays with these wallets, the money moves bank-to-bank via SEPA instant transfers, with no Visa, no Mastercard, and no interchange fees.\"\nIn this environment it's critical that cards be available in digital wallets, Tony DeSanctis, a senior director at Cornerstone Advisors, told American Banker. \"The question is which wallets are going to be relevant,\" he said.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Riley Wealth chief market strategist Art Hogan joins Opening Bid with Brian Sozzi to talk about his expectations for the Magnificent Seven and the broader AI trade.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat is the future of the AI trade and how are you playing it next year? Art, is it Max 7 or bust for you?\n00:09 Art\nUh, it's not. and I'll tell you this. I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Intel vs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points TSMC is the undisputed leader in manufacturing advanced chips.\nIntel's stock outperformed in 2025 after the company was backed by some big investors.\nTSMC has a clearer growth path between the two companies.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nWhen it comes to chip manufacturing, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the undisputed foundry leader, while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is trying to make inroads. However, in 2025, it was Intel's stock that outperformed, up nearly 80% as of this writing, compared to a 40% gain for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\nLet's look at which stock is set up to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC for short, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. Due to its technological expertise and scale, the company manufactures the vast majority of advanced chips, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) . It counts Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom among its top customers.\n\nIn chip manufacturing, the goal is to consistently push down node sizes, which refers to the transistor density of the chips. The more transistors that can be fit on a chip, the more powerful and energy efficient they become. However, producing advanced chips at scale is difficult, and TSMC's main competitors, including Intel and Samsung , have struggled with yields (the number of defects per wafer). Meanwhile, nearly three-quarters of its production is at 7nm nodes and below, and it is set to move to 2nm technology next year.\nGiven its position in the industry, TSMC is the go-to partner for chip designers. It works closely with companies like Nvidia to grow capacity to meet their projected demand. And, as the only foundry that can really make these advanced chips at scale with high yields, it has also garnered strong pricing power. The company is set to raise prices once again next year, while the cost of its new 2nm processing technology is forecasted to be 50% higher than its 2nm technology.\n\nTSMC is well-positioned to continue to benefit from the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout and sees AI chip demand growing by more than a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years.\nThe case for Intel Intel stock's outperformance in 2025 wasn't really a result of its operational performance. The company has struggled to grow its revenue, and it felt a lot of gross margin pressure in the first half of the year. However, it did see a huge rebound in adjusted gross margins in Q3, with it climbing from 18% a year ago to 40%. Revenue, meanwhile, edged up 3%.\n\nStory Continues\nThe biggest reasons for Intel's gains in 2025 were from the high-profile investments others made into the company's stock. Nvidia made a $5 billion equity investment in the company, while SoftBank invested $2 billion. Meanwhile, the U.S. government made an $8.9 billion investment. These investments, along with the 51% sale of its Altera business for $5.2 billion, helped Intel end Q3 with nearly $31 billion in cash on its balance sheet.\n\nThe company will use that cash to keep building out its foundry business and advance its chip manufacturing technology. Meanwhile, it is collaborating with Nvidia on new products, including integrating its central processing units (CPUs) with Nvidia's NVLink system to allow its CPUs to communicate more quickly with Nvidia's GPUs. This would help give Intel a nice advantage in the data center CPU market, where it has been losing share to Advanced Micro Devices . Separately, Intel is also working on its own AI chips designed for inference, and it is supposedly close to a deal with SambaNova Systems to further its efforts in this area.\nThe verdict Intel's 2025 performance was largely from events that won't repeat in 2026. For the company to outperform next year, it's probably going to need to win a large foundry customer or show major progress in data center chips, either with its CPUs or GPU efforts. That makes the stock more of a wildcard.\n\nTSMC, meanwhile, is the much safer choice. The company is set to benefit from the continued AI data center buildout, and its path forward is much clearer. As such, it's my pick to outperform in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

      "Content": "Steve Jobs sold his Volkswagen to raise $1,300 for Apple’s first computer—he became a millionaire just two years later at 23\n\nEmma Burleigh\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:28 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nVLKAF\n\nIf it wasn’t for a Volkswagen bus and a calculator, Apple might never have existed. At the time, late cofounder Steve Jobs was in his early 20s and strapped for cash, but hooked on the idea that everyone should be able to own a home computer. The only problem? Like many founders, he didn’t have enough money to bring his vision to life.\n\nSo Jobs sold off his Volkswagen bus while fellow cofounder Steve Wozniak got money for his programmable calculator, raising $1,300 to pay for the prototype’s parts. And the first Apple computer, Apple I, was born on April Fools Day in 1976.\nThe sacrifice paid off: A local computer dealer placed a $50,000 order for 100 units soon after it launched, with the product mainly bought up by hobby enthusiasts. But it made the entrepreneurial duo enough money to create Apple II for the mass market—the first personal computer to include a keyboard and color graphics. A year after its 1977 debut, it made nearly $3 million.\n“I was worth about over $1 million when I was 23, and over $10 million when I was 24, and over $100 million when I was 25,” Jobs told PBS in 1996. “And it wasn’t that important, because I never did it for the money.”\n\nThe days of selling their belongings to fund their fledgling business was long behind them.\nFrom college dropout to $10.2 billion net worth: Jobs’ path to Apple success Jobs didn’t discover his passion for technology in a college class; at the age of just 12 years old, the entrepreneur had already found his true calling, and took a massive leap of faith to pursue his dreams.\nA young Jobs thumbed through the yellow pages, and hunted down the phone number of Hewlett-Packard (HP) cofounder Bill Hewlett, ringing him up for a favor. At the time, the tween was in need of spare parts to build a frequency counter. But what he received was far better than some nuts and bolts; Hewlett offered Jobs an internship at the iconic $21.4 billion tech company, where he serendipitously met a talented engineer: Wozniak.\n\nTogether, the pair started their first business illegally selling “blue boxes” that allowed users to make free, long-distance telephone calls. Jobs reminisced on those years in the early 1970s as a &#8220;magical&#8221; time in his life that sent him on the path to soon create Apple.\n&#8220;Experiences like that taught us the power of ideas,&#8221; Jobs said during the 1998 documentary Silicon Valley: A 100 Year Renaissance . &#8220;If we hadn&#8217;t have made blue boxes, there would have been no Apple.&#8221;\nJobs later enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, but his days of higher education were short-lived. He dropped out after just one semester, inevitably working for legendary brand Atari as a technician and games designer at just 18 years old. That would be the last time Jobs worked under somebody else; Just two years later, Apple I hit the market, and Jobs was well on his way to becoming one of the most visionary tech pioneers in modern history.\n\nStory Continues\nFast forward five decades later, and Apple is the second most valuable company in the world. The business sits in fourth place on the Fortune 500, having sold more than three billion iPhones, and boasting more than 100 million Mac users globally.\nAt the time of his passing in 2011, Jobs was estimated to be worth $10.2 billion. Although he had enough money to buy a whole fleet of luxury cars shortly after founding Apple, selling his Volkswagen ironically proved to be a critical sacrifice in making it to the top.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

It’s the largest lending protocol in the sector by a mile, with more than $50 billion in assets deposited across its markets. That&#x27;s a balance sheet that would slot it roughly into the ranks of the top 50 U.S. banks by assets if it were a traditional institution.\nThis feature is a part of CoinDesk&#x27;s Most Influential 2025 list .\n\nStani Kulechov, founder of Aave and developer Aave Labs, has a straightforward version of what he’s building: \"Aave will be the backbone of all credit,\" he said . Not just leverage for crypto traders, but mortgages, credit cards, consumer and business loans, even sovereign debt — with DeFi running quietly in the background.\nThe path there runs on two rails. On the consumer side, the upcoming Aave App , now listed on Apple’s App Store, aims to become a savings account for average investors. Users see an interface closer to a neobank; under the hood, deposits are funneled into Aave’s onchain lending markets — a textbook \"DeFi mullet\" play where a familiar, Web2 front end masks the complex blockchain and DeFi engine in the back end.\n\nThen, there&#x27;s the institutional side and the booming tokenized real-world asset space. Aave&#x27;s Horizon , which debuted this August, is offering regulated players a marketplace to borrow stablecoins on their tokenized assets 24/7 while staying inside compliance lines. It has grown into a roughly $600 million pool despite the past months&#x27; crypto headwinds.\nAs the world is migrating onchain and traditional financial rails and blockchain rails are becoming increasingly intertwined, Aave is positioned to sit close to the center of that flow.\nMost recently, Aave has found itself at the center of a governance dispute between tokenholders — participants in the protocol’s self-governing DAO — and Stabi Kulechov&#x27;s Aave Labs over control of key revenue streams and who ultimately holds rights to core project assets like the brand, trademarks and related IP. At issue is not just the protocol’s parameters onchain, but the power that sits around it.\nThe ramifications of the outcome reaches far beyond the protocol itself. How that conflict is resolved could define what governance tokens truly grant holders in practice, set a precedent across DeFi for protocol ownership and the boundary between decentralized governance and corporate stewardship.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The ETF generates income from dividends paid by underlying equity holdings, tracking the Fidelity High Dividend Index of large and mid-cap stocks. With $7.7 billion in assets and a low 0.15% expense ratio, FDVV appears attractive on paper. However, a closer look at its top holdings reveals a fundamental tension between growth and income.\nPortfolio Composition Raises Concerns FDVV's largest positions are growth-oriented technology stocks that contribute minimal dividend income. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), the fund's largest holding at 6.41%, yields just 0.02% with an annual dividend of $0.04 per share. Despite a 53% profit margin and 67% earnings growth, NVIDIA slashed its quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.01 in 2024—a 75% cut that signals the company prioritizes reinvestment over shareholder payouts.\n\nApple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), the second-largest holding at 6.11%, offers a 0.37% yield with a $1.02 annual dividend. While more substantial than NVIDIA, this remains far below income investor expectations. Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) rounds out the tech triumvirate at 5.24% of the portfolio with a 0.72% yield and $3.40 annual dividend.\nTogether, these three holdings represent nearly 18% of FDVV but collectively yield less than 0.5%.\nTraditional Dividend Payers Provide Stability JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE:JPM ), representing 2.71% of the portfolio, offers more reliable income with a 1.73% yield and $5.55 annual dividend. The bank's 16x earnings multiple and 16% return on equity suggest sustainable payouts. Exxon Mobil ( NYSE:XOM ) at 1.97% of holdings provides a 3.36% yield with a $3.96 annual dividend, though recent quarterly earnings declined 8% year-over-year amid energy price volatility.\n\nThe problem is clear: FDVV's 26.5% allocation to information technology—the largest sector weighting—contradicts its dividend-focused mandate. Meanwhile, traditional income sectors like utilities (9.6%) and energy (8.7%) receive far less emphasis. Dividend payments have also shown concerning volatility, ranging from $0.185 to $0.504 quarterly over the past four years. After growing dividends 48% cumulatively from 2020 to 2023, FDVV experienced its first annual decline in 2024, dropping 7.7%.\n\nStory Continues\nThis infographic evaluates the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV), highlighting its portfolio's reliance on low-yield tech stocks and significant dividend volatility. It presents the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a potentially more reliable alternative for income-focused investors.\nConsider SCHD as an Alternative For investors seeking more reliable dividend income, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF ( NYSEARCA:SCHD ) offers a compelling alternative. SCHD yields 3.80%—significantly higher than FDVV's 2.78%—and focuses exclusively on US companies with consistent dividend growth records. The fund screens for financial strength and dividend sustainability, resulting in a portfolio weighted toward traditional dividend sectors rather than growth tech. SCHD has demonstrated more stable quarterly distributions and maintains a similarly low expense ratio, making it a stronger choice for income-focused investors seeking dependable cash flow.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

(NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have quietly become the two most dominant forces inside the Magnificent Seven, riding different paths to the same destination: artificial intelligence supremacy.\nNvidia's GPUs remain the backbone of the global AI buildout, powering everything from data centers to cutting-edge model training.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is pushing its own vertically integrated AI stack — from custom TPUs to Gemini — embedding intelligence directly across Search, Cloud and consumer products.\nThe market thus far has rewarded both approaches. Nvidia is up 33% year-to-date through Dec. 17, while Alphabet has surged 62%.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nZooming out further tells an even more dramatic story: since early 2023, Alphabet shares are up roughly 250%, while Nvidia has delivered a staggering 1,120% return.\nThat explosive run has made Nvidia the world's biggest company today, with a market capitalization of about $4.318 trillion — even briefly touching $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet ranks third at approximately $3.7 trillion, behind Apple's $4.05 trillion valuation.\n\nYet traders see a far closer race ahead.\nOn Polymarket, both Nvidia and Alphabet are assigned a 35% probability of being the world's most valuable company by the end of 2026.\nA $100 bet on Alphabet overtaking Nvidia to become the world's biggest company by the end of next year would pay out $265 if it happens — with nearly identical returns available for those wagering that Nvidia holds onto the crown.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nApple Inc.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) sit further back, at 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nHow Could Alphabet Overtake Nvidia As World’s Biggest Company? For Alphabet to dethrone Nvidia as world’s biggest company, it needs to outperform by a meaningful margin.\nThe current valuation gap between the two companies is about $600 billion.\nIf Nvidia's market cap were to grow 10% in 2026, it would climb from roughly $4.3 trillion to about $4.75 trillion. For Alphabet to leapfrog Nvidia in that scenario, its shares would need to outperform Nvidia by roughly 19 percentage points.\n\nStory Continues\nIn practical terms, that would mean Alphabet gaining about 29% in a year where Nvidia rises 10%, lifting Google's valuation to around $4.77 trillion.\nAny performance gap of 19 percentage points in Alphabet's favor could hand it the crown — assuming today's market caps as the starting line.\n\nThe bet, then, is whether Alphabet's AI monetization, advertising leverage and cloud growth can accelerate faster than Nvidia's already-dominant chip business.\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nWall Street Still Backs Nvidia Where traders see a coin flip, Wall Street analysts remain more decisive.\nBased on median 12-month price targets, analysts expect Nvidia's reign to continue. Consensus estimates point to Nvidia shares reaching about $250 over the next year, or roughly 40% upside from the current price near $177.\nAlphabet's outlook is far more muted by comparison. Analysts see a median 12-month target of $330, implying just 6% upside from its current level around $306.\n\nThat gap underscores the tension at the core of the debate: prediction markets see a neck-and-neck race for the world's largest company, while Wall Street analysts continue to model an extended run of Nvidia's dominance.\nBy the end of 2026, the outcome may hinge on a single question: will the AI arms race ultimately reward the company supplying the picks and shovels, or the one embedding intelligence into every layer of the digital economy?\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Apple Inc. (AAPL): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nApple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +2.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, to which Apple belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nApple is expected to post earnings of $2.65 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $8.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8.7%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.11 indicates a change of +12.3% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $137.46 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $451.64 billion and $489.55 billion estimates indicate +8.5% and +8.4% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Apple reported revenues of $102.47 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.9%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $1.64 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $101.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.25%. The EPS surprise was +6.94%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Buffett Leaving Berkshire Creates a ‘Vacuum Risk’ and a $381 Billion Question\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:18 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAAPL\n\nBA\n\nBRK-B\n\nGOOG\n\nQuick Read Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) is underperforming the S&P 500 in a rare break from a two-decade trend as Warren Buffett prepares to step down as CEO.\nThe departure of Todd Combs to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) raises concerns about future stock selection and internal investment leadership.\nBerkshire’s $341 billion cash position reflects valuation discipline, but investors are increasingly focused on how effectively the next generation will deploy capital.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video I started the discussion by acknowledging something that feels almost unnatural for long-time Berkshire watchers. Warren Buffett is struggling, at least by his own historic standards. With Buffett expected to step away from the CEO role within weeks, Lee and I agreed that the timing of recent events has only amplified investor anxiety.\n\nA rare break from long-term outperformance Lee reminded me that we have covered Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway for nearly 20 years, and since 2000 the company has outperformed the S&P 500 almost every single year. That streak is coming to an end. The stock has gone through a rocky period, and that kind of volatility is not what investors associate with Buffett’s steady hand. Once Buffett publicly committed to stepping aside, the margin for error narrowed, and the market has become far less forgiving.\n\nTodd Combs and the vacuum risk The most troubling development we discussed was the departure of Todd Combs. As one of Buffett’s two key proteges, Combs played a central role in portfolio management and in supporting Greg Abel, the executive expected to lead Berkshire going forward. When Combs left to take a role at JPMorgan Chase, it immediately raised a hard question. Who finds the next great ideas?\n\nLee pointed out that Combs or his investment cohort were likely behind Berkshire’s position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Even though Buffett was late to that trade, it remains one of Berkshire’s most strategically important modern holdings. The concern now is whether there is another investor inside Berkshire capable of sourcing similar opportunities in a market that is far more complex than it was twenty years ago.\nSelling stocks and stockpiling cash Another focal point of our conversation was Berkshire’s enormous cash hoard, now roughly $341 billion. I argued that this is not a sign of confusion, but discipline. Berkshire’s cash balance will likely continue to grow until markets correct and valuations become more attractive. Whether Buffett himself or his successors pull the trigger, there are clearly stocks the team likes. They just do not like them at current prices.\n\nStory Continues\nLee agreed, noting that patience has always been core to Berkshire’s DNA. The difference now is that investors are watching closely to see whether that patience translates into decisive action once opportunity appears.\nWhat might come next Lee brought up Boeing (NYSE: BA) as a potential example of the type of company Berkshire could target. After years of turmoil following the 737 Max crashes and operational failures, Boeing has begun to stabilize and has secured large new orders. Historically, Berkshire has favored exactly these kinds of battered but essential companies that are likely to survive and recover.\n\nCore holdings still dominate We closed by looking at the current portfolio. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) remains Berkshire’s largest holding by a wide margin, even after substantial trimming. The same is true for Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) , which has also been reduced significantly. How aggressively the next leadership team continues to reshape these positions will say a lot about Berkshire’s future identity.\n\nFor now, Berkshire sits at an inflection point. Underperformance, executive departures, and a looming leadership transition have unsettled even its most loyal shareholders. Whether that uncertainty creates an opportunity or signals a longer adjustment period will depend on how effectively the post-Buffett team proves it can do what Buffett did better than anyone else.\nTranscript: [00:00:00] Lee Jackson: Now let's talk about Tom Combs leaving and how it's underperformed, et cetera.\n[00:00:06] Doug McIntyre: Warren Buffett has been having a tough time now. He'll be retiring, I think in about three weeks. But yeah, he's\n[00:00:12] Lee Jackson: pretty much out the door from\n\n[00:00:13] Doug McIntyre: the CEO slot. Since he said he was gonna leave, he's had some real problems.\n[00:00:19] Part of it is departures of senior people, but the other one is the stock has been, it's been a rocky period for the stock, which, it's not traditional for him.\n[00:00:31] Lee Jackson: No, because we had done some work on this 'cause we've covered Buffett and Berkshire for almost 20 years here at 24/7. And, literally since 2000, he outperformed the s and p 500 almost every year, if not every year.\n[00:00:47] That ain't gonna be the case this year. And yeah, I think, It's not surprising when people leave. Just ask Old Miss. But, when, somebody like Todd Combs walks out the door, he was one of the two, Buffett proteges, that were helping him with the portfolio, helping the guy that's stepping in to be the new CEO, he was, they were the guys that were helping him.\n\n[00:01:14] When Todd takes a, job at JP Morgan to do. Some investment strategy stuff. I'm, I don't really remember exactly what he's gonna do there, but a, he must have got a huge paycheck to go there, and he's probably filthy rich anyway, because he is been at Berkshire for years. But that's not a good sign for Berkshire.\n[00:01:33] That's not a good sign because who's gonna be the stock pickers? who's gonna find the new ideas? And I think you know, it, was probably him or his, cohort that suggested Google. Even though, Buffett was late to the Google purchase, it's in there. And as, as you've said a lot, and it's been your favorite big name, is there gonna be somebody to find more good ideas like that?\n\n[00:02:00] Because all they've been doing is selling for the last couple of years, and they have that huge pile of cash, like 341 billion of cash. So. Do you think that, I think some investors, especially longtime investors, are concerned that is every anybody else gonna go, the other people gonna\n[00:02:20] Doug McIntyre: leave. Well, there's a second part about this and that is everybody talks about the cash.\n[00:02:25] The cash on that balance is going to grow until the market drops. Right. It may not be Buffett, it may be as proteges, but there are a bunch of people sitting there who love some stocks and they're waiting for them to get to the point where they think that they're a good buy. Yeah. They love the stocks.\n[00:02:43] They love them now, but they don't love 'em at these prices.\n\n[00:02:48] Lee Jackson: Yeah. I agree. And it's funny, I. there was an upgrade for Boeing, and Boeing's gotten some huge orders and it's been a nightmare over the last five years, the 737 max crashes and, all of that stuff, and it's gonna probably be a name like Boeing or, maybe some other company that's been beaten down hard, but, will survive and exist.\n[00:03:10] But yeah, it's gonna be interesting how. The portfolio evolves going forward. 'cause a, apple is still the biggest position by far. Yeah. But you know, they've sold a ton of that. They sold a ton of Bank of America and it'll be interesting to see how things go and it'll be interesting to see if investors start to buy a lower Berkshire or continue to sell it.\n\n[00:03:35] Doug McIntyre: Yeah\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "‘I don’t know how much my wife earns’: I’m 63 with $6.4 million in stocks, mostly Apple. Will I get punished on taxes?\n\nQuentin Fottrell\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:48 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nDear Quentin, I am a longtime reader of your columns. I am interested in vulnerabilities I may not see and any advice you may offer to address my challenges.\nI am a 63-year-old former environmental engineer. After a 33-year career in state government, I retired in December 2020 at 58 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. I have the state pension currently, which pays out about $9,000 a month with a 2% COLA compounding annually. I have the state lifetime healthcare insurance (Kaiser Permanente) and it coordinates with Medicare when I turn 65. My wife is included in all this; she will get 100% survivorship and healthcare when I pass away. I pay for vision (VSP) and dental (Delta Dental) insurance through the state as these are not part of the healthcare insurance plan.\n\nMost Read from MarketWatch Gen Z would rather cut Social Security benefits for current retirees than pay higher taxes to save the program\nOK, boomer: Why you should start giving your money to your adult kids now\n‘The stress at my job is getting worse every day’: I’m 61, earn $177K, and have a 401(k) with $965K. Do I retire and downsize?\n‘It’s heartbreaking’: My cousin died and her estranged husband has taken possession of her home. Can we evict him?\n\nMy wife, 62, still works at her Kumon Center, helping children get better academically in reading, writing and math. She wants to stop and is planning to sell the center. I don’t know how much my wife earns. We have lived in this city since 1989 and have a house that is paid off; our first home is rented out at $3,500 a month. Our primary home has a $300,000, 15-year refinance mortgage with 10 years remaining at 2.5%. This was a lucky pandemic era refinance. Both our properties are worth over $1 million each.\nThroughout my career, we have lived frugally, using coupons and deals and adopting the save mentality of our parents. I saved diligently into my 401(k) and 457(b) plans, the Savings Plus Program. Our investments started conservatively, but went aggressive through the years. It currently clocks in at $6.4 million — mostly in stocks and a large-cap index fund that follows the S&P 500. About half of that sits in Apple. This growth was mostly through capital appreciation and the splits these stocks went through all that time.\n\nBoth my son, 34, and daughter, 27, are well accomplished. Each has a master’s degree in the computer-science area and each is employed and living in their own condos that we helped them attain with the down payment. Neither is married yet. We both plan to take up the Social Security benefit at 70. My wife apparently can’t do the spousal benefit because her own benefit would be higher than half of mine. My wife has her own IRAs from her work and we do have a joint investment account with Charles Schwab and a checking account.\n\nStory Continues\nMy dad, 93, is a retired 22-year USN veteran who has land properties in the Philippines which we will have to deal with. I’ve been trying to figure out what to do with them. My mother passed away a while ago and a couple of properties were inherited. I was able to gain dual citizenship. My income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA) will be high but I think some may be reimbursed by the California Public Employee’s Retirement System (CalPER). Medicare premiums, I believe, are reimbursed by CalPERS.\n\nMy challenges:\n(​1.) My RMDs will be at 75 per the SECURE Act 2.0 and will be very high. As it’s all classified as regular income, income taxes will be very high.\n(​2.) Long-term care; I wonder if I can address this with self-funding.\nThank you and season’s greetings to you and yours.\nHopeful\nRelated: ‘I’m in a financial mess’: My income was cut in half. Do I sell my $600K home and kiss my 2.9% mortgage rate goodbye?\nDear Hopeful, Your RMDs are a years-long tax-related obstacle course. There is no one quick fix.\nYou’re a happy, willing, wealthy and hopefully healthy victim of your own success. Taking early withdrawals (59 ½ without having to pay a 10% early-withdrawal penalty) is a good goal, but it only takes you so far. As you rightly indicate, withdraw early only if it is part of a coordinated Roth-conversion and IRMAA-savvy strategy.\n\nYou knocked the ball out of the ballpark in the accumulation stage of your life, and now you are coming — somewhat late (but not too late) — to your distribution phase. You have children who will also benefit from an inheritance, so this is the equivalent of a double-edged silver sword with — you’ll be glad to know — relatively blunt edges.\nThis is not a savings or even a tax problem (you will have to encounter taxes one way or another). Your challenges are twofold: diversification or lack thereof and controlling your withdrawals, hopefully with an aggressive Roth conversion plan that also leaves tax-free withdrawals for your children as part of their inheritance.\nYour mission, if you accept it, will be to keep a handle on your marginal tax brackets, the IRMAA cliff you mention that could indeed lead to a sudden, significant jump in your Medicare Part B and D premiums if you cross that threshold, the 3.8% net investment income tax, California state taxes and, finally, survivor tax rates (when one spouse dies).\n\nAnd now? One of your biggest vulnerabilities has been your greatest strength: riding the tech wave with Apple AAPL, contributing to a substantial appreciation in your portfolio. You say that “about half” of your $6.4 million is Apple shares. That means you have $3.2 million in a single stock. If this is in tax-deferred accounts, selling triggers ordinary income tax, not capital gains.\nWorst-case scenario With a pension of $108,000 a year, Social Security of $90,000 a year for you and your wife collectively and your rental income, you could — in a worst-case scenario — actually exceed $700,000 in annual income, pushing you into the top federal and California state tax brackets. At 75, you could easily have nearly $9 million in stocks, requiring RMDs of $350,000 a year.\n\nFirst, how much will you have to take in RMDs? The Internal Revenue Service calculates RMDs by taking the balances of your tax-deferred retirement accounts at the end of the previous year and dividing that by a number based on your life expectancy. At 75, your RMD is calculated using a life expectancy factor of 24.6, meaning you must withdraw 4.07% of your account.\nYou will likely pay significant income tax on your RMDs assuming you have the lion’s share of that $6.4 million in tax-deferred retirement accounts. Your options include performing Roth IRA conversions and making qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) while strategically managing your withdrawals under the guise of an accountant who specializes in RMDs.\nWith a QCD, people 70 ½ can send up to around $108,000 (in 2025) from an IRA directly to charity, which counts towards your RMD; QCD limits are subject to annual inflation adjustments. In theory, this would help to lower your taxes and Medicare costs. However, this is not applicable for 401(k)s or 457(b)s; you may wish to consider rolling them into an IRA.\n\nA word of caution from Charles Schwab: “A Roth IRA conversion can be especially advantageous during your initial years of retirement, when RMDs haven’t yet kicked in and you’re most likely to be in a lower tax bracket as compared to your working years. But if you’re already receiving retirement benefits, converted funds could increase your taxable income.”\nLife insurance and long-term care Some retirees pair QCDs with Roth conversions in lower‑income years, says Savant Wealth Management, which has offices nationwide. “If you don’t need the distribution for living expenses, you can invest the after‑tax proceeds in a taxable account, contribute to a 529 plan for a grandchild, or incorporate the funds into a broader estate plan,” it says.\n\nGiven your real-estate and investments, you could comfortably finance your own long-term care if need be. Long-term-care insurance effectively doubles between your 60s and 70s. Most men your age can expect to pay a premium of $313 a month (compared with $536 for someone 75 years old), according to this guide from SmartAsset.\nIt’s more expensive for women due to their longer life expectancy (it costs around $524 for a 65-year-old single woman aged 65 versus $966 for a 75-year-old woman). Medicare does not cover long-term-care insurance. Based on your age, gender and health profile, your monthly premium could be $760 or more, according to a review of health insurers by Policygenius.\nIf you do decide to fund long-term care? In California, the median annual cost for long-term-care facilities can range from $65,000 for assisted living to over $150,000 for a private room in a nursing home, depending on the facility and location. In-home care could cost you more than $70,000 a year. You have a $1 million rental property to tap into, in addition to your investments.\n\nMoving onto the state of play after you’re gone: Roth conversions during your lifetimes will also help prevent your wife from facing a wall of taxes if you predecease her. Another reason to pursue this strategy: When you and your wife pass away, your children will also be forced to drain inherited tax-deferred accounts within a 10-year period.\nYou have a lot to do, but you have the wherewithal to do it. Include your wife in your plans.\nDon’t miss: ‘I fear a significant decline in the S&P 500’: Do I sell my tech stocks before it’s too late?\nPrevious columns by Quentin Fottrell:\nMy siblings don’t earn nearly as much as me.

      "Content": "Atlanta USPS worker arrested for stealing mail. Here’s how agents used a Walmart gift card to catch her red-handed\n\nVictoria Vesovski\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nA $10 Walmart gift card doesn’t scream “criminal investigation.” But in Cobb County, Georgia, that small piece of plastic helped federal inspectors and local police catch a U.S. Postal Service employee accused of stealing mail\nThe sting happened at a time when the institution was processing more than 350 million mail pieces per day last holiday season (1). According to Cobb County police and court records, Isis Hinson, who worked at the U.S. Post Office on East Cobb Road, was charged with theft after officials say she targeted mail containing cash and gift cards.\n\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThe investigation was launched when a fellow letter carrier flagged an unusual pattern of opened envelopes turning up near cluster mailboxes in an Acworth neighborhood.\n\"Envelopes containing greeting cards had been opened and or stolen, and some of those contained cash and or gift cards,\" Cobb County Police Sgt. Eric Smith told Fox 5 Atlanta (2).\nInvestigators then set up a gift card sting, slipping an envelope containing a $10 Walmart gift card into the Marietta East Cobb post office as an “integrity test”. Court records note the card didn’t go unnoticed. It was allegedly activated and used to buy an iPad, along with several Apple subscriptions.\nMissing mail means more than lost envelopes Records indicate Hinson admitted to taking eight gift cards from greeting cards processed through the East Cobb Road post office. Investigators later recovered nine more greeting cards from her vehicle, turning what started as routine complaints into a criminal case.\nThe number of items involved may seem small, but for many households, the postal system is how bills get paid, legal notices arrive, holiday gifts are sent and personal messages from loved ones make it home.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has warned that thieves often target gift cards because once they’re redeemed, the money is typically gone for good (3). In fact, during the first nine months of 2021, nearly 40,000 consumers reported losing $148 million to gift card-related theft.\nThose risks exist within a system operating at an extraordinary scale. Data from virtual mailbox provider Postal suggests that more than 542,000 pieces of mail were lost or went missing nationwide between 2022 and 2024 (4). During that time, the U.S. Postal Service delivered more than 100 billion pieces of mail annually, including 112 billion in 2024, 116 billion in 2023, and 127 billion in 2022.\n\nStory Continues\nUSPS says undelivered mail represents only a small share of overall volume, citing factors such as incorrect addressing, misrouting and theft. Even a limited failure rate can have meaningful consequences when mail carries bills or irreplaceable personal gifts.\nRead More: Vanguard reveals what could be coming for U.S. stocks, and it’s raising alarm bells for retirees. Here’s why and how to protect yourself\n\nMaking sure your package arrives safely Since the envelopes Hinson opened had not been processed or stamped, investigators suspected the mail had been taken before leaving the postal system. Police later confirmed the suspect lived in the same neighborhood where residents reported finding open mail.\n\"If anyone is going to send gift cards or cash through the mail, it's not recommended because anyone can intercept them,” Smith told Fox. “Once they're intercepted, almost anyone can use them.”\n\nTo reduce the risk, it’s recommended that senders opt for tracking or signature confirmation, and drop mail directly at post offices or secure collection boxes, rather than residential mailboxes. Digital gift cards can also be a safer option, alleviating the uncertainty that comes with mailing physical cards.\nBut the most reliable option may be the simplest one: hand-delivering gifts to close friends and family. It removes unpredictability and ensures your package makes it to its destination.\nIf your mail goes missing, the USPS advises customers to act quickly (5). They can submit a request through the Missing Mail search tool on USPS.com or contact their local post office to open a ticket. For mail that appears stolen, opened or tampered with before delivery, reports can be filed with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the federal agency responsible for investigating mail-related crimes.\n\nYou May Also Like Become the landlord of Whole Foods and Walmart without lifting a finger.

      "Content": "Six Charts That Show How Stock Markets Got Reshaped in 2025\n\nMichael Msika and Jan-Patrick Barnert\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nGOOG\n\n^VIX\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Stock investors can’t claim that this year has lacked market drama.\nIt didn’t always look likely, but equities have managed strong returns in 2025, weathering shocks like DeepSeek of China’s challenge to US artificial intelligence and the tariff storm unleashed by the Trump administration in April.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nDips were bought at record pace and a fear of missing out on the rally dominated sentiment. In the background, a powerful wave of diversification swept through the market as investors responded to the cracks appearing in so-called US exceptionalism by buying up European, Asian and emerging-market stocks.\nHere are six charts that capture some of the key episodes that reshaped equity markets in 2025:\n\nThe year started with investors maxed-out on American exposure and convinced US dominance was here to stay. But DeepSeek shook the status quo in the AI world, while President Donald Trump’s April tariff salvo all but spelled the end of the bull market that began in 2022. Still, as Trump dialed back his trade war, interest rates fell and the global economy showed resilience, investor confidence returned.\nThat didn’t spare US stocks from bearing the brunt of the selloff. And they never fully caught up with the rest of the world, held back by a weakening dollar. The greenback hasn’t clawed back its 13% slump in the first half, while a growing chorus of strategists has recommended international equities over their US peers.\nMSCI Inc.’s gauge of global stocks excluding the US is tracking its strongest outperformance over the S&P 500 since 2009.\nThe US flagship index is missing from the ranks of best-performing benchmarks, but it did still achieve decent enough gains of 14%. The nagging worry for investors has been the concentrated nature of those returns. “Bubble in the making” became a key concern this year, with some data echoing the early stages of excessive internet over-valuations. The tech sector’s weighting in the S&P 500 reached a record 36%, breaching the previous peak of 2000 leading into the dotcom crash, before retreating below 35%.\n\nA closer examination of this year’s trading reveals unprecedented levels of concentration behind the gains on Wall Street. Tech megacaps powered the rally all year long, with just five stocks accounting for nearly 45% of the benchmark’s returns: Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile excitement around AI has driven returns in the US and Asia, the story has been very different in Europe, a market crucially lacking tech stocks. Here, other thematics stepped to the fore. Banks led Europe’s rally, surging on the way to their strongest year since 1997, while governments’ defense, energy and infrastructure spending commitments lifted the names set to benefit from these outlays.\nThe upshot of all this is the widest dislocation in market leadership between the US and Europe ever seen. Value stocks inspired the advance in Europe, while growth equities led it in the US. This pushed investors into unchartered territory, as equity factors typically move in similar fashion.\nInvestors buffeted by April’s extreme turbulence could hardly have anticipated the relatively smooth ride they had the remaining three-quarters of the year. No drawdown exceeded 5% until November, with each dip enthusiastically snapped up at a rapid clip. The AI narrative, solid earnings and the leftovers from April’s sudden positioning washout encouraged investors to chase stocks steadily higher. The impressive rally stalled only as exuberance over AI was questioned in the final stretch of the year.\nStrong appetite for stocks has been accompanied by the destruction of volatility this year. Considering historical reset patterns for the VIX Index, it’s surprising how often the gauge managed to retrace a spike of 40% or more within a 10-day trading period. This didn’t happen at all before 2011, but has already occurred several times in topsy-turvy 2025.\nStock investors embraced the notion that volatility spikes have become increasingly short-lived. A new market logic appears to have taken hold: stocks panic, volatility gets bid, the risk event is resolved, gamma supply takes over and volatility quickly retreats.\nUS option volumes marked fresh highs, with two daily prints exceeding 100 million turnover this year for the first time. To emphasise the increased demand, trading volume was above 60 million daily contracts on 117 days compared to only 12 days in 2024.\nWhile hedging demand played a role in April and November, most of the time it was calls dominating the tape. With investors chasing the right tail as well as volatility sellers using ultra short-term contracts to earn income, the options market remains a key factor for stocks, contributing to the swift resets in volatility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Apple becomes a debt collector with its new developer agreement\n\nSarah Perez\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 3:56 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nApple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers’ behalf, among other methods.\nThe change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\n\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, US, and, now, Japan , where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though possibly not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\nIn its new developer agreement , Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\n\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee , called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\n\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developer’s other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\n\nStory Continues\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\n\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "PayPal CEO Alex Chriss says stablecoins will be key as his company navigates the ‘classic innovator’s dilemma’\n\nBen Weiss\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:44 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: PYPL\n\nSTRI.PVT\n\nAAPL\n\nWhen PayPal launched almost three decades ago, the company made its name as one of the world’s first fintechs. Now, PayPal faces a slew of competitors, from the payments colossus Stripe to Big Tech giants like Apple . “One of the challenges when you are at a certain scale and you’ve been around for a while is the very classic innovator’s dilemma,” Alex Chriss, the president and CEO of PayPal, told Fortune . “What you’ve done has worked, and are you constantly thinking about how to disrupt yourself?”\n\nInvestors are likely wondering the same thing. Since January, PayPal’s stock price has dropped more than 30% as it tries to halt competitors from encroaching on its core products of online checkout and peer-to-peer payments. In response, the fintech is looking to get a lift from next-generation payment products like stablecoins, and working to incorporate them across its operations and products.\n“If you were to build the payments ecosystem from scratch today, it wouldn’t look like the way it does today,” said Chriss. “You would start to use some sort of blockchain, or some sort of thing that probably looks a lot like stablecoins.”\nEarly movers Chriss isn’t a latecomer to crypto. Around 12 years ago, he split the bill for a steak dinner with his friend—but decided to pay his friend back with four Bitcoin. That’d now be worth more than $350,000 at current prices. “I remind him every once in a while when I see him just how expensive that steak meal actually was,” Chriss joked.\n\nPayPal was also early to the world of digital assets. In 2014, around the same time Chriss was paying his friend back in Bitcoin, PayPal announced that a subsidiary would accept payments in the world’s largest cryptocurrency.\nDespite that bout of early experimentation, PayPal largely stayed away from crypto until 2020, when it let users buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin, Ethereum and a handful of other cryptocurrencies in its digital wallet. It’s since expanded its crypto offerings and, in 2023, took a major strategic step with the launch of its own stablecoin, PYUSD.\n“We’re a payments company and a commerce company globally, and so really the heart of what makes it really interesting about blockchain technology is thinking about stablecoin payments,” May Zabaneh, PayPal’s head of crypto, told Fortune .\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. Long popular among crypto traders, the dollar-backed tokens have more recently become touted as tools to upgrade legacy payments infrastructure, speed up cross-border transactions, and reduce transaction fees.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmid the hype, the market capitalization of PYUSD has soared—from about $500 million at the start of January to nearly $4 billion in December. While that pales in comparison to the market leader Tether, whose own stablecoin has a market capitalization of more than $185 billion, PayPal is focused more on the strategic opportunities.\n\n“Most people are focused on stablecoins’ trading market cap. They’re really doubling down in that aspect,” said Zabaneh. “But when you take it from a payments lens, you actually cut it in a very different way.”\nCurrently the payments giant is focused on integrating its stablecoin across its business verticals, bit by bit. Users can hold and earn rewards off of PYUSD in PayPal’s digital wallet and Venmo, another wallet the fintech owns. Customers who use PayPal’s payouts product, like YouTube , can elect to let recipients receive payments in the fintech’s stablecoin. And the company is even using PYUSD for its internal treasury. From August to October, PayPal transferred $1 billion in company funds across five of its corporate entities on three different continents, a spokesperson told Fortune .\n\nMeanwhile, the company also lets customers use its stablecoin at checkout, and is testing a feature to let existing merchants use PYUSD to pay their bills. “How do we enable consumer-to-business transactions and actually disrupt payments by leveraging stablecoins?” asked Chriss.\nStill, analysts are skeptical that PayPal’s stablecoin ambitions will have any immediate impact on its bottom line in the near term. “There has been no real impact to the business today,” Nate Svensson, a director in equity research at Deutsche Bank who follows PayPal, told Fortune .\nBut, that doesn’t mean there won’t be an impact in the future. “If I [were] running PayPal, I would be doing the exact same thing,” added Svensson. “I would be coming up with these solutions and capabilities, just in case there is a future eventuality where you and I start using crypto or stablecoins on a day-to-day basis.”\nAnd it’s a future that PayPal CEO Chriss, who happens to own two hippo-themed NFTs, believes in. “Crypto within PayPal as a priority is top down. It’s being led by me,” he said. “I’m making sure that crypto is top of mind and something that we’re investing in as a company.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Tesla’s ‘Musk Premium’ in Focus With SpaceX IPO in View\n\nJordan Fitzgerald\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nMU\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\n(Bloomberg) -- (Updates stock price after Thursday’s open)\nElon Musk is selling investors a future of driverless cars, robot assistants and life on Mars. The problem for investors is there’s only one way to buy into his vision: Tesla Inc.’s stock.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nNew York Utility Says Queue for Large Power Users Has Tripled\n\nThe electric-vehicle maker’s shares were up nearly 3% on Thursday. They hit their first record of the year on Tuesday amid gains of more than 20% over the last four weeks. Since tumbling to a low on April 8 during the height of panic over the Trump administration’s tariffs, the stock has soared almost 120%, putting it among the 20 best performers in the S&P 500 Index.\nThe rally is a testament to Wall Street’s faith in Musk’s artificial intelligence ambitions, particularly since Tesla’s core auto business is struggling. But it has also made Tesla shares extremely expensive. At 214 times earnings over the next 12 months, the stock has the second highest valuation in the S&P 500, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and far ahead of number three, Palantir Technologies Inc., another high-flyer that trades at 178 times forward earnings as of Wednesday’s close.\n\n“The valuation doesn’t make any sense,” said Vikram Rai, portfolio manager and macro trader at First New York, which sold its Tesla position earlier this year after Musk and President Donald Trump had a very public fallout on social media.\nA Tesla representative didn’t reply to a request for comment.\nWith Musk’s SpaceX possibly going public next year, stock traders looking for “Elon exposure” will likely have another way to get it before long. The space exploration company is planning an insider share sale that would value it at $800 billion, making it the most expensive privately held business in the world. Its initial public offering would be the largest ever.\n\n“A SpaceX IPO could lead to some selling pressure on Tesla shares,” said Dmitry Shlyapnikov, an analyst at Horizon Investments who works with portfolio managers. “There are investors that own Tesla for exposure to Elon’s ideas and not for the car company attached to the ticker.”\nOf course, there’s another school of thought that a SpaceX public stock offering would shine a spotlight on Musk, giving Tesla another jolt of momentum.\n\nStory Continues\n“Historically, when one of Musk’s companies achieves a major milestone, it tends to lift sentiment for the others,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments. “A high-profile SpaceX IPO could attract a fresh wave of investors who are drawn to his innovation story — and that enthusiasm often spills over into Tesla.”\n\nSo far, Tesla’s stock price is getting a boost from the hype surrounding SpaceX, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. The missions of the two companies are interlinked, he said, describing a future where Tesla’s Optimus robots help with Musk’s ambition to colonize Mars, and SpaceX’s Starlink satellite system bolsters vehicle connectivity on Earth.\nThe companies also share lofty valuations. But Tesla skeptics question whether the company’s fundamentals can support those numbers. Its sales are slowing and profits are falling, while regulations rise and consumers spend less on cars.\n“If you’ve been long Tesla stock, you’ve made money, there’s no denying it,” said Thomas Thornton, founder of Hedge Fund Telemetry, who has a small short position in Tesla. “It’s just bizarre to me because the fundamentals are so bad.”\n\n‘Double-Down on Elon’\nOptimists, on the other hand, point to Tesla’s growth prospects with opportunities in autonomous driving and robotaxis. Musk’s goal is to transform Tesla from an auto manufacturer to an artificial intelligence and robotics company. He wrote in a September X post that 80% of the firm’s profits will eventually come from robots.\n“We believe Tesla’s earnings are going to be growing at 30% to 35% over the next two to three years based on the innovation that they have in the automotive segment,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, which owns the company’s shares.\nIf Musk can pull that off, Tesla’s stock market valuation would make more sense. If he can’t, that’s where SpaceX comes in. Publicly traded shares of SpaceX would give investors the opportunity to own a piece of Musk’s vision without Tesla’s baggage.\n\n“I think most investors will not want to double-down on Elon,” First New York’s Rai said. “That is a lot of risk to carry.”\nNeedham analyst Chris Pierce disagrees.\n“We don’t see investors making an either/or choice, but instead backing both companies,” he said. “Investors that have made money in Tesla are likely to want to back another Musk venture.”\nFor now, the reality for investors is Tesla is the only way to bet on Musk’s vision. The immediate risk is the stock’s valuation, which is getting close to dangerous territory. On a technical level, the shares had been close to being considered overbought earlier this week. When they last reached that level in early October, the stock fell 10% over the next seven sessions.\n“In the short term, it’s probably ready for a bit of a cooling off type of period after having that all-time high,” Mulberry said.\n\nBut to long-term Musk believers, the valuation may indeed be a short-term concern. Over the next few years, however, many see Tesla as a buy regardless of the price — possibly even more than SpaceX.\n“I fully believe that at some point there will be a commercial mission to Mars, but probably not in my lifetime,” said Mulberry, who is 51 years old. “Does that mean I want to invest in that stock today? You’d have to have a really long view of that, whereas you could see the impact of robotaxis and robots probably in the next three to five years.”\nTop Tech News\nMicron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer memory chips, gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, a sign that surging demand and supply shortages are allowing the company to charge more for products.\nThe growing acrimony over the biggest deal in Hollywood is spilling into the open. On Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., the parent of HBO and CNN, advised its shareholders to reject a hostile takeover bid by Paramount Skydance Corp. in favor of its original agreement with streaming giant Netflix Inc.\nOpenAI and Anthropic are looking to expand their office footprints in Dublin, a move that underscores both firms’ growing presence in Europe and the race to boost global uptake of their artificial intelligence services.\nApple Inc. is making changes to its iOS software in Japan to comply with a new local law aimed at fostering competition, part of broader efforts by the iPhone maker to adapt to regulations around the world.\nThe Academy Awards will move to Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube service in 2029, ending more than a half century on the ABC network and more than 70 years on broadcast TV.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\nNo major earnings expected\n--With assistance from Matt Turner, David Watkins and Nathaniel Popper.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Apple opens up its App Store to competition in Japan\n\nSarah Perez\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nEPGA.PVT\n\nApple announced it will allow alternative app stores in Japan and will permit developers to process payments for digital goods and services outside of its own in-app purchase system in iOS. The iPhone maker is not making these changes because it wants to be more open; it’s being forced — in this case, to comply with the country’s Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which is now going into effect.\n\nWith this update , Apple’s App Store revenues are being impacted in another major market due to anticompetition laws and regulations. The company already has to comply with Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which previously required the tech giant to allow for alternative app stores and other changes.\nIn the U.S., Apple has been strong-armed into changing its in-payments system by way of the courts , after a lawsuit from Fortnite maker, Epic Games. Though it was not declared a monopoly, the court decided Apple needed to give developers the right to process payments outside of its system if they chose. (The specifics around that order are still being worked out after an appeal partially reversed an earlier ruling. )\nAs usual, in its announcement about the changes in Japan, Apple warned that alternative app marketplaces and payments open up “new avenues for malware, fraud, scams, and privacy and security risks.” To mitigate those risks, the company said it worked with Japanese regulators to require an authorization process for app marketplaces (“Notarization”), which it says is designed to protect children specifically from inappropriate content and scams.\n\nThe fact that Apple has come up with a process to dial back the risk for alternative app stores indicates there has always been a technical solution at hand to balance the needs for both openness and security.\nAs in the EU, Apple has come up with a complex fee structure to ensure it doesn’t lose much in the form of App Store revenue, while seemingly complying with the letter of the law.\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, of course, was not silent on this matter, saying Fortnite will still not return to iOS in Japan because Apple is charging a 21% fee on third-party in-app purchases.\nIn a post on X, he wrote , “Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan. Apple chose poorly. Again.”\n\nHe also pointed out the difference between Apple and other game store providers, like Microsoft, by asking, “Can you imagine the gamer and regulator uproar that would ensue if Microsoft required all games from Steam and Epic Games Store to call its commerce surveillance API and report all transactions back to Microsoft?”\n\nStory Continues\n“That’s what Apple just announced in Japan,” he added.\nApple noted that developers will need to agree to the latest update to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, which includes the new options for Japan , by March 17, 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump says Americans need to prepare for something the US ‘has never seen.’ How to get ready (and wealthy) in 2026\n\nJing Pan\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:13 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nJNJ\n\nTM\n\n005380.KS\n\n^GSPC\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nPresident Donald Trump says the U.S. is on the cusp of something “this country has never seen” — and he’s crediting his much-discussed tariff policy.\nSpeaking at a White House Christmas reception, Trump argued that tariffs are driving a manufacturing revival, pointing to the auto industry as a prime example (1).\n\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“Our car industry … went to Europe, they went to Mexico, Japan — they went all over. They went to South Korea,” Trump said. “And now it’s just the opposite. They’re all coming back. We have an age that’s coming up, the likes of which this country has never seen.”\nTrump pointed to Toyota, which recently announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in its U.S. operations over the next five years (2). According to Trump, companies are increasingly choosing to build in the U.S. to avoid tariffs.\n“So they’re coming from Germany, they’re coming from Japan, they’re coming from Canada. Many factories are coming in because they don’t want to pay tariffs — very simple. They’re coming in and they’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said.\nThe result, Trump says, could be a historic economic upswing.\n\n“We have a country that potentially is geared to have the most incredible golden years ever,” he said, adding that when factories open up “by the thousands,” it would mark “the golden age of America.”\nTo be sure, that manufacturing boom has yet to materialize. According to the Institute for Supply Management, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the ninth consecutive month in November (3).\nStill, Trump insists the turnaround is coming soon.\n“You’re going to see results in six months to a year. I think you’ll see results — we’ve never had anything like it,” he said.\nBetting on America While Trump’s tariff policies have drawn criticism, major companies continue to view the U.S. as one of the most dependable places to build and grow. That confidence is showing up in the scale of capital they’re committing — across multiple industries.\nFor instance, Apple has announced a sweeping $600 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and workforce training (4). Johnson & Johnson plans to put $55 billion into U.S. manufacturing, research and development and new technologies (5). Hyundai, meanwhile, is investing $26 billion in the U.S. to boost automotive production capacity, localize key components and accelerate work on future industries (6).\n\nStory Continues\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett has long pointed to America as a prime destination for building long-term wealth.\n“America has been a terrific country for investors. All they have needed to do is sit quietly, listening to no one,” Buffett wrote in his 2023 letter to shareholders (7).\nOne of the simplest and most accessible ways to invest in America is through the stock market. Buffett has argued that doing so doesn’t require picking individual winners.\n\n“In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,” Buffett has famously stated (8). This approach gives investors exposure to 500 of America’s largest companies across a wide range of industries, providing instant diversification without the need for constant monitoring or active trading.\nIf you want to capitalize on this consistency, you could work with SoFi to invest in ETFs like an S&P 500 index fund.

      "Content": "2 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy No Matter What Happens in 2026\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points These two tech leaders had a challenging year but have demonstrated their resilience.\nThey also boast strong prospects and economic moats, making them excellent long-term investments.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nIn 2025, tariff threats and trade wars rocked equities and nearly triggered a full-blown bear market. Despite all that, stocks have performed pretty well this year.\n\nWhat's in store for 2026? Nobody knows. However, some companies can navigate the challenges ahead -- whatever they may be -- and perform well over the long run. These are the kind of businesses that investors want to set their eyes on.\nHere are two excellent, well-known candidates that fit the bill: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . These longtime market beaters are still worth investing in and sticking with next year and beyond.\n1. Amazon Amazon has basically moved sideways this year. The e-commerce specialist is lagging broader equities and most of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers. What's going on with the company?\nThere are several things, and here's one of the most important: Many investors are worried that the company is losing market share to its closest competitors in the cloud computing industry.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) accounts for most of Amazon's operating profits, as it boasts much juicier margins than its e-commerce operations. If it loses ground in this market, Amazon could see slower-growing earnings. That said, Amazon is showing it can perform well, despite this issue.\nDuring the third quarter, the company's sales growth within AWS accelerated, compared to recent quarters, and was stronger than anything investors have seen since 2022. Amazon maintains its lead at the top of the cloud computing industry.\nElsewhere, the company is seeking ways to enhance margins and profits within its e-commerce division. To that end, it has deployed a fleet of industrial robots in its warehouses.\nThe company's goal with this initiative is twofold. First, it will seek to cut costs while making shipping and deliveries faster, thereby improving the customer experience. Amazon's efforts here could help increase its razor-thin margin in its e-commerce division. Even a relatively small improvement may meaningfully boost the company's earnings.\n\nSecond, Amazon has several other potential growth drivers. Its advertising business is going strong, and it's making strides within its healthcare division, thanks to initiatives such as Amazon Pharmacy. And here's the best part: The industries and markets where it dominates still have significant long-term growth prospects.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's the case with e-commerce, which, despite its seeming ubiquity, still captures less than 20% of retail transactions in the U.S. It's also true of cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), which, CEO Andy Jassy has observed, are still in their early innings.\nLastly, Amazon has a wide economic moat due to its brand name, switching costs, and network effects. The company's investment thesis remains intact, despite the headwinds it has faced in 2025.\n\n2. Apple Apple is more exposed to the threat of tariffs than perhaps any of its similarly sized peers. The company still generates most of its sales from its hardware devices, particularly the iPhone, which is manufactured in countries such as China -- a country on which the Trump administration tried to impose steep tariffs.\n\nDespite all that, Apple's shares are up 12% year to date. That's below the performance of the S&P 500 but better than many expected six months ago.\nApple's strength lies in its ability to continue convincing new and existing customers to purchase more iPhones. The company's latest launch, the iPhone 17, was well received and is expected to drive a strong renewal cycle over the next three years, helping to maintain decent sales growth.\nHowever, Apple's hardware business isn't where the company's most important long-term opportunities lie. The company's services segment -- where Apple boasts more than 1 billion paid memberships -- arguably takes that crown. It accounted for a meaningful 39% of its sales, as of the last quarter.\n\nMoreover, the services segment has been growing its revenue, on average, faster than the rest of the business for years, a trend that should continue for the foreseeable future. Since services boast significantly higher margins than hardware sales, Apple's profits should increase meaningfully over the long run as the company expands this segment.\nRevenue from services will rise as Apple's large installed base of devices expands. The company routinely hits new highs in that department. And given the company's high switching costs -- Apple makes it hard to leave its ecosystem -- Apple's installed base should, at the very least, remain stable.\nApple has demonstrated that it can navigate the threat from tariffs, still maintains a solid hardware business, and boasts attractive tailwinds within services. To top it all off, it remains an excellent dividend stock . These are all good reasons to stick with Apple in 2026 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

Developers may add their own in-app payment methods, but Apple's will remain accessible.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with FRA:CVC1.\nIs AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThis is another major adjustment in Apple's worldwide App Store business, which has faced regulatory criticism in many nations. Developers pay Apple up to 30% on digital sales. Japan's new laws vary from Europe's, where Apple must expose its iOS environment. Apple approves third-party marketplaces in Japan and applies age ratings and notarization to any software sold outside its store.Apple also charged 15% for external payment connections in applications and 26% for App Store in-app purchases. Apple must also handle third-party device access requests, although it may refuse privacy-risky requests. The legislation requires hardware compatibility.Apple claimed it reduced security risks and maintained privacy requirements under the new approach. The company's compliance in Japan follows European and US legal actions. By 2025, Japan's restrictions will harm Apple's valuable services business, so investors will look for updates.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.: Why the Mag 7 needs to 'recalibrate'\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is concentrated primarily in the top ten technology stocks, according to Barclays.\nPNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati, Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré , and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss the market's concentration in tech and whether it's time for investors to start selling the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat I mentioned at the top about how much concentration risk there is in the S&P 500. What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\nWhich produces these results:\nThe two companies we’re going to look at that meet our criteria are Tesla (TSLA) and Apple (AAPL).\nTesla Bull Put Spread\nA bull put spread is a defined risk option strategy that profits if the stock closes above the short strike at expiry.\nTo execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.\nThis bull put spread comes from the vertical spread screener on the TSLA page.\nThis bull put spread trade involves selling the January expiry $410 strike put and buying the $400 strike put.\nSelling this spread results in a credit of around $1.35 or $135 per contract. That is also the maximum possible gain on the trade. The maximum potential loss can be calculated by taking the spread width, less the premium received and multiplying by 100. That give us:\n\n10 – 1.35 x 100 = $865.\nIf we take the maximum gain divided by the maximum loss, we see the trade has a return potential of 15.61%.\nThe loss probability is 17.0%, although this is just an estimate.\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion rating is a 100% Buy with a Average short term outlook on maintaining the current direction.\nLong term indicators fully support a continuation of the trend.\nApple Bull Put Spread\nFor Apple, let’s also look at the Bull Put Spread results for January.\nLet’s use the first line item as an example. This bull put spread trade involves selling the January expiry $265 strike put and buying the $255 strike put.\nSelling this spread results in a credit of around $1.74 or $174 per contract. That is also the maximum possible gain on the trade. The maximum potential loss can be calculated by taking the spread width, less the premium received and multiplying by 100. That give us:\n10 – 1.74 x 100 = $826.\nIf we take the maximum gain divided by the maximum loss, we see the trade has a return potential of 21.07%.\nThe loss probability is 28.8%, although this is just an estimate.\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion rating is a 80% Buy with a Weakening short term outlook on maintaining the current direction.\n\nStory Continues\nLong term indicators fully support a continuation of the trend.\nRelative Strength just crossed below 50%. The market is indicating support for a bearish trend.\nConclusion\nThere you have two bullish trade ideas on two different stocks.

      "Content": "Alphabet Has Another Hidden Asset, and Its Value Is About to Go to the Moon in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Alphabet's core business remains Google, but it has several other prominent businesses.\nThe company has some hidden assets in Waymo and quantum computing, but a lesser-known one is its investment in space companies.\nThe company is about to see a big windfall from its earlier investment in SpaceX.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is best known for Google, which is the most dominant search engine on the planet. Google commands an approximate 90% market share in search, in large part due to the distribution advantages it has. The company owns both the world's leading web browser in Chrome and the No. 1 smartphone operating system in Android.\nAlphabet also has a search revenue-sharing deal with Apple to be the default search on all its devices. This essentially makes Google the gateway to the internet for most people. Meanwhile, the company monetizes its search engine through the massive global ad network it has created, which can serve everything from global brands to local merchants. It has gained both the trust of users and advertisers, creating a power network effect that is still in place, even as the market shifts due to the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) .\nAlphabet's many businesses However, Google is not Alphabet's only business. It also owns the popular YouTube streaming service, which is the largest video platform on the planet. It also owns a plethora of apps and tools, such as Google Maps, Gmail, and Google Workspace. The company also helps other websites and apps monetize their content through its AdSense network.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's fastest-growing segment is its cloud computing business, Google Cloud. This is an infrastructure-as-a-service business that has been seeing strong growth driven by AI, as customers look to build out their own AI models and apps.\nAlphabet has established a nice edge in this business, as the company has developed its own custom AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), that give it a big cost advantage compared to competitors. It has also helped build one of the top large language models (LLMs) in Gemini, which it lets customers use as a foundational model to build upon. And it's infused Gemini across its own products to make them better.\nAlphabet also has some attractive emerging bets. The one furthest along is its robotaxi business, Waymo. Waymo is expanding rapidly across the U.S. and recently surpassed 450,000 weekly paid rides. It currently has a big first-mover advantage in the U.S. and is also looking to expand internationally into Tokyo, Japan, and London, England. This business could be a big growth driver for the company in the future.\n\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, it is also making strides in the area of quantum computing. Its Willow chip has shown the ability to correct errors in real-time as it scales, which is a major hurdle for the space. Quantum computing is likely many years away from becoming a contributing business, but it's another area where Alphabet is leading the way.\n\nAnother hidden asset While Waymo and its quantum computing unit are two hidden assets at Alphabet, they are not the only ones. Alphabet also owns about a 7% stake in Elon Musk's SpaceX, which could IPO late next year.\nAlphabet made a $900 million investment in SpaceX back in 2015, when the company was valued at around $12 billion. In a secondary market transaction, the company was recently valued at $800 billion, and Musk has said he will be looking for a $1.5 trillion valuation in an IPO. That would value Alphabet's stake at over $100 billion.\n\nSpaceX could look to go public next year to help fund an increasing launch schedule. The company has launched over 100 rockets just this year, with more than 70 for its own Starlink satellites. The company has established a huge satellite network that now powers its Starlink high-speed mobile internet service, which can work around the globe, even in remote areas. That business has been booming, with the company having more than 8 million customers, and the service available in 150 markets and being used by about two dozen airlines.\nSpaceX also makes money through launch services for both the U.S. government and commercial customers. Meanwhile, it also has big ambitions for orbital data centers, which would use solar power from the sun and have free cooling. While that may sound far-fetched, a lot of companies are actually looking into it, including Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet plans to test orbital data centers with its Project Suncatcher, in partnership with satellite imagery company Planet Labs , in which Alphabet owns a 10% stake. It will launch two prototype satellites in 2027 to test the technology and how the hardware handles being in space. Alphabet also owns a stake in AST SpaceMobile , which has a technology that lets satellite networks connect to current smartphones.\nSo, in addition to its many well-publicized businesses, Alphabet also has a nice investment portfolio of intriguing space businesses, one of which is about to be worth a lot of money in SpaceX. However, that's just an added reason to own the stock. The main reason to own it is that it's becoming an AI leader that has the most complete tech stack of any company, with its highly regarded custom AI chips and world-class Gemini AI model. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively valued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27 times 2026 analyst estimates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Mobile phone IDs may help fight fraud\n\nJustin Bachman\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 1:37 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nThis story was originally published on Payments Dive . To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Payments Dive newsletter .\nFraud represents a global financial scourge but people&rsquo;s biometric connections to their mobile phones could help better thwart criminals.\nA secure digital identification system paired with the common face and fingerprint ID tools in Apple and Google-Android devices could do more to reduce fraud schemes, Rep. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat, said Tuesday.\n\nThe &ldquo;tool at hand&rdquo; to provide a biometric-based identification system to fight fraud is &ldquo;trusted electronics in your cell phone associated with a national ID, a Real ID, a passport, something similar to that,&rdquo; Foster said. &ldquo;Other countries get this. And it&rsquo;s amazing how that just enables a flowering ecosystem of financial products.&rdquo;\nFoster and Rep. Dan Meuser, a Pennsylvania Republican, spoke at a financial conference sponsored by a banking trade group and The Hill, a Washington media organization.\nA digital ID offers multiple anti-fraud benefits in that a digital passport or Real ID-compliant driver&rsquo;s license offers &ldquo;a legally traceable person,&rdquo; said Foster, who sits on four House committees that deal with financial services, financial technology, national security and illicit finance.\n\nAdditionally, the digital ID is being presented on a mobile phone associated with the same ID and the device can confirm that the rightful owner had completed a biometric login, said Foster, whose district covers western suburbs of Chicago.\nA person&rsquo;s biometric access and their digital ID within the device could become a potent combination to help quash many fraud attempts, Foster said, with Meuser in agreement.\nMost of the recent Android-based and Apple phones require a biometric login to use them &ndash; Apple&rsquo;s latest iPhone 17 is unlocked with facial recognition technology &ndash; but the concept of integrating one&rsquo;s identification documentation into phones is far newer.\nThere are steps in that direction, however. Last month, Apple introduced a Digital ID function for its phones to allow users to load their passport information into its wallet tool.\n\nThat ID, accessed on an Apple phone or watch, is being tested for domestic travel at 250 airports with the Transportation Security Administration.To date, 19 states and Puerto Rico have begun allowing digital IDs , although not every state recognizes every device, and some states require use of their own app, according to the TSA.\n\nStory Continues\nDespite the growth of digital technologies, many U.S. businesses and government agencies still take a dated approach to identity security, said Meuser, who sits on the House Committee on Financial Services with Foster.\n&ldquo;They ask you your mother&rsquo;s maiden name, things like that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sort of rudimentary compared to what could be done and is being done successfully elsewhere.&rdquo;\n\nPandemic benefits distributed by the federal government in 2020 demonstrated the shortcomings of the U.S.&rsquo;s current system of ID verification and payments, Foster said, explaining how hackers intercepted as much as $300 billion in benefits payments to U.S. taxpayers.\n&ldquo;And that did not happen in countries that had a secure digital ID,&rdquo; he said.\nIn those countries, Foster said, people eligible for government benefits logged into their phones to authenticate their bank account information, with funds sent directly to that account holder.\n&ldquo;That stopped the North Korean hackers cold, because they can steal a million passwords, but unless they also steal a million cellphones and can do the biometric login on those stolen cell phones, they&rsquo;re out of business,&rdquo; he contended.\n\nOne big challenge for digital ID efforts &ndash; or what Foster termed &ldquo;something that sort of smells like a national ID card&rdquo; &ndash; is that people on the left and right sides of the political spectrum object vociferously, he noted.\n&ldquo;The vast majority of people in the middle just want a system that is reasonably secure and reasonably private and very trustworthy,&rdquo; Foster said. &ldquo;People are sick and tired of spending the afternoon on hold, changing all of their credit cards and magazine subscriptions because someone&rsquo;s stolen their numbers.&rdquo;\nRecommended Reading\nPayment players offer fraud fixes\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) is one of the Top AI and Technology Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. On December 8, Evercore ISI lifted the price target on the company’s stock to $325 from $300, while keeping an “Outperform” rating on the company’s stock. As per the analyst, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s upcoming Siri 2.0, powered by Gemini, is expected to act as a catalyst for potential upside in profits and valuation. The strategic launch has been planned for March 2026.\nIn a different update, Citi raised the price objective on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s stock to $330, hinting at stronger-than-expected momentum for the iPhone 17 cycle, along with a healthier upgrade pool moving ahead into 2026 and 2027. Notably, the firm expects iPhone upside in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s December and March quarters, amidst iPhone 12 and 13 users entering the company’s upgrade window. Also, Citi raised its earnings estimates to reflect iPhone 17 strength.\n\nThe firm’s analyst expects further tailwinds due to the company’s shift to WMCM (Wafer-level Multi-Chip Module) packaging in 2026. This can enable efficiency gains and place future devices for heavier on-device AI workloads. Furthermore, the firm bases the new target on a ~33x multiple of 2027 earnings. According to Citi, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s margin profile, services mix, and balance sheet tend to justify the premium.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

These updates create new options for developers to distribute apps on alternative app marketplaces and to process app payments for digital goods and services outside of Apple In-App Purchase. Across these changes, Apple has worked to reduce new privacy and security risks the law creates to provide users in Japan the best and safest experience possible.\n\nThe MSCA’s requirements for alternative app marketplaces and app payments open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, and privacy and security risks. Apple has worked with Japanese regulators to introduce protections from new threats — including important safeguards for younger users. These protections include Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization process for app marketplaces, and requirements that help protect children from inappropriate content and scams.\nWhile these safeguards do not eliminate the new risks, they are essential to Apple’s work to ensure iOS remains the best, most secure mobile platform available in Japan. Apple will continue to engage with regulators on strengthening protections for iOS users.\nDevelopers can learn about the new capabilities on the Apple Developer Support page and can integrate them into their apps beginning today as part of the iOS 26.2 release.\n\nNew Options for Developers to Distribute Apps on iOS in Japan\nThe App Store® — where every app is reviewed to meet the App Store’s high bar for privacy and security — remains the best place for iOS users in Japan to discover and download the apps they love. This includes App Store features that protect users against fraud and scams and empower parents to ensure their kids have age-appropriate experiences.\nWith the MSCA’s new requirements, developers will also have the option to distribute iOS apps in Japan using alternative app marketplaces other than the App Store. Alternative app marketplaces will have to be authorized by Apple and will need to meet ongoing requirements to serve developers and users. However, apps downloaded outside the App Store will not benefit from the same protections Apple provides through App Review, introducing new risks for apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content not allowed on the App Store.\n\nStory Continues\nTo reduce some of these new risks, Apple will conduct a baseline review — called Notarization — that applies to all iOS apps and focuses on basic functionality and protecting users from serious threats. This Notarization process involves a combination of automated checks and human review, and helps ensure apps function as promised and are free of known malware, viruses, or other security threats. However, Notarization is less comprehensive than the App Review process that applies to all apps on the App Store.\n\nDevelopers can learn more about operating or distributing from alternative app marketplaces on the new Apple Developer Support page .\nNew Options for Payments in App Store Apps on iOS\nOn the App Store, users in Japan can continue to use Apple In-App Purchase to buy digital goods and services, manage subscriptions, request refunds, and view their payment history.\nTo comply with the MSCA, Apple is sharing tools that enable developers to offer more ways for users to purchase digital goods and services in apps on the App Store. For their iOS apps distributed on the App Store in Japan, developers will be able to include an alternative payment processing method in their app and/or link users to a website to complete a transaction.\nThese alternative payment options will always be presented alongside Apple In-App Purchase, so that users in Japan are clear on when they are transacting through Apple. When users choose to pay with Apple In-App Purchase, they’ll continue to receive familiar protections and tools like refund support, subscription management, and Report a Problem. App Store users’ purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using Apple In-App Purchase.\n\nFor apps that use alternative payment processing or link users to the web for transactions, Apple will not be able to issue refunds and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud. Users may need to share their payment information with additional parties, which can introduce new privacy and security risks.\nUpdated Business Terms for iOS Apps in Japan\nTo reflect these options for app distribution and payment processing, Apple is also sharing updated business terms for developers’ iOS apps in Japan. These business terms reflect the many ways Apple creates value for developers’ apps, whether or not they use the App Store and/or Apple In-App Purchase.\nUnder the business terms for iOS apps in Japan, Apple will continue to only charge a commission on the sale of digital goods and services. The new terms include:\n\nApp Store commission : iOS apps on the App Store will pay a reduced commission of either 10 percent for the vast majority of developers — including members of the Small Business Program, Video Partner Program, Mini Apps Partner Program, and for subscriptions following their first year — or 21 percent on transactions for digital goods and services. The App Store commission reflects the value of the tools, technology, and services that enable developers to create apps, in addition to App Store distribution, discovery, and ongoing services.\nApple payment processing fee : In their iOS apps on the App Store, developers can process payments using Apple In-App Purchase for an additional 5 percent fee.\nStore services commission : iOS apps on the App Store will pay a commission of 15 percent on transactions for digital goods and services made on a website linked to by the developer’s app. Developers in the programs mentioned above, and subscriptions following their first year, will pay a reduced rate of 10 percent.\nCore Technology Commission : iOS apps distributed outside of the App Store will pay a 5 percent commission on the sale of digital goods and services, including paid apps. The Core Technology Commission compensates Apple for the tools, technologies, and services that enable developers to build and share their apps with iOS users.\n\nUnder these new business terms, developers that sell digital goods and services in Japan will pay Apple the same or less than they do today. Developers that do not sell digital goods and services will continue not to pay Apple any commissions or fees.\nImpacts to Kids’ Online Safety\nApple created the App Store to be a safe place for kids, where parents are empowered to ensure their children have age-appropriate experiences and have the tools they need to keep their children safe online. That’s why Apple has created industry-leading features like age ratings, Content & Privacy Restrictions, content filters, Ask to Buy, and powerful controls that help parents choose how children use their devices.\nWith the changes introduced under the MSCA, the new options for alternative distribution and payment methods may expose children to new risks. For instance, apps downloaded from outside the App Store may include illicit and objectionable content, and they will not undergo the same rigorous review process Apple employs to evaluate apps made for children on the App Store. For instance, similar regulatory changes in Europe have enabled types of apps that were previously unavailable on iOS, including pornography apps.\n\nIn an effort to reduce new risks of fraud or scams targeting children, Apple has worked with regulators in Japan to preserve some guardrails, including:\nApps in the Kids category on the App Store will not include links to websites to complete transactions, to reduce the risk of fraud or scams targeting children.\nFor users under 18 years old , all apps from the App Store that use alternative payment processing or link to a website for transactions must include a parental gate that requires younger users to involve their parent or guardian before making a purchase.\nFor users under 13 years old, apps from the App Store cannot link to websites for transactions to protect against the risk of scams that target younger kids.\nApple is also working to provide developers using alternative payments with a new API so they can enable parents to monitor and approve purchases made outside of Apple In-App Purchase.\n\nDevelopers must also continue to provide age ratings for their apps, whether their app is distributed on the App Store or an alternative app marketplace.\nApple will continue innovating to meet the evolving risks to kids’ safety online by building on the powerful tools and features it makes available today — like Child Accounts, web content filters, app restrictions, monitoring tools like Screen Time and Family Sharing, Communication Safety, and Communication Limits, which help parents shape who their children communicate with and shield them from inappropriate content.\nAdditional Updates to iOS\nAlongside the new app distribution and payment options, Apple has introduced additional controls and choices for users in Japan with the release of iOS 26.2. These include:\n\nA browser choice screen and search engine choice experience , giving users in Japan new ways to pick their preferred browser and search engine.\nDefault controls for navigation apps and app marketplaces.\nAcross these controls, users can review and adjust their choices at any time in Settings.\nFor developers, Apple is sharing tools in addition to the new options for alternative distribution and app payments, including:\nNew options for developers of browser apps to use alternative browser engines other than WebKit, with strict security and privacy requirements.\nA new API that enables developers of voice-based conversational apps to provide users the option to launch their app with the iPhone® side button.\nA process to request interoperability with core technologies in iPhone and iOS.\n\nApple is providing detailed resources to help developers understand the options now available for their apps in Japan, which they can access from the Apple Developer Support page .\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple’s six software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV. Apple’s more than 150,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n\nNOTE TO EDITORS: For additional information visit Apple Newsroom ( www.apple.com/newsroom ), or email Apple’s Media Helpline at media.help@apple.com .\n© 2025 Apple Inc.

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the Next $4 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:50 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Alphabet's market cap has come out of nowhere to surpass Microsoft's.\nMassive investments in its technology and the release of Gemini 3 have dramatically changed perceptions about the Google parent.\nAlphabet has the second-lowest P/E ratio in the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nMany investors were shocked when Nvidia became the first company to achieve a $4 trillion market cap . The competition for the world's largest market cap was long a contest between Apple and Microsoft , so to see Nvidia emerge out of nowhere likely came as a surprise.\nNow, the question is, which company is the next to achieve a $4 trillion market cap? Today, Apple has already achieved that, but instead of Microsoft (which previously reached that point before retreating), I believe another emerging company will be the next one to reach this milestone. Here's why.\nThe next $4 trillion company Today, the stock most likely to reach $4 trillion and stay above that point is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . Currently, its market cap is at $3.7 trillion, surpassing Microsoft's current $3.5 trillion market cap.\nThat choice may come as a surprise to some investors. As recently as spring 2025, the Google parent's market cap was under $2 trillion.\nAlphabet stock had long been smaller than many of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, as the rise of ChatGPT weighed on the stock. When GPT-4 came out in 2023, investors soured on Google Search, and its market share had fallen below 90% for the first time in decades.\nAt that point, not only did ChatGPT offer more thorough and concise results, but it bypassed the advertising ecosystem that had long served as the primary source of the Google parent's revenue.\n\nThe company released Google Gemini later that year. Still, Gemini did not initially stand out from the likes of Claude, Grok, Copilot, and numerous other AI platforms trying to unseat ChatGPT.\nAlso, investors should remember that Alphabet has long worked to reduce its dependence on advertising for revenue. In recent years, Google Cloud has claimed an increasing share of the revenue. Still, even though Alphabet was an early pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI), these efforts did not seem to impress investors.\nWhat changed? However, Alphabet has long benefited from a massive level of liquidity and considerable free cash flows. In late 2024, it pledged to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures (capex) in 2025, later raising that to the $91 billion-$93 billion range.\nMuch of that spending has gone into improving legacy products. Search now incorporates AI-driven results, and Google Cloud offers upgraded infrastructure, multimodality AI models, and new tools for developers. Additionally, AI should help to make Waymo a source of revenue as it seeks to compete in the autonomous driving space.\n\nStory continues\nNonetheless, it seems to be the release of Gemini 3 in November that has captured the most attention recently. With improved reasoning, coding, and multimodal understanding, some analysts claim it is \"better than ChatGPT.\"\nWith that, the stock is up more than 60% over the last year, and more than 110% from its April low. Not surprisingly, almost half of that increase has occurred since October.\nMoreover, despite these gains, it is the second-cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. Its P/E ratio of around 30 is undercut only by Meta Platforms , a stock trading at 28 times earnings. That comparative discount could give investors all the more reason to continue buying stock in the Google parent.\nAlphabet at $4 trillion (and beyond) Between the relatively low valuation and the newfound success of Gemini 3, Alphabet appears likely to reach $4 trillion next.\nUltimately, investors like winners in cutting-edge technologies, and amid Alphabet's massive investments, having Gemini 3 perceived as \"better than ChatGPT\" positions Alphabet stock for higher moves.\n\nAdditionally, the AI pioneer is aggressively applying the technology to Google Cloud, and its efforts with Waymo could begin to bear fruit soon. As investors notice the stock as undervalued relative to peers, it continues to benefit from numerous tailwinds.\nAmid such successes, Alphabet may not only reach $4 trillion, but could challenge Apple and Nvidia for the world's largest market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 2 AI Darlings Will Be Worth $5 Trillion or More in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Nvidia's growth is expected to be rapid in 2026.\nAlphabet could see its valuation increase and strong growth continue to cross the $5 trillion mark.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nCurrently, there are no stocks with a $5 trillion market cap or greater. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is valued at $4.3 trillion, and was recently valued at over $5 trillion before pulling back. Following up Nvidia are Apple at $4 trillion, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) at $3.7 trillion, and Microsoft at $3.5 trillion. These are the only real candidates that can be worth $5 trillion or more, as Amazon is the fifth-largest company in the world at $2.6 trillion, which means its stock would have to more than double to breach the $5 trillion threshold.\nSo, of these four, which ones could be worth $5 trillion or more in 2026? I think there are only two real answers, and one may surprise you.\nReaching the $5 trillion valuation threshold won't be easy for one of these stocks It should come as no surprise that I think Nvidia will cross the $5 trillion valuation threshold in 2026. It's still growing at a rapid pace thanks to its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPU) technology stack. Demand for artificial intelligence computing power in data centers isn't slowing down, and it is shouldn't for some time. Nvidia believes global data center capital expenditures will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from $600 billion in 2025. Should that come to fruition, Nvidia would be a monster performer over the next five years, and 2026 is shaping up to be another phenomenal year.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs, although he didn't elaborate on how far in the future they are sold out. Regardless, demand outpaces supply for its GPUs, which allows it to maintain high prices and lofty profit margins. This will fuel Nvidia's growth in 2026, and Wall Street analysts are expecting 48% growth again in fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027) after rising a projected 63% in fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026).\nWith growth like that, it won't take a whole lot for Nvidia to reach the $5 trillion threshold in 2026.\nHowever, it will take a bit more effort from Alphabet.\nAlphabet was a bit of a laggard in the AI arms race because competitors launched generative AI tools before it did. Furthermore, the initial release of its model was bad and caused several PR nightmares. However, Alphabet has addressed those issues and is now one of the leading providers of generative AI. In addition, Alphabet's core Google search business was spared from being broken up due to monopoly concerns earlier this year, and its future is now much clearer than it was just six months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nSince July 1, Alphabet's stock has been on fire, rising about 80%. However, for Alphabet's stock to be worth $5 trillion, it must rise at least 35% from today's levels.\nCan it do that?\nAlphabet's earnings growth has been impressive in recent quarters There are a few ways for a stock to rise: growing revenue and earnings, or an increase in valuation. Both of these are reasonable actions for a share price to rise, and Alphabet will likely need a boost from both to cross the $5 trillion threshold. In Q3, revenue rose 16% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 35%. If Alphabet can keep up its EPS growth, then it could cross the $5 trillion threshold with growth alone. However, I think it could also use some help in the valuation department.\nDespite growing at the same pace or faster than Apple or Microsoft, Alphabet trades at a discount from a price-to-earnings perspective.\nShould Alphabet's stock receive a 35 times trailing earnings valuation, that would result in 14% growth alone.\nAlphabet will need all the help it can get to reach a $5 trillion valuation by the end of 2026, but I think it can do it. Even if it doesn't, I think it could easily reach that level by 2027.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "3 Best Tech ETF Picks for 2026\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 1:18 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Tech has been a strong outperformer, but it might be time to rethink investing in this sector.\nCompanies with strong fundamentals and more reasonable valuations present enticing opportunities.\nSoftware and digital payments are two subsectors that have the chance to outperform in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Amplify ETF Trust - Amplify Digital Payments ETF ›\n\nAs we wrap up 2025, tech stocks are again on pace to be one of the best-performing S&P 500 sectors. Fueled by strong demand for anything tied to artificial intelligence (AI) , investors steadily bought stocks and pushed the Nasdaq-100 index to several new all-time highs.\nWhile the \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks helped lead the way higher, 2026 may not be a repeat. If you're looking to invest in tech, it may be time to look beyond just Nvidia , Microsoft , and Apple . While these have been terrific-performing companies for a long time, there are a number of opportunities within the sector that may be flying under the radar.\nIn particular, undervalued areas of the tech sector could see better performance. The mega-cap companies, as well as chip stocks, have really gotten all the attention lately. Areas, such as software and digital payments, could enjoy renewed interest if investors begin seeking out more value-oriented stocks backed by healthy fundamentals.\nHere are three tech ETFs that I believe could outperform in the coming year.\nInvesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: RSPT) invests in all of the big large-cap tech companies, but removes the concentration factor. It equally weights the roughly 70 tech stocks within the S&P 500 and rebalances quarterly to ensure it maintains its diversified exposure.\n\nRSPT is a great way to invest in the tech stocks that have led the market over the past several years, but broaden out the exposure in case the mega-cap names begin to underperform. We've already seen some hints that investors are worried about Magnificent Seven valuations. This ETF allows you to invest in the long-term tech narrative while mitigating some of that idiosyncratic risk.\nTop holdings currently include Western Digital , Micron Technology , and Teradyne .\nAmplify Digital Payments ETF Think of the one thing that almost every person does at least once a day (and probably multiple times): buy something! Years ago, people would pay for these purchases using cash or a check. Today, everybody uses credit cards or some form of digital payment, such as PayPal .\nThe Amplify Digital Payments ETF (NYSEMKT: IPAY) invests in all the major companies that provide payment services. Its top three holdings -- American Express , Visa , and MasterCard -- are all major credit card issuers, but other companies within the top 10 reflect how the entire sector is evolving. PayPal is more of a traditional online payment platform. Global Payments is a payment processor and software provider. Coinbase Global is a cryptocurrency trading platform.\n\nStory Continues\nThe transaction processing space is already a big cash flow generator. Adding the next-generation fintech evolution to it provides a great long-term growth opportunity.\niShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF Ever since coming out of the 2022 bear market, software has been a tech laggard. The AI boom had investors gravitating toward semiconductor stocks, leaving certain segments of the sector underbought and unloved.\nWithin the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGV) , there are a lot of high-quality companies with strong revenue growth and solid margins that could finally see some of that value get unlocked in 2026. Top 10 holdings include Palantir Technologies , Salesforce , Intuit , and ServiceNow alongside industry heavyweight Microsoft.\n\nSoftware is intriguing because it covers so many areas within tech. IGV is essentially an investment in cloud computing, enterprise automation, cybersecurity, and AI productivity tools. There's constant demand for performance improvement and staying ahead of the latest threats. That makes a lot of these companies steady cash flow generators that can actually add some stability to a portfolio.\nWith software lagging behind the Nasdaq-100 in 2025, there's some catch-up potential in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amplify ETF Trust - Amplify Digital Payments ETF right now?

      "Content": "Dear BlackBerry Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for December 18\n\nAnushka Mukherji\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:44 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BB\n\nAAPL\n\nOnce a household name in smartphones, BlackBerry (BB) famously lost its grip on the booming mobile market to Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone and Android-powered rivals. After walking away from handset manufacturing altogether, the company reinvented itself as a software-driven player focused on Internet of Things (IoT) and cybersecurity solutions. Even as competition in the cybersecurity software space continues to heat up, BlackBerry stock has still managed a respectable run in 2025, albeit with some volatility, supported by solid financial performance that has helped keep investor confidence intact.\n\nThat optimism was reinforced in September, when BlackBerry delivered a strong fiscal 2026 second-quarter earnings report, highlighted by particularly robust results from its QNX segment, which quickly caught the market’s attention. Now, the company is preparing to report its third-quarter earnings on Dec. 18, and Wall Street is heading into the release expecting meaningful gains in the upcoming quarter. With that backdrop, here’s a closer look at what lies ahead for BlackBerry.\nMore News from Barchart While AI Panic Struck Applied Digital (APLD) Stock, the Smart Money Has a Different View\nJPMorgan Says to Sell NVDA March $160 Puts.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nAbout BlackBerry Stock Founded in 1984, BlackBerry built its legacy as a pioneer of secure mobile communication, once dominating the smartphone market with its iconic keyboard devices. Headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, the company has since exited the handset business completely and reinvented itself as a software-first enterprise focused on mission-critical technologies. Today, BlackBerry supports enterprises and governments with intelligent software and services that keep the world running behind the scenes.\n\nThe company’s high-performance foundational software empowers top automakers and industrial leaders to build transformative applications, open up new revenue opportunities, and introduce innovative business models, while maintaining the highest standards of safety, security, and reliability. Its QNX operating system is a key revenue engine, embedded in millions of vehicles worldwide and increasingly central to next-generation automotive and industrial systems.\nAlongside this, BlackBerry’s cybersecurity business delivers endpoint protection, secure communications, and threat intelligence to enterprises and governments, positioning the company as a behind-the-scenes enabler of safety, security, and connectivity in an increasingly digital world. The company is currently valued at a market capitalization of roughly $2.6 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nAfter surging an impressive 32.34% over the past year, BlackBerry’s rally has lost some steam more recently as investors weigh uncertainties around its ongoing shift toward cybersecurity and IoT, along with renewed debate over the company’s long-term direction. Even so, the stock has held up well in 2025, rising a solid 12.04% for the year, just a notch below the broader S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) 14.49% gain during the same stretch.\nA Look Inside BlackBerry’s Q2 Performance On Sept. 25, BlackBerry delivered a standout second-quarter earnings report that showcased clear operational progress and marked its second consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. The results exceeded expectations across the board and sparked a strong market reaction, with the stock surging nearly 9% on the day of the announcement, followed by another 6.7% gain on Sept. 26.\n\nFor the quarter, BlackBerry reported revenue of $129.6 million, up 3% year-over-year (YOY), comfortably topping Wall Street’s $122 million forecast and landing above management’s own guidance. Strength was evident across BlackBerry’s key businesses, led by its QNX division, which focuses on embedded software for automotive and IoT applications. QNX generated $63.1 million in revenue, representing a robust 15% YOY increase and coming in ahead of guidance.\nAlso, the segment delivered an impressive 32% adjusted EBITDA margin, while its adjusted gross margin remained flat at a healthy 83%, highlighting the durability and profitability of the platform. The company’s Secure Communications segment, which includes UEM, SecuSUITE, and AtHoc, also posted solid results, generating $59.9 million in revenue during the quarter.\n\nImportantly, Secure Communications' annual recurring revenue (ARR) continued to trend higher, rising both YOY and sequentially to $213 million, signaling improving momentum and revenue visibility. Profitability further strengthened BlackBerry’s investment case. The company posted GAAP earnings of $0.02 per share, a sharp reversal from a loss of $0.03 per share in the year-ago quarter.\nOn an adjusted basis, earnings came in at $0.04 per share, well ahead of Wall Street’s $0.01 estimate. Additionally, BlackBerry returned $20 million to shareholders through the repurchase of roughly five million common shares during the quarter, while total cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term investments declined $18.4 million sequentially to $363.5 million.\n\nDear BlackBerry Investors, Mark Your Calendars for Dec. 18 Looking ahead to the third quarter, BlackBerry’s management has laid out an upbeat outlook. The company expects revenue to come in between $132 million and $140 million, with the fast-growing QNX segment projected to deliver $66 million to $70 million in revenue. Meanwhile, Secure Communications revenue is forecast to land in the $60 million to $64 million range. On the bottom line, BlackBerry sees adjusted earnings of $0.02 to $0.04 per share, signaling continued progress on profitability.\n\nWith that backdrop, the former smartphone pioneer is set to report its third-quarter earnings after the market closes on Thursday, Dec. 18, and anticipation is clearly building. Options markets are pricing in a sizable move of 10.18% around the earnings release, reflecting heightened investor interest. Looking further out, analysts covering the stock expect third-quarter earnings of $0.03 per share, which would represent a striking 200% YOY improvement and underscore the momentum behind BlackBerry’s turnaround.\nHow Are Analysts Viewing BlackBerry Stock? Despite the buzz around BlackBerry’s upcoming earnings, Wall Street’s overall tone remains somewhat cautious. The stock currently carries a consensus “Hold” rating, reflecting a wait-and-see stance among analysts. Of the seven analysts covering the name, just one is bullish enough to rate it a “Strong Buy,” while the other six are sitting on the sidelines with “Hold” recommendations.\nRegardless, room for upside is still possible. The average price target of $5.06 points to a potential gain of 19.34% from current levels. At the same time, the most optimistic Street estimate pegs the stock at $6, implying upside of up to 41.51% if BlackBerry delivers on expectations.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Investors Love Warren Buffett, So Why Aren’t They Listening to His Warning?\n\nRich Duprey\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:31 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nBRK-B\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nQuick Read Warren Buffett has been a net seller of stocks for 12 straight quarters. Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK-A , BRK-B ) now holds a record $382B in cash.\nBerkshire reduced its Apple stake from 50% of the portfolio to 20% over the past year.\nThe Buffett Indicator sits at 223%, signaling extreme overvaluation at 77% above trend line.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nWarren Buffett's remarkable success over six decades has turned Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE:BRK-A )( NYSE:BRK-B ) into a phenomenon with something close to a cult following. Since assuming the helm of Berkshire in the mid-1960's, the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has delivered better than 5 million percent returns, about 20% annually or twice those of the S&P 500 over the period.\nEvery year, thousands of investors travel to Omaha for the annual shareholder meeting, often called the \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" to hear Buffett share his insights on investing and business. As Buffett's long tenure as CEO nears its end -- he plans to step down by the end of the year -- many fans continue to admire him.\nYet, despite their adoration, investors appear to be ignoring the warning he has been giving about the stock market.\n\nBuffett's Actions Speak Louder Than Words Now, Buffett has not issued any explicit warnings about an impending market crash. He hasn't said, don't buy stocks. However, his portfolio moves raise clear concerns.\nFor three consecutive years -- 12 straight quarters -- Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of stocks. The company sold more equities than it bought, with net sales reaching billions of dollars in recent periods. This pattern has built a record cash pile of approximately $382 billion.\n\nBuffett has made occasional purchases, including new stakes in tech names, but few major aggressive bets. For example, he has unloaded shares in Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) reducing his stake from about half of the portfolio down to 20%, but he bought over 5 million shares in UnitedHealth Group ( NYSE:UNH ) in the second quarter this year.\nAnalysts interpret this cash buildup as preparation for opportunities when prices drop, indicating he is uncomfortable with current market valuations.\nA Classic Value Approach in Action This strategy aligns with Buffett's core value investing philosophy of not overpaying for stocks. As he put it, \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\" By holding massive cash reserves, Berkshire positions itself to deploy capital advantageously during downturns and buy numerous \"wonderful\" stocks.\n\nStory continues\nInvestors may question how to identify overvaluation today. While AI-driven gains have propelled stocks --and stock valuations -- higher, echoing past tech booms, many of these companies are supported by genuine demand growth that continues to grow.\nBuffett, though, has provided investors with guidance through key metrics. In a 2001 Fortune article, he described the ratio of total U.S. stock market capitalization to GDP as \"probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\"\n\nA Persistent Red Flag Known as the Buffett Indicator, this metric divides total market cap -- often using the Wilshire 5000 as a proxy -- by U.S. GDP. Readings above 100% indicate potential overvaluation, and below that -- around 70% to 80% -- undervaluation. It should be noted that Buffett has since backed away from relying solely on one measure, instead using a more holistic approach to determine valuation. However, even Buffett himself can't be ignoring the flashing red lights of what the Buffett Indicator is signaling today.\n\nCurrent readings are at record highs. Today, the Wilshire 5000 shows a total market capitalization of around $68.7 trillion while U.S. GDP currently sits around $30.5 trillion, or about 223% -- some 77% above its trend line. Historically, levels above 200% have signaled extreme overvaluation and \"playing with fire,\" as Buffett once warned. Even adjusted versions exceed the long-term averages near 100%.\nThese figures indicate stocks have far outpaced economic output, raising the risk of a correction if growth or earnings fail to justify prices.\nKey Takeaway Every sign points to Buffett viewing the market as extremely overvalued, prompting his shift to cash. His consistent net selling over three years and record hoard underscore patience for better entry points. Investors who ignore Buffett's warnings do so at their own peril.\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Apple Plans Major iPhone Expansion as Global Sales Accelerate\n\nMoz Farooque ACCA\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:51 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nApple Inc. ( AAPL , Financials ) is expanding its iPhone lineup as worldwide sales show signs of improvement. Early indicators suggest the iPhone 17 is performing well across several regions, including China, giving Apple room to push for growth over the next two years.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with APP.\nIs AAPL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nCurrently, Apple sells five iPhone models globally, though industry watchers expect that number to rise by 2027. Reports citing internal roadmaps and supply-chain sources suggest Apple could introduce as many as seven models by that time, though the company has not officially confirmed such an expansion and the final lineup remains subject to change.\nOne of the most anticipated developments is Apple's first foldable iPhone, widely rumored to arrive in September 2026. According to supply-chain and concept reports, the device may unfold to roughly the size of an iPad mini, representing Apple's most significant iPhone design shift in years. That said, Apple has not confirmed the form factor, specifications, or final design.\n\nLooking further ahead, Apple is also expected to mark the iPhone's 20th anniversary in 2027. Concept leaks and analyst speculation point to a bold redesign, potentially featuring a near-edge-to-edge display, but these descriptions are based on rumors rather than official disclosures .\nApple's push to broaden its product range reflects intensifying competition and rising expectations around on-device AI features, including a more capable Siri. With the iPhone still accounting for roughly half of Apple's revenue, the stakes remain high.\nAs Apple prepares for its next major product cycle, investors will closely watch upcoming product events for clarity on how much of this reported roadmap ultimately becomes reality.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Services Rides on Apple TV and Arcade: What's Ahead for Apple Stock?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:37 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nDIS\n\nApple AAPL has been riding on a strong Services business, driven by strong Apple TV content and an expanding Apple Arcade game portfolio. In fiscal 2025, the Services business accounted for 26.2% of net sales with revenues growing 14% year over year, better than 13% year-over-year growth in fiscal 2024. Strong Apple TV content and an expanding Apple Arcade game portfolio have been catalysts for the Services business over the past couple of fiscal years.\n\nApple’s endeavor to continuously expand its Arcade game portfolio is expected to keep subscribers engaged in the upcoming holiday season. The latest farming expansion, which is massive, is expected to keep players engrossed with Sneaky Sasquatch . SpongeBob: Patty Pursuit 2 , PowerWash Simulator , Cult of the Lamb Arcade Edition, Subway Surfers+ and NARUTO: Ultimate Ninja STORM+ are the new games that joined Apple Arcade in December. Cozy Caravan , Sago Mini Jinja’s Garden , True Skate+ and Potion Punch 2+ are the new games set to join in January 2026.\n\nApple’s focus on expanding sports content is noteworthy. Beginning in 2026, all Major League Soccer (MLS) games will be available to stream for Apple TV subscribers at no additional cost. Apple TV has become the exclusive new broadcast partner for Formula 1 in the United States in 2026 under a five-year partnership. The introduction of Apple TV and the Peacock bundle from Oct. 20 is expected to drive subscriber base.\n\nApple Faces Tough Competition in Streaming Market AAPL is facing stiff competition from the likes of Disney DIS and Netflix NFLX in the streaming space.\n\nDisney’s streaming services — Disney+ and Hulu — now reach 191 million subscribers. The launch of the standalone ESPN DTC service on Aug. 21, 2025, marks a major milestone in repositioning Disney’s ESPN as a fully digital sports powerhouse. Content investments in Marvel and Star Wars franchises are driving strong box office results for Disney.\n\nNetflix has set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, supported by a diversified content strategy, including international programming, live events, and gaming initiatives. For the fourth quarter, Netflix projects $11.96 billion in revenue with 16.7% growth and a 23.9% operating margin, featuring major releases including Stranger Things' final season and NFL Christmas games. Netflix raised its full-year free cash flow forecast to $9 billion from $8-8.5 billion.\n\nAAPL’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Apple shares have jumped 39.7% in the past six-month period, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 22.2%.\n\nStory Continues\nApple Stock Beat Sector in 6 Months\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe AAPL stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/earnings of 32.98X compared with the broader sector’s 27.76X.

      "Content": "My Surprising Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Pick for 2026\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Investors have become impatient with the lack of immediate results from Amazon's increased spending.\nAmazon is adding more computing capacity to Amazon Web Services.\nAdvertising was Amazon's fastest-growing segment in the third quarter.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nThe \" Magnificent Seven \" is the name given to the group of Nvidia , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , Meta , Tesla , and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . These seven companies are bundled together because they have driven much of the stock market's gains in recent years. As of Dec. 15, they are seven of the world's top nine most valuable companies and represent nearly 35% of the S&P 500 .\nSo far this year, every \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has produced double-digit returns except for one: Amazon.\nOnce the face of growth stocks, Amazon has lagged over the past year, frustrating its investors along the way. Despite that retreat, Amazon may be positioned to bounce back in 2026.\nWhy has Amazon's stock been lagging? There hasn't been one issue that's caused Amazon's underperformance. It's more a combination of factors. First, Amazon has spent a lot of money this year, with capital expenditures (capex) of around $90 billion through the first nine months of 2025.\nGiven how much Amazon has been spending (mostly on AI infrastructure), investors have been wanting more to show for it -- especially when it comes to Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth. With many of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks making big splashes in AI, some people viewed Amazon as falling behind in the race.\nAmazon's heavy spending has weighed on its free cash flow, and that's not something investors typically like without seeing more immediate results. Add in how expensive Amazon's stock has been, and there was little room for error in many investors' eyes.\nAWS is positioning itself for the future AWS may not have been producing the results that we've grown used to seeing over the years, but investors jumping ship seems like a premature overreaction (which is no surprise if you know investors). Yes, AWS has been losing market share to Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, but it's still the world's largest cloud platform by far.\n\nCloud platforms are, and will continue to be, crucial to AI training and scaling. That's why Amazon has been focusing so much on building out more infrastructure and adding computing capacity. It has added more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months and plans to double its capacity through 2027.\n\nStory Continues\nThis investment is noteworthy because, according to calculations from investment bank Oppenheimer , each incremental gigawatt of capacity could add $3 billion in revenue. The high capex might be weighing on Amazon's financials right now, but it's poised to pay off in the long term.\nAmazon has an underrated profit machine There's no doubt that AWS is Amazon's profit engine, accounting for most of its operating income. However, advertising is a high-margin business that has been growing steadily over the past couple of years.\nOn one hand, Amazon has access to data from its millions of customers and Prime members, making it more effective at helping advertisers with targeted ad campaigns. They know what customers buy, when they buy it, what they watch, what they listen to, what they browse, and other information that allows advertisers to target with greater precision.\nOn the other hand, Amazon's massive reach means it has plenty of places to set these ads. Whether it's online, when you search for a specific product, stream something on Prime Video, watch Twitch, or listen to music, there's no shortage of real estate for advertisers looking to reach potential customers. Amazon also announced that it recently struck partnerships that allow its advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix , Spotify , and SiriusXM .\n\nIn the third quarter, Amazon's advertising services revenue grew 24% to $17.7 billion, outpacing its revenue from subscriptions ($12.5 billion). Beyond revenue growth, advertising is a high-margin business that can help Amazon boost its overall profitability. I expect the momentum to continue in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Why Sam Altman Sees Apple and Not Google as its Top AI Rival\n\nJoey Frenette\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:03 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nQuick Read Sam Altman views Apple as OpenAI’s top AI rival despite Google’s recent Gemini 3.0 momentum.\nApple pays only $1B annually to use Gemini and plans to integrate it into Siri in 2026.\nApple’s Gemini-powered Siri could become the default iPhone AI option over ChatGPT.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nOpenAI's top boss, Sam Altman, has been quite busy of late responding to Google Gemini 3.0 with a \"code red\" of sorts. And while the latest ChatGPT 5.2 seems to be a worthy rival, questions linger as to whether OpenAI is about to lose its AI lead to the likes of Google and its parent company, Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ). Arguably, the torch has already passed after Gemini 3.0 garnered spectacular feedback while powering impressive App Store downloads.\nThough Google has made massive ground over the past year, I still think it's a tad too early in the game to deem Google as the winner of the AI race, even though Gemini 3.0's strong launch has made a case for switched chatbots. While Google is an AI force to be reckoned with, I found it quite interesting that Altman expressed his view that it's Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), a firm it's partnered up with to offer ChatGPT via Apple Intelligence, as opposed to Google, which could be the most significant AI rival, at least over the long term, for the GPT-maker.\n\nSam Altman is right to acknowledge Apple's AI abilities Sure, such a comment seems laughable for now, especially given where Apple Intelligence currently stands in the AI race. However, as we head into 2026, Apple is going to be launching what could be its biggest AI offering to date: Siri with a Gemini boost. Of course, in the longer term, it might be more about Apple's dominance in software and hardware that makes Apple a serious contender in the AI war.\n\nThough it may seem far-fetched to think that the Cupertino giant is a bigger threat than the likes of Google, which has all the right tools in place to extend its lead in the race, I certainly wouldn't doubt Apple CEO Tim Cook and company as they look to learn from the mistakes of other tech titans to offer an AI experience that's simply better than what most other firms are currently offering. In a prior piece, I shone a bright light on the great deal that Apple was getting to use Gemini.\nJust $1 billion per year to use Gemini and add to it seems like a great deal that only Apple has the leverage to make. The most exciting thing, I believe, is what else Apple adds on top of Gemini. As the AI experience becomes more about what's added on top of a large language model (LLM), it will be very interesting to see how Apple's take on AI will be in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nApple's big AI upgrades are coming. It might be the biggest AI story of 2026 My guess is the Gemini experience will be made that much richer with Apple's polishings added on top. Either way, Apple users are going to get a premium and more exclusive AI product pretty much for free. And that might power a device refresh cycle, the likes of which we may not have witnessed since the COVID lockdown days. Personally, I think Apple's new Gemini-powered Siri could be a hit. And it might cause further competitive pressures for OpenAI.\n\nOf course, ChatGPT is likely to stick around as an option for iPhone users, but if it's not the default option, things could have the potential to get very sticky for OpenAI as it looks to fight off a new threat in Apple, as it continues to do its best to keep up with Google and Gemini. Add the OpenAI device that former Apple CDO Jony Ive has been working on into the equation, and Apple stands out as a top foe in AI consumer hardware.\nAnd with OpenAI also looking to make strides in AI chips, Apple and its M-series chips also stand out as a top rival. If Apple's Siri upgrade goes well, perhaps it's M-series chips in Apple's Private Cloud Compute and A-series chips on the edge that we'll all be using as we stay in that Apple ecosystem.\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Memory chip prices could pressure smartphone shipments in 2026: RPT\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:47 AM PST\n\nIn this video: MU\n\nSSNLF\n\nAAPL\n\nCounterpoint Research expects smartphone shipments to fall by 2.1% in 2026 over rising memory chip costs as more companies invest billions into AI infrastructure buildouts.\nCounterpoint Research senior research analyst Yang Wang and Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh come on Morning Brief to expand on these global tech trends.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nLet's talk about the sort of ripple effect of the AI buildout and in sort of Micron being a case study, so to speak. And Yang, you know a lot about this because we have seen memory chip prices go through the roof because a lot of memory is sort of being dedicated and diverted to the AI build out now. You guys have been doing research on that. So what effect has that been having?\n00:30 Yang\nWell, I mean, first of all, I mean, we we will be looking very closely at the Micron earnings, especially because they've announced recently that they will be winding down the crucial business unit which caters to consumer electronic segment and smartphones. Uh will be the first to get hit.\n00:53 Yang\nNow, come, zooming out a bit. You, when we look at the key memory components such as DRAM, prices have gone up 70% in this quarter, and we've we're projecting it to go up another 40% next quarter. So, what that directly means is that the build cost or bill of materials for smartphones, they have already increased 20 to 30% for, you know, the low-end devices below $200.\n01:29 Yang\nBut even for think of the flagship devices from from Apple, from Samsung, even those prices have will be going up 10 to 15 um percent. Now, what is the compounding effect, right? It means that costs are going up. And then, you know, companies have to make a tough decision, will they bite the the bullet and take the um, take take the additional cost or will they choose, which in our opinion is a likely case, pass through the the cost to consumers.\n02:07 Yang\nAnd in an environment where um prices are high, inflation isn't really coming down yet, it's going to be a tough decision for consumers whether they're going to upgrade or whether they're going to postpone. And in our, in our understanding, through our consumer surveys, they're very likely to to postpone and that means it's leads to our our latest forecast that the smartphone shipments for the global market next year is going to be coming down 2.1%.\n02:44 Yang\nAnd that is a big um delta from uh from what has happened in this year, which the market grew 3%. So a a swing of 5% is going to be painful for all industry players in the smartphone industry.\n03:00 Speaker A\nYang, when's the last time there was a decline in shipments year over year?\n03:04 Yang\nWell, I mean, the last time we had a big decline was in 2022, 23, when obviously on the onset of the the Ukraine war, you had inflation and uh central banks hiking rates. So, of course, that, you know, there was also the compounded effect of a massive amount of pent up demand working from home. So there was a lot of um device refreshes ahead of it.\n03:41 Yang\nSo, entering into that cycle, you had a lot of um supply chain pains, but on the demand side, it created. So, luckily, and in looking at what's going to turn out next year, we see demand remaining fairly resilient, and that's mainly because the trading environment has been fairly stable. I mean, the growth engines, emerging markets, you look at big markets like India, Southeast Asia, they're still on a growth trajectory.\n04:16 Yang\nUm the US, you know, China, Europe remaining stable, and let's not forget, um US, China, um the the one year uh trade war or tech war truce. And that kind of paves a stable environment for our industry. So thankfully, we're not get going to get a demand collapse. But yeah, I mean, on the, who knows what happens in a year's time when, you know, we uh we hopefully get out of the memory squeeze cycle, but then geopolitics could rear its ugly tail again.\n05:08 Speaker A\nYes, most definitely. And who knows also the AI build out what other kind of knock on effects it will have. And Mandeep, I want to bring you back to to pose that question to you because we just heard Yang talking about the higher prices of memory chips, um and the effect that could have smartphones, but I'm also curious for the AI build out itself. Um, you know, are we going to see price volatility in all of the things needed to go into that build out and have the major players really insured their supply or are we going to see a lot of volatility there as well?\n06:01 Mandeep\nYeah, I mean, you could see, you know, supply shortages and certain components at a given point of time, but to my mind, you know, the buildout is more or less uh you know, certain in the sense like that three trillion number in aggregate spending through 2030 does sound very plausible given what we have seen in terms of the intent around AI investments and uh frankly speaking, the ROI that people are seeing when it comes to the generative AI use cases, whether it's coding agents or customer service.\n07:00 Mandeep\nSo from that perspective, you know, the buildout will take place. It's just a question of whether, you know, the neo clouds uh aren't able to raise funding at a given point of time because of concerns around excessive leverage or, you know, there could be some component shortages, which is why CoreWeave had to push out its data center going live last quarter. So all those are part of the build out, but there is no doubt that, you know, uh companies are committed when it comes to uh deploying AI and and they do need the compute uh which is pretty much uh a requirement when it comes to uh doing inferencing uh on these large language models.\n07:53 Speaker A\nYeah.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Those seven companies — Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Apple ( AAPL ) — are essentially powering the artificial intelligence boom.\nThese stocks are up on average 21% this year compared to a 15% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data. Alphabet is the top performer with an advance of 62% amid optimism on its new Gemini 3 model.\nIn turn, the valuation of the S&P 500 has reached a level even most bulls would agree is on the rich side. Krishna's work reveals the S&P 500 is trading at the 91st percentile relative to its 10-year valuation history.\n\"Complacency\" could ignite an AI bubble, Deutsche Bank strategist Adrian Cox told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (video above).\nRead more: How AI, unemployment, and interest rates could shape the stock market and your investments next year\nIndeed, complacency appears to have settled in, despite the risks investors had to endure this year.\nRemember the \"Liberation Day\" tariff spectacle in April? The S&P 500 tanked 4.8% the day after President Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on April 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped a staggering 1,679 points.\n\nTariffs are now in effect, though they are not as severe as first advertised.\nAnd more recently, disappointments from AI darlings CoreWeave ( CRWV ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) have begun to call into question the near-term outlook for the AI trade.\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation in 2026 in the AI trade,\" Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye said on Opening Bid .\nAlphabet is Essaye's top AI pick for 2026, though he acknowledges there are likely to be winners and losers from the Magnificent Seven complex next year.\n\"I think companies like Oracle that [are] not overextended financially but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that is tied to open AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" Essaye added. \"There's going to be some pretty serious bifurcation.

Morgan Stanley weighs in\n\nSam Boughedda\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:05 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nMS\n\nGOOG\n\nInvesting.com -- Morgan Stanley believes Apple could make progress in artificial intelligence distribution in 2026, but warned the company is still likely to lag peers in core AI capabilities despite an anticipated overhaul of Siri.\nIn a note led by analyst Erik Woodring, the bank said Apple “will become a leading distributor of AI technologies with a Siri re-release in spring 2026,” supported by closer collaboration with external partners such as Google’s Gemini.\n\nThe bank added that these partnerships, rather than in-house development, are expected to be the main driver of Apple’s AI strategy next year.\nHowever, Woodring struck a cautious tone on Apple’s competitive position, saying the company “will remain less relevant in the game of AI in the coming year.”\nIt is believed that Apple’s relatively conservative AI investment over the past two to three years means it will take time to catch up with rivals, even if Apple Intelligence improves through third-party large language models.\nWoodring argued that Apple Intelligence has yet to meaningfully accelerate iPhone upgrade cycles.\nDespite strong consumer interest, the firm estimated that replacement cycles lengthened in fiscal 2025, with shipment growth driven more by an ageing installed base than by new AI features.\n\nThat could begin to change with a Siri relaunch expected in spring 2026, when Apple is likely to integrate a customised Gemini model to deliver more advanced functionality.\nThe bank noted that Apple is stepping up AI spending, including higher operating expenses and capital investment, but said execution risks remain.\nMorgan Stanley feels monetisation is likely to come later, with a paid Apple Intelligence tier “as early as 2027,” once adoption and user engagement are established.\nRelated articles\nCan Apple close the AI gap in 2026?

      "Content": "Warner Bros will urge shareholders to reject hostile bid as Trump attacks Paramount\n\nUna Hajdari\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 4:54 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nORCL\n\nWarner Bros Discovery is expected to recommend that shareholders vote against a hostile takeover bid from Paramount Global, according to reporting from several news outlets, dealing a blow to Paramount’s massive $108bn (€92.2bn) attempt to take over the rival studio. Euronews has reached out to Warner for further comment.\n\nThis comes after Paramount announced it was planning to go to Warner Bros' shareholders directly in early December with an all-cash $30 per-share offer — bypassing the board after the studio rejected several of its acquisition proposals. Netflix, on the other hand, is proposing $27.75 per share in cash and stock.\nSince the acquisition battle heated up, Warner Bros stock has been trading closer to $30 per share, shooting up from around $24 per share earlier this month.\nWhy is Warner Bros so hot right now? The battle for Warner Bros has become a test of who will dominate the US media industry.\nWhoever acquires the company would gain access to an extensive film and studio content library licensed under Warner Bros, as well as HBO content and the DC Comics franchise, which includes legacy characters such as Batman and Superman.\n\nThe company's share price was widely considered to be undervalued as the company became bogged down by heavy debt and intense competition from Netflix, Amazon, and Apple.\nOn 5 December, Netflix made a formal offer for Warner Bros Discovery, which the company’s board agreed to support and which included HBO Max and HBO, after a high-stakes months-long bidding war.\nIn a statement, the streaming giant confirmed the mammoth $82.7bn (€71bn) deal, which is being framed as a bringing together of \"two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,” Warner Bros CEO and president David Zaslav said at the time.\nIf Warner Bros does break its current agreement with Netflix, it will owe the rejected streamer a $2.8bn (€2.4bn) fee.\n\nEven so, Paramount still faces a number of hurdles before it can claim victory over Netflix, with critics notably questioning the financing of the offer.\nRelated\nWarner Bros Discovery weighs sale after 'unsolicited' buyer interest\nParamount goes hostile in bid for Warner Bros, challenging Netflix\nNetflix wins battle for Warner Bros as HBO joins streaming giant’s empire\nIs Trump's son-in-law involved? President Donald Trump weighed in publicly on the Warner Bros sale a week ago, arguing that the news network CNN should be sold as part of any transaction involving its parent company. He criticised the network’s current leadership as “corrupt or incompetent”, insisting CNN be divested to secure broader political balance in their coverage.\n\nStory Continues\nParamount’s acquisition proposal included acquiring cable and broadcast news assets currently owned by Warner Bros. This sparked worries among some lawmakers and observers that editorial coverage could shift, particularly with regard to reporting on the Trump administration.\nBillionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is one of the principal financial backers of Paramount Skydance’s hostile bid, providing a large portion of the equity that underpins the offer and helping to secure other investors. His son, David Ellison, is chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance.\n\nThat affiliation — coupled with the Ellisons’ friendship with Donald Trump and their role as major Republican donors — has led some analysts to believe that the Skydance bid is not merely a commercial offer but also a play for political influence.\nJared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, or more specifically his private equity firm Affinity Partners, was initially listed as a backer of Paramount’s hostile takeover bid. The firm has since pulled out of the financing consortium.\nIn a not-so-atypical turnaround, Trump criticised Paramount on Tuesday evening, claiming that he was not actually as cosy with Paramount as it may have seemed. Paramount owns CBS, a station that ended production of 'The Late Show' earlier this year. When the programme's cancellation was announced, some suggested the decision linked to host Stephen Colbert's criticism of the Trump administration. At the time, CBS said it was \"purely a financial decision\".\n\nThe axing of the 33-year-old show came just days after Colbert publicly criticised Paramount for settling a $16mn (€13.7mn) lawsuit with Donald Trump at a time when the company was seeking regulatory approval for its Skydance merger.\n“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that '60 Minutes' has treated me far worse since the so-called 'takeover', than they have ever treated me before,” Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday night. “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n'60 Minutes' is a news show produced by CBS and was the subject of the $16mn defamation case settled earlier this year. Trump claimed that producers edited an interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris in a way that was deliberately deceptive.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Alphabet a Top Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy for 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet's rise in 2025 is due to low expectations entering the year.\nAlphabet could open a new business unit in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the best big tech stocks to own in 2025. Its stock has risen 65% so far in 2025, outperforming nearly all of its big tech peers, like Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , and even Nvidia . However, after a great 2025, some investors may be a bit more concerned about what 2026 will hold. After all, it isn't easy to follow up a strong year with another.\n\nIf you look into the reasons why Alphabet's stock had a great 2025, it's clear that it frees the stock up to have another strong 2026, although it will be difficult to be as impressive as 2025 was. I think this makes Alphabet a great buy heading into 2026, and I'd expect Alphabet to emerge as the second-largest company in the world, behind Nvidia.\nAlphabet faced several doubts heading into 2025 To understand why Alphabet's 2025 was so successful, we need to rewind the clock to the start of 2025. Then, there were several question marks surrounding Alphabet's business. Alphabet's core business is the Google Search engine, and there were questions about its future in the generative AI (artificial intelligence) world. Many thought that Google's best days were behind it, and slipping market share didn't help that opinion.\n\nFurthermore, there was a pending court case questioning the status of Google as a monopoly. Investors didn't know what Alphabet's business would look like in the future, as it could be broken up. As a further negative mark against Alphabet, it was losing the AI race. Competing models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and other models like Perplexity and Claude far outperformed Gemini.\nInvestors were very skeptical of Alphabet's future, and there was heavy bearish sentiment on the stock. At its low point in April, Alphabet's stock traded for less than 14 times forward earnings . That's value stock territory, and showcased the market's negative outlook on Alphabet's future.\nBut then, everything changed.\nSlowly, all of the question marks surrounding Alphabet's stock were answered, and the results were incredibly positive.\n\nAlphabet received positive news regarding its monopoly court case in September. It wouldn't be broken up, although it did have to make a few minor concessions. The fear that Google Search would be dethroned ended after AI overviews became incorporated into each result. This hybrid approach of traditional search and generative AI turned out to be a great compromise and has maintained Google's place at the top of the search engine market. Google's generative AI model, Gemini, also emerged as a leader in its industry. It was such a threat to OpenAI's dominance that it called a \"code red\" due to Gemini's improvements.\n\nStory Continues\nWith all of those problems being resolved, Alphabet's stock was free to be valued at the same level as its tech peers. Now, it trades for around 30 times forward earnings.\nWhile this isn't necessarily cheap, it places Alphabet on a level playing field and allows its business results to shine in 2026.\nAlphabet's 2026 is shaping up to be a good one On top of those questions being answered, another positive one was asked: What if Alphabet sold its in-house computing unit on the open market? Alphabet has developed a custom AI computing unit known as the tensor processing unit (TPU) with Broadcom . This unit was only sold to Alphabet, and could be rented by other clients through its cloud computing network, Google Cloud. However, Alphabet may consider selling these computing units outright to Meta Platforms . That would open up a new business unit for Alphabet in 2026, leading to further growth.\n\nIf this business unit takes off and Alphabet can continue growing its core business at a strong rate (its revenue rose 16% in Q3, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 35%), Alphabet will be in store for a great 2026. While returns won't be as explosive due to its higher starting valuation, I think its growth will allow it to be a market-beating stock in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Warren Buffett Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Trillion-Dollar AI Stock Up 12,180% Since Its IPO\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nBRK.A\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points During the third quarter, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway continued to sell Apple stock and started a new position in Alphabet.\nApple is well-positioned to monetize consumer adoption of artificial intelligence, but the stock is expensive at its current price.\nAlphabet has opportunities to monetize artificial intelligence across its digital advertising, cloud computing, and autonomous driving businesses.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) had about $267 billion invested across 41 U.S. stocks as of the third quarter. Those totals changed very little from the previous quarter, but Buffett (and his fellow investment managers) made some trades worth exploring:\nBerkshire sold 41.7 million shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . it remains the largest holding at 21% of the portfolio, but Buffett has slashed the position by 74% in two years.\nBerkshire bought 17.8 million shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . It is a relatively small position at 2% of the portfolio, but still noteworthy because Buffett has traditionally avoided technology stocks.\nAlphabet stock has returned 12,180% since its 2004 IPO and its $3.7 trillion market value makes it the third-largest company in the world. That Berkshire only recently started a position teaches a valuable lesson: It's alright to buy a stock that you initially overlooked, even if its share price has increased substantially.\nHere's what investors should know.\n1. Apple Apple reported encouraging financial results in the September quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Total revenue increased 8% to $102 billion driven by strong sales growth in the iPhone, Mac, and services segments. Non-GAAP net income increased 13% to $1.85 per diluted share due to modest operating margin expansion and continued share buybacks.\n\nThe investment thesis for Apple centers on its dominance in smartphones and its strong presence in other consumer electronics verticals. Design expertise spanning hardware and software has helped the company build a loyal consumer base willing to pay premium prices. iPhones accounted for 43% of smartphone sales in the September quarter, and Apple's installed base exceeds 2.35 billion devices.\nThat so many people have Apple devices means the company is ideally positioned to monetize consumer adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Last year, Apple introduced a suite of generative AI capabilities (called Apple Intelligence) for newer devices. They are currently free, but the company plans to introduce paid AI features in the next few years, according to Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\nNevertheless, Apple has a valuation problem. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 10% annually in the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 36 times earnings look very expensive. Those values give a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 3.6, and readings above 2 are typically considered overvalued. I think Apple is a great company, but the stock is not worth the current price.\n\n2. Alphabet Alphabet reported solid third-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 16% to $102 billion, an acceleration from 15% growth in the same quarter last year. GAAP earnings rose 35% to $2.87 per diluted share. CFO Anat Ashkenazi noted strong demand for AI infrastructure, specifically highlighting the adoption of custom chips and Gemini models.\n\nThe investment thesis for Alphabet centers on dominance in digital advertising, a position the company hopes to reinforce with artificial intelligence. Conversion rates have improved (i.e., more clicks) since Alphabet introduced AI Max for Search Campaigns earlier this year, and query volumes have increased since it added generative AI features to Google Search.\nMeanwhile, industry analysts rank Google Cloud as a leader in large language models, AI application development tools, and conversational AI tools. Google has also developed custom AI chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that have been adopted by Apple and Anthropic, among other noteworthy clients. Meta Platforms may deploy TPUs in its own data centers in 2027, according to The Information.\n\nFinally, Alphabet's autonomous driving subsidiary Waymo could eventually be a major source of revenue. It already offers commercial robotaxi services in six U.S. cities: Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, Atlanta, and Miami. Waymo will launch in four new cities across Texas and Florida in the coming weeks. And the company is testing its vehicles in another dozen cities.\nWall Street expects Alphabet's earnings to increase at 16% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 30 times earnings look reasonable. Those values give a PEG ratio of 1.9, which is far more attractive than Apple's PEG ratio of 3.6. Investors should consider buying a small position in Alphabet stock today.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?
