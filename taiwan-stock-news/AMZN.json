      "Content": "Adobe Stock Rides on Expanding Partner Base: Is There More Upside?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:40 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADBE\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAdobe ’s ADBE prospects are expected to benefit from an expanding partner base that includes the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Copilot, Google Gemini, HUMAIN, OpenAI and others. ADBE’s Firefly, Express and Creative Cloud applications currently integrate models from partners, including Google, OpenAI, Black Forest Labs, Luma, Runway, Topaz Labs and Eleven Labs.\n\nAdobe’s launch of Premiere Mobile in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 strengthened its footprint as a leading provider of next-generation AI video editing. The company announced a partnership with Google and YouTube, which is helping creators receive Adobe Premiere’s video editing tools in a new content creation space called Create for YouTube Shorts at the Premiere mobile app. Expansion of ad network partnerships with Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Snap and TikTok is a key catalyst for Adobe.\n\nThe company has recently entered into a strategic partnership with Runaway, where ADBE will utilize Runaway’s video technology, along with its own creative tools, to develop the next generation of video workflows. Adobe will be Runaway’s preferred API creativity partner, which will help ADBE’s customers get access to Runaway’s latest models. Its latest models, including Runaway’s new GEN-4.5, which are available only in Adobe Firefly, will be available to all ADBE’s clients.\n\nApart from an expanding partner base, Adobe’s strategy of infusing AI into its portfolio is driving growth, as reflected by the fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results. Adobe exited the year with annual recurring revenues (ARR) of $25.2 billion, indicating 11.5% year-over-year growth, and management expects it to continue to rise to $25.6 at the end of fiscal 2026. The Semrush acquisition is expected to further boost Adobe’s ARR growth.\n\nAdobe Faces Tough Competition in the AI Domain ADBE’s AI business is minuscule compared with Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenues are benefiting from growth in Azure AI services and a rise in the AI Copilot business. Microsoft now has 900 million monthly active users of AI features across its products, with over 150 million monthly active users of first-party Copilots. More than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, with major customers deploying tens of thousands of seats.\n\nAlphabet’s focus on leveraging AI to drive growth is a key catalyst. AI is infused heavily across its offerings, including Search and Google Cloud. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries. AI Mode is now available in more than 40 languages globally and has more than 75 million daily active users. GOOGL added 100 improvements to AI Mode in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nADBE’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Adobe shares have lost 21.6% in a year, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 22.9% and the Zacks Computer Software industry’s appreciation of 6.3%.\nAdobe Stock Lags Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nADBE stock is trading at a premium, as suggested by a Value Score of C.\n\nIn terms of trailing price/book, Adobe shares are trading at a higher multiple of 12.71 compared with the broader sector’s 10.76.\nADBE Stock is Overvalued\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 revenues is currently pegged at $6.28 billion, indicating 9.89% growth over the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2026 earnings is pegged at $5.86 per share, which has inched up by 19 cents over the past 60 days, suggesting 15.4% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdobe Inc.

      "Content": "Meta Platforms' AI-Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:38 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMeta Platforms META is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META’s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\n\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META’s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms’ initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company’s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN, are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\n\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space Meta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nAlphabet’s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans. This is driving GOOGL's advertising revenue growth.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Amazon’s advertising revenues increased 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company announced partnerships allowing advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify and SiriusXM Media through Amazon Ads, expanding its advertising reach beyond its own properties. The strong performance in advertising reflected successful AI-powered optimization of the platform and growing market share in digital advertising, providing a high-margin revenue stream that supports investments in other parts of the business.\n\nStory Continues\nMETA’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Meta Platforms shares have climbed 11.3% in the trailing 12 months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 24.6%.\nMETA’s Stock Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.22X compared with the broader sector’s 6.62X.

      "Content": "2 Stocks I'd Happily Hold Through Any Stock Market Crash\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Artificial intelligence (AI) competition has brought out the best in Alphabet.\nThe company has a big structural cost advantage that should continue to widen.\nAmazon, meanwhile, does not get enough credit for its leadership in robotics or its own custom AI chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWith the market near all-time highs and murmurs of an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble and even a potential market crash, there are some stocks I still wouldn't sell.\nWhile I'm not expecting a big market pullback, let's look at two stocks I'd continue to hold and likely be buying more of if a crash were to happen.\n1. Alphabet I think Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is going to be one of the biggest long-term winners in AI. The reason is that AI is pushing the company to innovate, making its products better.\nI'd argue that OpenAI is actually one of the best things to happen to the stock. Before OpenAI came along, Alphabet was largely viewed as a great company, but one that was bloated and stagnant. However, competition not only brought out the best in Alphabet, but it also highlighted some of the tech innovations it had been working on behind the scenes.\n\nThe biggest of these behind-the-scenes innovations was its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Alphabet had been using and advancing these custom chips for more than a decade, but it wasn't until recently that investors began to see their importance. These chips give Alphabet a huge structural cost advantage, both within its cloud computing unit and also with training its Gemini large language model (LLM) and running AI inference. Now, even other companies are set to begin deploying Alphabet's chips at scale to run some of their AI workloads within Google Cloud.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has incorporated its Gemini model throughout its portfolio of products, making them better, which is driving revenue growth. Meanwhile, by incorporating AI into Google Search, Maps, and Gmail, as well as becoming an AI assistant with Android and soon Apple devices, the company is meeting people where they are active every day. That's just a huge advantage that will grow with time.\n\nRight now, Alphabet is in the midst of riding a virtuous cycle, given its vertical integration edge. That's why it's a stock to hold through any market crash.\n2. Amazon Like Alphabet, I really like what Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been doing behind the scenes. The company does not get nearly the credit it deserves in robotics, because it is using them in its own fulfillment centers to drive efficiency rather than selling them to generate revenue. But make no mistake: Amazon is one of the world's foremost companies in robotics.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company has more than 1 million robots in its distribution centers, all of which are coordinated by its DeepFleet AI model. These robots keep becoming more advanced and able to handle more complex tasks. Meanwhile, Amazon is also using AI to help reduce delivery times through optimizing routes, locating hard-to-find drop-off locations for drivers, and determining which warehouses are best to store certain items. This has been leading to strong operating leverage, with the company seeing its segment-adjusted operating income soar 28% last quarter on an 11% increase in revenue.\n\nAnd while its custom AI chips are not as battle-tested as Alphabet's, Amazon is also making strong inroads in this area, which should help power its cloud computing results moving forward. It built out a world-class data center for Anthropic using Amazon's Trainium chips, which is still ramping up. Meanwhile, Amazon has been in talks with OpenAI about taking a stake in the company, which would also see the LLM company start to deploy some of its chips for its workloads. The two companies agreed earlier on a seven-year, $38 billion AWS (Amazon Web Services) computing deal, but that would be powered by Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\nGiven its robotics and e-commerce leadership, combined with its position in cloud computing, Amazon looks like a long-term winner, whether the market crashes next year or not.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $504,994 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,156,218 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 986 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Those shares are now worth almost $700M.\nAST SpaceMobile successfully deployed BlueBird 6 on Wednesday. It is the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit.\nPlanet Labs ( PL ) reported record revenue of $81.3M in fiscal Q3. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672M.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAlphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) dominates the search engine market with over 90% share and powers billions of daily queries through Google Search. Its Google Cloud division has gained market share from leaders Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ).\nA lesser-known aspect is Alphabet also directly invests in public companies through its venture arms GV and CapitalG. This portfolio held 38 stocks at the end of the third quarter with assets under management of about $2.5 billion and spanning sectors like healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI), and technology.\nYet there is one sector where Alphabet has placed its biggest bets: space. According to McKinsey, the space sector is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, so it's not surprising Alphabet is attempting to cash in on the explosive growth expected. What's notable about Alphabet's space investments is that it has concentrated its focus on just two stocks, which comprise 45% of the portfolio's AUM at current valuations.\n\nAST SpaceMobile ( NASDAQ:ASTS ) and Planet Labs ( NYSE:PL ) stand out as the largest positions in the portfolio, so let's see whether they warrant an investment from you, too.\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) AST SpaceMobile builds a space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by standard smartphones. Alphabet participated in a $155 million strategic investment round in early 2024 alongside AT&T ( NYSE:T ) and Vodafone ( NASDAQ:VOD ), supporting the company's satellite constellation development.\n\nGoogle collaborates on product development, testing, and implementation for network connectivity on Android devices. In the first quarter of 2025, Alphabet added 8.9 million shares valued at approximately $203 million. Today, those shares are worth almost $700 million and represent the portfolio's largest holding, or 23.3% of the total.\nAST achieved a key milestone on Wednesday with the successful launch and orbital deployment of BlueBird 6, the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit. This validates its technology for direct-to-device connectivity.\n\nStory Continues\nThe satellite stock's shares have surged 270% year-to-date as it advances its launch schedule and partnerships with over 50 mobile network operators serving billions of subscribers. The stock has been volatile, but has gained significant ground as it attained new milestones.\nAST SpaceMobile's focus on eliminating connectivity gaps aligns with the growth in satellite broadband, but analysts still give it mixed reviews. Some rate it a Buy for its long-term potential, while others are concerned about execution risks, limited revenue, and ongoing losses. Weiss Ratings , for example, just reiterated its Sell rating on the stock while Barclays downgraded it in October from Overweight to Underweight.\n\nAST SpaceMobile is probably best suited for risk-tolerant investors who may see an opportunity in it capturing even a slice of the projected $100 billion satellite broadband market.\nPlanet Labs (PL) Planet Labs operates a fleet of over 200 satellites providing daily global imagery and geospatial data for sectors including agriculture, defense, finance, and climate monitoring. Alphabet holds a roughly 10% stake, with data integrations supporting Google Earth and AI models for environmental analytics.\n\nAlphabet's position in Planet Labs is currently valued at approximately $650 million after the stock jumped following its fiscal year 2026 Q3 earnings report, making it the portfolio's second-largest holding. The valuation is 56% above where it stood on the date of Alphabet's 13F-HR filing.\nPlanet Labs reported record quarterly revenue of $81.3 million, up 33% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672 million, driven by defense and intelligence contracts.\nThe space stock's shares have rocketed over 400% in 2025 following hefty earnings beats and analyst upgrades. Morgan Stanley hiked its price target from $4.50 to $20 per share, which suggests Planet Labs is fairly priced, but the consensus has a sub-$15 target, which is why the stock has a Hold rating overall.\n\nIn the expanding $1.8 trillion space economy by 2035, Planet Labs benefits from geospatial AI applications that should contribute to revenue growth outpacing the sector. Aggressive investors may view it as a thematic play, but most investors should probably wait for a more attractive entry point following its huge run-up.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Tech stocks had been taking a beating lately, but are back on rally mode, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time closing high on Tuesday.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Analog Devices, Inc. , Amazon.com, Inc. and Fortive Corp. , which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nS&P 500 Hits All-Time High The S&P 500 rose 0.5% on Tuesday to finish at 6,909.79 points, to hit an all-time closing high. The jump came as the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a pace of 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.2%, and a lot higher than the 3.8% recorded in the second quarter.\n\nThe report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could revise its monetary policy outlook for 2026 and go for more interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve had earlier hinted at just one rate cut in 2026.\nHowever, markets are now pricing in at least two rate cuts next year, given that the Fed is confident that inflation, despite being high, will ease substantially in 2026, and economic growth, too, will accelerate. Also, the Fed had earlier ruled out the chances of a rate hike in the near term.\nThe positive outlook supported by the latest economic data saw tech stocks rebound from their earlier lows. Investors have lately been worried about the profitability of the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Major AI deals reached over the past two months have raised doubts among investors about their sky-high valuations and fear that AI is yet another bubble that would eventually burst.\n\nHowever, those fears appear to have alleviated, with some major tech giants issuing better-than-expected profit guidance for the present and upcoming quarters.\n3 S&P 500 Stocks with Growth Potential Analog Devices, Inc.

      "Content": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\n\nNalak Das\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:38 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\n\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of the three above-mentioned stocks year to date.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon.com Inc. Global e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN’s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon’s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is “Growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”\n\nExtensive AI Applications Amazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called “Project Rainier.” This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\n\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers’ queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\n\nStory Continues\nAMZN’s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance Amazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft Corp. Microsoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT’s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company’s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT’s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength Microsoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN’s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT’s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook For the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\n\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc. The undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\n\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company’s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\n\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions Zacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is the biggest transaction Nvidia has made so far to buy anything. The goal of the move is to make Nvidia more competitive in the quickly increasing market for AI hardware and data centers.The business will use Groq's specialized chip designs in future products and hire Jonathan Ross, the startup's CEO, and other top engineers. Ross was part of the team that started Google's own AI chip initiative.The deal is part of a larger wave of investments worth billions of dollars that are changing the AI infrastructure environment. Recently, Microsoft, Oracle, Meta, and Amazon have made big promises to increase their AI processing power and work with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and CoreWeave.Analysts argue that Nvidia's partnership with Groq will help it stay ahead of AMD, Intel, and bespoke chipmakers in the AI accelerator market by giving it access to more technologies. The transaction also supports Nvidia's plan to improve vertical integration as demand for AI computing keeps going up until 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The company has described these as “rumors.”\nAWS Outage On Christmas Outage-tracking service Downdetector posted that user reports had been flagging problems with Amazon Web Services since 8:41 p.m. EST, asking followers how the disruption was affecting them and tagging the issue with the hashtag #AmazonWebServicesDown. The service also directed users to its dedicated AWS status page, where live charts showed a surge in complaints tied to the cloud giant.\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nDowndetector data indicated 3,659 reports of AWS outages as of 10:52 p.m. (EST). An Amazon spokesperson told Benzinga over email that claims of AWS outage were without “factual basis.”\nOn the question of Downdetector reports, the company said, “Downdetector is not a reliable source. It's frequently wrong.”\n\nDowndetector did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments.\nImage Courtesy: Downdetector\nThird Such Crash in 2025 In a post on X, The Kobeissi Letter said \"Amazon Web Services has crashed with tens of thousands of websites currently down,\" adding that it was the \"3rd large-scale crash in Amazon Web Services this year.\" The tweet included a chart showing AWS outage reports spiking sharply over the prior 24 hours, underscoring the sudden and severe nature of the incident.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nAWS responded to Kobeissi Letter and said the reports of outage were “false.” The company said, “AWS services are operating normally today, but an event elsewhere on the internet has prompted some inaccurate speculation on social media.”\n\nStory Continues\nEarlier Crash Brought Down Disney+, Reddit The latest disruption follows an earlier AWS incident that knocked out key online platforms including Disney+ , Reddit , McDonald's app and United Airlines , after a DNS issue in the us-east-1 region affected more than 70 services, according to prior reporting. During that episode, Amazon engineers said they pursued \"multiple parallel paths\" to restore functionality as businesses and government websites struggled with elevated error rates and latency.\nOn Christmas Eve, social media users reported outages across multiple websites:\nSee Also: Missed Tesla?

For markets, each new incident raises questions about operational risk, potential regulatory action and the costs companies may incur to build redundancy across multiple cloud vendors.\n\nThe fresh wave of outages highlights the systemic risk created by dependence on a handful of cloud providers, where technical failures at a single company can ripple across airlines, media platforms, financial apps and government portals. Investors and policymakers have been scrutinizing AWS's dominance as repeated disruptions expose how concentrated infrastructure can \"break the internet\" for millions of users at once.\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

      "Content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year\n\nJoel South\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nORCL\n\nKey Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms.\nMicrosoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) gained 1.96% over the past five trading sessions after losing 0.03% the five prior. That brings MSFT's year-to-date gain to 16.59%, including a nearly 38% gain since its year-to-date low on April 8.\nWhen the Magnificent Seven member reported FY 2026 Q1 earnings on Oct. 29, 2025, shares fell despite beating on EPS and revenue. The company announced earnings of $3.72 per share versus analysts' expectations of $3.67, and quarterly revenue of $77.67 billion versus analysts' expectations of $75.33 billion.\nOn Oct. 1, 2025, the company announced that it was increasing its Xbox Game Pass subscription by 50%. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft saw more than 8% of revenue derived from its gaming segment, which now boasts 50 million monthly active subscribers and nearly $5 billion in YoY revenue.\n\nMicrosoft's decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth.\nWhy Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) AWS.\nIn June, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 39% in FY25 Q4, driven by AI services.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect the company's capex to remain elevated to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth.\n\nTariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year.\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft's AI and cloud momentum.\n\nMicrosoft As a Stock Broadly, 34 Wall Street analysts' remain bullish, with 32 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a \"Buy\" rating, two assigning it a \"Hold\" rating and none assigning it a \"Sell\" rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating. Wall Street's price targets cover a significant range, spanning $500 per share on the low end to $700 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $631.36, which represents 29.37% potential upside from today's share price.\nInstitutional ownership currently stands at 73.74%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\n%Change From Current Price\nLow\n$500\n2.45%\nMedian\n$631.36\n29.37%\nHigh\n$700\n43.43%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s strong Azure revenue growth positions it for cloud and AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger.\n\n24/7 Wall St. ’s year-end price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying upside potential of 15.49% from the stock's current price.

      "Content": "Is Amazon Stock a Buy Ahead of 2026?\n\nNauman Khan\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 3:29 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nCMCSA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nValuation momentum sits at the center of the buy case for Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) as investors eye 2026. Analysts expect FY2026 EPS of $7.85, and a conservative P/E midpoint of 45 puts a fair value near $353 per share. roughly a 52% upside from current levels.\nAmazon keeps growing its core businesses. E-commerce and Amazon Web Services still show double-digit revenue gains, and the company's digital advertising arm has been the fastest-growing segment for several quarters, outpacing growth rates at some larger rivals. That trend gives Amazon more levers to monetize traffic across shopping, cloud, and ads.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe company also moves into newer markets. It launched a cloud-gaming push with Luna in partnership with Comcast (CMCSA), and Zoox advances toward robotaxi commercialization in selected U.S. cities. Those projects could create bundles with Prime and drive AWS demand, but they also carry execution risk and require heavy investment.\nCompetition in cloud and AI remains a clear risk. Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) ramp up AI infrastructure and services; Google's recent model releases may influence some enterprise choices. That rivalry could pressure AWS pricing or slow market share gains.\nAmazon, however, displays some margin lift despite R&D increasing, implying that it is getting some operating leverage. Labor and automation remain some of the most important cost-saving actions, yet the figures for the headcount are. They are all about and should be in a dandy of a look.\n\nWhen the price-to-sales multiples are high, the market is essentially suggesting that it believes revenues are going to continue to skyrocket. When such growth stops, the stock would experience a sell-off despite continuously rising margins.\nTo investors, the question of whether to enter before 2026 is whether to take into account Amazon as a combination of opportunity surfaces, flexibility, combating huge growth and competition, and high expectations.\nIs AMZN Stock a BUY? Based on the one year price targets offered by 72 analysts, the average target price for Amazon.com Inc is $291.27 with a high estimate of $360.00 and a low estimate of $227.10. The average target implies a upside of +25.34% from the current price of $232.38.\nBased on the consensus recommendation from 71 brokerage firms, Amazon.com Inc's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) average brokerage recommendation is currently 1.8, indicating a \"Outperform\" status. The rating scale ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 signifies Strong Buy, and 5 denotes Sell.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Sells Amazon Stock and Buys an AI Stock Up 1,030% Since 2024 (Hint: Not Nvidia)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nAMZN\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points In the third quarter, billionaire Ken Griffin sold Amazon stock and bought shares of Palantir, a stock up 1,030% since January 2024.\nAmazon's investments in artificial intelligence are bearing fruit, as evidenced by its strong sales growth and expanding operating margin.\nPalantir is growing like wildfire amid demand for its artificial intelligence platform, but the stock trades at an absurd (and unsustainable) valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nKen Griffin runs Citadel Advisors, the most successful hedge fund in history as measured by net gains since inception. Additionally, Citadel outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 8 percentage points over the last three years. That makes Griffin an excellent source of inspiration for retail investors.\nIn the third quarter, Citadel sold 1.6 million shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and purchased 388,000 shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) , a stock that has advanced 1,030% since January 2024. Comparatively, Nvidia stock is up 281% over the same period.\nHere's what investors should know about Amazon and Palantir Technologies.\nAmazon: The stock Ken Griffin sold Amazon has a strong presence in three growing industries: e-commerce , digital advertising, and cloud computing . The company is leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) to increase sales and improve profitability across each operating segment, as detailed below:\nE-commerce: Amazon runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. It has developed generative AI tools for customer service, inventory placement, and last-mile delivery, as well as models that make its industrial robot fleet more efficient. Amazon has also developed an AI shopping assistant called Rufus that is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales this year.\nAdvertising: Amazon is the third-largest ad tech company and the largest retail advertiser, which is one of the fastest-growing categories in the broader digital advertising market. The company has built generative AI tools that let brands create images, video, and audio; Amazon has also developed an agentic AI tool that can research products and create campaigns.\nCloud computing: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud. It has added new platform services, like Bedrock for generative AI application development. AWS has also designed custom AI chips for training and inference workloads that provide clients with a less expensive alternative to Nvidia GPUs. More recently, AWS introduced AI agents that automate software development, security operations, and performance monitoring.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestments in AI are bearing fruit. In the third quarter, Amazon's revenue increased 13% to $180 billion, driven by accelerating sales growth across its advertising and cloud computing segments. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded 60 basis points (excluding two one-time charges) and operating income increased 23% to $21.7 billion.\n\nWall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look reasonable. So, why did Ken Griffin sell Amazon? Perhaps he was simply taking some profits. Whatever the reason, it would be wrong to assume he lost confidence in the company. Amazon is still one of Citadel Advisors' top 10 positions.\nPalantir Technologies: The stock Ken Griffin bought Palantir develops data analytics and artificial intelligence platforms for customers in the public and private sectors. Its key differentiator is ontology-based software, meaning its products are designed around a decisioning framework made more effective over time by machine learning (ML) models. Use cases span supply chain management, retail inventory optimization, financial fraud detection, and battlefield analytics.\n\nLast year, Forrester Research recognized Palantir as the most capable AI/ML platform on the market, ranking it above Alphabet 's Google, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure. The analysts wrote, \"Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market.\" Earlier this year, Forrester ranked Palantir as a leader in AI decisioning platforms.\nThat recognition from industry analysts has come alongside strong financial results. In the third quarter, Palantir's revenue rose 63% to $1.1 billion, the ninth straight acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings more than doubled to $0.21 per diluted share. Management said strong demand for its artificial intelligence platform was key to its strong performance.\nThe problem with Palantir is valuation. Shares currently trade at 119 times sales, which makes it the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 by a wide margin. AppLovin is the next-closest stock at 45 times sales. That means Palantir could lose more than 60% of its value and still be the most expensive stock in the index.\n\nConsider this: Palantir's stock price has increased 11x since January 2024, but its revenue has increased less than 2x. That means the primary reason the stock price has increased is that investors are happily paying higher price-to-sales multiples. Indeed, the stock traded at 18 times sales in January 2024.\nThat figure cannot keep expanding indefinitely. Valuation will matter at some point. When that day comes, Palantir is likely to crash. I'm not sure why Griffin bought shares of Palantir in the third quarter, but investors should not assume he has a great deal of conviction in the company: Palantir does not rank among his top 300 holdings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?

      "Content": "After 23 years working for Jeff Bezos, the CEO of a $1.3 billion skills platform shares lessons he learned from Andy Jassy and the Amazon founder\n\nEleanor Pringle\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 12:02 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nCOUR\n\nIn 1997, the day before Greg Hart joined Amazon , he was summoned to a meeting—on a Sunday—with its founder, Jeff Bezos.\n\nAt the time, Bezos had interviewed virtually every one of Amazon&#8217;s circa 200 employees; Hart was one of the few the tech entrepreneur hadn&#8217;t personally appointed. Over the next 23 years at the online giant, Hart reported directly to Bezos as technical advisor to the CEO, and to Amazon&#8217;s current CEO, Andy Jassy.\n\nThe lessons Hart learned at one of the world&#8217;s most famous businesses have stayed with him to this day, where he leads $1.35 billion online learning giant, Coursera . Hart tasked himself with shepherding the company through a transformation—conveniently, in time for demand to explode, as job seekers and employees alike rushed to add an all-important AI qualification to their CVs.\n\nMany of the changes Hart brought to Coursera—and its more than 1,000 employees—will be familiar to Amazon alumni. Hart said that Bezos&#8217; practice of interviewing every employee in the early days set the tone as Amazon grew, explaining, &#8220;He wanted to make sure that the passion, customer focus, the high standards, and the move fast traits that the early set of employees had stayed true as the company grew in scale.&#8221;\nSo it made &#8220;perfect sense&#8221; when Bezos penned his now-famous letter to shareholders outlining the leadership principles and priorities of the business, because they &#8220;reflected&#8221; the day-to-day conversations in the office.\nHart wanted to embed a similar mindset at Coursera, he said: &#8220;I wanted to really transform the company and make it move at a faster rate and do a better job of serving our learners. I felt that one of the most critical things in doing that was ensuring there was really good cultural alignment, and so we introduced a set of leadership mindsets. We looked at some of the most successful companies in the world, we looked at either their values or their principles &#8230; and we created our own that we felt were very specific to both our business and our history as a company.&#8221;\n\nThat speed became critical as the AI boom transformed the skillset businesses wanted, with employees and job seekers racing to keep up. The platform is now home to more than 12,000 courses, 1,100 of which are based on generative AI—a 44% increase year-over-year. GenAI is significantly the most popular topic on the platform, both from individual learners and from employees with a subscription paid for by their employer.\nThe CEO was also keen to do away with unfocused company all-hands, and instead dusted off the Amazon playbook of focusing each of the meetings on a single leadership principle: &#8220;One of the things that I&#8217;ve just recognized over my time leading different businesses in different industries is no matter how clear something is in your mind, or your leadership team&#8217;s mind, you cannot repeat it frequently enough to the rest of the organization. They might not be paying attention, they may not understand it, they might have been in a customer meeting at that time, whatever, they might have missed it.\n\nStory Continues\n&#8220;Every month, one of my direct reports sends out an email with a video that talks about just one of our leadership mindsets. Every all-hands, we do the same thing. We&#8217;ll pick one, and have examples that speak to it, because it helps make it real for people and helps people have better context around it.&#8221;\n\nHow Hart uses AI at work A key focus for every CEO at present is how they can leverage AI at work, either within their business or in their own personal use. KPMG&#8217;s 2025 U.S. CEO Outlook found 74% of leaders said investing in AI was a top priority despite economic uncertainty, with 79% saying they were confident they were ahead of the curve on adoption and utilization.\n\nPreviously, CEOs have told Fortune they&#8217;re using AI for everything from recruitment to management, to meeting prep and document summaries .\nHart, an English major, is well-versed in the efficiencies AI can offer but said one thing he never uses the technology for is writing. &#8220;For me, writing is the way I think, and so trying to outsource that would be effectively giving up thinking,&#8221; Hart said. &#8220;So that would not be appealing or effective for me personally.&#8221;\nStaff across Coursera are encouraged to experiment with AI as they see fit, currently without any goalposts in place for what they should be trying to achieve. The most useful outcome of this approach, Hart adds, is that colleagues are sharing their use-cases and best practices in an internal forum called &#8216;AI Sparks.&#8217;\n\n&#8220;AI Sparks is a monthly meeting where people from across the company, at any level, are coming to share how they&#8217;re using AI in their job. Those are by far the most well-attended and popular meetings that we do at the company,&#8221; Hart said.\nA final lesson from Amazon prepared Hart for the era of AI: If you get too caught up on outcomes in the early stages of a new technology, you miss the bigger picture.\n&#8220;My perspective is we just want to get a workforce that is using it as much as possible, in as many ways as possible. Over time, we&#8217;ll start to be much more focused on quantifying the impact on all of that,&#8221; Hart said. &#8220;If we focus myopically on that right now, I think we would miss the opportunity to have a far greater impact down the line.&#8221;\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Expedia and Amazon\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 11:45 PM PST 14 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nEXPE\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL – December 26, 2025 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE and Amazon, Inc. AMZN.\nIndustry: e-Commerce Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2808394/weak-macro-cant-stop-e-commerce-stocks-expedia-and-amazon\nWhile macroeconomic challenges mount, the e-commerce market is growing through innovation, technology and insight, as it continues to take away slices of the total retail pie. Commerce Department numbers are proof of this trend: ecommerce sales in the third quarter of 2025 grew 5.1% over 3Q24 (1.9% sequentially), with total retail sales increasing 4.1% (1.5% sequentially).\n\nEcommerce accounted for around 16.4% of total U.S. retail sales. A point to note here is that consumers are increasingly blending their online and offline shopping experiences, so this distinction may soon become irrelevant. As a corollary, it is those retailers that have the capacity to sell through both channels that will be able to compete tomorrow.\n\nAmazon for instance started building its physical presence several years ago because nothing beats proximity to the consumer when it comes to retail. Our other pick Expedia is an online travel booking company. As consumers mostly book travel online these days, this business is growing strongly.\n\nThe convenience of online shopping remains the top reason for ecommerce volumes and this is particularly true of Gen-Z, which is, increasingly, the more relevant component of sales. Many of these buyers have grown up on the Internet and are accustomed to a high level of digitization.\n\nThey are also likely to hang out on popular social media platforms, allowing themselves to be influenced by the latest trends there. This is driving an entirely different perspective on the ecommerce space, one that revolves around digital influencers and appears to be expanding with more advanced technology such as AR/VR, social commerce and generative AI.\n\nConsumers appear to be more reticent about spending this holiday season. Adobe Analytics data based on 1 trillion+ visits to U.S. retail sites, covering 100 million products and 18 product categories, shows that ecommerce sales increased 6.1% in the first 6 weeks of the holiday shopping season ending Dec 12, reports Forbes. Significantly, customer returns were down 2.5%, indicating that customers have turned incrementally cautious because of the macroeconomic environment, and are using AI tools for more considered purchasing.\n\nIndustry Description Internet - Commerce continues to evolve as the technologies driving it advance.\n\nStory Continues\nOn one side are increasingly powerful and capable user devices. On the other are increasingly sophisticated platforms often combining chatbots, AI and social media. AI continues to deliver increased user satisfaction and is growing into a primary enabler.\nDifferentiation comes from better technology for improved showcasing, variety, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty, etc. as well as good customer service and more shipping options, which generally tip the scales in favor of larger players. Particularly so, because there is fierce price competition necessitating deep discounting in many cases.\n\nCurrent Trends Driving the Internet-Commerce Industry · AI is shaping up to be one of the major enablers of ecommerce , as customers get increasingly comfortable with the superior recommendations and personalization it offers. AI-enabled product search is very common today and all the major retailers offer shoppers some form of AI assistance. The latest development here is agentic commerce where LLM models like ChapGPT recommend products, compare features and complete the sale. Even if you’re unsure about what to buy, the statement of your general intention may be enough to complete a sale. Adobe estimates that AI-driven traffic to retail websites will be up 515-520% from the 2024 holiday season with November being the heaviest (up 758%). AI referrals on desktops will be up 74.5% and on mobile up 25.5%.\nThe total retail experience between physical and digital continues to blur as most consumers blend their online and offline activities. This usually takes the forms of research online and buy in-store or buy online and pick up in-store. Physical stores are increasingly experience centers allowing the traditional touch and feel that many customers can’t do without. It’s also evident that some customers prefer to walk out with their purchase. Therefore, a solid physical presence is undoubtedly a positive. Convenience is also an important factor, any experience that increases the speed of delivery/pickup is preferred. This may entail increased reliance on robots, self-driven delivery vehicles and drones that could ease bottlenecks and make deliveries smoother and cheaper. Therefore, it isn’t just the online-first retailers that are building a physical presence but also those that have traditionally been physical retailers that are digitizing to various degrees, or operating through their digital store-fronts.\nA trend that Gen-Z is popularizing is social commerce . Social commerce means the ability to discover, research and complete the purchase of products and experiences on a social media platform, often and increasingly more so, through influencers. With the influencer culture, user-generated content is reaching a new level of importance for brands on social media platforms. Brands usually have store fronts on these platforms where influencers also discuss their products, thus driving traffic to them. The social element of shopping that ecommerce had taken out is thus returning through this route. Since social commerce first became popular in China, it isn’t surprising that the Chinese social media platform TikTok that’s also very popular with Gen Z, is the number one place for social commerce. According to eMarketer via akeneo, 46% of Gen Z consumers are already using TikTok to initiate their product searches, rather than the traditional Google and Amazon. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and a host of others are also very popular. Instagram and YouTube are finetuning their checkout systems, so customers can place their orders in-app, without leaving their feeds (akeneo).\nAnother notable trend is a subscription format for repeat-use items. This makes it easier for the consumer to order and for the retailer to plan and identify loyalty. Retailers usually offer some kind of discount to consumers choosing this option, which makes it all the more attractive. Subscriptions have become more or less ubiquitous with repeat use items and this trend is expected to expand going forward as both tangible and intangible commodities and low-value and high-value items are increasingly sold ‘as-a-service’.\nThe macroeconomic situation continues to evolve , although we can probably say that a deep recession is unlikely. Earlier this month, the Fed took a cautious tone, with Powell saying that although official forecasts for growth and inflation have improved, there are risks to both. He warned that the jobs data could be overestimating hiring. Right now, the jobs market appears to be softening with new job openings declining in November and the unemployment rate rising. Consumer confidence dipped nearly 7 points in November with consumers expressing reluctance to buy big-ticket items. Although disposable income has increased in each month since May, consumers do not expect much improvement in future business conditions or the jobs market. The S&P Global said in its inaugural holiday sales survey report that the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop would result in a tempered outlook. The geopolitical situation is also volatile, and tariffs remain a bone of contention with major trading partners, so the negative impact could continue.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Strength The Zacks Internet - Commerce Industry is a rather large group within the broader Zacks Retail And Wholesale Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #79, which places it in the top 33% of 243 Zacks industries.\nOur research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. So the group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates positive near-term prospects.\n\nEcommerce being in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is the result of its relative performance versus others. What we’re seeing in the aggregate estimate revisions are some ups and downs in estimates over the past year. The aggregate earnings estimate for 2025 is down 5.5%, while that for 2026 is down 7.1%. The macroeconomic uncertainty, the cautious tone around rate cuts and fears of a possible recession are likely contributing to softer spending and thus estimate cuts.\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nIndustry Returns Have Been Sluggish Until August, the Zacks Electronic - Commerce Industry has traded relatively close to the broader Retail and Wholesale sector as well as the S&P 500, although it started treading water thereafter, continuing mostly at a premium to the broader retail sector.\nThe stocks in this industry have collectively gained 4.2% over the past year, compared to the 3.4% gain for the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector and the 15.8% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nIndustry Fairly Valued Historically, the industry has traded at a premium to the sector as well as the S&P 500. However, being more volatile, the difference has varied considerably. Its current price-to-forward 12 months’ earnings (P/E) of 24.03X represents a premium of 3.1% to the S&P 500 and discount of 2.2% to the broader retail sector. It’s worth noting, however, that the industry is currently trading at a slight discount to its own median level of 24.48X.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio There are a number of stocks currently worth picking, especially because of the significant variety that exists in this industry in terms of lines of business, business model, location and so forth. This is also the reason that choosing can be tricky. We have used our proprietary ranking system to pick 2 stocks that appear attractive today.\n\nExpedia Group, Inc. : Seattle-based Expedia is one of the largest online travel booking companies in the world, operating through B2C, B2B and trivago segments. It serves leisure and corporate travelers. Expedia takes bookings for hotel and alternative accommodation, cruise ships, rental cars, air tickets and such other services. Through Expedia Partner Solutions, a B2B brand and Egencia, it provides corporate travel management services. It also provides advertising and media services.\nExpedia is seeing growth in both B2C and B2B but the latter segment is growing faster by far, raising the corporate average. In the last quarter for instance, total gross bookings grew 12%, driven by a 26% increase in B2B. Similarly, the 9% revenue growth was driven by 18% growth in the B2B segment.\n\nThis strength is attributable to the way businesses are viewing travel. There is a greater focus on live events like seminars and conferences, for which attendance is going up. Business development has always been the biggest driver of corporate travel and this year is no different. But upskilling employees is close, possibly because companies are preparing their employees for the massive change that AI is bringing. In-person engagement with clients and partners, followed by conference attendance are the other factors responsible for the strength in business travel (Deloitte: Corporate Travel Forecast, Sept 2025).\nExpedia had discontinued its quarterly dividend since the outbreak of the pandemic, but resumed this year. This is an added positive for all investors, especially income-seeking ones.\n\nAnalysts appear highly optimistic about this company. In the last 60 days, estimates for 2025 have increased 96 cents (6.8%) while those for 2026 increased $1.54 (9.2%). At current levels these estimates represent 6.7% revenue growth and 24.6% earnings growth in 2025. The following year, revenue and earnings are expected to grow a respective 6.3% and 20.8%.\nThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is up 51.9% year to date.\nAmazon, Inc. : Seattle, Washington-based Amazon is one of the leading online marketplaces in the world. It has developed its business around the Prime loyalty program that drives sales across merchandise and media categories. The online business is supplemented with broad physical presence, augmented by the acquisition of the premium grocery company Whole Foods Market back in 2017. Amazon also enjoys a dominant position in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, courtesy Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe company’s sheer size and scale allow it to offer products at some of the cheapest prices. Amazon is known for its huge discounts and deals, and the number of services it piles into Prime has ensured a subscription revenue channel. Amazon has steadily increased prices over the years, but the user base remains sticky. Its profitability depends on the AWS business, where it still enjoys first-mover advantage. With access to humongous amounts of data, Amazon has developed some AI-powered products to make the most of generative AI and other developments in the space. It also uses AI and automation across the business.\nOne development of concern is the recent settlement with the FTC where it was proved that Amazon used unfair practices to trick people into taking Prime memberships and then made it very difficult for them to cancel or refuse it. Amazon was directed to simplify the process, remove ambiguities for buyers and also ordered to pay $2.5 billion ($1 billion in penalty and $1.5 billion in compensation). It is also required to abide by certain fair-practice directives.\n\nAmazon also announced a huge layoff of 14,000 staff that investors need not worry about. Amazon’s sales aren’t shrinking. On the other hand, AI is allowing greater efficiencies, such that certain management layers and HR staff are no longer necessary. Amazon expects the leaner structure to facilitate more nimble operation akin to a very large startup.\nDespite its huge business volumes, analysts are optimistic about double-digit revenue and earnings growth this year although the earnings growth rate is expected to come down a bit next year. Of course this is early days yet, and actual growth rates may be much higher. Amazon certainly has a great track record of beating estimates: at double-digit rates in each of the last four quarters, averaging 22.5%. For 2025, analysts expect 11.9% revenue growth and 29.7% earnings growth. For 2026, revenue and earnings growth are expected to be a respective 11.3% and 9.3%. In the last 60 days, analyst estimates for 2025 and 2026 have increased 31 cents (4.5%) and 18 cents (2.3%).\n\nThe shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares are up 1.3% over the past year.\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Europe Could Wipe Out Hundreds of Unlicensed Crypto Firms Next Week\n\nLockridge Okoth\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:56 PM PST 4 min read\n\nA small EU nation is set to enforce one of Europe’s strictest crypto crackdowns, warning that hundreds of unlicensed digital asset firms could face fines, website blocks, and even prison time starting next week.\nThe central bank has made it clear that any platform continuing to onboard users or handle crypto without proper MiCA authorization after December 31 will be considered illegal.\n\nLithuania Draws a Hard Line on Crypto Starting January 1 The Bank of Lithuania, which oversees the country’s crypto sector, has urged all service providers to secure licenses immediately. While over 370 firms are officially registered in the nation, only around 120 are actively operating and reporting revenues.\nAlarmingly, fewer than 10%, or roughly 30 companies, have applied for MiCA licenses so far. This leaves dozens of active firms and hundreds of registered entities exposed to enforcement.\n\nA transitional period, during which crypto exchanges, wallet operators, and other service providers can obtain authorization, expires at the end of 2025.\nAfter the deadline, Lietuvos Bankas has stated it will take stringent action against non-compliant firms, including fines, blocking websites, and pursuing criminal liability under national law. Violations could carry prison terms of up to four years.\nDalia Juškevičienė, head of the Central Bank’s Investment Services and Undertakings Supervision Division, emphasized the importance of orderly shutdowns for firms that do not plan to continue operations.\nCustomers must be provided with clear guidance on transferring fiat and digital assets to other custodians or self-hosted wallets before services are discontinued.\nThe crackdown positions the Baltic state as a strict gateway for MiCA-compliant operations rather than a permissive crypto hub.\nAuthorities have warned that enforcement will go beyond targeting active platforms. Instead, it will target registered entities that maintain websites, accounts, or custody services.\n\nThis approach ensures the regulator can protect investors and maintain transparency and integrity in the market.\nEurope Tightens the Reins as MiCA Enforcement Moves from Theory to Action The looming enforcement follows a broader trend of regulatory tightening across Europe. MiCA rules, which establish licensing requirements and investor safeguards, are now moving from theory to practice.\n\nStory Continues\nThe region is signaling that unlicensed operations will no longer be tolerated, creating a high-stakes environment for crypto firms in jurisdictions seeking compliance.\nBesides Lithuania, another European country has similar aspirations. Bordering Lithuania to the north, Latvia is also working toward turning the country into another Baltic gateway to MiCA.\nMārtiņš Kazāks, governor of Latvijas Banka, the Latvian central bank, highlighted that the country has talent, entrepreneurs, and a sound financial infrastructure. Based on this, it looks to strengthen its economy by leveraging the crypto industry.\nAgainst these backdrops, global crypto platforms are moving quickly to achieve MiCA compliance before enforcement deadlines.\nKuCoin, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, has recently become MiCAR compliant following approval by the Austrian Financial Market Authority.\nThe exchange highlighted the value of regulated crypto access and its commitment to operating within the new legal framework in its announcement.\n\nCoinbase also followed suit four months ago, raising the bar for EU compliance with MiCA-compliant whitepapers.\nOutside Europe, Lithuania’s move mirrors developments in other regions, such as the United Arab Emirates, where sweeping Central Bank reforms have criminalized unlicensed crypto services, including self-custody wallets and market-data tools.\n\nThese parallel measures highlight a rising global emphasis on regulation, compliance, and investor protection.\nWith the December 31 deadline looming, crypto firms in this Baltic EU state have just days to secure licenses or begin orderly wind-downs.\nAs regulators prepare to act, the coming week could significantly reshape the European crypto arena, eliminating non-compliant operators and marking the beginning of a new era of strict MiCA enforcement.\nRead original story Europe Could Wipe Out Hundreds of Unlicensed Crypto Firms Next Week by Lockridge Okoth at beincrypto.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Designed for anyone feeling trapped in recurring patterns with partners, friends, family, or colleagues, the app uses AI-assisted coaching and embedded somatic tools to help users create real emotional change. Unlike traditional therapy apps, Hearten AI isn't built for diagnosis - it's a supportive structure designed to meet people in the exact relationship difficulty they're facing, offering science-backed psychoeducation, reflective dialogue, and practical body-based exercises. The result is accessible, empathy-driven coaching without the bias or superficial advice found in generic self-help tools.\n\n\"As someone who's worked at the intersection of wellness, design thinking, and AI, my philosophy for Hearten is simple: accessible healing, personalized safety, and actionable tools,\" says founder Shanshan Gong. \"From breakup recovery to rebuilding after infidelity and shifting long-standing patterns, our roadmap is about giving people clear, guided pathways for the specific relationship challenges they are facing - not just generic advice.\"\nWho Hearten AI is for\nMany of these midlife users are not just looking for quick tips; they want to understand and actively rewire the relationship patterns that have followed them for years. They may be recovering from divorce or infidelity, juggling teenagers and aging parents, or questioning long-standing dynamics in their closest relationships. For people in this stage, a tool that only targets thoughts is not enough - they need support that reaches the nervous system, where so many of their automatic reactions and attachment patterns are stored.\n\nHearten AI's approach is grounded in growing research on the brain-body connection, which shows that emotional responses and relational habits are deeply tied to the state of the nervous system, not just to conscious thinking. Instead of asking users to simply \"think differently,\" the app is built to help them feel safer, calmer, and more regulated in the moments that matter most. This is where its embedded somatic exercises come in: short, guided practices that can be launched directly from the chat to help users downshift from fight-or-flight, reconnect with their body, and create enough internal space to choose a new response.\n\nStory Continues\nAround these tools, Hearten AI uses a framework called \"regulate, resonate, regenerate.\" First, the app helps users regulate their nervous system so they are not overwhelmed by emotion. Then it guides them to resonate more accurately with what they feel and need in a given relationship moment. Finally, it supports them in regenerating new patterns - turning insights into healthier boundaries, more honest communication, and different choices over time. By making this process available 24/7, one conversation and one somatic exercise at a time, the app aims to make meaningful change feel less like a breakthrough event and more like a series of accessible, repeatable steps.\n\nHow Hearten AI Supports Toxic Relationship Healing\nHearten AI is built for the harder side of relationship healing: breaking toxic patterns, recovering from breakups, and working through infidelity or long-standing dynamics, not just getting quick tips. It invites users to describe what happened in a difficult interaction and then guides them with structured prompts, psychoeducation, and suggestions for next steps in love, family, and work relationships.\nSomatic videos are embedded directly into the coaching chat, so users can launch short nervous-system regulation exercises at the exact moment they feel overwhelmed, shut down, or triggered. This combination of reflective conversation, science-backed guidance, and in-the-moment body-based tools turns each session into a focused mini-coaching experience that can fit into a busy day.\nThe Science Behind Somatic Relationship Coaching\nMany people stuck in toxic relationships carry unhealed attachment wounds or complex trauma from earlier in life, which show up as patterns like choosing unavailable partners, people-pleasing, or staying in one-sided relationships. These patterns live not only in thoughts but in the nervous system, which can react to conflict or intimacy as if it is still under threat.\n\nSomatic and trauma research suggests that real change comes from repeated experiences of safety and regulation, not mindset shifts alone. Hearten AI uses brief somatic exercises and just-in-time support to help users calm their system while processing painful relationship events, making it easier to practice new boundaries, communication, and choices in real time.\nWhere to Find Hearten AI\nHearten AI is available on iOS and Android .\nAbout Somabrain, the Company Behind Hearten AI\nHearten AI is developed by Somabrain, a Helsinki-based startup founded in April 2023 by relationship coach & wellness entrepreneur Shanshan Gong. Somabrain's work sits at the intersection of behavioral science, somatic practices, and AI, with a mission to make nervous-system-aware relationship support widely accessible.\n\nBefore founding Somabrain, Gong launched a web-based, gamified app in 2022 that combined somatic exercises with situational AI relationship advice, which laid the groundwork for Hearten AI's current approach. Since Somabrain's official launch, the team has focused on bringing this vision to mobile, rolling out Hearten AI on both iOS and Android so users can access somatic relationship coaching anytime, anywhere.\nMedia Contact:\nCompany: Somabrain Oy (Ltd)\nContact: Gong Shanshan\nEmail: shanshan@heartenapp.ai\nWebsite: www.heartenapp.ai\nSOURCE: Somabrain Oy (Ltd)\n\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What Is the Smartest Quantum Computing Stock to Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nQBTS\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Pure-play developers like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum are the hottest quantum computing stocks right now.\nBig tech giants are also exploring quantum computing in addition to their established generative artificial intelligence (AI) products.\nNvidia is quietly building a quantum AI ecosystem that stands to benefit, no matter which systems succeed in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOne of the hottest pockets of the artificial intelligence (AI) realm in 2025 was quantum computing. Shares of pure-play quantum developers such as IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum each handily trounced the S&P 500 this year.\nWhat many investors might not fully realize is that several members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are also exploring quantum computing technology alongside their existing generative AI efforts. While Alphabet , Amazon , and Microsoft have received some notoriety around their custom quantum processors, I think there's a more lucrative opportunity hiding in plain sight.\nI'll detail how Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is quietly building a full-spectrum quantum computing suite, and explain why this could be a major catalyst for the company as the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure era begins.\nNvidia is laying the foundation between quantum and accelerated computing At the moment, quantum computing is an exploratory pursuit. While some businesses are assessing how the technology may be integrated within their existing AI framework, quantum technology has little use at the enterprise level today.\nAgainst this backdrop, pure-play developers are primarily focused on research and development right now. IonQ and Rigetti specialize in gate-based approaches leveraging trapped ions and superconducting techniques. D-Wave, for its part, is more niche -- focusing on quantum annealing processes for optimization tasks.\n\nThe main takeaway is that quantum pure plays are currently engaged with the actual physics behind the creation and configuration of quantum bits -- known as qubits -- within new computing architectures.\nAs mentioned, the big three cloud providers have each designed their own quantum processors -- dubbed Willow (Alphabet), Ocelot (Amazon), and Majorana (Microsoft). While quantum computing is not a meaningful contributor to their respective businesses at this time, it's clear that big tech is fascinated by how this emerging technology may eventually impact the broader AI opportunity.\nNvidia's approach is entirely different from that of its megacap counterparts, as well as the pure plays. Instead of building its own quantum computers, Nvidia is seeking to become a bridge between the software and hardware investments necessary to build these systems.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia offers a software platform called CUDA-Q, within which developers can write applications that work across a network of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (quantum processing units). On the hardware side, Nvidia has built a high-speed interconnect called NVQLink. NVQLink represents a pathway for QPUs and GPUs to seamlessly communicate without straining latency and bandwidth.\n\nEssentially, Nvidia's decision to provide a software and hardware ecosystem allows programmers to easily test their AI workloads across a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment. This is a particularly smart move because it positions Nvidia to be a beneficiary regardless of which quantum processor designs or qubit architecture emerges as the market standard down the road.\nWill 2026 be a big year for Nvidia? Nvidia's growth trajectory is directly tied to the budgets of big tech. As the slope of the lines in the chart illustrate, AI hyperscalers are accelerating their capital expenditures (capex) -- suggesting that data center buildouts, networking equipment, and chip procurement remain high priorities.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs suggests that the hyperscalers alone will contribute nearly half a trillion dollars to AI infrastructure in 2026. While this is great news for Nvidia in the short term, AI infrastructure is expected to become a nearly $7 trillion opportunity by the end of the decade, according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a couple of key ideas. First, Nvidia appears well-positioned to benefit from rising data center spend going into next year. More importantly, however, AI infrastructure is shaping up to be a longer-term secular opportunity.\nGiven these dynamics, Nvidia could continue receiving outsized demand for its products as quantum computing becomes a more meaningful contributor to the broader AI narrative over the next several years. So while CUDA-Q and NVQLink may not yet be major contributors to Nvidia's business today relative to its core compute and networking services, I'm encouraged by the company's pursuit of quantum computing and see these products eventually becoming an important storyline in its evolution throughout the AI infrastructure chapter.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a good buy? As of this writing (Dec. 22), Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 24. Considering Nvidia's current growth in combination with Wall Street's outlook, the stock is valued quite reasonably.\nIn my eyes, quantum computing represents just another pillar supporting Nvidia's growth arc as AI continues to dominate the market. For these reasons, I think Nvidia is headed for further valuation expansion heading into 2026 and well beyond -- making it a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "'No winner': Kosovo snap poll unlikely to end damaging deadlock\n\nIsmet HAJDARI\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:19 PM PST 4 min read\n\nBefore the first vote is even cast in Kosovo's snap election on Sunday, experts predict it is unlikely to end the political crisis that has been gripping Europe's youngest country for almost a year.\nThe Balkan nation has been politically deadlocked since the inconclusive vote in February, which outgoing premier Albin Kurti's Vetevendosje (VV) party won but without enough seats to form a government.\n\nAfter months of wrangling in a stalled parliament, the caretaker prime minister is going back to the electorate in a vote that analysts say will change very little.\n\"I think that the December 28 elections will not bring any clarity,\" economist Mehmet Gjata told AFP as he predicted Kurti's party would come out on top again.\nPolitical analyst Fatime Hajdari agreed that \"chances were high\" that VV would secure the most votes, but said little else was clear.\n- Charismatic Kurti -\nIf anyone can secure a majority, Kurti, once dubbed Kosovo's Che Guevara for his radical past, has a rare record.\nHis party swept to power in 2021 in the largest electoral victory since the country's independence from Serbia in 2008, taking over 50 percent of the vote.\n\nFrom a student radical to a political prisoner, Kurti's long path to the prime ministership has made him one of the most recognisable and influential politicians in Kosovo.\nHis blend of nationalism and a reform agenda has proven popular in a country whose sovereignty is still contested by Serbia, more than two decades after its war for independence ended.\nBut Gjata says things may have changed since Kurti's last term.\n\"I'm afraid that the current political crisis will repeat itself, because VV will not get more than 50 percent of the votes,\" the economist said.\n\"We will have no winner again.\"\nThe largest opposition parties have refused to join a Kurti coalition, all but assuring a fragmented parliament.\nThe only realistic challenge to VV would be \"cooperation\" between the three major opposition parties, former foreign minister and opposition candidate Enver Hoxhaj said.\n\n\"I think that only they can offer stability,\" Hoxhaj said.\n- Popular Serb policy blamed for 'instability' -\nFor Kurti and his party, countering Serbian influence in Kosovo has long been a focus, drawing support at home but criticism abroad.\nWhen Serbian forces withdrew under NATO bombardment in 1999, it left many of its state structures in place for ethnic Serbs who live mainly in the north.\nKurti has labelled these services \"instruments of intimidation, threat and control\" and spent nearly his entire second term uprooting the system -- and angering Belgrade in the process.\n\nStory Continues\nThe resulting tensions in the north, which last flared into violence in 2023, have drawn sanctions from the European Union and caused Washington to accuse Kurti's government of increasing \"instability\".\nBut among his voters, the removal of Serbian influence remains popular, Hajdari said.\n\n\"The extension of sovereignty there is perceived by the citizens as a major success,\" Hajdari said.\nMost opposition parties avoid the issue, but the Serb List -- which contests and retains most of the ten reserved Serb seats in parliament -- regularly clashes with Kurti's agenda in the north.\nThe minor party, with close ties to Belgrade, has previously called the government's moves in the north \"ethnic cleansing\" and has said they are willing to work with other parties to keep Kurti out of power.\n- A year of 'colossal damage' -\nWithout a parliament, key international agreements have not been ratified, putting hundreds of millions of euros in assistance funds at risk.\nTwo national polls and a local election have cost one of Europe's poorest nations at least 30 million euros ($35 million) this year.\n\nOver a dozen government institutions and agencies have also been left leaderless, as the mandates of their managers expired without new ones being appointed.\nGjata said \"colossal damage\" had been done to the economy by divided lawmakers over the past months.\n\"They have put Kosovo in a state of anarchy,\" he said.\nWhile lawmakers bickered, the cost of the crisis would be felt by the Balkan nation's citizens, Hajdari warned.\n\"That is precisely why Kosovo needs a stable and functional government that would focus on development and welfare.\"\nih/al/fg\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Only junkies gathering there benefit from it now,\" nextdoor neighbour butcher Arsim Futko, 62, told AFP.\n\nFor seven years, it waited for a European Union-funded revamp, only for the money to be suddenly withdrawn with little explanation.\nNow it awaits similar repairs promised by the national government that has since been paralysed by inconclusive elections in February.\nAnd it is anyone's guess whether the new government that will come out of Sunday's snap election will keep the promise.\n\n- 'Collateral damage' -\nCinema director Ares Shporta said the cinema has become \"collateral damage\" in a broader geopolitical game after the EU hit his country with sanctions in 2023.\nThe delayed repairs \"affected our morale, it affected our lives, it affected the trust of the community in us,\" Shporta said.\n\nBrussels slapped Kosovo with sanctions over heightened tensions between the government and the ethnic Serb minority that live in parts of the country as Pristina pushed to exert more control over areas still tightly linked to Belgrade.\nCultural institutions have been among the hardest-hit sectors, as international funding dried up and local decisions were stalled by the parliamentary crisis.\nAccording to an analysis by the Kosovo think tank, the GAP Institute for Advanced Studies, sanctions have resulted in around 613 million euros ($719 million) being suspended or paused, with the cultural sector taking a hit of 15-million-euro hit.\n- 'Ground zero' -\nWith political stalemate threatening to drag on into another year, there are warnings that further funding from abroad could also be in jeopardy.\n\nSince February's election when outgoing premier Albin Kurti topped the polls but failed to win a majority, his caretaker government has been deadlocked with opposition lawmakers.\nMonths of delays, spent mostly without a parliament, meant little legislative work could be done.\nAhead of the snap election on Sunday, the government said that more than 200 million euros ($235 million) will be lost forever due to a failure to ratify international agreements.\nOnce the top beneficiary of the EU Growth Plan in the Balkans, Europe's youngest country now trails most of its neighbours, the NGO Group for Legal and Political Studies' executive director Njomza Arifi told AFP.\n\nStory Continues\n\"While some of the countries in the region have already received the second tranches, Kosovo still remains at ground zero.\"\nAlthough there have been some enthusiastic signs of easing a half of EU sanctions by January, Kurti's continued push against Serbian institutions and influence in the country's north continues to draw criticism from both Washington and Brussels.\n\n- 'On the edge' -\nAcross the river from the Lumbardhi, the funding cuts have also been felt at Dokufest, a documentary and short film festival that draws people to the region.\n\"The festival has had to make staff cuts. Unfortunately, there is a risk of further cuts if things don't change,\" Dokufest artistic director Veton Nurkollari said.\n\"Fortunately, we don't depend on just one source because we could end up in a situation where, when the tap is turned off, everything is turned off.\"\nHe said that many in the cultural sector were desperate for the upcoming government to get the sanctions lifted by ratification of the agreements that would allow EU funds to flow again.\n\"Kosovo is the only one left on the edge and without these funds.\"\nih/al/fg\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "8 million minimum wage workers are up for a raise in January. Some will hit a historic $15 milestone.\n\nJuliana Kaplan,Madison Hoff\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:16 PM PST 3 min read\n\nNineteen states will raise their minimum wages in January, affecting over 8 million workers.\nSix states will reach at least a $15 minimum wage for the first time, over double the federal $7.25 minimum.\nFor the first time, more workers will live in states with at least a $15 minimum wage than the federal minimum.\n\nFor workers in 19 states, New Year's won't just mean festivities and futile resolutions — they'll also be getting paid more as minimum wage increases kick in. For some, those raises will be historic: In six states, the minimum wage will reach at least $15 an hour for the first time.\nThe 19 states hiking wages will impact over 8 million workers, an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, found. Women, Black, and Hispanic workers are set to be disproportionately affected by the new increases, per EPI's analysis, and workers in states like Missouri and Nebraska will see their annual wages increase by nearly $1,000 on average.\nThe map below shows which states are set for a raise in January, and what those increases will be. Most January increases are due to inflation adjustments , although some are tied to legislation or ballot measures, such as in Rhode Island , where legislation set a gradual increase from $15 in 2025 to $17 by 2027. The minimum wage there will reach $16 on January 1, 2026. A few states will hike their minimum wage later this year; Florida will increase its minimum by a dollar to $15 at the end of September.\n\nThe new round of raises will hit an \"important milestone for the minimum wage movement,\" according to EPI's Sebastian Martinez Hickey.\n\"What's really distinctive is that for the first time this January, there are going to be more workers that live in a state with at least a $15 minimum wage compared to those that live in a state with the federal minimum wage, which is still $7.25,\" Hickey said.\n\nHowever, the fresh round of statewide increases means an even greater discrepancy in some local wages and the federal minimum wage . The majority of states have stepped in to increase their pay beyond the federal minimum, although 20 states still either mandate $7.25 or default to the federal line.\nYannet Lathrop, a senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, said that while the new spate of $15 minimum wages will likely be a boon for many — and reflects a long history of organizing — workers will still contend with affordability concerns.\n\"Even these wages, as good as they are, as positive as they are for workers, none of them are going to fully cover the cost of living for even single workers without families in any state or locality,\" Lathrop said. \"These workers are still going to be facing a crisis of affordability. It's just that in some places where minimum wages are going up much more, the pain of that gap between what the cost of living is and what the minimum wage is going to be a little bit better for workers.\"\n\nStory Continues\nAs states opt to hike pay on their own, a federal minimum increase still looks unlikely. Democrats failed to garner any Republican support for an effort to raise the minimum wage to $15 during President Joe Biden's term. President Donald Trump had previously opened the door to raising the wage beyond $7.25, but there has been no legislative movement toward making that a reality.\nAre you set to be affected by a minimum wage increase, or currently make the minimum wage?

      "Content": "Dan Ives Loves This Under-the-Radar AI Stock for 2026\n\nNauman Khan\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nWhen investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, individuals tend to focus on the large, mega-cap stocks that are all the rage, yet the next wave of AI may more comfortably benefit smaller infrastructure businesses. As capital shifts from model development to deployment, people are demanding more cloud capacity, superior compute power, and AI-ready data centers, making the demand hot.\n\nOne quietly notable name that has been catching Wall Street's eye is Nebius (NBIS). Wedbush analyst Dan Ives just listed NBIS as his top AI infrastructure pick for 2026, arguing the company’s positioning and tech make it a likely acquisition target for a hyperscaler such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), or Amazon (AMZN).\nMore News from Barchart Super Micro Computer Stock Tumbles, But Investors are Piling into Its Call Options - Time to Buy SMCI?\nA $61 Billion Reason to Buy Amazon Stock for 2026\nRKLB Stock Bullish Diagonal Trade Targets a Price of $85 by January 16th\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nFor investors looking beyond the obvious AI leaders, here’s a closer look at why NBIS is drawing bullish attention heading into 2026.\nAbout NBIS Stock Based in Amsterdam, Nebius provides full-stack cloud and GPU-accelerated AI infrastructure across Europe and North America. It builds sustainable data centers and rents AI‑optimized compute clusters with liquid cooling and high‑power GPUs to hyperscalers and enterprises. The company emerged from a restructuring of the former Yandex infrastructure business and now combines its core AI cloud service with subsidiaries in autonomous vehicles and education technology.\n\nValued at around $23 billion by market cap, NBIS stock has been stellar this year. After languishing post-restructuring, the shares rallied over the summer, in part when Nvidia (NVDA) disclosed a stake in the company, peaking above $140 by October. A surge in new contracts with tech giants, such as Microsoft and Meta (META), further fueled investor enthusiasm. Until now, Nebius has gained roughly 225% year-to-date (YTD), despite a pullback from the recent high.\nThat performance comes with clear trade-offs. Nebius now trades at valuation levels that leave little room for error. Its trailing price-to-sales multiple sits in the mid-50s, far above the sector median, which trades closer to 4x, and its own 5-year historical average, which sits at 24x.\nIn short, the market is pricing Nebius as a future cornerstone of AI infrastructure. That may prove correct, but it also means any slowdown in contract growth, pricing pressure, or capital-spending misstep could weigh heavily on the stock. At today’s levels, execution matters as much as vision.\n\nStory Continues\nImpact of Ives’ Acquisition Thesis Dan Ives’s endorsement, calling Nebius “ripe” for a 2026 acquisition by a hyperscaler, gave the stock a short-term boost. The day his comments were publicized, NBIS spiked about 14% following the news. Investors interpreted it as validation of Nebius’s strategic value. Ives specifically noted that among AI “neocloud” firms, Nebius is the most likely buyout candidate, which fueled positive sentiment.\n\nFor the company, this means fresh investor interest and higher trading volume, though it’s too early to say if any deal is imminent. In the near term, the news underscores Nebius’s industry stature; if true, a 2026 deal could be transformative. But even absent an actual acquisition, the hype helps spotlight Nebius’s core business and contracts, potentially improving access to capital.\nNebius Delivered Solid Revenue Yet Widened Losses Nebius delivered a strong quarter in Q3 2025, posting revenue of $146.1 million, up 355% year-over-year (YoY), as demand for AI infrastructure surged and large new contracts came online. This growth was largely driven by strong uptake across its core AI infrastructure business, which now accounts for the vast majority of results.\n\nProfitability, however, remains a work in progress. Nebius reported a GAAP net loss of $119.6 million, wider than a year earlier, reflecting aggressive expansion and rising depreciation tied to new data center capacity. But there was a bright spot below the surface. Adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed sharply to $5.2 million, a significant improvement from nearly $46 million last year, as higher revenue began to offset operating expenses.\nOn the other side, spending ramped up sharply as the company accelerated its buildout. Operating cash burn rose to $80.6 million, while capital expenditures jumped to nearly $1.0 billion in the quarter, underscoring how capital-intensive AI infrastructure has become. Even so, Nebius ended the period with a formidable $4.8 billion cash balance, supported by recent equity and debt raises, giving it ample firepower to execute its growth plans.\n\nLooking ahead, management remains aggressive. Nebius is targeting an annualized revenue run rate of $750 million to $1 billion by the end of 2025 and plans to scale connected power capacity to 800 to 1,000 megawatts by 2026, with even more capacity already under contract.\nCEO Arkady Volozh has said the company has effectively sold out its existing capacity, with future capacity already pre-committed. While losses are expected to persist in the near term, the strategy is clear: scale first, optimize later.\nRecent Developments Since the quarter's close, Nebius has continued to make headlines. On Dec. 17, it launched Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 featuring Nvidia’s new Blackwell ultra-power GPUs. The company said it is now “ the first cloud in Europe to operate ” these cutting-edge Nvidia GB300 and HGX B300 systems in production, a technical milestone for customers.\n\nNebius also highlighted its $3 billion AI infrastructure agreement with Meta (announced in September) as a revenue backlog boost. These announcements were viewed positively as further proof of Nebius’s scale and partnerships.\nAnalyst's Perspective on NBIS Stock Wall Street remains broadly positive on NBIS stock, though analysts are clear about the risks. Goldman Sachs reiterated a “Buy” rating in November 2025 and raised its 12-month price target to $155, citing accelerating demand for AI infrastructure and improving visibility on large-scale contracts.\nSimilarly, D.A. Davidson also maintained a “Buy” with a $150 target, while CICC initiated coverage at $143, pointing to Nebius’ growing role in global AI compute buildouts.\n\nTaken together, on average, the rating given by analysts is “Moderate Buy,” and the broader consensus sits at about $150, which implies roughly 70% upside potential, which shows analysts' confidence in Nebius’ growth trajectory rather than near-term profitability.\nHowever, that optimism comes with caveats. Analysts consistently highlight Nebius’ rapid revenue growth and ability to secure large enterprise deals, but many also flag valuation as demanding. The investment case assumes smooth execution, disciplined capital spending, and sustained customer demand. Any stumble could weigh heavily on NBIS stock.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump, giving Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin, Reuters\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:03 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 a.m. Pacific Time on Aug. 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia, AMD, OpenAI, Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\n\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThe transition to Tan comes as Intel is in the middle of an announced $28 billion project to construct microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany . While the factories were originally slated to begin operations this year, that has been delayed to 2030 at the earliest as Intel seeks buyers for the chips those factories are to produce .\n\nStory Continues\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 minutes in the Oval Office Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms - Walden International and Walden Catalyst - did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies, including coming to Intel's formal groundbreaking ceremony in Licking County in 2022 .\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nIntel's venture capitalist CEO Born in Malaysia to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger , and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA 'lifeline' for Intel So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Amazon.com (AMZN) Is Up 5.0% After Expanding AI Infrastructure, AWS Backlog and Strategic Partnerships – What's Changed\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:20 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nCMCSA\n\nIn recent days, Amazon and its partners have announced a wave of AI- and cloud-focused initiatives spanning AWS infrastructure expansion, new autonomous AI agents, and deeper collaborations such as a potential US$10 billion OpenAI investment and expanded Amazon Luna access on Comcast’s Xfinity devices.\nTogether with a US$200 billion AWS backlog and heavy data center spending, these moves underline how AI-driven workloads are becoming central to Amazon’s long-term profit engine beyond traditional e-commerce.\nWe’ll now look at how Amazon’s intensifying AI infrastructure build-out and AWS backlog reshape the company’s existing investment narrative.\n\nWe've found 10 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year . See the full list for free.\nAmazon.com Investment Narrative Recap To own Amazon today, you need to believe that AWS and AI driven services will keep compounding profits faster than the mature retail arm can grow, while heavy data center capex and intensifying cloud competition remain the key swing factors. The latest announcements around Amazon Business perks, Luna’s wider distribution, and potential OpenAI collaboration do not materially change that near term, but they reinforce how much of the story now rests on monetizing AI infrastructure at scale.\n\nAmong the recent news, the expansion of Amazon Luna onto millions of Comcast Xfinity devices stands out, because it quietly broadens the Prime and cloud ecosystem in a way that could support higher engagement and incremental AWS workloads over time. While this does not rival the US$200 billion AWS backlog as a catalyst, it illustrates how Amazon is layering new services on top of its core infrastructure build out to deepen customer lock in and diversify usage.\nYet behind the AI and cloud optimism, rising capital intensity at AWS and the risk that it fails to keep pace with rivals technologically are issues investors should be aware of, because...\nRead the full narrative on Amazon.com (it's free!)\nAmazon.com's narrative projects $905.9 billion revenue and $111.9 billion earnings by 2028.\n\nUncover how Amazon.com's forecasts yield a $295.53 fair value , a 27% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives 111 fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$206 to US$305 per share, showing how far apart individual views can be.

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Let's start there, explain that. I mean, is that is that valuation, Joseph, is it is it earnings growth, positioning, explain it.\n00:27 Joseph\nI think that there have been a number of businesses in the magnificent 493 that are perceived as being uh hurt or uh compromised by the growth of AI. Valuations have gone significantly lower for a number of those companies and businesses that are just not participants in in uh the opportunity of AI have also not performed particularly well uh in that bucket of the magnificent 493. And I think in 2026, what we're going to find is that many of these companies are harnessing AI to get better, to lower their costs, to improve the velocity of introducing new products, um, and those businesses will begin to get the benefits of that uh as people recognize it. It hasn't happened uh in the last couple of years, but I think we're going to notice that in the next couple of years.\n01:29 Speaker A\nWell, what does that suggest Joseph about what do you think I do with the Mag 7 though in 2026? You know, am I avoiding those names? Am I trimming exposure? You know, do I have to be more discerning? Maybe next year, Joseph, it's more like, you know, the mag three or four.\n01:46 Joseph\nI think so. I think the Mag 7 it's tough to paint them with a broad brush because each one of them has a specific story associated with them. But I think just from a valuation perspective and the fact that they've performed so well for such a long period of time, I think that some of them will take a break, some of them will perform well, but really the opportunities for outsized returns next year are going to be outside of those seven businesses.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Weak Macro Can't Stop E-commerce Stocks Expedia and Amazon\n\nSejuti Banerjea\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:39 AM PST 12 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nEXPE\n\nWhile macroeconomic challenges mount, the e-commerce market is growing through innovation, technology and insight, as it continues to take away slices of the total retail pie. Commerce Department numbers are proof of this trend: ecommerce sales in the third quarter of 2025 grew 5.1% over 3Q24 (1.9% sequentially), with total retail sales increasing 4.1% (1.5% sequentially).\n\nEcommerce accounted for around 16.4% of total U.S. retail sales. A point to note here is that consumers are increasingly blending their online and offline shopping experiences, so this distinction may soon become irrelevant. As a corollary, it is those retailers that have the capacity to sell through both channels that will be able to compete tomorrow.\n\nAmazon AMZN for instance started building its physical presence several years ago because nothing beats proximity to the consumer when it comes to retail. Our other pick Expedia EXPE is an online travel booking company. As consumers mostly book travel online these days, this business is growing strongly.\n\nThe convenience of online shopping remains the top reason for ecommerce volumes and this is particularly true of Gen-Z, which is, increasingly, the more relevant component of sales. Many of these buyers have grown up on the Internet and are accustomed to a high level of digitization.\n\nThey are also likely to hang out on popular social media platforms, allowing themselves to be influenced by the latest trends there. This is driving an entirely different perspective on the ecommerce space, one that revolves around digital influencers and appears to be expanding with more advanced technology such as AR/VR, social commerce and generative AI.\n\nConsumers appear to be more reticent about spending this holiday season. Adobe Analytics data based on 1 trillion+ visits to U.S. retail sites, covering 100 million products and 18 product categories, shows that ecommerce sales increased 6.1% in the first 6 weeks of the holiday shopping season ending Dec 12, reports Forbes. Significantly, customer returns were down 2.5%, indicating that customers have turned incrementally cautious because of the macroeconomic environment, and are using AI tools for more considered purchasing.\n\nIndustry Description\nInternet - Commerce continues to evolve as the technologies driving it advance.\nOn one side are increasingly powerful and capable user devices. On the other are increasingly sophisticated platforms often combining chatbots, AI and social media. AI continues to deliver increased user satisfaction and is growing into a primary enabler.\n\nStory Continues\nDifferentiation comes from better technology for improved showcasing, variety, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty, etc. as well as good customer service and more shipping options, which generally tip the scales in favor of larger players. Particularly so, because there is fierce price competition necessitating deep discounting in many cases.\n\nCurrent Trends Driving the Internet-Commerce Industry\n· AI is shaping up to be one of the major enablers of ecommerce , as customers get increasingly comfortable with the superior recommendations and personalization it offers. AI-enabled product search is very common today and all the major retailers offer shoppers some form of AI assistance. The latest development here is agentic commerce where LLM models like ChapGPT recommend products, compare features and complete the sale. Even if you’re unsure about what to buy, the statement of your general intention may be enough to complete a sale. Adobe estimates that AI-driven traffic to retail websites will be up 515-520% from the 2024 holiday season with November being the heaviest (up 758%). AI referrals on desktops will be up 74.5% and on mobile up 25.5%.\n\nThe total retail experience between physical and digital continues to blur as most consumers blend their online and offline activities. This usually takes the forms of research online and buy in-store or buy online and pick up in-store. Physical stores are increasingly experience centers allowing the traditional touch and feel that many customers can’t do without. It’s also evident that some customers prefer to walk out with their purchase. Therefore, a solid physical presence is undoubtedly a positive. Convenience is also an important factor, any experience that increases the speed of delivery/pickup is preferred. This may entail increased reliance on robots, self-driven delivery vehicles and drones that could ease bottlenecks and make deliveries smoother and cheaper. Therefore, it isn’t just the online-first retailers that are building a physical presence but also those that have traditionally been physical retailers that are digitizing to various degrees, or operating through their digital store-fronts.\n\nA trend that Gen-Z is popularizing is social commerce . Social commerce means the ability to discover, research and complete the purchase of products and experiences on a social media platform, often and increasingly more so, through influencers. With the influencer culture, user-generated content is reaching a new level of importance for brands on social media platforms. Brands usually have store fronts on these platforms where influencers also discuss their products, thus driving traffic to them. The social element of shopping that ecommerce had taken out is thus returning through this route. Since social commerce first became popular in China, it isn’t surprising that the Chinese social media platform TikTok that’s also very popular with Gen Z, is the number one place for social commerce. According to eMarketer via akeneo, 46% of Gen Z consumers are already using TikTok to initiate their product searches, rather than the traditional Google and Amazon. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and a host of others are also very popular. Instagram and YouTube are finetuning their checkout systems, so customers can place their orders in-app, without leaving their feeds (akeneo).\n\nAnother notable trend is a subscription format for repeat-use items. This makes it easier for the consumer to order and for the retailer to plan and identify loyalty. Retailers usually offer some kind of discount to consumers choosing this option, which makes it all the more attractive. Subscriptions have become more or less ubiquitous with repeat use items and this trend is expected to expand going forward as both tangible and intangible commodities and low-value and high-value items are increasingly sold ‘as-a-service’.\n\nThe macroeconomic situation continues to evolve , although we can probably say that a deep recession is unlikely. Earlier this month, the Fed took a cautious tone, with Powell saying that although official forecasts for growth and inflation have improved, there are risks to both. He warned that the jobs data could be overestimating hiring. Right now, the jobs market appears to be softening with new job openings declining in November and the unemployment rate rising. Consumer confidence dipped nearly 7 points in November with consumers expressing reluctance to buy big-ticket items. Although disposable income has increased in each month since May, consumers do not expect much improvement in future business conditions or the jobs market. The S&P Global said in its inaugural holiday sales survey report that the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop would result in a tempered outlook. The geopolitical situation is also volatile, and tariffs remain a bone of contention with major trading partners, so the negative impact could continu\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Strength\nThe Zacks Internet - Commerce Industry is a rather large group within the broader Zacks Retail And Wholesale Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #79, which places it in the top 33% of 243 Zacks industries.\nOur research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. So the group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates positive near-term prospects.\nEcommerce being in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is the result of its relative performance versus others. What we’re seeing in the aggregate estimate revisions are some ups and downs in estimates over the past year. The aggregate earnings estimate for 2025 is down 5.5%, while that for 2026 is down 7.1%. The macroeconomic uncertainty, the cautious tone around rate cuts and fears of a possible recession are likely contributing to softer spending and thus estimate cuts.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nIndustry Returns Have Been Sluggish\nUntil August, the Zacks Electronic - Commerce Industry has traded relatively close to the broader Retail and Wholesale sector as well as the S&P 500, although it started treading water thereafter, continuing mostly at a premium to the broader retail sector.\nThe stocks in this industry have collectively gained 4.2% over the past year, compared to the 3.4% gain for the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector and the 15.8% gain for the S&P 500.\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIndustry Fairly Valued\nHistorically, the industry has traded at a premium to the sector as well as the S&P 500. However, being more volatile, the difference has varied considerably. Its current price-to-forward 12 months’ earnings (P/E) of 24.03X represents a premium of 3.1% to the S&P 500 and discount of 2.2% to the broader retail sector. It’s worth noting, however, that the industry is currently trading at a slight discount to its own median level of 24.48X.\nForward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio\nThere are a number of stocks currently worth picking, especially because of the significant variety that exists in this industry in terms of lines of business, business model, location and so forth. This is also the reason that choosing can be tricky. We have used our proprietary ranking system to pick 2 stocks that appear attractive today.\n\nExpedia Group, Inc. (EXPE) : Seattle-based Expedia is one of the largest online travel booking company is in the world, operating through B2C, B2B and trivago segments. It serves leisure and corporate travelers. Expedia takes bookings for hotel and alternative accommodation, cruise ships, rental cars, air tickets and such other services. Through Expedia Partner Solutions, a B2B brand and Egencia, it provides corporate travel management services. It also provides advertising and media services.\nExpedia is seeing growth in both B2C and B2B but the latter segment is growing faster by far, raising the corporate average. In the last quarter for instance, total gross bookings grew 12%, driven by a 26% increase in B2B. Similarly, the 9% revenue growth was driven by 18% growth in the B2B segment.\n\nThis strength is attributable to the way businesses are viewing travel. There is a greater focus on live events like seminars and conferences, for which attendance is going up. Business development has always been the biggest driver of corporate travel and this year is no different. But upskilling employees is close, possibly because companies are preparing their employees for the massive change that AI is bringing. In-person engagement with clients and partners, followed by conference attendance are the other factors responsible for the strength in business travel (Deloitte: Corporate Travel Forecast, Sept 2025).\nExpedia had discontinued its quarterly dividend since the outbreak of the pandemic, but resumed this year. This is an added positive for all investors, especially income-seeking ones.\n\nAnalysts appear highly optimistic about this company. In the last 60 days, estimates for 2025 have increased 96 cents (6.8%) while those for 2026 increased $1.54 (9.2%). At current levels these estimates represent 6.7% revenue growth and 24.6% earnings growth in 2025. The following year, revenue and earnings are expected to grow a respective 6.3% and 20.8%.\nThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is up 51.9% year to date.\nPrice & Consensus: EXPE\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon, Inc. (AMZN) : Seattle, Washington-based Amazon is one of the leading online marketplaces in the world. It has developed its business around the Prime loyalty program that drives sales across merchandise and media categories. The online business is supplemented with broad physical presence, augmented by the acquisition of the premium grocery company Whole Foods Market back in 2017. Amazon also enjoys a dominant position in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, courtesy Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe company’s sheer size and scale allow it to offer products at some of the cheapest prices. Amazon is known for its huge discounts and deals, and the number of services it piles into Prime has ensured a subscription revenue channel. Amazon has steadily increased prices over the years, but the user base remains sticky. Its profitability depends on the AWS business, where it still enjoys first-mover advantage. With access to humongous amounts of data, Amazon has developed some AI-powered products to make the most of generative AI and other developments in the space. It also uses AI and automation across the business.\nOne development of concern is the recent settlement with the FTC where it was proved that Amazon used unfair practices to trick people into taking Prime memberships and then made it very difficult for them to cancel or refuse it. Amazon was directed to simplify the process, remove ambiguities for buyers and also ordered to pay $2.5 billion ($1 billion in penalty and $1.5 billion in compensation). It is also required to abide by certain fair-practice directives.\n\nAmazon also announced a huge layoff of 14,000 staff that investors need not worry about. Amazon’s sales aren’t shrinking. On the other hand, AI is allowing greater efficiencies, such that certain management layers and HR staff are no longer necessary. Amazon expects the leaner structure to facilitate more nimble operation akin to a very large startup.\nDespite its huge business volumes, analysts are optimistic about double-digit revenue and earnings growth this year although the earnings growth rate is expected to come down a bit next year. Of course this is early days yet, and actual growth rates may be much higher. Amazon certainly has a great track record of beating estimates: at double-digit rates in each of the last four quarters, averaging 22.5%. For 2025, analysts expect 11.9% revenue growth and 29.7% earnings growth. For 2026, revenue and earnings growth are expected to be a respective 11.3% and 9.3%.

      "Content": "Trump’s $100,000 H-1B Visa Application Fee Upheld by Judge\n\nMadlin Mekelburg\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:18 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nTCS.BO\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge said the Trump administration can move ahead with a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, providing a setback for US technology companies that rely on hiring skilled foreign workers.\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell said in a ruling Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s effort to radically increase the cost of the popular visa is lawful. The decision gives a boost to the administration’s campaign to restrict immigration and push demand for US workers. The US Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the proposal, can appeal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nHowell rejected the Chamber’s argument that Trump doesn’t have the power to impose the fee, finding that his proclamation was issued under “an express statutory grant of authority to the President.”\nCongress has given the president broad authority that he used to address “in the manner he sees fit, a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security,” she wrote.\nDaryl Joseffer, the Chamber’s executive vice president, said in a statement the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive.\n“We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations,” Joseffer said.\n\nThe Chamber, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, argued in its October lawsuit that raising the fee is unlawful because it overrides federal immigration law and exceeds the fee-setting authority afforded by Congress.\nA group of 19 state attorneys general also is challenging Trump’s proclamation. Their lawsuit focuses on the projected impact to the public sector, particularly in the fields of health care and education, that also rely on the H-1B visa program. A separate suit was filed by a global nurse-staffing agency.\nThe ruling Tuesday, a so-called summary judgment that doesn’t require a trial, doesn’t have an impact on the other lawsuits, meaning another judge could still block the new visa fee in the months to come. The other cases include a suit filed in Massachusetts earlier this month by more than a dozen mostly Democratic-led states, as well as a suit filed in October in California by a global nurse-staffing agency and several unions.\nBoth of the other cases are also being handled by Obama appointees, and neither judge has yet ruled on any requests for injunctions against the rule. A hearing in the California case is set for Feb. 12 in Oakland. The dispute is likely to ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court.\n\nStory Continues\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of employment-based immigration, allowing companies in the US to hire college-educated foreign workers for specialized occupations. In September, Trump signed a proclamation to increase the application fee to discourage companies from abusing a program that he claimed displaces US workers.\n\nIt’s a stark shift from America’s historical stance toward immigration. Since its founding, the US has welcomed people from diverse countries and economic backgrounds who come to the US in search of a better life and more freedom.\nYet while Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have mused about the prospects of a windfall for the US Treasury that could total $100 billion or more, immigration attorneys have cautioned that an increase in cost of this magnitude would cause major disruptions that would be likely very expensive to the US economy.\n“This puts a chilling effect on America’s employers,” said Michael Wildes, a managing partner at the New York-based immigration law firm Wildes and Weinberg PC. “How can you make America great by taking away the talent pool?” Wildes noted that “it’s a limiting law in that America will skip a beat. There will be a generation of talent out there in the world that will go to other countries. We will be missing an opportunity and that is foolhardy.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said it will replace the lottery for choosing H-1B visa applicants with a weighted selection to overcome wage arbitrage and incentivize American employers “to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers.” There are also proposals being considered to impose a wage floor.\nH-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but are used primarily in the tech industry. Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. are among the companies with the greatest number of H-1B visas, according to the US government.\nThe visa fees will shape hiring efforts, but affect some jobs and companies more than others, said Alexis DuFresne, founder of recruiting firm Archer Search Partners, which specializes in recruitment for alternative financial asset managers.\n\nFor “superstars” in highly-paid, specialized roles, or for jobs that generate a lot of revenue, organizations will be willing to pay the $100,000 fee, she said.\nBut the high cost will change how people making hiring decisions approach looking for employees in more run-of-the-mill jobs, DuFresne said. “If you’re going to search, you’re going to tell the search people ‘Don’t look globally for me. Look domestically for me,’” she said of such common jobs.\nLikewise, organizations with offices around the world will be able to respond to the recruitment costs by shifting where they hire, according to DuFresne. “The firms that it’s going to affect the most are the smaller firms,” she said.\nThe tech industry has been adapting to changes in US immigration rules for a while now as political currents shift.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google is taking steps to help move employees off of H-1B visas and onto more permanent status. The company recently told staff it will be “ramping up” PERM applications next year for eligible employees, Business Insider reported, taking a crucial step to securing a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\nBeyond the US tech companies, the action also hits India hard, as Indians have been the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In addition to the extra costs that Indian IT companies will bear for thousands of employees on such visas, the ongoing unpredictability has unnerved many Indian professionals working in US tech, finance, health care and other industries, especially after the recent mass postponement of work-visa appointments.\n\nThe case is Chamber of Commerce vs. US Department of Homeland Security, 25-cv-03675, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).\n--With assistance from Jake Bleiberg, Erik Larson and Patrick Howell O'Neill.\n(Updates with expert comments in 14th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI & Security Push Aids Google Cloud: What's Ahead for GOOGL Stock?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:49 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nAlphabet GOOGL is riding on a strong Google Cloud prospect, which accounts for more than 14% of GOOGL’s revenues. In the trailing nine-month period ended Sept. 30, Google Cloud revenues jumped 31.2% over the same year-ago time frame to $41.04 billion. The top line benefited from growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core products, AI Infrastructure and generative AI (Gen AI) Solutions. Cloud backlog jumped 46% sequentially to $155 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2025. The AI and security push is expected to boost Google Cloud’s prospects in the near term.\n\nAlphabet’s expanding AI infrastructure is helping Alphabet win enterprise clients. GCP’s prospects remain robust, driven by strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs (led by seventh-generation Ironwood) and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for the latest Gemini and other AI models, and other services, including cybersecurity and data analytics. Google Cloud is also benefiting from strong Gen AI adoption due to leading models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues from products developed on Google’s Gen AI models surged more than 200% year over year.\n\nSecurity push is expected to drive Google Cloud’s top-line growth further. The addition of Wiz (acquisition pending, expected to complete in 2026) to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT in the cloud computing space. The latest collaboration between Google Cloud and Palo Alto Networks combines Google Cloud’s AI and infrastructure capabilities with Prisma AIRS, the latter’s comprehensive AI security platform. Accelerating investments bodes well for GOOGL’s prospects. Alphabet expects capital expenditure between $91 billion and $93 billion for 2025, which is anticipated to increase further in 2026.\n\nGOOGL Faces Tough Competition in Cloud Domain Per Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 29% in the third quarter of 2025, ahead of Microsoft’s Azure platform at 20% and Google Cloud at 13%.\n\nAmazon is spending heavily on fortifying its Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure that supports AI workloads and expanded data center capacity. Amazon committed $125 billion in capital expenditure for 2025, with the vast majority directed toward AWS infrastructure. The third quarter alone saw $34.2 billion in cash capex, while the company added 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity over 12 months, the largest expansion in cloud history.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft Azure and other cloud services revenues accelerated 40% in constant currency (cc), with management attributing significant contributions to AI-related demand. Microsoft Cloud revenues reached $49.1 billion, increasing 25% in cc and reflecting strong enterprise adoption of cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities. Spending is expected to accelerate throughout fiscal 2026, with roughly half to be spent on GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand and AI workload expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nGOOGL’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Alphabet shares have appreciated 60.5% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nGOOGL Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe GOOGL stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 9.67X compared with the broader sector’s 6.55X.

      "Content": "How Mill closed the deal with Amazon and Whole Foods\n\nTim De Chant\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMill may have started with households, but co-founder and CEO Matt Rogers says the food waste startup has long aspired to expand to commercial customers.\n“This has been part of our plan since our Series A deck,” Rogers told TechCrunch.\nNow, with an official deal locked in with Amazon and Whole Foods the company’s plan to profit from handling other people’s food waste is a bit more public.\n\nWhole Foods will deploy a commercial-scale version of Mill ’s food waste bin in each of its grocery stores beginning in 2027. The bins will grind and dehydrate waste from the produce department, reducing costly landfill fees while also providing feed for the company’s egg producers. Both trim the company’s overhead.\nAt the same time, Mill’s bins will collect data to help Whole Foods understand what gets wasted and why, helping the grocer further control costs. “Ultimately, our goal is not just to make their waste operations more efficient, but also to move upstream so they actually waste less food,” Rogers said.\nThe company started selling food waste bins to households a few years ago . As can be expected from a team that made the Nest thermostat, the devices are well designed and — to lean on a Silicon Valley cliche — they can be a delight to use. My kids got a kick out of the bins while testing the first and second generations .\n\n“Starting in consumer was very intentional because you build the proof points, you build the data, the brand, loyalty,” Rogers said. Many members of the Whole Foods team were already using Mill in their homes when the two companies started talking.\n“It’s actually kind of our enterprise sales strategy,” Rogers continued. “We have conversations with senior leadership at our various ideal customers, and if they haven’t had Mill at home yet, we say, ‘Hey, try Mill at home, see what your family thinks.’ It is a surefire way of getting folks excited.”\nThe startup began having conversations with Whole Foods about a year ago, Rogers said. In the ensuing months, Whole Foods trialed the consumer version in some of its stores. Mill used feedback from Whole Foods to refine its commercial model.\n\nBut what helped sealed the deal was Mill’s ability to pinpoint food waste before it was wasted. Mill has developed an AI that uses a range of sensors to determine whether food that enters the bin should still be on the shelf. Minimizing “shrink” — the industry’s term for sales lost through waste or theft — can give grocers an edge in a cutthroat market.\nAdvances in large language models have been key, Rogers said. When he and Mill co-founder Harry Tannenbaum were at Nest, it took dozens of engineers and a “Google budget” more than a year to train Nest Cameras to recognize people and packages. With new LLMs, Mill only needed a handful of engineers and far less time to deliver superior results, according to Rogers, who said “AI is a huge enabler.”\n\nStory Continues\nThe use of AI allowed Mill to deliver a commercial version faster, diversifying its customer base and source of revenue.\n“If you are a single channel, single customer business, you’re fragile,” Rogers said. “I grew up at Apple during the iPod era,” he said. “Apple at the time was a single leg business. iPod was like 70% of company revenue. This was why we did the iPhone. Steve [Jobs] pushed us really hard on the iPhone because he was worried that folks like Motorola — who were working on smartphones at the time — would start to eat our lunch on the iPod business and that that would crush us. We needed to build another leg of the stool.”\nAnd it seems that Mill isn’t finished adding legs to its figurative stool. Rogers said its working on building out a municipal business as well.\n“We’re continuing to add more legs to the stool and adding more diversity to the business,” he said.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Deal activity in the sector hit a record $61 billion in 2025, showing the rapid pace of companies locking in enough data center space and computing power for artificial intelligence work. And this is further fueled by generative AI workloads that are pushing today’s power and server capacity to the limit.\n\nDemand for AI-ready data centers is soaring so quickly that supply could fall behind. This is the reason behind the largest cloud providers that are rushing to add more capacity, along with specialized chips and better cooling systems. One of the clearest winners from this shift is Amazon (AMZN), since AWS is spending heavily to stay ahead as AI infrastructure spending keeps rising.\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nBroadcom (AVGO) Stock Options Are Signaling Pensiveness. Here’s Why the Fear Might Be Unwarranted.\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nAmazon has already doubled AWS power capacity since 2022 and added 3.8 gigawatts in the last year alone, more than any other cloud provider, with plans to double that again by 2027 to keep up with AI demand. At the same time, Amazon’s Trainium-based AI infrastructure has grown into a multibillion-dollar business, posting triple-digit growth as AWS invests in custom silicon and large-scale data center expansion to support AI-focused workloads.\nWith global data center revenue projected to reach roughly $739.05 billion by 2030, can Amazon’s hyperscale build-out turn this data center supercycle into meaningful upside for its stock in 2026? Let’s find out.\nAmazon’s Financial Engine As the world’s largest online retailer and cloud provider, Amazon runs a broad business that brings together e-commerce, subscription services, digital advertising, and its main cloud arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is still the company’s biggest profit driver.\nOver the past year, Amazon’s stock has moved up in a slow but steady way, gaining 3.15% over the past 52 weeks and 5.81% year-to-date (YTD).\nAlso, the valuation shows investors are willing to pay up for that outlook, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 31.7x, well above the sector average of 17.87x, which signals the market expects stronger earnings from Amazon than the typical peer group.\nThat view is supported by the latest financial results. For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2025, Amazon reported net sales of $180.2 billion, up 13% from a year earlier. Operating income came in at $17.4 billion. But without special charges of $2.5 billion tied to a legal settlement and $1.8 billion in planned role eliminations severance costs, operating income would have been $21.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nNet income climbed to $21.2 billion, or $1.95 per diluted share, up from $15.3 billion last year. Free cash flow fell to $14.8 billion, primarily due to a $50.9 billion increase in property and equipment investments, which underscores Amazon's substantial investment in scaling its infrastructure, particularly cloud and data center capacity, to support its next stage of growth.\n\nAmazon’s Growth Foundations Amazon expanded its Nova portfolio this year, and it directly strengthens its AI infrastructure push tied to the data center demand shaping the 2026 growth story. The company introduced four new Frontier Nova models along with Nova Forge, a service that lets organizations build their own custom model versions using an “open training” approach that brings proprietary data into the process early. Amazon also rolled out Nova Act, which reached a 90% reliability rate for browser-based automation workflows, giving enterprises a more dependable way to automate online tasks as they scale digital operations.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon upgraded Bedrock AgentCore with real-time, policy-based controls that block unauthorized agent actions, plus AgentCore Evaluations for ongoing quality checks. It also added AgentCore Memory, which helps AI agents learn from past experiences so decision-making improves over time. Organizations such as Cohere Health, Thomson Reuters, and S&P Global Market Intelligence are already using AgentCore in production deployments.\nMeanwhile, Amazon expanded its work with SolarWinds, allowing the IT management company to build in generative AI through Amazon Bedrock. The partnership supports AI-driven automation and observability for SolarWinds, highlighting how AWS is becoming the underlying AI infrastructure that many large enterprises rely on.\n\nAnalysts See More Room to Run For the fourth quarter of 2025, management is guiding net sales to a range of $206.0 billion to $213.0 billion, which would mean 10% to 13% year-over-year (YOY)growth. Operating income is expected to land between $21.0 billion and $26.0 billion, compared with $21.2 billion in the same quarter last year. The next earnings release is set for Feb. 5, 2026, and analysts are looking for earnings of $1.97 per share for the current quarter and $7.17 for full-year 2025. That works out to an estimated YOY growth of 5.91% for the quarter and 29.66% for the full year.\n\nThat outlook helps explain why Oppenheimer recently raised its Amazon price target to 305 from 290. The firm pointed to Amazon’s plan to double AWS capacity by 2027. It also suggested each added gigawatt could bring in about $3 billion in revenue, which could have a “meaningful” impact on cash flow as new data centers come online in this AI-heavy environment. Barclays analyst Ross Sandler made a similar point, saying “AWS has secured significant AI capacity over the next several years,” and his team expects growth to accelerate from here, as more AI work moves onto that expanded capacity.\nOverall, all 56 analysts surveyed rated Amazon a consensus “Strong Buy,” with 49 “Strong Buy,” five “Moderate,” and two “Hold.” The average price target of $295.80 suggests about 27.4% upside from the current level.\nConclusion Amazon looks like one of the cleanest ways to play the $61 billion data center supercycle heading into 2026, with AWS-led infrastructure spending, surging AI demand, and a packed product roadmap all pointing in the same direction. The company is leaning hard into power capacity, custom silicon, and AI-native services at the exact moment enterprises are scrambling for compute. Also, Wall Street clearly likes what it sees, with strong earnings growth estimates and a roughly 30% implied upside from here. Nothing is guaranteed, but if data center and AI investment stay on their current trajectory, Amazon’s shares look more likely to grind higher than to stall.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Buy 3 Tech Stocks as Santa Rally Begins With a Record High S&P 500\n\nRitujay Ghosh\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nADI\n\nFTV\n\nThe Santa Claus rally appears to have finally taken off, with tech stocks rebounding after a roller-coaster ride over the past month. Tech stocks had been taking a beating lately, but are back on rally mode, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time closing high on Tuesday.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Analog Devices, Inc. ADI, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Fortive Corporation FTV, which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nS&P 500 Hits All-Time High The S&P 500 rose 0.5% on Tuesday to finish at 6,909.79 points, to hit an all-time closing high. The jump came as the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a pace of 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.2%, and a lot higher than the 3.8% recorded in the second quarter.\n\nThe report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could revise its monetary policy outlook for 2026 and go for more interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve had earlier hinted at just one rate cut in 2026.\nHowever, markets are now pricing in at least two rate cuts next year, given that the Fed is confident that inflation, despite being high, will ease substantially in 2026, and economic growth, too, will accelerate. Also, the Fed had earlier ruled out the chances of a rate hike in the near term.\nThe positive outlook supported by the latest economic data saw tech stocks rebound from their earlier lows. Investors have lately been worried about the profitability of the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Major AI deals reached over the past two months have raised doubts among investors about their sky-high valuations and fear that AI is yet another bubble that would eventually burst.\n\nHowever, those fears appear to have alleviated, with some major tech giants issuing better-than-expected profit guidance for the present and upcoming quarters.\n3 S&P 500 Stocks With Growth Potential Analog Devices, Inc.

      "Content": "The 20-Year Signal: Preparing for the Predicted Reversal of AI-Fueled Stock Market Gains\n\nDavid Beren\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:45 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nThere is no question that artificial intelligence has transformed the stock market as we know it over the past three years, all but single-handedly driving the S&P 500 to record after record. Companies that are sitting at the forefront of this technology, like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), have delivered returns that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The Shiller CAPE ratio sits above 35, a level seen only twice before: the Great Depression and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\nThe S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022. The Mag 7 tech stocks now represent 30% of total S&P 500 market value.\nAfter the 2000 peak at similar CAPE levels, the S&P 500 fell 49% over 2.5 years and took 7 years to recover.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMost importantly, the AI technology is real, and so far, the enthusiasm for this technology has been mostly justified, all while the long-term potential (and dangers) seems incredible. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolios have grown in a massive way over the last 36 months. But, and there is always a but, beneath this celebratory growth, there is a warning signal that has emerged.\nThis indicator, which looks at the close relationships between stock prices and underlying economics, hasn't flashed at current levels in over 20 years, not since the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. The last time this signal appeared, it was followed by a multi-year bear market that erased roughly half of the market's overall value. While history doesn't always repeat itself, it does at least suggest that we need to look at these readings and consider, as investors, what the next smart move really is.\n\nAI Mania Drives Stocks to Historic, Record Highs The artificial intelligence revolution has, without question, captivated investors in a way that almost no other technology has. The belief that AI is going to and has already started to automate work, revolutionize manufacturing, and create entirely new industries is just scratching the surface of what investors are thinking about.\n\nFor companies that are in the AI world, all of this speculation and promise has led to explosive revenue growth. For example, NVIDIA's data center business has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in corporate America, and Microsoft's AI integration across basically its entire product lineup is driving enterprise adoption. In other words, this technology is actually driving real revenue.\n\nStory Continues\nThis technological transformation has driven stock prices to levels that would have seemed absurd three years ago. The S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022, and NVIDIA has seen its market cap grow by trillions. The Mag 7's technology stocks represent a whopping 30% of the entire S&P 500 market value, a level not seen since the 1990s. Valuations have also exploded as the forward P/E of the S&P 500 now hovers around 21 to 22, 40% above historical averages.\n\nThe optimism that is driving these valuation numbers is assuming that AI will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for years to come. More importantly, it also assumes that AI adoption won't have any obstacles to adoption in the coming years and that companies building AI infrastructure will continue generating returns to justify their current high stock prices and valuations.\nThis pattern of pricing in future success isn't new, as the late 1990s boom also seemed a trajectory where investors were basically paying today for profits they expected companies to deliver in the next five years. However, as the world knows, the technology of the internet boom from the 1990s succeeded, it's how you're reading this today, but many of the stocks crashed because valuations got too far ahead of any financial reality.\n\nA Rare Signal Not Seen in Two Decades: What the Indicator Means The warning signal that is flashing today is the Shiller CAPE ratio, a number that is an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio that measures stock prices relative to average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This metric attempts to smooth out short-term earnings volatility and give a longer-lens look at valuation extremes. As of December 2025, the Shiller CAPE sits above 35, a level that has only been seen twice in modern history: the Great Depression market crash and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\n\nThe last time the US saw the CAPE ratio reach these current levels was in early 2000, right before the stock-market crash. At that peak, investors were paying extreme premiums for stocks based on the expectation (think hope) that internet companies would continue to just deliver on their unprecedented growth. History reminds us that the reality of what took place was that these companies did not enjoy unstoppable growth and that the market declined 49% over a 2.5-year period, the NASDAQ fell 78%, and it took 7 years to recover.\nThe CAPE ratio's predictive power comes from understanding long-term perspectives, and unlike traditional P/E ratios that can be distorted by temporary earnings spikes or collapses, the CAPE ratio looks with a wide lens at a full decade of earnings. When this ratio does hit 30, it can be a historical signal that stocks are priced for perfection and have almost no room for disappointment.\n\nWhat makes the current signal particularly troubling is that it isn't just existing in a silo. Instead, it's appearing alongside three other late-cycle indicators like three consecutive years of double-digit S&P 500 gains, forward P/E ratios at 40-year highs, extreme concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks, and retail investor enthusiasm that feels eerily like the dot-com bubble. While no single indicator is going to be definitive, the combination of all three suggests that a major reversal could be on the horizon, and an entire generation of investors has never experienced what happens when valuations are this stretched.\nHistory's Verdict: A Reversal is Coming - How Smart Investors Respond History is pretty unambiguous about what can happen when an extreme CAPE reading is taking place. For one, you might be in a position that creates a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. At the 1929 stock peak, stocks fell 89% over three years, and again in 2000, you had the 49% S&P 500 drop over 2.5 years. What a drop might look like in the near future is unknown, but the pattern that occurred during these two previous instances of extreme valuations resolving through major corrections seems to be all too familiar to what we're going through now with AI.\n\nFor investors, this could be the strategic opportunity they have been waiting for rather than a situation full of panic. The mistake during previous bubbles wasn't recognizing that stocks were not expensive, but it was remaining fully invested at those prices and then panic-selling at the bottom. The smart approach today is about recognizing that current valuations create a situation where the downside potential far exceeds any upside of staying fully invested.\nBuilding a cash reserve now so investors can \"buy the dip,\" as the saying goes, is arguably the best move, to the tune of upward of 30% of a portfolio being liquidated for cash or put into short-term bonds. If the market does decline by 40-50% from current levels, this cash can be invested into companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA at valuations these companies haven't experienced in years. This could give investors a chance to double their position size.\n\nThe key here is going to be the right amount of discipline, as history shows that bear market pain isn't the actual decline itself, it's the psychology of trying to understand how to buy at the bottom. If the market falls 30%, there might be a voice going on that says it's going to 50% and if it falls 50%, total economic collapse might be the voice on the news. In other words, investors should have capital reserved for buying during these panics so they can ignore the noise and acquire quality companies at steep discounts and prepare for the next decade's best returns.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\n\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\n\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory Continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE\nBefore heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms -- Walden International and Walden Catalyst -- did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO\nBorn in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\n\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\n\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\n\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\n\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL\nSo far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\n\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

Most members of the Magnificent Seven stocks advanced, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising over +3% to lead gainers in the Dow and Amazon.com (AMZN) gaining more than +1%. Also, some chip stocks gained ground, with Marvell Technology (MRVL) climbing over +3% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 and Broadcom (AVGO) rising more than +2%. In addition, ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM) climbed over +5% after the company said it had received multiple acquisition offers as part of its ongoing review of strategic alternatives. On the bearish side, ServiceNow (NOW) fell more than -1% after agreeing to acquire cybersecurity firm Armis for $7.75 billion in cash.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, in its initial estimate of Q3 GDP growth, said on Tuesday that the economy grew at a +4.3% annualized rate, stronger than expectations of +3.3%. Also, U.S. November industrial production rose +0.2% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.1% m/m. At the same time, U.S. durable goods orders fell -2.2% m/m in October, weaker than expectations of -1.5% m/m, and core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation, rose +0.2% m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.3% m/m. In addition, the U.S. Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell to 89.1 in December, weaker than expectations of 91.7.\n“The strongest pace of economic growth in two years is bolstering confidence that corporate earnings will continue to expand robustly in 2026,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. At the same time, U.S. money markets continue to price in at least two Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026.\nMeanwhile, the much-anticipated Santa Claus Rally period officially kicks off today. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has delivered an average return of 1.3%, posting gains 78% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.\n\nStory Continues\nToday, investors will focus on U.S. Initial Jobless Claims data, which is set to be released in a couple of hours.

Energy stocks advanced on Wednesday, as oil prices climbed for a sixth straight session. Luxury stocks also gained ground. Meanwhile, the regional Stoxx 600 index hit a new record high on Tuesday and is on track for its best annual performance since 2021, underpinned by lower interest rates, Germany’s fiscal spending push, and investor rotation away from expensive U.S. technology stocks. In other news, the Bank of Spain raised its economic growth forecast to 2.9% from 2.6% for this year and to 2.2% from 1.8% for 2026.

The benchmark index notched its longest winning streak since July. Technology stocks gained ground on Wednesday. Global investors are ramping up bets on Chinese AI-related companies, wagering on the next DeepSeek and looking to diversify. Earlier this week, Moore Threads Technology, often referred to by analysts as “China’s Nvidia,” introduced a range of new products, including its next-generation chip architecture and AI chips. Meanwhile, the yuan extended its gains on Wednesday, moving closer to the key 7-per-dollar level after the People’s Bank of China set a firmer fixing.

Hong Kong’s market will be closed on Thursday and Friday for the Christmas holidays, while mainland China’s financial markets will remain open as usual.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index gave up earlier gains and closed slightly lower today, marking its first decline in four sessions. Japanese equities were pressured by a stronger yen. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas sales for the country’s heavyweight exporters, with automakers among the notable underperformers on the day. The Japanese currency rose for a third day as traders stayed alert for signs of intervention following Tokyo’s warning against excessive moves. Financial stocks also slumped, paring some of the sharp gains that followed the Bank of Japan’s interest-rate hike last Friday. Limiting losses, some chip stocks climbed, tracking overnight gains in their U.S. peers. Data from the Cabinet Office released on Wednesday showed that Japan’s October leading economic indicators index, which gauges the economic outlook for a few months ahead based on data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, was revised slightly lower. Meanwhile, minutes from the Bank of Japan’s October meeting released on Wednesday showed that policymakers debated the need to keep raising interest rates toward levels seen as neutral for the economy. A few members of the nine-member board also said recent yen declines could risk an inflation overshoot by driving up import costs. In other news, a draft seen by Reuters showed that Japan plans to issue new government bonds worth about $189 billion to finance a record-sized budget for the next fiscal year. Investor focus is now squarely on a raft of Japan’s economic data, scheduled for release on Friday, including Tokyo core CPI, industrial production, retail sales, and employment figures. Investors also await BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda’s speech on Thursday, as they seek guidance on the central bank’s policy path.

      "Content": "A US Postal Service plan to raise cash could cost the agency its biggest customer\n\nChris Isidore, CNN\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 2:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nFor years, a huge Amazon contract has been one of the few bright spots in the US Postal Service’s finances. But now the USPS plans to offer those last-mile services to additional customers to stem billions in ongoing losses – a move that risks losing its biggest customer.\nThe USPS faces a tight squeeze. With fewer people using the mail, it’s lost more and more money: $9 billion in the 12 months ending in September alone.\n\n“We certainly have a precarious cash position. You know, within probably 12 to 24 months, we are out of cash,” USPS Commissioner David Steiner said in a recent interview with Reuters . Simply making additional cost cutting measures won’t solve the problem, he said.\nThe Amazon contract reportedly brings in about $6 billion a year to the agency, money it can’t afford to lose.\nBut the post office now plans to accept bids from other shippers for access to the service’s distribution centers – even though Amazon says that might prompt it to pull back from the using the USPS so much.\n“We’ve been working for nearly a year to extend our partnership that started more than 30 years ago,” said Amazon spokesman Steve Kelly.\n“We were surprised to hear they want to run an auction after nearly a year of negotiations, and, given the change of direction and the uncertainty it adds to our delivery network, we’re evaluating all of our options that would ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers.”\n\nUniversal service The very thing that makes the postal service so attractive to Amazon is also the reason why the agency so badly needs more money: universal service.\nThe postal service is legally required to deliver mail all across the United States all at the same price, what’s called universal delivery. That includes rural, far-flung or hard-to-reach destinations, expensive places for mail carriers to get to.\nFor Amazon, that means it’s sometimes cheaper to use USPS for that last stretch of delivery to a customer’s door.\nBut while that contract is important to USPS, it’s not nearly enough.\n“We may not have sufficient liquidity to meet all of our existing legal obligations when due while also repaying our maturing debt and making the critical infrastructure investments… without putting our ability to fulfill that primary mission at undue risk,” it said in its most recent annual report.\n\nTrying to get more customers to deliver pre-sorted packages in bulk directly into the USPS system makes operational sense, said Elena Patel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institute and an expert in Postal Service finances. But she said there is a risk if those negotiations with smaller shippers pushes Amazon to no longer use the USPS as much as it has in the past.\n\nStory Continues\n“I don’t know what the state of negotiations is, but it certainly would not be good for the financial situation at the Postal Service for the negotiations with Amazon to fall apart,” she said.\nUSPS has already started to see package volumes start to slip after years of growth fueled by online consumer purchases. Total parcel and package volume slipped nearly 6% in the most recent fiscal year. But packages are still up nearly 500% from where they were 20 years ago, while first-class letter volume has plunged in the same period.\n\nPatel said that it’s in the national interest for the government to continue to provide universal service, even if it means between $6 billion to $10 billion in annual congressional appropriations to USPS.\n“The premise of (the USPS) is that it would deliver everywhere at an affordable rate, and we will let you keep the letter monopoly to pay for that,” she said. “Well, the second half of that is broken. It doesn’t make any sense in this era of digital communications.”\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The rapid increase in enterprise spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure has pushed AWS' backlog to $200 billion, giving it exceptional multiyear revenue visibility.\n\nAmazon's custom silicon chips, such as Graviton and Trainium, have strengthened AWS' price-performance advantage relative to hyperscalers, depending heavily on third-party chips. The company also plans to double data center capacity by 2027, which can further reduce costs and attract even larger workloads.\nAmazon expects capital investment of $125 billion in 2025, and plans to invest even higher amounts in 2026, primarily to expand its AI infrastructure.\nAdvertising and retail business Advertising has become the second most prominent growth engine. Advertising revenues increased 22% year over year to $17.7 billion in the third quarter, driven by the strong performance of its full-funnel advertising portfolio encompassing every stage of the customer purchase journey.\nAdvertising through Prime Video and live sports capabilities helps build brand awareness at scale, while advertising through sponsored products at the point of sale improves conversion rates. The company's partnerships with premium content providers, such as Netflix, Spotify , and Sirius XM , enable advertisers to access high-quality ad inventory through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP).\n\nTD Cowen analyst John Blackledge expects advertising to bring $68 billion in revenues and account for 35% of the company's total operating income in 2025. So although it's a smaller part of the total revenues, advertising is more profitable than AWS or the retail business.\nAmazon's stock has reached an all-time high, yet it appears to be entering a new phase of accelerated growth. The stock can still be a good choice for long-term investors who can overlook share-price pullbacks due to profit-taking in the short term.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Evolutionary Tree Dumps 11,000 monday.com Shares for $3.6 Million\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:29 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MNDY\n\nNOW\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Sold all 11,304 shares of monday.com; net position change of $3.55 million.\nThe fund had invested in monday.com since 2023.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\nOn November 13, 2025, Evolutionary Tree Capital Management, LLC disclosed in an SEC filing that it sold out of monday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY) , exiting its $3.55 million position.\n\nWhat happened According to its SEC filing dated November 13, 2025, Evolutionary Tree Capital Management, LLC sold its entire holding of monday.com, totaling 11,304 shares. The transaction value, based on average quarterly pricing, was $3,554,882. The fund now reports no position in the company, following normal trading activity for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.\n\nWhat else to know Evolutionary Tree Capital Management, LLC fully divested from monday.com, which now represents 0% of its 13F reportable assets under management.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: MSFT: $8.85 million (9.7% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AMZN: $8.10 million (8.8% of AUM)\nNYSE: NOW: $4.90 million (5.3% of AUM)\nNYSE: RBLX: $4.74 million (5.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: NFLX: $4.55 million (5.0% of AUM)\n\nAs of November 12, 2025, shares of monday.com were priced at $159.11, down 38.94% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 by 56.34 percentage points.\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close November 12, 2025)\n$159.11\nMarket Capitalization\n$8.21 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.16 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$65.05 million\n\nCompany Snapshot Offers a cloud-based Work OS platform enabling organizations to build custom workflow and project management applications; product suite includes solutions for marketing, CRM, software development, and operational management.\nGenerates revenue primarily through subscription-based licensing of its SaaS platform, with additional income from value-added services such as onboarding and customer support.\nServes a global customer base spanning enterprises, SMBs, government, and educational institutions across the United States, EMEA, and other international markets.\n\nmonday.com operates at scale as a leading provider of flexible work management software, supporting over 2,500 employees and a diversified international client base. The company leverages a modular, cloud-native platform to drive digital transformation and operational efficiency for organizations of all sizes. Its competitive advantage lies in its highly customizable, user-friendly interface and its ability to address a wide range of business functions within a single unified system.\nFoolish take Evolutionary Tree appears to have sold out of its monday.com position after its pullback had already occurred.\n\nStory Continues\nThe SaaS stock had risen steadily since the end of the 2022 bear market . However, monday.com experienced its first significant pullback in years over the summer.\nEvolutionary Tree invests primarily in tech stocks. Although Microsoft and Amazon are its largest positions, most of its positions are tech growth stocks like monday.com.\n\nWith this stock, the timing is interesting since Evolutionary Tree began accumulating its Monday.com shares in 2023. It appears to have begun buying shares close to the price where it unloaded its entire position in the third quarter of 2025. It also continued adding shares over the years, implying that it likely lost money on this stock.\nUltimately, we do not know why the fund exited its monday position. Still, given the recent revenue slowdown and what looks like a lack of gains over the last two years, Evolutionary Tree seems to feel like sometimes it is best to admit a mistake and move on, which is often a wise decision when specific positions do not work out as planned.\nGlossary 13F AUM: Assets under management reported by institutional investment managers in quarterly SEC Form 13F filings.\nDivested: Sold off or disposed of an asset or investment, fully or partially, from a portfolio.\nStake: The ownership interest or share held in a company by an investor or fund.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\nCAGR: Compound Annual Growth Rate; the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period, assuming compounding.\nWork OS: A cloud-based platform enabling users to build custom workflow and project management applications.\nSaaS: Software as a Service; software delivered online via subscription rather than installed locally.\nValue-added services: Additional services provided beyond the core product, such as onboarding or customer support, often for extra fees.\nCloud-native: Software designed specifically to run and scale efficiently in cloud computing environments.\nDigital transformation: The integration of digital technology into all areas of a business to improve operations and value delivery.\nModular platform: A system built from separate components that can be independently developed, replaced, or upgraded.\nUnified system: A single platform that integrates multiple business functions or processes for streamlined management.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Billionaire Mark Cuban Says 'Name And Shame' Big Employers Who Pay So Little Their Workers Get Medicaid—'Taxpayers Are Subsidizing' Their Profits\n\nJeannine Mancini\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:30 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: WMT\n\nMCD\n\nAMZN\n\nXAAI.PVT\n\nDLTR\n\nIn June, self-made billionaire Mark Cuban lit up X with a series of posts that didn't call for sweeping legislation, but something simpler: accountability. \"When a large employer pays so little that their full-time employees qualify for Medicaid, or any public assistance, we the taxpayers are effectively subsidizing that big company. That's wrong,\" he wrote.\n\nCuban wasn't pitching policy reform—he was drawing a line between capitalism and corporate freeloading. \"The best way to reduce the cost of Medicaid is to name and shame big employers that pay their full time employees so little, they qualify for Medicaid,\" he said.\nDon't Miss:\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nSomeone tried to drag him into a political label. Cuban pushed back . \"When did you stop understanding how capitalism and free markets work? I didn't mention a word about policy change. If I knew which companies are costing taxpayers money, so they can make more money, I would stop doing business with them. That's capitalism.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Cuban has called out bloated systems. He launched Cost Plus Drugs in 2022 to lower prescription prices by cutting out the middlemen . He's argued for transparency, not government handouts, and he's applying the same thinking here: if companies pay workers so little that public programs have to close the gap, that's not a free market—it's a subsidy disguised as payroll.\nThe companies weren't named in Cuban's post, but Grok , xAI's assistant, listed several that often show up in Medicaid enrollment data: Walmart, McDonald's, Amazon, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell, Home Depot, Lowe's, Walgreens, CVS, and Uber. These are some of the most recognizable employers in the country, and in many states, they also happen to be the top sources of workers relying on Medicaid and SNAP.\n\nTrending: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nThis isn't just a one-off. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office , Walmart and McDonald's were among the biggest employers of Medicaid recipients in multiple states as of 2020. Newer state-level data shows Amazon now leads in Nevada . In other states , Walmart, Publix, and McDonald's remain on the list. The common theme? Workers clocking in full-time hours but still qualifying for public aid.\n\nStory Continues\nMedicaid enrollment fell 7.6% in fiscal 2025, yet spending still climbed 8.6% , with states covering a larger share than ever. Budget negotiations in Congress are eyeing cuts of up to $1 trillion over the next decade . But Cuban's pointing the spotlight elsewhere—on companies with strong earnings, investor payouts, and a long trail of low-wage employment.\n\nHe's not asking for legislation or penalties. He's asking why anyone should keep doing business with employers that rely on public money to fill in the gaps. The message wasn't about punishing success—it was about calling out a system where success gets built on the backs of underpaid labor, then packaged as efficiency.\nSee Also: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nSome praised the stance, saying it forces a conversation that's long overdue . Others blamed politics, inflation, or immigration. Cuban didn't respond to those points, but the post stayed up, and so did the numbers. Millions of views. Dozens of examples. One repeat question: if consumers knew which companies built their profits this way, would they still support them?\n\nCuban's answer is already public. \"I would stop doing business with them,\" he said.\nRead Next: From Moxy Hotels to $12B in Real Estate — The Firm Behind NYC's Trendiest Properties Is Letting Individual Investors In.\nImage: Shutterstock\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

      "Content": "Why Marvell Technology (MRVL) Stock Is Trading Up Today\n\nPetr Huřťák\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:35 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: C\n\nMRVL\n\nMU\n\nAMZN\n\nWhat Happened? Shares of networking chips designer Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) jumped 3.4% in the afternoon session after investment firm Citi issued a positive catalyst watch for the stock ahead of the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES), contributing to a broader rally in the chip sector.\nCiti noted that worries about competition from two major clients were likely unfounded and viewed the stock's recent price drop as a buying opportunity. The firm anticipated Marvell would showcase wider use of its networking solutions at the conference. Adding to the positive sentiment, analysts at Benchmark clarified that Marvell had retained its role in Amazon's Trainium chip designs, easing recent investor concerns. The stock's move also came amid general strength in the semiconductor market, as other chipmakers like Micron and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index also posted gains.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $87.57, up 3.3% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Marvell Technology? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Marvell Technology’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 42 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock gained 3.2% on the news that positive results from peer company Micron lifted the broader semiconductor sector.\n\nThe strong report created a ripple effect, boosting sentiment for chip-related companies. Marvell climbed alongside other industry players, as firms connected to memory and storage saw some of the most notable gains. For instance, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, Broadcom, and Qualcomm all recorded increases. The move highlighted investor optimism across the semiconductor space, reinforcing the view that companies like Marvell, which are key to AI infrastructure, were well-positioned.\nMarvell Technology is down 22.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $87.57 per share, it is trading 30.5% below its 52-week high of $126.06 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Marvell Technology’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,887.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

      "Content": "Amazon Just Unveiled Some Seriously Impressive “Frontier” AI Agents. It’s Time to Buy.\n\nJoey Frenette\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 10:24 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nQuick Read Amazon gained just 3% this year versus other Magnificent Seven stocks despite multiple AI initiatives.\nAmazon launched three autonomous AI agents designed to run for hours without intervention and scale massively.\nThe new frontier agents target coding, security engineering, and virtual ops to boost growth.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAmazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) has been a quiet laggard in the Magnificent Seven this year after gaining just over 3% year to date. With just a few trading days left in the year, it's looking like the $2.45 trillion e-commerce juggernaut is about to disappoint yet again, despite all the encouraging AI projects going on behind the scenes, from \"frontier\" AI agents to those impressive Trainium3 AI chips, the rollout of Alexa+, and let's not forget about the warehouse robots.\nWhile shares of Amazon don't seem to have much going for them as the year comes to a close, I do think the very reasonable valuation warrants giving the firm a second look, especially given the risks that many investors might be heavily underestimating the company's AI potential. Of course, AI seems to be something for retail investors to be afraid of, rather than bullish about, at least in the past couple of months amid renewed AI bubble fears.\n\nHowever, I do think that if the AI trade can regain some of its luster (perhaps as part of that so-called Santa Claus rally?), Amazon might have room to expand its multiple by a considerable amount. In the meantime, it might be worth exploring the new AI innovations going on at Amazon to see if it's worth getting in here ahead of the herd at around $228 per share.\nAmazon's trio of new frontier agents could change the game The company's new AI agents may have flown under the radar of many, but as we ring in the new year, which may very well be the year agentic AI really takes off, such innovations might become more of a needle mover, especially if we gain more insight into what they're really capable of and how they could impact software development teams.\n\nAmazon describes its frontier agents as \"autonomous, massively scalable AI agents that work for hours without requiring intervention.\" Are these the profound agents that should have white-collar workers fearful for their jobs? Time will tell. Either way, the trio of frontier agents is packed with innovation and potential, especially as they look to supercharge development teams.\n\nStory Continues\nWith Amazon recently pulling the curtain on its Kiro autonomous agents, the AWS Security Agent, and the AWS DevOps Agent, it appears the e-commerce titan is making a big swing in the agent race. Not only can the agentic solutions run for hours, with less oversight, but they're scalable and could help give AWS (Amazon Web Services) the much-needed boost it needs to get its growth rate heating up again, especially as its hyperscaler rivals really start to put their foot on the growth gas.\n\nIt's still early in the agent race, but Amazon's looking like an early leader Though it's still early days for agents, Kiro, the AWS Security Agent, and the DevOps agent might transform coding, security engineering, and virtual ops for good. To put it simply, the trio of frontier agents holds a profound amount of promise. And if enterprise adoption kicks into high gear, perhaps it's time to give shares of Amazon the benefit of the doubt after a market-lagging year.\n\nThough it's early in the game, the company sees its frontier agents as \"extensions of teams,\" which, I think, could have significant implications on the labor market over the next few years, especially as these agents get even better, run for longer, and scale even faster.\nIt's a big, aggressive splash into the AI agent race, to say the least, and it might not yet be fully appreciated by investors quite yet.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Alphabet Agrees to Buy Intersect Power in $4.75 Billion Clean Energy Deal\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 9:07 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nAlphabet Inc. ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) has agreed to acquire clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash plus existing debt, a deal that could expand Google's access to electricity as it scales data centers tied to artificial intelligence. The acquisition, announced Monday, follows Google's minority investment in Intersect last year and comes as US power grids face rising strain from renewed demand growth. Alphabet said the transaction is intended to give Google greater flexibility to develop new power generation alongside expanding data center capacity, which has increasingly become a limiting factor for AI deployment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe deal arrives as the AI buildout drives consolidation across data centers and energy infrastructure. Google, along with Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Microsoft Corp. ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), has been managing the tension between rising electricity needs and long-term climate goals, after the company disclosed in 2024 that its carbon emissions increased 48% over the past five years due largely to data center operations. Intersect, backed by private equity firm TPG Inc., has focused on solar and battery storage projects designed to power large-scale data centers, particularly in Texas, a region its CEO Sheldon Kimber has described as attractive due to abundant wind and solar resources. The company has about 7.5 gigawatts of solar and storage in operation and another eight gigawatts in development, with much of that capacity tied to data-center-heavy markets.\n\nAs part of the transaction, Alphabet will acquire Intersect's power development platform, team, and in-development assets already contracted by Google, while Intersect will retain its brand and continue under Kimber's leadership. Grid assets contracted to other customers in Texas and California will remain outside the purchase, with TPG Rise Climate retaining a stake in those projects. Industry analysts have suggested the structure could reduce regulatory risk for Google, as owning power generation assets may provide more flexibility in how and where new data centers are built, rather than relying solely on third-party power arrangements as AI infrastructure continues to scale.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "An X-Ray View of the Magnificent Seven\n\nJohn Dorfman\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:38 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBy John Dorfman December 22, 2025 (Maple Hill Syndicate)\nFor the past three years, a huge share of the stock market's action has been in the Magnificent Seven , a small group of super-successful, super-popular stocks.\nThere are signs of fatigue in this leadership group. But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

      "Content": "SHOP's Merchant Solutions Revenue Growth Picks Up: More Upside Ahead?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:25 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SHOP\n\nShopify’s SHOP capacity to monetize the economic activity on its platform is evident in the rapid acceleration of its Merchant Solutions segment revenues, which jumped 38.2% year over year in the third quarter of 2025 to $2.15 billion. Rising sales among existing merchants and new additions resulted in a 32% increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which reached $92.01 billion. Merchants with annual GMV below $25 million generated a significant majority of Shopify’s GMV, while merchants with GMV greater than $25 million\ngrew at a faster pace in the reported quarter.\n\nThe increased use of Shopify Payments, which attained a 65% penetration of GMV in the third quarter, drove the Merchant Solutions segment revenues. Shop Pay processed $29 billion in GMV, marking 67% year-over-year jump. Merchant Solutions’ revenues were significantly driven by 31% growth in the offline commerce category and the remarkable 98% rise in the B2B segment, fueled by existing merchants adopting Shopify’s solutions and go-to-market initiatives that target more B2B specific verticals and merchants.\n\nNew merchant-friendly tools like Shop Minis, Shop Cash, Sign in with Shop and Shop Pay solutions are helping Shopify win merchants rapidly. Shopify expects mid-to-high 20% revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2025, led by sustained strength in Merchant Solutions. Continued expansion of payment solutions across more countries, further adoption of AI and agentic commerce technologies, and strategic performance marketing investments are expected to drive ongoing acceleration. International growth, especially in Europe and emerging markets, is a key catalyst.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 Merchant solutions revenues is pegged at $2.79 billion, indicating 30% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is currently pegged at $3.58 billion, suggesting 27.3% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nTough Competition Hurts SHOP’s Prospects Shopify is facing stiff competition in the e-commerce marketplace from the likes of eBay EBAY and Amazon AMZN.\n\neBay is a significant player in e-commerce, with 134 million active buyers and a GMV of $20.11 billion in the third quarter of 2025. The company leverages generative AI to enhance ads and listings, driving advertising revenues 23% on a forex-neutral basis. eBay’s intensified focus on high-growth “focus categories”, such as collectibles, refurbished goods, fashion and circular economy products, continues to drive meaningful marketplace expansion.\n\nAmazon dominates the U.S. e-commerce market, driven by its “Buy with Prime\" service, which combines its payments and fulfillment services and makes them available at checkout on other websites while promising faster delivery for Prime members. Amazon’s vast customer base, logistics and AI tools make it a formidable competitor worldwide.\n\nStory Continues\nSHOP’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shopify shares have jumped 48.3% in the past six-month period, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.3% but underperforming the Zacks Internet Services industry’s appreciation of 75.2%.\nSHOP Stock’s Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShopify stock is overvalued, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 15.87X compared with the broader sector’s 6.55X.

This reacceleration signals robust enterprise demand for cloud infrastructure, particularly as businesses prioritize AI capabilities. Management projects capital expenditures of approximately $125 billion for 2025, with increases planned for 2026, underscoring aggressive investment in AI infrastructure to capture market share.\n\nDecember's AWS re:Invent conference showcased breakthrough innovations positioning Amazon at the forefront of enterprise AI. The company unveiled Trainium3 chips delivering superior price-performance for AI workloads, alongside Project Rainier featuring nearly 500,000 Trainium2 chips. Amazon expanded its Nova model family with specialized AI capabilities, while introducing Nova Forge, enabling organizations to build custom models. The $38 billion OpenAI partnership further validates AWS infrastructure dominance. Frontier agents, including Kiro, an autonomous coding assistant and new AWS AI Factories, demonstrate Amazon's commitment to comprehensive AI solutions.\n\nRetail operations simultaneously benefit from AI integration, with Rufus shopping assistant reaching 250 million active users who demonstrate 60% higher purchase completion rates. The Buy for Me agentic service expanded to more than 500,000 products, while seller-facing AI tools automate complex operations for Amazon's marketplace partners.\n\nFourth-quarter guidance projects revenues between $206 billion and $213 billion, reflecting 10-13% growth, suggesting sustained momentum from AI-driven initiatives across both business segments.\n\nAlibaba and Google Match Cloud AI Momentum Alibaba BABA and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google demonstrate comparable AI-driven cloud expansion, with both achieving 34% year-over-year growth in their respective third-quarter 2025 periods. Alibaba Cloud generated 39.8 billion yuan in quarterly revenues, with AI-related products maintaining triple-digit growth for nine consecutive quarters. Google Cloud reported $15.2 billion in revenues with a $155 billion backlog, signing more billion-dollar deals in nine months than the previous two years combined. Alibaba plans to invest 380 billion yuan over three years in AI infrastructure, while Google expects $91 billion-$93 billion in capital expenditures for 2025 alone. Both Alibaba and Google report over 70% of existing customers adopting AI products, mirroring enterprise-wide AI integration patterns. Google attracted nearly 34% more new customers year over year, while Alibaba captured 35.8% of China's AI cloud market. The parallel growth trajectories suggest synchronized global enterprise AI adoption rather than market-share disruption among leading providers.\n\nStory Continues\nAMZN’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Amazon shares have returned 7.4% in the past six-month period compared with the Zacks Internet – Commerce industry and the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s growth of 5.6% and 4.7%, respectively.\nAMZN’s 6-Month Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, AMZN stock appears overvalued, trading at a forward 12-month price/earnings ratio of 29.16X, higher than the industry’s 23.99X.

This sustained expansion reflects multiple tailwinds, including rising smartphone penetration in emerging markets, the proliferation of buy-now-pay-later payment options that increase purchasing accessibility, growing consumer trust in digital payment security and the continued shift of advertising budgets toward e-commerce platforms. Three companies positioned to capitalise on these trends are Amazon AMZN, Expedia EXPE and Fiverr International FVRR, each offering distinct exposure to different facets of the expanding digital economy.\n\nThe sector's momentum has been reinforced by improving macroeconomic conditions, particularly the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts in 2025 that lowered the benchmark federal funds rate by 175 basis points since September 2024 to a range of 3.50%-3.75%. These rate reductions have eased borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, potentially unlocking discretionary spending power that favors online purchasing channels.\n\nArtificial intelligence is expected to play a more visible role in shaping online retail outcomes in 2026, building on investments made across the sector in 2025. Retailers increasingly deployed AI-driven recommendation engines, search optimization tools and personalized marketing algorithms to improve conversion rates and customer engagement. AI has also been applied to demand forecasting, inventory management and dynamic pricing, helping platforms reduce stockouts while improving fulfilment efficiency. In parallel, generative AI tools have been integrated into customer service and content creation workflows, lowering operating costs and enhancing responsiveness. These capabilities are expected to strengthen operating leverage while reinforcing convenience for digital shoppers globally.\n\nBeyond AI, several structural trends are expected to support continued online retail expansion in 2026. Faster fulfilment remains a key driver, with wider adoption of same-day and next-day delivery reducing friction in purchase decisions. Social commerce is gaining momentum as platforms enable in-app shopping, live commerce and creator-led discovery, shortening the path from engagement to transaction. Cross-border e-commerce is expected to benefit from improved international logistics, localized fulfilment networks and multi-currency payment processing, expanding addressable markets for leading platforms. In addition, the growing use of digital wallets, loyalty ecosystems and subscription-based models is likely to enhance customer retention, purchase frequency and revenue visibility, reinforcing long-term growth prospects for digital-first retailers.\n\nStory Continues\nStock Performance Reflects Diverging Strategies Over the past three months, shares of digital commerce leaders have shown divergent performance. Shares of Expedia Group led with an increase of 32.8%, significantly outperforming the broader market as investors rewarded B2B momentum and margin expansion. Amazon advanced 3.7%, supported by its diversified revenue streams across retail, cloud and advertising. Shares of Fiverr International declined 20.4% as the market digested concerns around AI competition in the freelance services sector. These varying performances create different entry points for investors seeking exposure to online retail trends heading into 2026.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our three picks in the past three-month period.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nExpedia is positioned to benefit as increased travel booking migrates to digital channels in 2026. The platform's AI-powered search and mobile commerce capabilities enhance conversion rates as consumers book trips via smartphone. Lower interest rates expand discretionary budgets for leisure spending, while buy-now-pay-later options increase accessibility. Expedia's B2B segment captures corporate travel shifting to digital procurement, providing differentiation. Geographic diversification and social commerce integration through set-jetting trends strengthen market positioning. Expedia currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for EXPE's 2026 EPS has remained unchanged over the past 30 days at $18.23. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFiverr is expected to benefit from the digitization of services procurement in 2026. The platform's network effects strengthen as more freelancers attract buyers, creating switching costs. Fiverr's predefined gig structure simplifies transactions compared to bidding platforms, reducing friction. The marketplace spans over 500 service categories, providing breadth that competitors struggle to match. Mobile commerce enables seamless transactions while AI integration improves delivery quality. Lower interest rates support small business outsourcing budgets. Fiverr's commission-based model scales efficiently as volumes increase. Fiverr currently sports a Zacks Rank #1, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FVRR's 2026 EPS has inched upward by a penny over the past 30 days to $3.05.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon is expected to capture significant online retail growth in 2026, benefiting from rising smartphone penetration and AI-powered personalisation that enhances conversion rates. AMZN's logistics network and Prime ecosystem create switching costs, reinforcing customer loyalty. Amazon's fulfillment infrastructure enables faster delivery, while lower interest rates expand discretionary budgets. Advertising within product search generates high-margin revenue as brands compete for visibility. Its marketplace model allows third-party sellers to reach Prime members efficiently. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMZN's 2026 EPS has inched upward by 2 cents over the past 30 days to $7.85.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "The S&P 500’s Rare 40-Year Valuation Warning: Economic Slowdown Is Confirmed by Federal Reserve\n\nDavid Beren\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:55 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered what can only be described as a strong year to date, extending a rally that has rewarded investors for staying the course through inflation, rate hikes, and geopolitical uncertainty. On the surface, by all accounts, the market looks healthy as stocks continue climbing and corporate earnings remain strong. Similarly, optimism around artificial intelligence and an easier monetary policy has kept an appetite for the stock market intact.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 now trades at 22.4x forward earnings. This valuation has only occurred twice in the past 40 years.\nFederal Reserve research shows tariff policies will reduce annual GDP growth by 0.3% to 0.5% over the next two years.\nProfit margins are near historical highs with limited expansion room while earnings forecasts for 2026 remain modest.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnderneath all of this performance, however, there is something of a growing concern as the same market producing double-digit gains is now trading at approximately 22.4 times forward earnings, a valuation number the country has only seen twice in the last 40 years. At the same time, you have new Federal Reserve research indicating that tariff policies will slow economic growth in a fairly substantial way over the next two years.\nWhen these extremes collide, it's cause for concern, but when combined with weakening fundamentals, history suggests that investors need to pay closer attention, even if the market appears to be mostly calm.\nThe Market Paradox: High Gains Amidst Tariff Uncertainty As you look at the 16% S&P 500 gain year to date, it not only reflects a level of continued optimism but also highlights that there are several key areas worth watching. At the top of any list has to be artificial intelligence, which continues to drive a ton of enthusiasm for technology stocks, particularly for names like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ).\n\nAdditionally, you have the Federal Reserve and its efforts to shift from rate hikes to rate cuts, which is helping to improve the situation for equity investments by making future earnings more valuable and reducing the competition from stocks and bonds, where people shifted money when interest rates were high.\nIf you have invested in the market, so far, so good, as you have been able to enjoy the financial benefits of a 16% market increase. The market has, as it often does, rewarded those who go full force ahead, all while punishing those who were too cautious and missed out on these returns.\n\nStory Continues\nStill, you can't ignore that the Federal Reserve's recent indicators around the impact of tariffs are going to give a whole lot of investors a reality check in the not-too-distant future. The Fed's analysis indicates that tariff policies could reduce annual GDP growth from anywhere between 0.3% and 0.5% over the next two years. On paper, this might sound small, but the resulting loss in growth is substantial. What's worse is that this isn't a speculative conclusion. It's based entirely on comprehensive economic modeling according to the Fed, so it's going to happen, it's just a matter of when.\n\nOnly Seen Twice: The 22.4x Forward Earnings Warning Unsurprisingly, the S&P 500's current forward P/E ratio of 22.4 as a red flag puts the market in the uncomfortable spot of being among the most expensive valuations in the last four decades. Considering that the historical average sits between 15 and 16, this current number is 40% higher, which leads to investors having to pay more for the same dollar of earnings than they have in the past.\n\nMore notable is that this scenario has only played out twice in the last 40 years, during the late 1990s tech boom and the 2021 pandemic stimulus period. If you are a student of financial history, you know that neither instance ended well for investors who bought at peak valuations, as the tech bubble crashed 49% between 2000 and 2002, while the 2021 pandemic peak was followed by a 25% decrease.\nWhile there is cause for concern, it's also necessary to highlight that high valuations do not automatically mean that economic conditions are not strong. If earnings are growing rapidly, which they are, and business conditions are improving, investors can make a justification for paying a premium for future growth. The flag here is that none of these conditions exist right now, including profit margins expanding, so earnings forecasts for 2026 are pretty modest. Profit margins, in particular, are close to historical highs, so there isn't a lot of room for expansion, and according to the Fed, business conditions are about to get worse.\n\nThe 22.4 forward P/E reflects an optimism for investors that doesn't really align with any reality the Fed is describing. It assumes continued strong earnings growth and stable margins, and when those assumptions break or uncertainty increases, valuations are going to reset lower as investors decide they no longer want to pay premiums for companies that have falling fundamentals.\nTariff Impact: Fed Study Predicts Slowed Growth and Market Headwinds The Fed's research on tariff impacts is likely to be the clearest warning sign about what could potentially happen next year with the economy. From its study, we learned that both the direct and indirect effects of tariffs across multiple sectors are going to slow US economic growth in a measurable and meaningful way in the next 24 months.\n\nAs data and detail-heavy as this all is, the math is pretty clear as tariffs increase input costs for manufacturers and force companies to either absorb the cost, impacting margins, or pass the expense onto consumers, which reduces overall demand. It won't surprise anyone to consider that both scenarios likely result in economic compression. If there is a higher input cost, there is less capital for companies to expand, hire, etc., and higher consumer prices reduce overall purchasing power, especially for middle and lower-income households that spend a lot of money on the exact kinds of goods that tariffs will hit hardest.\nThe research also highlighted the uncertainty that is going to impact overall business planning, even before tariffs have been fully implemented. Companies are undoubtedly going to keep delaying capital expenditures if there is even a hint of concern over clarity as to what trade rules could look like in six months. What's worse is that supply chain managers can't commit to long-term contracts when tariff policy shifts weekly. All of this comes together as slowed investment for companies as hiring plans are put on hold and any expansion projects get delayed, perhaps indefinitely.\n\nFor the stock market, any instance of slower economic growth is going to translate into weaker earnings. Corporate revenue is tied directly to economic activity, and even if GDP growth falls from 2% to 1.5%, which may not sound like a lot, it has a big impact. When sales fall, so too do profits, and when profits start to disappoint, stock prices are going to directly reflect investor concerns. Arguably, the biggest takeaway for investors is that the Fed's research all but confirms that the economics surrounding stock prices is about to weaken, perhaps significantly. This is going to translate to the kind of headwind that even the momentum of a few large-cap names can't overcome.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

At the same time, it's not the perfect user interface for every kind of computing activity you might consult.\"\n\nHale added that he doesn't think the iPhone will go away, just as the iPhone didn't fully replace laptops or desktops.\n\"It's just another form factor for computing,\" he said. \"I think that's where the device goes, and I think that we'll have a cloud of wearables that'll be tuned to whatever your use case is.\"\n\nA possible hardware product from OpenAI — the winner of this year's Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award — has generated buzz and interest, with good reason.\nThis past spring, the company snapped up Io, a startup run by Apple design alum Jony Ive, in a $6.5 billion all-equity deal. Ive worked on design for the iPhone with Steve Jobs while at Apple.\nOpenAI's possible handheld device is \"expected to be pocket-sized, screenless and contextually aware,\" according to Builtin.com . It was described as \"gathering information from its surroundings and experiences through built-in cameras and microphones.\"\nSome speculate that the device, which likely won't be a phone or a wearable like a watch, could resemble an iPod Shuffle worn around the user's neck. It will run OpenAI's updated models and is expected to communicate with a user's existing devices and ecosystems, eliminating the need to replicate technology, according to BuiltIn.\n\nThe outlook for OpenAI's hardware push was thought to have hit a snag this month.\nCEO Sam Altman issued a company-wide \"code red\" memo, which explained that OpenAI would delay projects in its pipeline to focus on its primary product, ChatGPT.\nBut OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told Yahoo Finance that a hardware device by Ive is still in the cards.\n\"It's coming,\" Friar said. \"The hardware is still very much coming.\"\n\nStory Continues\nWatch more from the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast\n\nWhy driverless tractor trailers are coming sooner than you think\n\nHilton CEO on AI: 'Everybody has a plan until you get punched in the face'\n\n'We needed to go to work': Hilton CEO details how a winning offering evolved\n\nTo be sure, the battle to analyze your health data has arguably never been fiercer.\nThe Apple Watch has sold tens of millions of units, all of which are collecting health data.

      "Content": "Holiday Sales Boom: 4 Retail Stocks Ready for 2026 Gains\n\nSumit Singh\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:14 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ROST\n\nWMT\n\nCOST\n\nAMZN\n\nAs the final calendar pages of 2025 turn, the holiday shopping season once again underscored its importance to the retail industry. From Black Friday through Christmas week, consumer demand has remained resilient despite lingering concerns about inflation, trade policies, a cooling labor market and still-elevated interest rates. While shoppers became more selective, they continued to spend, prioritizing value and brands that deliver convenience, speed and flexible pricing.\n\nTo meet these shifting behaviors, retailers adopted innovative strategies and enhanced delivery logistics as consumers seamlessly transitioned between digital and physical channels. Shoppers browsed online, picked up in stores, ordered via mobile apps, and even turned to AI-driven chatbots to discover products and compare prices. Retailers that invested in real-time inventory visibility, faster fulfillment, frictionless checkout and AI-powered demand forecasting appear well-positioned to emerge as holiday winners.\n\nAt the same time, industry participants relied on targeted promotions, loyalty programs and data-driven pricing to stimulate demand without eroding profitability. Subscription perks, exclusive member offers and buy-now-pay-later options helped convert value-conscious shoppers. Moreover, disciplined cost control and aggressive marketing not only safeguard margins but also drive healthy sales volumes.\n\nThese dynamics are already reflected in the sales data. The National Retail Federation projects U.S. holiday sales for November and December to exceed $1 trillion for the first time, with year-over-year growth of 3.7%-4.2%, translating into total sales of $1.01-$1.02 trillion. This strength is reinforced by Adobe’s latest data, which showed online spending during Cyber Week — the five-day period from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday — jumped 7.7% year over year to $44.2 billion.\n\nUndoubtedly, holiday performance often serves as a preview of how retailers may fare in the year ahead. Strong traffic trends, inventory discipline and customer retention metrics during this period often translate into sustained revenue momentum. Here are four retail stocks to consider for 2026 against the backdrop of a projected record-breaking 2025 holiday season — Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Ross Stores, Inc. ROST, Walmart Inc. WMT and Costco Wholesale Corporation COST.\n\n4 Prominent Picks for 2026 Amazon: Driving the Digital Holiday Spend Wave Amazon continues to dominate global e-commerce by combining unmatched product selection, industry-leading fulfillment capabilities and technological innovation. These strengths become especially visible during peak holiday shopping periods. Its Prime ecosystem drives customer loyalty and repeat purchases, while ongoing investments in faster delivery, regionalized fulfillment, and last-mile logistics enhance convenience and reduce shipping times. Amazon’s data-driven personalization, AI-powered recommendations, and growing use of automation across warehouses improve conversion rates and operational efficiency.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Amazon’s current financial-year sales and EPS implies growth of 11.9% and 29.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s actuals. For the next fiscal year, the consensus estimate indicates a 11.3% rise in sales and 9.5% growth in earnings. This Zacks #2 (Buy) Ranked company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 22.5%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRoss Stores: An Off-Price Destination for Holiday Shoppers Ross Stores continues to demonstrate the strength of its off-price model, driven by compelling branded assortments, effective merchandising execution and strong customer engagement across regions. Management highlighted broad-based category momentum, improved vendor partnerships, and successful marketing initiatives that are enhancing traffic and basket trends . Store expansion and disciplined inventory management further reinforce its ability to capitalize on favorable buying opportunities, particularly during peak holiday shopping periods. With a resilient value proposition and a proven operating playbook, Ross appears well-positioned to sustain market share gains and long-term growth.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ross Stores’ current financial-year sales and EPS implies growth of 6% and 1.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s actuals. For the next fiscal year, the consensus estimate indicates a 5.4% rise in sales and 9.8% growth in earnings. This Zacks #2 Ranked company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.7%, on average.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWalmart: Omnichannel Leader for Holiday Value Shoppers Walmart continues to strengthen its position as a leading omnichannel retailer, leveraging a broad assortment, accelerated e-commerce momentum, and growing higher-margin profit streams such as advertising and membership. During the holiday season, Walmart’s combination of everyday low prices and omnichannel convenience positions it as a preferred destination for value-conscious shoppers. Its focus on faster fulfillment and tech-powered innovation, particularly in automation and AI, enhances customer convenience and operational efficiency. Market share gains across grocery, general merchandise, and health & wellness reflect durable brand relevance and customer loyalty. This scale-driven, diversified profit model supports steady growth well beyond the holiday period.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Walmart’s current financial-year sales and EPS implies growth of 4.5% and 4.8%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s actuals. For the next fiscal year, the consensus estimate indicates a 4.5% rise in sales and 11.6% growth in earnings. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 0.8%, on average.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCostco: Membership Model Powers Holiday Traffic Costco’s differentiated membership-driven model continues to fuel strong traffic, brand loyalty and market share gains, supported by a curated value-oriented assortment and an expanding global footprint. Holiday periods typically amplify bulk purchasing and gift-related categories, reinforcing Costco’s traffic and basket-size advantages. The company’s investments in digital capabilities, personalization and operational technology, including AI-enhanced inventory systems, are improving efficiency and elevating the member experience. Robust membership renewal rates and rising Executive penetration reinforce the strength of Costco’s recurring revenue base. Costco's disciplined expansion strategy and focus on quality, value and newness underscore its competitive moat.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco’s current financial-year sales and EPS implies growth of 7.5% and 11.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s actuals.

      "Content": "Ranking the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy for 2026. Here's My No. 6\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 4:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Amazon runs the biggest e-commerce site in the U.S. -- by far, the most dominant one in the sector.\nThe tech giant also operates the globe's biggest cloud computing operation, Amazon Web Services.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a legitimate powerhouse in two completely different fields. It has the biggest share of the e-commerce market in the U.S., with a market share of more than 37%. It's also the world's biggest cloud computing provider, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) having a 29% market share.\n\nThe two branches helped propel Amazon to global dominance -- it's a member of the Magnificent Seven grouping of stocks, which represent the seven best-performing publicly traded tech companies in the world. The Magnificent Seven make up 34% of the S&P 500 , so their performance has a significant effect on the overall market.\nThis is the second installment of a seven-article series ranking, in reverse order, the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026. Apple took the No. 7 spot on the list . Amazon is a great company, but it has some significant issues that keep it from being rated higher than others on this list. Here's why.\nAbout Amazon's e-commerce network Amazon traces its roots back more than three decades. It got its start as an online bookseller and expanded to include music and DVD sales, home improvement products, software, and video games.\nA major shift in strategy occurred in 2000, when Amazon launched Amazon Marketplace and began allowing third-party, independent sellers to offer goods on its e-commerce network. That helped Amazon expand its reach tremendously. The company says that independent sellers have been responsible for more than $2.5 trillion in sales, and currently make up 60% of sales on Amazon.com.\nRevenue in the third quarter was $180.17 billion, with $147.16 billion of that coming directly from retail sales. But there's also a huge issue with the e-commerce business -- it's incredibly expensive.\nRegion\nQ3 2025 Net Sales\nQ3 2025 Operating Expenses\nProfit Margin\nNorth America\n$106.27 billion\n$101.48 billion\n4.5%\nInternational\n$40.90 billion\n$39.70 billion\n2.9%\nCombined\n$147.16 billion\n$141.17 billion\n4.1%\n\nData source: Amazon.\nIt's challenging to run a successful business when the primary revenue source yields such a low profit margin. But trade tensions -- such as President Donald Trump's tariff policies -- are increasing costs for sellers and forcing Amazon to choose between changing suppliers to a country with lower import fees, increasing prices, or lowering its profits. Amazon briefly considered adding a notation to prices on Amazon.com to show how much tariffs cost for each item, but backed off from that idea.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is taking steps to reduce costs wherever possible. CEO Andy Jassy says that the company uses automation in its fulfillment network, deploying more than 1 million robots to increase productivity and speed. But it's undoubtedly a challenging business, and part of the reason why Amazon's stock rose less than 5% so far in 2025.\n\nAbout Amazon's cloud services Unquestionably, Amazon's most interesting division right now is AWS. That's why the company's promoting it so heavily in its corporate communications and earnings calls. While Amazon.com has just over a 4% profit margin, Amazon Web Services contributed $33 billion in revenue in Q3 and $11.43 billion in operating income, for a profit margin of 34.6%.\n\nPut another way, Amazon had net income of $21.19 billion for Q3, and 54% of that came from AWS. \"AWS is gaining momentum,\" Jassy said. \"Customers want to be running their core and AI workloads in AWS given its stronger functionality, security and operational performance and the scale I see in front of us gives me significant confidence in what lies ahead.\"\nAmazon reported that its AWS backlog grew to $200 billion by the end of Q3, signaling increased demand for cloud platform. In addition, it's unveiling an upgraded AI chip, called Trainium3, that is designed to replace some of the company's reliance on Nvidia infrastructure. The Trainium3 chips are designed to handle AI tasks at lower prices, and Amazon is looking to have AI developers use its chips rather than Nvidia's Blackwell architecture.\n\nAmazon is a buy here, but it's still No. 6 Amazon is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 32, which is hefty for any stock. But it's also much lower than where Amazon traded earlier in 2025, when the P/E was north of 40.\nThe company is making significant efforts to expand its AWS network, which should continue to be an expanding profit center for Amazon stock. It's monetizing AI in its Amazon.com advertising network, and its Trainium chips are already considered a multi-billion-dollar opportunity.\n\nThe only thing that gives me pause about Amazon is the expenses required to run the e-commerce operation. But Amazon is still a good stock to buy, deserving of its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven and its No. 6 ranking.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Regulators said the software could cause vehicles to cross yellow center lines or stop in front of oncoming traffic near intersections, increasing the risk of collisions.\nZoox sent out a free software update to fix the issue. In May, the firm recalled 270 cars after an incident in San Francisco that resulted to changes to make pedestrian detection and safety procedures better.\nThe new recall came months after the NHTSA approved Zoox for public road demonstrations. This ended an inquiry into its safety compliance in 2022.\nAs Amazon, Alphabet's Waymo, and Tesla push toward self-driving vehicles, the government is paying more attention.

United States Steel became the first $1 billion enterprise on the planet in 1901, and 117 years later, in 2018, iPhone maker Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion milestone.\nEight other U.S. companies have since joined Apple in the trillion-dollar club, including Nvidia , Alphabet , Amazon , and Tesla . It looked as though Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) was set to join them back in September as its market capitalization peaked at $940 billion, but following a 41% decline in its stock price since then, the company is now valued at just $550 billion.\nRecent stock price performance aside, artificial intelligence (AI) developers are lining up to rent access to Oracle's data center infrastructure, which is fueling a surge in the company's revenues. Could it be only a matter of time before this tech titan charts a path back toward $1 trillion?\nA leader in AI infrastructure Most AI development happens inside large, centralized data centers fitted with tens of thousands of advanced parallel processors -- many of them graphics processing units ( GPUs ) supplied by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . It can cost billions of dollars to build a single data center, and since most businesses don't have that kind of money to dedicate to such endeavors, they rent computing capacity from specialized operators like Oracle instead.\n\nOracle's data center infrastructure is among the best in the industry. It uses proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology that moves data between chips and devices more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since most AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, even minor increases in processing speed can result in major cost savings over time.\nOracle's data centers also offer significant scale, enabling developers to tap into clusters of over 131,000 GPUs, which is enough to handle even the most advanced AI workloads.\nMoreover, it's bringing capacity online at a rapid pace. As of the conclusion of its fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ended Nov. 30), Oracle had 147 data center regions up and running with 64 more in the pipeline. OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are just a few of the tech juggernauts using Oracle's infrastructure.\n\n繼續閱讀\nOracle's cloud infrastructure revenue is soaring Oracle generated $16.1 billion in total revenue during its fiscal 2026 second quarter, which was a modest 14% increase from the prior-year period. But revenue from its cloud infrastructure segment, specifically, soared by 66% to a record $4.1 billion.\nThe cloud infrastructure unit could be growing its sales even faster, but Oracle simply can't build data centers fast enough to meet demand. That's why the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) rocketed by a whopping 438% year over year to $523 billion during the quarter. RPO is like an order backlog, because it reflects the value of signed contracts with customers for services that haven't been delivered yet.\n\nAround $300 billion of Oracle's RPO is reportedly from one customer, OpenAI, which creates concentration risk. OpenAI is still a fairly young company, and it doesn't have anywhere close to $300 billion in cash on hand. Unless it becomes a raging financial success, this enormous commitment might never convert into revenue for Oracle.\nSkepticism about this deal is part of the reason Oracle stock has plummeted in the past few months. The company has around $108 billion in debt, and it's taking on even more to fund the construction of more data centers. The possibility that one of its top customers might never have the money to rent all of the capacity it has requested is spooking investors.\nWill Oracle join the $1 trillion club? Oracle generated earnings of $5.32 per share over the last four quarters on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, which gives its stock a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.1. That is a premium to the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so even though Oracle stock has tumbled, it still isn't cheap.\nFrom its market cap of about $550 billion today, Oracle's stock would have to soar by 82% for the company to join the $1 trillion club. If we assume Oracle's P/E ratio remains exactly where it is right now, the company would have to nearly double its earnings per share to justify that type of share price gain. If its P/E ratio declines further, it will have an even steeper mountain to climb.\n\nOracle's AI business is growing at a lightning-fast pace right now, so there's a good chance the company will join the $1 trillion club at some point, but it probably won't be the next member inducted. Several other U.S. companies are much closer to the mark: Walmart has a market cap of $911 billion, and JPMorgan Chase is also in range at $872 billion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now? Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Is Amazon Still Attractively Priced After Its AI and AWS Expansion Push?\n\nSimply Wall St\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:13 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nIf you are wondering whether Amazon.com at around $228 a share is still a smart buy or already pricing in perfection, you are not alone. That question is exactly what this breakdown will tackle.\nThe stock is up 2.6% over the last week and 3.5% over the last month, modest moves that sit against a flat 1 year return of around -0.3% but a powerful 175.1% gain over 3 years.\nRecent headlines have focused on Amazon pushing deeper into AI infrastructure via AWS and expanding its logistics and advertising businesses, reinforcing the idea that it is far more than a simple online retailer. At the same time, ongoing antitrust and regulatory discussions continue to shape how investors think about its long term growth runway and risk profile.\nOn our numbers, Amazon.com scores 5/6 on our valuation checks , suggesting it looks undervalued on most, but not all, metrics. That is why we will walk through multiple valuation approaches next and then finish with an even more intuitive way to think about what the stock is really worth.\n\nFind out why Amazon.com's -0.3% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.\nApproach 1: Amazon.com Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a business is worth today by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back into todays dollars.\nFor Amazon.com, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $40.0 billion. Analysts expect this to rise rapidly, with Simply Wall St aggregating forecasts and then extrapolating further to around $264.9 billion of Free Cash Flow by 2035, based on a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model.\n\nAdding up all these projected cash flows and discounting them back to today leads to an estimated intrinsic value of roughly $305 per share. Compared with the current share price around $228, the DCF suggests the stock trades at about a 25.1% discount, implying meaningful upside if these cash flow projections play out.\nIn plain language, this cash flow based model says the market is not fully pricing in Amazons long term earnings power.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Amazon.com is undervalued by 25.1%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 898 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Amazon.com.\nApproach 2: Amazon.com Price vs Earnings For a profitable business like Amazon.com, the price to earnings ratio is a useful way to gauge how much investors are paying for each dollar of current earnings. In general, faster growth and lower risk justify a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty should result in a lower, more conservative PE ratio.\n\n繼續閱讀\nAmazon currently trades on a PE of about 31.9x. That is slightly below its peer group average of roughly 32.6x, but well above the broader Multiline Retail industry average of around 19.5x. This comparison may reflect Amazon’s large scale and growth profile. To move beyond simple comparisons, Simply Wall St calculates a proprietary Fair Ratio, which estimates what Amazon’s PE should be given its earnings growth outlook, profitability, industry position, market cap and risk profile. For Amazon, that Fair Ratio is around 40.1x.\nBecause this Fair Ratio incorporates company specific drivers rather than relying only on broad industry or peer averages, it offers a more tailored view of value. With the stock trading below its 40.1x Fair Ratio, Amazon screens as undervalued on this earnings based lens.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1458 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Amazon.com Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to connect your view of Amazon.com’s business to a set of financial forecasts and a fair value estimate.\nA Narrative is the story behind your numbers. It captures how you think Amazon’s revenues, margins and earnings will evolve, and then translates that story into a fair value so you can see whether the current share price looks attractive or not.\n\nOn Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors build Narratives that link their assumptions about AWS growth, retail margins and AI investment to projected financials. This makes it easy to compare Fair Value to today’s Price and decide when they would buy, hold or sell.\nThese Narratives update dynamically as new news, earnings or guidance is released. For Amazon, you might see one investor with a more cautious Narrative and a fair value around $217.95, and another with a more optimistic AI and AWS driven Narrative closer to $295.53, giving you a clear, living map of how different perspectives translate into different valuations.\nFor Amazon.com however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Amazon.com Narratives:\n\n🐂 Amazon.com Bull Case\nFair Value: $234.75\nUndervalued by: 2.7%\nRevenue growth assumption: 13.6%\nSees Amazon as a diversified leader across e commerce, AWS, advertising and subscriptions, with a long runway supported by heavy investment in AI and data centers.\nHighlights strong recent execution with record Prime Day, double digit sales growth across regions, robust AWS client wins and expanding robotics and satellite initiatives.\nDescribes conservative but attractive long term return assumptions with a current fair value of $234.75 and a 10 year upside scenario of over $670, viewing recent price weakness as a potential opportunity for long term investors to consider.\n🐻 Amazon.com Bear Case\nFair Value: $227.14\nOvervalued by: 0.6%\nRevenue growth assumption: 9%\n\nFrames Amazon as a company split between high margin, fast growing businesses like AWS, advertising and subscriptions, and lower margin, slower growing retail and third party seller operations.\nAssumes the high tech side maintains 15% plus growth with 30% to 40% margins, while core retail grows only 5% to 10% with margins below 5%, which limits overall profitability in the model.\nModels Amazon reaching about $1 trillion in revenue and around $150 billion in earnings in 5 years, but concludes that this outlook justifies a fair value close to today's price rather than a large potential upside.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Amazon.com?

      "Content": "My Top 3 Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in December\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Alphabet's Google Quantum AI is addressing nearly every aspect of superconducting quantum computing.\nAmazon's Ocelet chip holds the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of quantum error correction.\nMicrosoft's topoconductors could represent a giant leap forward in building large-scale quantum computers.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\n\"Plastics.\"\nThat's the one-word advice that Mr. McGuire (played by Walter Brooke) gave to Dustin Hoffman's character, Benjamin Braddock, in the classic 1967 movie The Graduate . If the movie were remade today, though, McGuire might have to use two words in his investing recommendation to young Braddock – quantum computing .\nQuantum computing is poised to profoundly reshape the technological landscape over the next few years. Importantly, it presents tremendous opportunities for investors today. I think that some opportunities stand out above others, though. Here are my top three quantum computing stocks to buy in December.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is best known as the parent company of Google. And Google, of course, is best known for its ubiquitous search engine. However, Google is also working to advance quantum computing.\nGoogle Quantum AI officially began operating in 2012. Its mission, then and now, is to 'build quantum computing for otherwise unsolvable problems.\"\n\nTo achieve this lofty goal, Google Quantum AI covers nearly every aspect of superconducting quantum computing . Its staff work on both hardware (including quantum processors and cooling systems called cryostats) and software (including operating systems and user applications).\nThus far, Google Quantum AI has completed two of the six milestones on its roadmap to build a practical, large-scale quantum computer. In 2019, Google Quantum AI announced that its technology achieved quantum supremacy (a term used to describe where a quantum computer solves a problem that would take classical supercomputers a significantly long time to handle). In 2023, its team unveiled the first logical qubit prototype that demonstrated quantum error correction.\n2. Amazon You may have also heard about my second quantum computing stock. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reigns as the 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce and cloud services. The company is also an important player in quantum computing.\nIn one sense, Amazon is a \"picks-and-shovels\" play in quantum computing. Amazon Braket is a quantum cloud computing service that's available on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It supports researchers in developing quantum computing algorithms, testing quantum hardware, and creating quantum software.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Amazon isn't just operating on the sidelines in the quantum computing arena. The company is also busy developing its own quantum technology. In February 2025, Amazon announced a new quantum computing chip called Ocelet.\nOcelet could be a key breakthrough in the goal to build large-scale quantum computers. The chip can reduce the costs of quantum error correction by up to 90% versus current approaches. It uses \"cat-qubits\" (named after physicist Erwin Schrödinger's famous quantum thought experiment, which featured a cat) that can suppress some types of quantum computing errors.\n\n3. Microsoft My third pick is also a household name. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a technology giant with products including the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office 365 productivity software, and Xbox gaming systems. Like Alphabet and Amazon, Microsoft is also investing heavily in quantum computing.\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform offers a \"Quantum Ready\" program. This program helps leaders develop strategies to mitigate the potential negative impact of quantum computing on their organizations while leveraging the opportunities that quantum computing presents.\n\nArguably, the most crucial quantum computing initiative for Microsoft is its topological core architecture. This architecture utilizes topological superconductors, also known as topoconductors, which are a special type of matter that falls neither into the solid, liquid, nor gas states.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced the first quantum computing chip that uses topoconductors – Majorana 1. Microsoft believes the technology used in Majorana 1 presents a key step toward fitting 1 million or more qubits on a single chip.\nCommon denominators You may have noticed several commonalities among my top three quantum computing stocks to buy in December. They're all so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. They all operate widely used cloud platforms. All three companies are leaders in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlso, none of them are pure-play quantum computing companies. I think that's critical. No one knows for sure which quantum technologies will emerge as the biggest winners. Investing in a single pure-play quantum computing stock could be a highly risky proposition.\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have ample financial flexibility to acquire smaller rivals that show exceptional promise. If you want to profit from quantum computing but not take on a significant amount of risk, these megacap stocks are the way to go, in my opinion.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 IBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\n\nAmin Ayan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nIBIT\n\nBLK\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nBlackRock has placed its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund among its three biggest investment themes for 2025, ranking the product alongside Treasury bills and US mega-cap technology stocks.\nKey Takeaways:\nBlackRock named its spot Bitcoin ETF a top 2025 investment theme alongside Treasurys and big tech.\nIBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\nThe fund now leads rivals by a wide margin, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios.\n\nThe world’s largest asset manager said its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) together with an ETF tracking short-term Treasurys and another linked to the so-called “Magnificent 7” group of US tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla.\nBlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Pulls $25B in Inflows Despite Bitcoin’s 2025 Pullback IBIT has drawn more than $25 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to market data, ranking sixth among all ETFs by inflows despite posting a negative return in 2025.\nThe performance comes as Bitcoin has slid roughly 30% from its October peak, a drawdown that has not deterred investor demand.\n\nNate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said BlackRock’s decision to spotlight IBIT shows the firm remains comfortable backing Bitcoin through market cycles.\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed that view, noting that if the fund can attract $25 billion in a weaker year, the upside during a stronger market could be significantly larger.\nThe latest inflows add to the roughly $37 billion IBIT attracted in 2024, bringing total net inflows since launch to about $62.5 billion, according to Farside Investors.\nThat figure puts IBIT well ahead of competitors, with flows more than five times larger than those of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, its closest rival.\nBlackRock has continued to build out its crypto-linked ETF lineup beyond spot Bitcoin exposure. In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Got $100,000? Buy This Unstoppable Growth Stock Before Its Market Cap Hits $3 Trillion.\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 11:00 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nKey Points Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, online shopping, and digital advertising provide tailwinds for Amazon's revenues.\nIts valuation is at a 10-year low based on one metric.\nAnalysts expect the company’s operating income to surge in 2026, which would support a higher stock price.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nBusinesses that can increase their revenues and earnings at high rates over long stretches of time make for wonderful investments. You might think that these opportunities only come from smaller and earlier-stage companies. That's not true: At least one magnificent tech enterprise looks like it fits that description.\nIf you're ready to invest $100,000, it could be a good idea to buy this unstoppable growth stock now, before its market cap hits $3 trillion.\nSustainable growth supported by multiple tailwinds Investors should pay close attention to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . Its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, continues to be a critical growth engine, benefiting from customers' robust interest in its artificial intelligence tools and features. Management has said it expects its capital expenditures to total $125 billion this year as it rushes to build out its data center capacity so that it can capture more of the available demand.\n\nOnline shopping is another secular trend pushing its business forward. Other retailers simply can't compete with the massive product selection Amazon offers or the finely tuned logistics network it has built. The fast and free shipping it offers supports an exceptional user experience that drives new sign-ups for Prime memberships and keeps established members resubscribing, gradually expanding the Amazon ecosystem.\nThe digital advertising industry has long been dominated by Alphabet and Meta Platforms . However, Amazon is rapidly rising up the ranks, having collected $65 billion in digital ad revenues in the past 12 months. Amazon is clearly providing value to marketers, giving it another tailwind as the overall digital ad market keeps expanding.\n\nA $3 trillion market cap could happen sooner than you think Amazon's current market cap is about $2.4 trillion. To get to the $3 trillion mark -- a milestone only four companies have reached -- that figure would need to rise by 25%. It's entirely possible that Amazon will achieve this over the next 12 months, if history is any indication.\nIn the past 20 years, the stock has rocketed 9,140% higher (as of Dec. 19), making it one of the best investments of recent decades. However, it's only up 4% this year, and its current enterprise-value- to- earnings-before-interest-and-taxes ratio of 31 is near a 10-year low. Therefore, investors could benefit from valuation expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts' consensus estimates are for operating income to increase 26% between 2025 and 2026. With strong financial results like this possibly on tap, the market should start to appreciate this business more. That would create a favorable backdrop that could push the stock price higher in short order.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "1 Stock I'd Buy Before Tesla in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Tesla is hovering around an all-time high despite its core automotive business posting poor results.\nNvidia’s high margins enable it to invest aggressively in research and development without draining its cash flows.\nNvidia is a far better value than Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been on a tear -- hitting an all-time high on Dec. 15 . Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

It helps Best Buy sell appliances and electronics, since people can see what they're buying in a physical store, yet have it delivered with all the convenience offered by a pure-digital retailer.\nAnother Amazon rival, FlexShopper, has tried to make electronics, appliances, computers, furniture, and more accessible to everyone. FlexShopper and seven affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware on December 22, 2025, reporting minimal assets and liabilities, according to MarketScreener .\nStill, as you can see, the top five online retailers are all giant brands that have a brick-and-mortar presence, with Amazon as the only exception.\nTop 5 U.S. online retailers by e-commerce sales (2024) Amazon.com , $143.7 billion in U.S. online sales: Amazon leads the U.S. ecommerce market by a large margin.\nWalmart.com , $79.2 billion in U.S. ecommerce revenue: Walmart is the clear second place.\nApple.com estimated $41-42 billion in online sales: Apple’s online sales place it among the top U.S. sites (higher than Target by many estimates, but the company does not break out these numbers in its earnings reports).\nHomeDepot.com , $22.5 billion in U.S. ecommerce revenue: Home Depot rounds out the top five.\nTarget.com : $20.5 billion in U.S. ecommerce sales\n\n\"Amazon’s U.S. e-commerce share exceeds 40%, dwarfing smaller online retailers, according to Bernstein analysts, Investing.com reported.\n\"Amazon's ability to grow absolute sales faster than its biggest rivals stems from the fact that it's no longer just a retail company. In fact, it makes greater profits from its cloud computing and advertising businesses than it makes from retail,\" wrote The Motley Fool's Adam Levy .\nAmazon can actually afford to lose money on a sale because of its other busineses, according to Citi Research.\n\"We believe Amazon is intentionally selling goods to consumers at a loss,\" Citi Research analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a note. \"But, it is leveraging dual-purpose infrastructure (servers, fulfillment centers, web traffic) to profitably sell services to Enterprises.\"\nThat makes it challenging for any retailer to compete with Amazon, but FlexShopper attempted to win over customers by building its business around a consumer-friendly payment model.\nFlexShopper files Chapter 11 bankruptcy FlexShopper uses a lease-to-own business model.\n\"Lease-to-own with FlexShopper lets you get the products you love — like furniture, electronics, and appliances — without paying the full price upfront. Take your item home today and make affordable weekly or monthly payments; once your plan is complete, it’s yours to keep.

      "Content": "Saks Mulls Bankruptcy Year After Raising Billions for Turnaround\n\nReshmi Basu and Eliza Ronalds-Hannon\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:31 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: PJT\n\nAMZN\n\nCRM\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Saks Global Enterprises, facing limited options ahead of a more than $100 million debt payment due at the end of this month, is considering Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a last resort, according to people with knowledge of the situation.\nThe company is also weighing additional ways to shore up liquidity, including raising emergency financing or selling assets, the people said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly. Separately, some Saks lenders have held confidential talks in recent days to assess the company’s cash needs, according to other people familiar with the matter. Those discussions have focused on a potential debtor-in-possession loan, a form of bankruptcy funding.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working.

Instead, the deal deepened the company’s debt burden and failed to resolve long-running issues with vendors, many of whom halted shipments amid missed payments, accelerating losses.\nIn June, Saks persuaded creditors to provide hundreds of millions of dollars more as part of a debt deal that reshuffled repayment priorities, creating multiple tiers of bondholders with differing claims on the company’s assets. Even those securities have since plunged, underscoring concern among investors that the turnaround effort is running out of time.\n\n“Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future for Saks Global and advance our transformation while delivering exceptional products, elevated experiences and personalized service to our customers,” a representative for Saks said via email. PJT Partners, which is advising the company, declined to comment.\nThe tie-up with Neiman last year was intended to create a multibrand luxury giant powered by the technology of new high-profile investors, which included Amazon.com Inc. and Salesforce Inc. But by May, bondholders were already facing paper losses of more than $1 billion as the plan stumbled.\nFollowing the restructuring, Saks in October cut its full-year guidance after reporting declining sales tied to inventory management challenges, as it continued to delay payments to some vendors to conserve cash.\n\nStory Continues\nSaks faces interest payments of more than $100 million due Dec. 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $941 million portion of Saks’ second-out notes restructured in August traded at about 7.5 cents on the dollar on Monday, down from roughly 36 cents two weeks earlier, according to Trace pricing. About $762 million of more senior debt was quoted at around 48 cents.\n(Updates with Saks comment in fifth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nJohn Paulson Gets a Gold Mine in America’s Critical Minerals Scramble\nThe United States of Klarna\nThe Rehabilitation of an Israeli Spyware Mogul\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia by the End of 2026\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:25 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock is at risk in 2026 if revenue growth slows down.\nAlphabet is gaining market share back in artificial intelligence (AI) and should keep growing its earnings next year.\nAmazon has a chance to grow its operating leverage if it can stay disciplined with its cost base.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIs 2026 the year Nvidia finally underperforms versus the broad market? I think it might be.\nThe leader in artificial intelligence ( AI ) computer chips is unlikely to give up all its gains from the last few years, but it is facing increasing competition, a high starting valuation, and the potential of near-term overspending to build out AI infrastructure. That makes the stock risky for 2026.\nThat doesn't mean you should dump your entire position. However, if you are thinking of buying AI stocks in 2026, there are two companies I believe will finish the year with larger market caps than Nvidia: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) . Here's why both are better buys than Nvidia today.\nAlphabet's AI comeback Alphabet is the conglomerate that owns Google, YouTube, Android, Waymo, and other technology properties. It is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, with billions of users across multiple product lines.\nThe stock was deemed a potential AI loser after ChatGPT came out and rapidly began taking market share of search and AI queries, with Alphabet falling flat-footed after the launch. Now, with the launch of updated Gemini AI models for text, images, and video creation (among other things), Alphabet is steadily gaining market share back from OpenAI and ChatGPT.\n\nIts stock has begun to perform because of it. Alphabet stock is up 60% year to date (YTD), which is more than double the returns of Nvidia. It is growing revenue at 15% year over year in constant currency, and with expanding profit margins. The durability of Google Search and YouTube, fast growth at Google Cloud, and long-term plays with Gemini and Waymo's self-driving cars should help Alphabet keep compounding its earnings power for years to come.\nAmazon's dual engines Alphabet's growth path in 2026 is clear. Amazon's will be determined by management's ability to wrangle costs that spiraled out of control during the pandemic years, which is a headwind still impacting the business.\nAmazon's cloud computing division -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- grew revenue 20% year over year last quarter, with a fat 36% operating margin over the last 12 months. Cloud computing is benefiting from the AI infrastructure expansion, with Amazon specifically helped by the likes of its partner Anthropic, a start-up growing incredibly quickly that Amazon is also an investor in. OpenAI is in talks with Amazon about a $10 billion investment that would likely flow back through to AWS cloud computing spending.\n\nStory Continues\nYou have a 36% operating margin at AWS. In retail, Amazon is still growing strongly, with double-digit growth in the last few years in North America and internationally. Advertising, third-party seller services, and subscription revenue now generate $279 billion in trailing revenue, or 40% of Amazon's total revenue. These segments have high profit margins and have been growing faster than the overall Amazon retail business.\n\nAnd yet Amazon's retail operations in North America only have a 6.6% operating margin. This could be looked at as a failure or a future path to profit expansion. Amazon has been trimming its ranks through layoffs, which should help margins expand throughout 2026 and beyond. If retail can keep up this operating leverage, along with the fast growth at AWS, then Amazon's profitability will explode in 2026.\nThe math: Why Amazon and Alphabet will be worth more than Nvidia Today, Alphabet generates $128 billion in operating income, Nvidia $110 billion, and Amazon $80 billion. Nvidia's revenue is currently growing much faster than both of these businesses, but that could come to a grinding halt if the AI infrastructure buildout slows down in 2026.\nNvidia's revenue growth doesn't have to go negative in order for earnings to fall, as it is currently implementing huge price increases for its products that are generating incredibly high profit margins. Plus, its stock trades at a more expensive earnings ratio than both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nIf Nvidia's revenue growth slows down in 2026 while Alphabet and Amazon keep chugging along, then Nvidia's earnings will likely fall along with its high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. That could lead both stocks to finish 2026 with market caps larger than Nvidia.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Who has the best last-minute holiday deals --Walmart, Amazon, or Target?\n\nTodd Campbell\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:12 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nTGT\n\nWMT\n\nIt's a race to the finish. Despite concerns that a K-shaped economy could derail holiday spending, Americans are on pace to set yet another record for spending through Christmas, providing a windfall for retailers such as Walmart, Target, and Amazon.\n91% of Americans celebrate the holidays and are budgeting an average of $890 in holiday spending, according to the National Retail Federation .\n\nIf you're like me, a lot of that shopping has been happening since mid-December. As presents get wrapped and lists get double-checked, I always find myself online or heading to the store hunting for last-minute hard-to-get items. Often, the item isn't available, or if it is, the prices vary from location to location, making it tough to get the best deal. Even worse is finding the perfect item only to discover it won't arrive in time.\nHoliday shopping at-a-glance (2025): Holiday sales are expected to surpass $1 trillion.\nRetail sales are expected to increase by 3.7% to 4.2% year over year in November and December 2025.\nAs of early December, shoppers had completed 51% of their holiday shopping.\nSource: NRF.\nTo help, Bank of America conducts an annual survey in December that ranks major online retailers. Its survey reveals it's not just prices that separate major retail rivals. While Walmart has the edge on prices, Amazon came out on top when it comes to selection, delivery, and shipping times. Meanwhile, Target trailed behind Walmart and Amazon, offering slightly higher prices and slower shipping times.\nThe findings suggest that last-minute shoppers may still have an opportunity to shop on Amazon, because of one-day shipping on many items. However, in-person shopping is your best bet at Target, and likely at Walmart as well.\nBank of America survey shows Walmart price edge Walmart is known for its low-price approach, and despite tariffs causing it to raise prices on select items, the big box retailer has rolled back prices on many items this year to win customer wallet share.\nThe big-box retail chain's \"hold the line\" mentality on prices was on clear display in Bank of America's 17th Annual Holiday Pricing Survey, which was shared with me via email.\n\nBank of America compiled a list of recommended gifts and products from top sites such as Verge, CNET, Sahara, The Toy Insider, Vogue, L'Officiel, in mid-December across five categories:\nElectronics\nToys\nBeauty & Fashion\nGaming Hardware\nOther\nIt compared prices and shipping times for those items at top online retailers, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and eBay.\nOf the 28 items available at Walmart, Amazon, and Target, Walmart had the lowest total price for the basket, clocking in at $5,325. The same items cost $5,401 at Amazon and $5,414 at Target.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, Walmart also had the lowest total price for the 37 items also available at Amazon (not Target). For those items, Walmart was 0.5% cheaper than Amazon, with a total basket size of $7,075 versus $7,111.\nAcross Walmart, Amazon, and Target, Walmart boasted below-average prices on 43% of the items. Amazon was next at 40%, while Target only had lower-than-average prices on 29% of them.\n\nIt wasn't always a win for Walmart on price, though.\nAcross a basket of electronics items available at all three retailers, Amazon came out cheapest at $2,210, undercutting Walmart and Target, which boasted total retail cart prices for those items of $2,241 and $2,230, respectively.\nHoliday prices for top electronics gifts (2025): 17th Annual Holiday Pricing Survey Data\nElectronics\nAmazon\nWalmart\nTarget\nBest Buy\nAirpods Pro 3\n$219.99\n$251.49\n$219.99\n$219.99\nRay-Ban Meta Gen2\n$379.00\n$379.00\n$379.99\n$379.00\nBose SoundLink Flex Portable Speaker\n$119.00\n$119.00\n$119.99\n$119.00\nSony WH-1000 XM6\n$398.00\n$398.00\n$399.99\n$398.00\nAmazon Echo Dot Max\n$79.99\nn/a\n$31.99\n$79.99\nGoogle Pixel Watch 3\n$219.99\n$215.76\n$229.99\n$229.99\nKindle Colorsoft (16GB)\n$189.99\nn/a\n$209.99\n$189.99\nQrevo S5V Robot Vacuum\n$499.99\n$499.99\n$499.99\nn/a\nApple Watch Series 11 (42mm)\n$299.00\n$299.00\n$299.99\n$299.00\nRoku Ultra\n$75.00\n$79.00\n$79.99\n$79.99\nSource: Bank of America 17th Annual Holiday Pricing Survey Data via email\n\nTarget and Amazon were also cheaper than Walmart for toys, with a basket of available items at Target and Amazon costing $207, compared to $214 at Walmart.\nHoliday prices for top toy gifts (2025): 17th Annual Holiday Pricing Survey Data\nToys\nAmazon\nWalmart\nTarget\nRealFX Disney Stitch\n$66.99\nn/a\nn/a\nVerizon Gizmo Watch 3\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nBluey Supermarket Playset\nn/a\nn/a\n$34.99\nNex Playground\n$250.00\nn/a\nn/a\nLego Duplo Bluey Ice Cream Trip\n$23.95\n$23.95\n$23.99\nLego Super Mario Adventures Starter Course Set\n$59.99\n$60.58\nn/a\nElmo's Lift and Slide (Sesame Street)\n$8.41\n$14.99\n$8.41\nKids Camera Instant Print\n$30.37\n$28.99\nn/a\n3Doodler Start Plus\n$59.99\n$59.99\n$59.99\nDisney Lorcana TCG: Whispers in the well booster pack display\n$114.98\n$114.98\n$114.99\nSource: Bank of America 17th Annual Holiday Pricing Survey Data via email\n\nAmazon wins selection and shipping battle While Walmart had the lowest prices, it couldn't match Amazon's selection and delivery options.\nOf the items Bank of America searched for online, Amazon was selling 94% of them, while Walmart.com had 74% and Target's website had 60%.\nMore Retail:\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\nIn addition to being able to find more of these top holiday items on Amazon, it also outpaced Walmart and Target in terms of shipping and delivery.\nBank of America used a San Francisco address, and Amazon offered free one-day delivery on 27 of the 50 items.

Bank of America also noted that some items at Amazon were available via its latest same-day service.\nOverall, Walmart averaged 5.2 days for shipping, only slightly better than Target's 5.4 days. Walmart's electronics delivery timeline was 2 days, while Target's was 3 days. Walmart had only 14% of its items listed as available for one-day shipping, significantly less than Amazon.\nThe data suggest that when speed matters, Amazon has been the best option for receiving gifts quickly in the final days of the shopping season, especially for electronics and toys, as it also offers lower total prices for these products than Walmart and Target, according to Bank of America's survey.\nRelated: Best Buy, Macy's, and Kohl's add fees to holiday returns\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the Retail section.

Costco's stock price and earnings have increased several-fold because the business model has resonated with consumers. This has allowed the company to expand rapidly across North America while still adhering to its core principles of passing along value to customers through low merchandise margins and affordable memberships.\nDespite Costco's long-term track record of outperforming the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) , 2025 is on track to be Costco's worst year relative to the index in over two decades. The stock is down 6.5% year to date at the time of this writing, compared to a 15.3% gain for the index.\nThe sell-off may look like a compelling opportunity to scoop up shares of this longtime winner. But there's an even better retail stock to buy for 2026.\nCostco and Amazon share many similarities Costco shoppers can be confident that they are getting great deals on merchandise and services, because Costco doesn't price-gouge, and it values customer loyalty. Like Costco, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has an elite supply chain that allows it to pass value along to customers. Similar to Costco, Amazon's Prime membership model generates a recurring revenue stream, enabling the company to offer competitive prices.\n\nIn Costco's most recent quarter, the company generated $2.46 billion in operating income from $67.31 billion in revenue, including membership fees, which is a 3.7% operating margin.\nIn Amazon's most recent quarter, the company raked in $147.16 billion in revenue from online and physical stores, advertising, subscription services, third-party fees (like commission, fulfillment, and shipping), and other. Amazon earned $5.99 billion in operating income on those sales, which is an operating margin of 4.1%. Keep in mind that this doesn't even include the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's non-AWS business is similar to Costco, just more than twice as large. AWS is Amazon's high-margin cash cow, earning roughly twice as much operating income in Amazon's third-quarter 2025 as the rest of the business combined, even though AWS' net sales are less than a quarter of the rest of the business.\n\nAmazon is a better value than Costco Given their similar margins and recurring revenue from subscriptions, Amazon would deserve to be valued similarly to Costco if it were just the non-AWS component. But AWS adds a massive growth story to Amazon's investment thesis. And yet, Amazon trades at just 32.2 times forward earnings, compared to 42.4 for Costco.\n\nCostco is a phenomenal company, but the stock price has risen faster than its earnings growth, making it too expensive even after the recent sell-off. Amazon is a much better value and has more growth potential.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now? Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Interface Stock Is Up 14% but Here's Why This Fund Just Cut $2.4 Million\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TILE\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nMELI\n\nKey Points Pennsylvania-based Matthew 25 Management sold 200,000 shares of Interface in the third quarter.\nThe estimated net position value change from the previous period was $2.38 million.\nAs of September 30, the fund reported holding 225,000 TILE shares valued at $6.51 million.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nPennsylvania-based Matthew 25 Management reduced its stake in Interface (NASDAQ:TILE) by an estimated $2.38 million, according to a November 12 SEC filing.\nWhat Happened\nAccording to a November 12 SEC filing , Matthew 25 Management Corp sold 200,000 shares of Interface (NASDAQ:TILE) from its portfolio during the third quarter. The value of the reduction was about $2.38 million from the previous period. The fund’s remaining position stands at 225,000 shares valued at $6.51 million at quarter end.\nWhat Else to Know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: NVDA: $81.72 million (25.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AMZN: $31.56 million (9.7% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: MELI: $30.38 million (9.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: TSM: $19.13 million (5.9% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: TSLA: $16.32 million (5% of AUM)\nAs of Monday, shares of Interface were priced at $27.98, up 14% over the past year and slightly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 16% in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nMarket Capitalization\n$1.63 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.37 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$113.47 million\nPrice (as of Monday)\n$27.98\n\nCompany Snapshot Interface produces modular carpet tiles, resilient flooring, rubber flooring, and luxury vinyl tile products, with additional offerings in antimicrobial compounds and installation systems.\nThe company generates revenue through direct sales to end-users and indirect distribution channels, complemented by project management and maintenance services.\nIt serves commercial, institutional, and residential clients globally, with a focus on offices, healthcare, education, hospitality, and retail sectors.\n\nInterface is a global leader in modular flooring, leveraging a diversified product portfolio and broad geographic reach to serve commercial and institutional markets. The company’s strategy emphasizes innovation in sustainable flooring solutions and value-added services, reinforcing its competitive position. Scale, brand recognition, and a multi-channel distribution model underpin Interface’s ability to capture demand across key end markets.\nFoolish Take What makes this move worth watching is not the sale itself but the timing. Interface just delivered one of its strongest quarters in years, with third-quarter revenue up nearly 6% to $364.5 million and GAAP earnings per share jumping 63% year over year to $0.78. Margins expanded meaningfully too, with adjusted gross margin climbing more than 230 basis points, and management raised full-year guidance. On the surface, this looks like exactly the kind of setup that would keep long-term holders comfortable.\n\nBut portfolio management is about opportunity cost. Interface shares have rallied off prior lows and are now up roughly 14% over the past year, even as broader demand indicators in commercial construction remain uneven. For a fund whose top positions include mega-cap growth names like Nvidia, Amazon, and MercadoLibre, trimming a smaller, more cyclical holding after a solid run can be less about doubt and more about discipline.\n\nInterface still has a compelling story around pricing power, sustainability leadership, and balance sheet improvement, with net leverage now well under one times EBITDA. The takeaway for long-term investors is simple: Strong execution does not guarantee linear upside. At this stage, Interface looks more like a well-run compounder than a deep value rebound, which means returns may increasingly hinge on patience rather than momentum.\n\nStory Continues\nGlossary Stake: The ownership interest or investment a fund or individual holds in a company.\n13F reportable assets: Securities that institutional investment managers must disclose quarterly to the SEC on Form 13F.\nAssets Under Management (AUM): The total market value of investments managed on behalf of clients by a fund or firm.\nTop holdings: The largest investments in a fund's portfolio, usually ranked by market value or percentage of AUM.\nDistribution channels: The various ways a company sells its products, such as direct sales or through third-party distributors.\nEnd markets: The industries or customer segments that ultimately purchase and use a company's products or services.\nModular carpet tiles: Carpet flooring products made in square or rectangular sections, allowing flexible installation and replacement.\nProject management services: Assistance provided by a company to oversee and coordinate the installation or implementation of its products.\nValue-added services: Additional services offered beyond basic products to enhance customer experience or product effectiveness.\nMulti-channel distribution: A sales strategy using multiple methods or platforms to reach customers, such as direct and indirect sales.\nAntimicrobial compounds: Chemical additives used in products to inhibit the growth of bacteria, mold, or other microbes.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NYSE: OLP), a real estate investment trust focused on the ownership of industrial properties, today announced the completion of the previously announced acquisition of a 397,440 square foot, six building, multi-tenant industrial property located in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, for $53.5 million. The portfolio is 93% leased to 16 tenants, anchored by Amazon, Linde Gas, a Fortune Global 2000 multinational chemical company, The Macomb Group, and Safelite Fulfillment. The aggregate annual base rent is approximately $3.4 million, with annual contractual rent bumps ranging from 2% to 3% and the potential for additional rent growth as vacancies are filled and mark-to-market upside as leases expire. The weighted average remaining lease term is 3.3 years.\n\nThe acquisition was financed with cash and a seven-year $32.4 million mortgage bearing an interest rate of 5.45%, with the first five years interest-only, followed by a 30-year amortization schedule.\nPatrick J. Callan, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of One Liberty stated, “This acquisition delivers immediate critical mass in a high-performing and high barrier to entry submarket within the Pittsburgh MSA. The properties add a diverse roster of high-quality industrial tenants and creates operational efficiencies beyond what smaller piecemeal acquisitions can accomplish. The over $188 million of transactions completed in 2025 represents over five times our average annual acquisition pace from the prior five years, reflecting a meaningful inflection point in the execution of our industrial-focused transformation strategy.”\n\nForward Looking Statement:\nCertain information contained in this press release, together with other statements and information publicly disseminated by One Liberty Properties, Inc. is forward looking within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Uh, you emphasize strong seasonal trends, Eric, you point out solid earnings growth, you talk about, you do raise some some questions on your radar as well. What what would those be Eric as we head into 2026?\n00:17 Eric\nWell, first off, uh always a pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me, Josh.\n00:22 Eric\nUh there's a lot of great momentum.\n00:27 Eric\nI think um the questions are simply one, valuation, right? And we and we know that.\n00:36 Eric\nUm concentration, right? We know that the top 10 stocks in the S&P now account for 40% of the value of the S&P. That is\n00:47 Eric\nas concentrated uh as we've ever been.\n00:52 Eric\nAnd we actually know from history, if you go back to 1970, once we get over 30% in those top 10, going out the next five years, there's a 95% chance\n01:06 Eric\nthat the other 490 are going to outperform those top 10.\n01:12 Eric\nUm so I'm concerned about concentration. And then of course with AI, look, AI is real. This is a game changer. It's going to change the world.\n01:20 Eric\nBut a lot of this is definitely focused on Open AI. Open AI is is right out there saying, hey guys, we're going to be losing money for a long time. We might be profitable\n01:30 Eric\n2030.\n01:32 Eric\nIs the market going to be patient and wait while all this capX happens and money's being invested and we're not seeing that ROI yet.\n01:43 Eric\nIs the market going to be patient with that? You know, I'm not sure. I think there's going to be a lot of volatility.\n01:49 Speaker A\nIn terms of that AI trade, Eric, looking ahead in 2026, do you think about, listen, I'll I'll just, I'll stick with the Mag 7 as a basket or do you feel like no, I'm going to have to be more discerning next year. It's going to get tougher. Maybe it's the mag 3 or four.\n02:04 Eric\nUh it's a great question. I mean, look, we're not stock pickers at the Wealth Alliance, we're more asset allocators.\n02:10 Eric\nI think if you own the Mag 7, I think you're going to be okay. Let's not forget, the Mag 7 the last decade has grown its earnings 20-fold.\n02:19 Eric\nThat is a 35% compounded versus about 8% for the S&P.\n02:25 Eric\nI think it's okay to have Mag 7 exposure and you should. My concern is when I see a lot of new clients are coming into the firm, they're just loaded up in tech.\n02:34 Eric\nAnd they're not diversified. And I'm I just hit my 40th anniversary doing this. and I remember 1999 and 2000, seeing the same thing. People just loaded up in the same stocks. That was just gets me all nervous. Stay diversified.

(UNFI) have voted overwhelmingly to join Teamsters Local 745. The 311 workers organized to secure better wages, stronger benefits, and safer working conditions. Their victory marks the latest Teamsters organizing win at the nation's largest grocery distributor for Amazon-owned Whole Foods.\n\"The reason I got involved in this organizing drive was simple — the level of exploitation we were facing every single day,\" said Estrina Hughes, a warehouse worker at UNFI and a new member of Local 745. \"I knew the only way to improve our jobs and protect our co-workers was by joining the Teamsters.\"\n\nSince 2022, more than 3,500 UNFI workers have organized with the Teamsters nationwide, bringing the total number of Teamsters at the company to over 5,500.\n\"I want to welcome these workers into the Teamsters family and look forward to helping them win the strong first contract they deserve,\" said Brent Taylor, Secretary-Treasurer of Local 745 and Teamsters Southern Region International Vice President. \"We are going to fight tooth and nail for the wages, benefits, and job protections that thousands of Teamsters at UNFI have already stood up for and won.\"\nThe Lancaster warehouse workers are the latest to join a growing wall-to-wall Teamsters movement at UNFI. In May, nearly 100 drivers at the same facility voted to join Local 745 . In September, more than 50 drivers at UNFI in Richburg, South Carolina, voted to join Teamsters Local 509 . With the warehouse workers' victory, the Lancaster facility is now fully unionized.\n\n\"We're growing our density at UNFI because workers know that organizing with the Teamsters is the only way to win the respect they deserve,\" said Tom Erickson, Director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division. \"We're building power across this company and delivering real results for working families.\"\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

      "Content": "Will More Circular Deal-Making Be in the Cards for Nvidia in 2026?\n\nJoey Frenette\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:40 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Circular dealmaking among tech firms, like Nvidia, is expected to continue through 2025.\nEnterprise AI adoption may accelerate if evidence of strong ROI emerges in the future.\nAmazon is reportedly considering a $10B investment in OpenAI.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe circular nature of the deals and partnerships we've seen across the AI space may make some skeptics and those worried about a looming AI bubble burst a bit woozy. Undoubtedly, it seems like a new deal is coming in every couple of weeks. And if each new announcement or rumor has you on pause, you're definitely not alone.\nAnd while adding more dominoes to the row might make for a more spectacular implosion at some point down the road, investors might wish to take a step back and reconsider what every new deal means and whether it really is a sign that we're headed for a repeat of the events that unfolded in the late-1990s.\nAll these deals seem to fuel the AI bubble fears With Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) most recently reported to be considering a big $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the web of deals across big tech titans seems to be getting bigger and more interlinked. Does that mean the risks are higher?\nPossibly. But adding more dominoes to the row might not be all too big of a deal if there's nobody who nudges one of them anytime soon. As always, timing is such a hard thing to get right. If you don't get the timing right, you may as well be wrong about the bubble situation.\n\nAnd while AI bubble talks are probably going to be the talk of the town in 2026, I think investors might be better off sticking with individual value names rather than dismissing all stocks until that big crash comes. Indeed, timing the market, even when valuations are on the higher end, might not be all too beneficial.\nSo, in my view, the question of whether we're in a bubble or not might matter a whole lot less if you're diversified and ready to ride through a storm.\nCould the circular AI deals keep happening, even as investors give a thumbs down? Whether it's OpenAI or Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) that keeps its foot to the deal-making pedal, I don't think investors should hit the panic button just yet, especially as many others are already acting as though AI has run into a brick wall. While increased collaborations between tech titans and innovative startups could make it harder to track systemic risk, I do think that such circularity stands to accelerate efforts while reducing waste.\n\nStory Continues\nUndoubtedly, raising the bar on risk isn't exactly what retail investors want from the big tech titans they hold shares in. But the more elevated risk profile, I believe, also accompanies greater potential rewards if things go right. In essence, the bear case gets more bearish while the bull case might get that much more bullish. At the end of the day, large-scale AI and ambitious goals (think reaching artificial general intelligence, or AGI) are profound challenges that require group effort.\n\nAs a builder of the most powerful GPUs out there, Nvidia stands out as a firm that should keep making deals where possible to keep advancing the technology. So, should investors expect more circular dealmaking in the new year?\nTime will tell, but I'd say it's probable, especially as enterprise adoption of AI looks to pick up, should more evidence of monetization arise.\nRight now, it's unclear if the return on investment will be there. And while we might not know what the ROIs will be in the near future, I do think that there's a chance that if evidence of a decent ROI suddenly comes flowing in, an AI adoption floodgate might just open, unlocking another wave of growth for the firms across the AI stack.\nThe bottom line Of course, we can only speculate for now, but it seems like many analysts see more circular deals in the new year. And as the king of AI chips, Nvidia is likelier than not to be involved, as too are leading model makers like OpenAI. So, in short, expect more of the same in the AI scene.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Waymo is back online in San Francisco, but may struggle after failure\n\nTony Owusu\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:17 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nFor Waymo, 2025 has been a year of one step forward and two steps back.\nFor now, it has leapt ahead of big money rivals like Tesla Robotaxi and Amazon-backed Zoox.\nWaymo quick facts: Founded in 2009.\nPassed the first U.S. state self-driving test in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2012.\nSource: IEEE Spectrum\nSpun out from Alphabet as a separate subsidiary in 2016.\nAs of July 2025, Google indicates that Waymo One is available 24/7 to customers in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nThe current Waymo fleet features over 1,500 vehicles. By 2026, the company expects to add 2,000 more.\n\nWaymo began operating fully autonomous vehicles in Miami on Nov. 18 and said it will start operations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando “over the coming weeks, ahead of opening our doors to riders next year.”\nIt is also “returning” to Las Vegas and regularly testing in Detroit during winter weather , and spreading its fleet of more than 200 vehicles to new locations seemingly every month.\nBut the Alphabet-backed company is also facing issues such as a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration probe into the autonomous vehicles for “traffic safety violations relating to stopping when encountering a school bus, particularly when the bus is boarding or offboarding students.”\nBut recently, some of Waymo's biggest issues have arisen in the company's home city of San Francisco.\nSan Francisco power outage temporarily stops Waymo autonomous vehicles Waymo currently operates a fleet of approximately 2,000 vehicles on U.S. roads.\nApproximately 800 of those autonomous vehicles are operating in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to data the company shared with the San Francisco Examiner in August , making the City by the Bay the company's unofficial center of operations.\n\nRelated: Waymo customer swears off autonomous driving after close call\nHowever, the company recently experienced a significant issue in its hometown.\nIn a viral video from No Safe Words on X ( formerly Twitter ), it looked like an endless line of Waymos had taken over one city street on Nov. 22. The company says the vehicles were all headed to a “mass hailing event” in the video, causing the bottleneck that was filmed.\nThis weekend, the company experienced an even more disruptive event after its San Francisco fleet was unable to navigate the terrain during a massive blackout in the city, which has a population of more than 800,000.\nWaymo was forced to suspend service in San Francisco, as apparently its vehicles did not know the \"four-way-stop\" rule that applies to intersections with inoperable traffic lights.\n\nStory Continues\nThe vehicles were filmed stuck at numerous intersections , unsure how to navigate the situation , causing even more turmoil on the roads as drivers slowly inch past electricity-less city blocks.\nA fire caused the outage, which affected 130,000 citizens in the city.\n“The sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections. This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion,” Waymo said in a statement as it temporarily shut down operations in the city.\n\nWaymo restores San Francisco service, but can it restore customer faith in the company? While Waymo suspended the service on Saturday, Dec. 20, by 7 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 21, Waymo said it was resuming service in the region.\nAs for the passengers caught in the vehicles during the disruption, Waymo says \"the majority of active trips were completed before vehicles returned to depots or pulled over,\" so at least \"the majority\" of passengers weren't left stranded.\n\nRelated: Waymo pulls ahead of Tesla Robotaxi, Amazon Zoox with latest move\nWaymo says its vehicles represent a 91% reduction in serious injury or worse crashes, a 79% decrease in airbag deployment crashes, and an 80% decrease in injury-causing crashes.\nWaymo is also safer for non-drivers, with 92% fewer pedestrian crashes resulting in injuries, 78% fewer cyclist crashes resulting in injuries, and 89% fewer motorcycle crashes resulting in injuries.\nBut good luck to Waymo convincing San Franciscans, and other Californians, about those numbers after the recent high-profile incidents in the city.\nNearly 80% of California voters support requiring a human safety operator in self-driving trucks and delivery vehicles, and just 33% of voters express a favorable general impression of autonomous vehicles.\n\n“We are increasingly bringing AI from the digital world to the physical world, and it’s critically important that we do that in a very careful and considerate way,” Rowan Stone, CEO of AI data training company Sapien, told TheStreet.\nSapien currently works with Waymo rival Zoox.\n“What we can do better as an entire industry is resist the urge to move quickly and break things, especially when you’re dealing with a hunk of metal that could potentially kill people,” he said.\nWaymo issues extend beyond San Francisco San Francisco isn't the only city where Waymo has had to temporarily pause operations in recent weeks.\nOn Dec. 1, after Waymo received its 20th citation from the Austin Independent School District for the current school year, Austin ISD decided to release the video of the previous infractions to the public.\n\nBy Dec. 5, Waymo announced that it would file for a voluntary recall after videos of the company's robotaxis committing traffic violations while operating in school bus zones went viral.\nThe Austin ISD had been in private contact with the company, but as the incidences of Waymos driving through school bus stop signs piled up (eventually averaging 1.5 per week), the Austin ISD decided to go public.\n“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” said Muaricio Peña, chief security officer for Waymo.\nBack in California, Waymos have been recorded piling up at Santa Monica charging stations at night in Southern California.\n\nA video , posted on X by Nic Cruz Patane, shows a seemingly endless line of lifeless robots waiting to be charged, is eerily similar to the video from San Francisco.\nOn Nov. 24, the city formally demanded Waymo cease overnight operations at its two local autonomous vehicle charging facilities.\nThe move comes after months of noise complaints from nearby residents, according to the Santa Monica Daily Press . The directive was unanimously approved in a 6-0 City Council vote on Nov. 18, but now the city is demanding that property owners, lessees, and operators immediately stop nighttime operations due to nuisance conditions at the two charging sites.\nResidents in the neighborhood have complained about the constant noise and disruption caused by the 24-hour operations, with some deliberately blocking the vehicles’ entry and exit. They have been bothered by everything from the legally mandated backup alarms to other vehicle noises that have become incessant.\n\nIn a statement, Waymo said it has been listening to community input and is “committed to continuing to operate and invest” in Santa Monica. It says it has adjusted operations at the site in response to community feedback and that it will continue to seek community input.\nRelated: Waymo pumps the brakes as dangerous issue comes to light\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 22, 2025, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

      "Content": "TTD vs. AMZN: Which Ad-Tech Stock Is the Smarter Buy Now?\n\nVaishali Doshi\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:08 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nDigital advertising remains one of the most attractive long-term growth markets in the technology space. According to a Grand View Research report, the global digital advertising market is expected to witness a CAGR of 15.4% from 2025 to 2030.\nBoth The Trade Desk, Inc . TTD and Amazon.com, Inc . AMZN play pivotal roles in the digital advertising ecosystem. While TTD is a pure-play ad-tech firm built around a demand-side platform (DSP), AMZN is an e-commerce and cloud giant with advertising quickly becoming one of its key revenue drivers.\n\nSince both firms have sizeable exposure to the booming connected TV (CTV) and retail media trends, this makes for an intriguing comparison for investors.\nLet us break down their fundamentals, growth prospects, market challenges and valuation to determine which offers a more compelling investment case.\nThe Case for TTD The Trade Desk has emerged as one of the leading independent DSP players in the digital advertising space. Unlike Amazon, advertising is TTD’s entire business, thereby allowing management to focus relentlessly on product innovation, customer relationships and performance improvements. Over time, this focus has translated into strong customer retention, with reported retention rates consistently above 95% in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nCTV remains a major growth driver for TTD. On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management noted that the transition toward biddable CTV is gaining rapid momentum and it expects decision CTV to become the default buying model in the future. The benefits of decision-based buying (like greater flexibility, control and performance) compared with traditional programmatic guaranteed or insertion-order models, are rendering it the logical choice for advertisers.\nStrategic partnerships with Disney, NBCU, Roku, Netflix, LG and Walmart, among others, bode well. In the third quarter, video advertising, which includes CTV, represented more than 50% share of the total business. While video remains the largest share of its business, audio is emerging as a key driver of growth.\n\nTTD had a strong balance sheet at the end of the third quarter, having cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion with no debt. Moreover, the company continues to generate healthy profitability and cash flow. The financial firepower gives TTD significant room to maneuver as it accelerates innovation, scales AI-driven capabilities and deepens its presence across global markets.\nThe Trade Desk Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\nThe Trade Desk price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Trade Desk Quote\n\nStory Continues\nThe Trade Desk is deploying resources to boost platforms like Kokai (next-generation AI-powered DSP experience) and data transparency tools like OpenPath and Sincera. Among its clients, 85% use Kokai as their default experience. This strengthens its competitive moat. TTD highlighted that Kokai delivered (on average) 26% lower cost per acquisition, 58% lower cost per unique reach and a 94% higher click-through rate compared with Solimar.\n\nWhile The Trade Desk remains a leading independent DSP, the competitive environment is intensifying. Walled gardens like Meta Platforms, Apple, Google and Amazon dominate this space as they control their inventory and first-party user data, allowing for highly targeted ad campaigns.\nThough TTD is focusing on geographic expansion, executing well across disparate markets can be complex and risky. Regulatory and privacy-related changes like the deprecation of cookies and tightening data-privacy laws like Europe’s GDPR also pose ongoing challenges. Macro volatility and higher expenses remain additional concerns.\nThe Case for AMZN Amazon’s advertising business has gradually emerged as a strong contender in the digital advertising space, leveraging its first-party data. In the third quarter of 2025, AMZN’s ad business delivered $17.6 billion in revenues, up 22% year over year, driven by its full-funnel advertising offerings. In the United States itself, advertisers can now reach an average ad-supported audience of more than 300 million across its retail marketplace, Prime Video, Twitch, Fire TV, Live sports (NFL, NASCAR, NBA), as well as third-party websites and apps.\n\nAt the center of Amazon’s advertising strategy is Amazon DSP. AMZN’s DSP platform enables advertisers to plan, activate and measure full-funnel investments. The DSP platform leverages trillions of proprietary browsing, shopping and streaming signals. These, when paired with AMZN’s wide-ranging supply-side relationships and secure clean rooms, help advertisers achieve optimization and higher ROI.\nPartnerships with Roku and Netflix and integrations with Spotify and SiriusXM bode well. Integrations with Spotify and SiriusXM offer advertisers programmatic access to more than 560 million (400 million on Spotify and 160 million on SiriusXM) monthly digital listeners across both platforms.\nLive sports on Prime Video emerged as another major driver of ad business momentum. On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, Amazon noted strong advertiser interest during upfront negotiations for 2025 and 2026, exceeding its expectations with significant growth in commitments.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nAI is playing an increasingly important role in Amazon’s advertising business. In September 2025, the company announced an agentic AI tool and creative studio capable of planning and executing the entire creative process in a matter of hours rather than weeks.\n\nAds are still a relatively small share of Amazon’s total revenue base compared with retail and AWS, meaning ample room to scale. That said, competition in CTV and DSP remains intense, and as Amazon ramps up, The Trade Desk faces growing pressure to defend its share. For investors, it is important to note that AMZN’s business diversification, especially retail, cloud and AI, with stupendous financial resources, gives it an edge and reduces reliance on one segment.\nShare Performance for TTD & AMZN\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nOver the past month, TTD shares have declined 4.6% while AMZN stock is up 0.5%, respectively.\nValuation for TTD & AMZN Both TTD and AMZN are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D and C, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month price/earnings ratio, TTD shares are trading at 17.84X, lower than AMZN's 29.02X.\nHow Do Zacks Estimates Compare for TTD & AMZN? Analysts have made marginal upward revisions for TTD’s bottom line for the current year in the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor AMZN, there is an upward revision of 4.5% for the current fiscal year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTTD or AMZN: Which Is a Smarter Bet? TTD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while AMZN is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nFor investors, Amazon stands out as the stronger pick based on. Its diversified business model spanning retail, cloud, AI and advertising provides stability and multiple growth engines, unlike TTD’s reliance on ad-tech alone.\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "‘Top Pick’ Amazon Had a Dismal Year: What’s AMZN Stock’s Forecast for 2026?\n\nMohit Oberoi\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 9:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nMSFT\n\nWith year-to-date (YTD) gains of a mere 3.6%, Amazon (AMZN) is set to underperform the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which is on track to deliver double-digit returns for the third consecutive year. Unless we see something dramatic over the next week, Amazon will end up as the worst-performing “Magnificent 7” constituent this year.\n\nWhile the coveted group did not have a roaring year with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META) underperforming the S&P 500 Index and Tesla (TSLA) only slightly nudging ahead following the recent rally, Amazon’s underperformance stands out.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nAnalysts Are Hot on the Foldable iPhone.

Sign Up Now!\nAmazon entered 2025 as a “top pick” for many brokerages—a distinction it had held for the previous couple of years. However, the stock failed to live up to expectations and is on track to underperform the broader markets by a wide margin. Notably, while Amazon shares outperformed in the preceding two years, riding the artificial intelligence (AI) mania, they underperformed in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn fact, over the last five years, AMZN is up just 43%, which is just about half of what the average S&P 500 Index constituent has delivered. Meanwhile, brokerages are quite bullish on the stock’s prospects, and BMO, TD Cowen, Wedbush, Truist, J.P. Morgan, and Evercore ISI have named Amazon as a “top idea” or equivalent for 2026.\nWhy Did Amazon's Stock Underperform in 2025? Barring brief periods, particularly following the Q3 2025 earnings release, Amazon stock underperformed peers this year. There’s a lot that’s making markets apprehensive, which is reflected in the stock’s price action. Here’s a brief overview:\nRising Competition : Amazon is facing competitive pressure from legacy brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart (WMT), as well as Temu and Shein, which have become popular with their ultra-low-cost merchandise.\nMarket Share Losses in AWS : While Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) growth has rebounded, it continues to lose market share to Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), which are growing at a much faster rate.\nCapex Taking a Toll on Cash Flows : The Amazon story was never about GAAP earnings, but the stellar cash flows that it generated. However, the burgeoning capex, particularly towards building the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, is taking a toll on the company’s free cash flows. Amazon’s trailing 12-month free cash flows plunged to $14.8 billion at the end of Q3 2025, while the corresponding numbers in 2024 and 2023 were $47.7 billion and $21.4 billion, respectively. While AI could drive Amazon’s growth and help the company lower costs, intermittent concerns over tech companies’ ability to monetize their AI investments have put pressure on their stock prices.\nImpact of AI : While AI would positively impact nearly all aspects of Amazon’s business, there are concerns that the rise of third-party AI shopping agents is a threat to Amazon’s lucrative and fast-growing digital advertising business.\n\nStory Continues\nAMZN Stock 2026 Forecast Brokerages are upbeat on Amazon’s forecast, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 56 analysts covering the stock. AMZN’s mean target price of $295.80 is 30% higher than the current price levels. The stock trades even below the most pessimistic target price of $230, while the Street-high target price of $360 represents a potential upside of 58%.\nShould You Buy Amazon Stock? While Amazon’s e-commerce growth in developed markets might have plateaued, the company should be able to bolster its growth. Amazon is doubling down on groceries and has even launched a private food brand, which would help it increase its total addressable market. Haul, which is Amazon’s platform to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, should also help the company earn additional revenues. Amazon's business-to-business (B2B) platform, Amazon Business, is another potential growth driver to watch, and it is already running at a multi-billion-dollar gross revenue run rate.\n\nPrime should also help drive Amazon’s growth next year, and we might even see the company hike prices. The company has started cracking down on Prime password sharing and should ramp up ads in 2026, which would help it increase its digital ad business.\nAMZN stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 31.7x, which looks quite tempting to me even as earnings growth might be tepid over the next couple of years on higher depreciation expenses emanating from the AI capex.\nI find Amazon among the best structural growth stories, as the company is a play on several high-potential sectors like e-commerce, cloud, streaming, digital advertising, and now even AI. I have been bullish on Amazon stock for quite some time, and while I did book some profits earlier this year, I have used the recent dip to add more shares.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: AMZN, META, AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOG.

The facility is the largest warehouse in Stord’s network and ships more than 5 million packages annually. It includes significant climate control storage, a pick mezzanine with 120,000 square feet of extra space, pallet racking and robotic automation.\n\nAtlanta-based Stord said Thursday it will lease a 525,000 square foot warehouse with 49 dock doors capable of offering a comprehensive suite of value-added services for brands, including kit assembly and embroidery. The facility is located near Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport, where Amazon and DHL Express have their primary U.S. air transport hubs and other freight airlines operate. The company also plans to outfit the building with automated handling equipment, proprietary AI-capable warehouse and transportation management systems, and other capabilities.\nThe current Hebron fulfillment center is operated by more than 300 employees and 300 contractors. Stord said order processing there during the Black Friday-Cyber Monday period doubled year over year.\n\nStord, which calls itself the Consumer Experience Company, was founded in 2015. It supports hundreds of direct-to-consumer and B2B brands, including Seed Health, Native, Jolie (shower filter), Quip (oral wellness), True Classic and Goodr (sunglasses) with $10 billion in annual gross merchandise value. Stord says it delivered more than 30 million packages to around 11.5% of U.S. homes last year.\nIn 2025, Stord raised $200 million in funding, created a partner network of outside e-commerce technology providers and acquired Ware2Go , an on-demand warehousing and fulfillment network, from UPS.\nIt recently acquired Penny Black, a startup software-as-a-service solution that provides hyper-personalized post-purchase inserts to enhance a brand experience and generate new revenue.

Shares of personal care company The Honest Company (NASDAQ:HNST) jumped 2% in the morning session after the stock's positive momentum continued as the company announced a major shift in its sales strategy, planning to halt direct sales from its website and mobile app to improve profitability.\nThis change was part of a new plan called “Transformation 2.0: Powering Honest Growth.” The strategy also involved exiting its website fulfillment and apparel operations, as well as closing its stores in Canada. The company’s stated goal was to streamline its supply chain and reduce expenses. Despite the end of direct selling, customers could still find Honest Company products at major retailers such as Walmart, Target, and Amazon.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $2.81, up 0.5% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy The Honest Company? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us The Honest Company’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 31 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was about 2 months ago when the stock dropped 24% on the news that the company reported weak third-quarter results that missed revenue expectations and lowered its full-year forecast for sales and earnings.\n\nFor the quarter, revenue fell 6.7% from the previous year to about $93 million, falling short of analyst expectations. The bigger concern for investors was the updated outlook. The Honest Company cut its full-year revenue projection from a prior estimate of 4% to 6% growth to a new range of a 3% decline to flat. In addition, the company revised its adjusted earnings (EBITDA) forecast downward to a range of $21 million to $23 million, a drop from the previous guidance of $27 million to $30 million. These results came as the company announced a new plan, called “Transformation 2.0,” aimed at simplifying its business by getting rid of less profitable products.\nThe Honest Company is down 58.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $2.81 per share, it is trading 60.2% below its 52-week high of $7.05 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of The Honest Company’s shares at the IPO in May 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $121.96.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

      "Content": "How Caterpillar Crushed the Magnificent 7 in 2025 — And It’s Not Done Yet!\n\nRich Duprey\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nQuick Read Caterpillar ( CAT ) rose 61% in 2025 to become the top Dow performer. Caterpillar outpaced six of the seven Magnificent 7 tech stocks.\nCaterpillar’s Energy and Transportation segment drove gains with Q3 power generation sales up 31% from AI data center demand.\nCaterpillar raised guidance to 5% to 7% annual sales growth through 2030 with adjusted operating margins reaching 21% to 25% at $100B sales.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate market headlines in 2025, many of the stocks most closely tied to the technology -- the Magnificent 7 stocks of Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) -- have shown volatility or lagged.\nSix of the seven have experienced mixed or negative returns at points throughout the year, with broad concerns over valuations, sector rotations, and sustainability weighing on performance. In contrast, one unexpected name has outperformed six of the seven: Caterpillar ( NYSE:CAT ), the heavy equipment manufacturer. On a total return basis (capital appreciation plus dividends), Caterpillar trails only Alphabet by about one percentage point or so as of last Friday's close. Yet less than two weeks ago, Caterpillar was even ahead of Alphabet in year-to-date gains.\n\nSo, how is a traditional industrial company easily outpacing some of the world's largest tech giants?\nCaterpillar's Strong 2025 Performance Caterpillar has risen approximately 61% in 2025 compared to Alphabet's roughly 62 % gain, leaving the heavy equipment manufacturer just behind the tech behemoth and with the potential to surpass it by year-end.\nIt also stands as the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , edging out Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) in second place, and significantly outpacing the rest of the Magnificent 7, with only Nvidia, which has returned almost 35% this year, coming close.\n\nWhat Is Doing the Heavy Lifting for Caterpillar Caterpillar's outperformance stems from strong demand in its Energy and Transportation segment, particularly generators and power equipment for AI data centers and infrastructure. Partnerships like the one with Vertiv ( NYSE:VRT ) for data center power solutions have highlighted Caterpillar's role in supporting AI growth.\nEnduring global infrastructure spending and mining demand have also contributed, but the real standout has been in power generation and oil and gas, segments that saw sales rise 31% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nTariffs posed challenges earlier in the year, with estimated costs up to $1.8 billion in 2025, but the company mitigated impacts through cost controls and pricing adjustments. Still, inflation continues to weigh on margins, with consolidated operating profits slipping 3%.\nHowever, these drivers that carried Caterpillar higher in 2025 appear sustainable into 2026, with analysts pointing to ongoing AI-related power needs and potential infrastructure rebounds. The risks of tariff escalation and cyclical slowdowns in construction or mining remain present.\n\nKey Takeaway Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar often deliver the best returns when bought during downturns to capture upside as cycles recover. Caterpillar began rising in late 2022, gained strongly in 2023, and delivered about 24% returns in 2024. In 2025, shares faltered on tariff fears in April before doubling from those lows.\n\nAt this point in the cycle, Caterpillar remains a solid holding, with tailwinds from AI infrastructure and global demand likely continuing into next year and beyond. Their strength allowed management to raise guidance for the next five years.\nCaterpillar is now expecting 5% to 7% compound annual sales growth through 2030, adjusted operating margins of 15% to 19% at $60 billion in sales and 21% to 25% at $100 billion in sales, and $6 billion to $15 billion in free cash flow—a 20% to 50% increase over prior estimates.

      "Content": "Wall Street Analysts Think Amazon (AMZN) Could Surge 30.11%: Read This Before Placing a Bet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:55 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nShares of Amazon (AMZN) have gained 3% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $227.35, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $295.8 indicates a potential upside of 30.1%.\n\nThe average comprises 54 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $230.00 to a high of $360.00, with a standard deviation of $24.81. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 1.2% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 58.4% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\nWhile the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.\n\nHowever, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in AMZN. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\n\nStory Continues\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\nHere's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in AMZN There has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0%, as one estimate has moved higher compared to no negative revision.\nMoreover, AMZN currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .\nTherefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much AMZN could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Where Will UPS Stock Be in 1 Year?\n\nLee Samaha, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: UPS\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points UPS is reducing Amazon deliveries, which will lower volume but potentially boost profits.\nSMB market growth remains uncertain due to new tariffs and shifting supply chains.\nDividend sustainability is in question, with a possible need for cash reserves or debt.\n10 stocks we like better than United Parcel Service ›\n\nThe outlook for United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) is not straightforward. The company is set to see some major changes over the next year, but the real question for investors is how much it will change, what will happen to the share price, and what the dividend, now yielding 6.5%, will look like. Here are the main factors to keep an eye on.\nTwo key things to look out for with UPS in 2026 I will focus on the U.S. domestic package segment, as it accounts for over half of UPS's earnings and is typically the swing factor in those earnings. It's also the segment undergoing significant change in 2026. The two major factors to focus on in 2026:\nThe deliberate reduction in Amazon delivery volumes will contribute to a decrease in delivery volumes overall but should increase revenue per piece, hopefully leading to margin expansion and a profit increase\nThe small- and medium-size business (SMB) market is a key end market for UPS, and it's unclear whether SMBs have yet felt the full weight of tariffs on their operations.\n\nVolume, revenue, profits, and customer prospects are essential at all times, but particularly so when the company appears to be facing a significant challenge in supporting its $5 dividend payment. As a reminder, the Wall Street analyst consensus calls for just $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion in free cash flow (FCF) for UPS in 2026 and 2027, respectively. These figures indicate UPS would need to dip into cash reserves or issue debt to support the dividend.\nWhile UPS could muddle through and sustain the dividend, there are significant questions about whether this is actually the best use of shareholder resources, and it doesn't leave the company much room for error.\nLower delivery volumes, higher profit? Management plans to reduce Amazon deliveries (focusing on low- or negative-margin deliveries) by 50% from the start of 2025 to the second half of 2026. The move makes perfect sense and aligns with management's strategy of tailoring its network for more productive deliveries rather than chasing volume growth in its own right.\nAs UPS shifts to more productive deliveries, delivery volumes are dropping, while revenue per package is rising. In 2025, volumes are falling, but higher revenue per package helps offset the lower total volume.\n\nStory Continues\nFor clarity, the segment's adjusted operating profit decreased by 1.4% and 1.5% year over year in the second and third quarters, respectively. The drop in volumes is not due only to fewer Amazon deliveries; the market has also been weaker than expected this year because tariffs have negatively affected trade.\nSimply put, UPS investors hope that falling volumes (blue bars above) will be offset by higher revenue per package (red bars), which could lead to increased revenue (yellow bars) and improved profits in 2026.\nThe SMB market in 2026 Alongside healthcare, the SMB market is a focus for UPS, particularly through its Digital Access Program (DAP), which enables SMBs to access the pricing and shipping options of large enterprises.\nAlthough SMB daily volume declined by 2.2% in the third quarter compared to the same period of last year, it rose as a share of total U.S. volume to 32.8% from 29.4% in the third quarter of 2024. Management's long-term aim is to get it to 40%.\n\nThe outlook for SMBs in 2026 is still uncertain. UPS CEO Carol Tomé is cautious, saying on a recent earnings call that \"next year is when you're going to feel the full brunt of some of these tariffs hitting some of these SMBs.\"\nThis makes sense. Tariffs began in 2025, but SMBs will feel the full impact in 2026, since many have used up the inventory they purchased before the tariffs. Now tariffs also apply to countries like Vietnam and Thailand, where SMBs have turned for supplies instead of China. Moreover, SMBs attempted to pass on price increases in 2025, but it remains unclear whether this will be successful in 2026.\nUPS in one year? The company will improve strategically by reducing Amazon volume. Still, the wild card of SMB volume creates uncertainty, and not least for a company struggling to generate the FCF to cover its dividend. One outcome is a dividend cut, followed by a recovery in the stock price once management resets expectations.\n\nAlternatively, management has the financial resources to maintain the dividend. That will please income-focused investors, even if it's not necessarily what growth-oriented shareholders might want.\nShould you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?

      "Content": "Wall Street Analysts See Amazon (AMZN) as a Buy: Should You Invest?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nThe recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon (AMZN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.16, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 57 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.16 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 57 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 50 are Strong Buy and five are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87.7% and 8.8% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN Check price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs AMZN a Good Investment? In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $7.17.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "After pouring $450 million into Florida real estate, Larry Ellison plans to lure the ultrarich to an exclusive town just minutes from Mar-a-Lago\n\nMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:19 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nAMZN\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nOracle cofounder Larry Ellison is helping raise the profile of the 400-resident island town of Manalapan, Fla. The multibillionaire has already made a cumulative $450 million real estate investment in the town and has taken over its biggest structure, the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa, which offers memberships to town property owners without initiation fees or dues.\n\nKnown for his tech feats as cofounder and chief technology officer of Oracle, Larry Ellison is instead flexing his developer experience in South Florida as he pours millions of dollars into real estate and helps transform an exclusive island town 20 minutes from Mar-a-Lago into a haven for the mega-rich.\nThe world’s fifth-wealthiest man started buying properties in the 400-resident town of Manalapan, Fla., in 2022, and since then has pumped $450 million into two landmark properties, Bloomberg reported. Ellison set a Florida record for the purchase of a $173 million estate spanning 16 acres that includes both beachfront and lakefront property. And in August 2024, he paid $277 million for the town’s biggest structure, a hotel with more than 300 rooms, the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe hotel stands on the grounds of the original La Coquille Club, which in the 1950s reportedly hosted the Duke and Duchess of Windsor as well as members of the Ford and Vanderbilt families. In the ’80s the original club was razed, but it still exists in name and is part of what is now the Eau Palm Beach hotel. Manalapan property owners can become members of the beach club without paying initiation fees or annual dues, according to the Town of Manalapan’s website .\nFor years, the ultrarich have increasingly homed in on Florida properties. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has bought three properties on the Florida island Indian Creek, near Miami. Ken Griffin, the founder and CEO of investment firm Citadel, has also spent an estimated $450 million over the years amassing a 25-acre spread in Palm Beach.\n\nIn Manalapan, several beachfront homes along the same road as Ellison’s property have sold for tens of millions of dollars, according to Zillow . Yet, Manalapan’s Mayor John Deese told Fortune that the recent high-price purchases as well as Ellison’s investments in the town are more than welcome.\n“Manalapan has for many years been one of the highest-ranked communities in terms of home sales prices in the United States. The recent sales have just added to the overall success of the real estate market in South Florida. We feel very fortunate that Mr. Ellison and others chose Manalapan for their residential and commercial property investments,” Deese said in an email.\n\nStory Continues\nEllison’s purchase of the Eau Palm Beach hotel now serves as a prime attraction for high-net-worth potential buyers. Stewart Satter, the local developer of a recently listed $285 million mansion adjacent to Ellison’s property in Manalapan, said Ellison’s plans for the hotel could become a focal point of the area.\n\n“The hotel has the potential to be an extraordinary property in the town,” Satter told Bloomberg. “And Ellison certainly has a reputation for operating some beautiful resorts.”\nEllison purchased the majority of the Hawaiian island of Lanai in 2012 for an estimated $300 million. Through his company, Pulama Lanai, he has remodeled the island’s two Four Seasons resort hotels and received praise for new, ultraluxe touches. Among the additions debuted in 2016 at the Four Seasons Resort Lanai were a $21,000-per-night Alii Royal Suite, as well as grotto-style pools and iPad Air devices in every room to order room service and housekeeping, among other amenities, according to SFGate .\nAt the Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa, Ellison has also promised renovations. One of the first changes was a pop-up Nobu restaurant that later became a permanent replacement for the Polpo Palm Beach restaurant formerly located in the space, according to a spokesperson for the hotel.\n\nNobu appears to be a favorite of Ellison’s. He and Tesla CEO Elon Musk brought Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang there last year to beg him for more GPUs. Ellison said he picked up the tab.\nAnother draw of Manalapan and the surrounding areas is the proximity to Mar-a-Lago, President Trump’s “Winter White House,” where he often spends weekends, according to Palm Beach County Commissioner Maria Sachs.\n“Every place in that area is having a moment because of Donald Trump,” Sachs told Bloomberg. “You are so close to Mar-a-Lago, you can get a membership, and everyone knows that he’s very public there.”\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on March 21, 2025 .\nMore on real estate: In a frozen luxury housing market, buyers are asking to ‘ try before they buy ’ and having sleepovers in multimillion-dollar mansions\nGen Z is defiantly ‘ giving up ’ on ever owning a home and is spending more than saving, working less, and making risky investments, study shows\nA ‘ new era ’ in the housing market is about to begin as affordability finally improves ‘for the first time in a bunch of years,’ economist says\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAmazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this online retailer have returned +3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.97 per share, indicating a change of +5.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.17 points to a change of +29.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.85 indicates a change of +9.5% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $211.29 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.5%. The $713.69 billion and $794.2 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.9% and +11.3%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Amazon reported revenues of $180.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.4%. EPS of $1.95 for the same period compares with $1.43 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $177.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.29%. The EPS surprise was +23.42%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Is Amazon One of the Best Stocks to Buy for 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:43 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Amazon's stock entered the year at a premium valuation.\nGrowth at its AWS segment has been reaccelerating.\nAdvertising is a key part of Amazon's profitability.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a poor stock to own in 2025. The stock is essentially flat for the year, which is disappointing because the S&P 500 is up around 14%. With 2025 being a disappointing year, investors are hoping that 2026 could be a comeback year.\nHowever, hope isn't an investment strategy; we need real results that will help turn Amazon's stock around. I think Amazon's stock is primed for a good 2026, and I've got a few reasons to back that up.\nAmazon's stock was expensive entering 2025 First, let's diagnose what went wrong with Amazon's stock in 2025. If you look at Amazon's growth, there is nothing wrong with it\nOutside of one quarter, Amazon's revenue growth was in the low double-digits, which is expected from a mature business. Its operating income growth did slow, but Amazon's efficiency measures were delivering impressive results last year, and those elevated growth rates could never last forever.\n\nValuing Amazon's stock using operating income is a wise idea, as it has substantial investments in other companies that can cause its diluted earnings per share (EPS) metric to rise and fall even if it hasn't realized gains or losses on its investments. From a price-to-operating income standpoint, Amazon's valuation has come down throughout 2025.\nWhile 30 times operating income isn't necessarily cheap, it isn't far off from its peers. Others like Alphabet and Microsoft trade for 28 and 26 times operating profits, so Amazon isn't overly expensive. With its valuation coming down to a somewhat normal level, Amazon's stock is free to deliver returns in line with business growth, and 2026 is shaping up to be a strong year.\n\nAmazon's most important business unit isn't commerce Most people think about Amazon's sprawling e-commerce site, but that's not the profit driver in the company. Instead, Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing wing, drives most of the profits. In Q3, 66% of operating income came from AWS, despite making up 18% of revenue. AWS also grew revenue at a 20% pace in Q3 -- the fastest rate in multiple years. This bodes well for 2026, as AWS is starting to capture more AI workloads, especially with its new chip.\n\nWhile many AI companies are using Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to train and run AI models, competitors are starting to launch alternatives, including Amazon. Amazon recently unveiled its Trainium3 chips, which helped generative AI companies like Anthropic dramatically reduce their costs. It estimates that Trainium3 chips created an AI video four times faster at half the cost of a GPU. That's just one scenario, but it shows that Amazon's chips are impressive and can compete at the highest level.\n\nStory Continues\nAnother area to watch is advertising. Amazon's advertising service has been a monster over the past few years and has grown to become one of its largest segments. Although Amazon doesn't break out advertising's profitability as it does with AWS, it's fairly obvious that this is a high-margin division, as there are several companies that get the majority of their revenue from ads, like Alphabet. In Q3, ad revenue grew 24% year over year. If it keeps up this growth in 2026, it will continue driving outsized profit growth for Amazon.\n\nAds and AWS may be a smaller dollar figure of Amazon's total, but they account for the majority of Amazon's profits. As long as these two continue posting incredible results, I'll be bullish on Amazon's stock. I think Amazon is due for a comeback in 2026, and these two will be the primary reasons why Amazon's stock is a great buy now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "BMO Capital Raises AWS (AMZN) Growth Forecast as AI Demand and Claude Adoption Intensify\n\nMaham Fatima\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:42 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is one of the best growth stocks to buy in 2026 . On December 16, BMO Capital raised the firm’s price target on Amazon.com to $304 from $300 with an Outperform rating on the shares. Based on feedback from former AWS executives, BMO Capital reported that cloud commitments are intensifying and developers are increasingly gravitating toward the Claude model. With enterprise AI expected to scale by 2027, the firm boosted its assumed AWS growth rate from 23% to 24%.\n\nIn other news, on December 9, Amazon announced a massive $35 billion investment in India to be deployed through 2030. This new capital builds upon the $40 billion the company has already invested since entering the market in 2010, bringing its total planned commitment to $75 billion. The strategy is built on three central pillars: AI-driven digitization, expanding export growth, and large-scale job creation.\nAccording to an Economic Impact Report by Keystone Strategy released at the summit, Amazon’s operations have already digitized 12 million small businesses and enabled $20 billion in cumulative e-commerce exports. By 2030, the company aims to quadruple its export impact to $80 billion and bring the benefits of artificial intelligence to 15 million small businesses. To support this, Amazon is launching tools like Seller Assistant and Next Gen Selling, while enhancing customer experiences through Lens AI and the conversational assistant Rufus. With this new investment, Amazon also expects to support 3.8 million jobs by 2030, which includes the creation of 1 million new opportunities.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores in North America and internationally.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Volatility decay eroded 20 percentage points beyond what 2x leverage predicts.\nThe fund holds just 13.57% in direct Amazon equity. Daily rebalancing of derivatives creates compounding drag that destroys long-term returns.\nAmazon gained 3.63% year-to-date but AMZU lost 13.99%. This 21-percentage-point shortfall stems from daily leverage resets during choppy markets.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nDirexion Daily AMZN Bull 2X Shares ( NYSEARCA:AMZU ) offers 200% daily exposure to Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), but its mechanics reveal why it's designed for short-term traders, not income investors. Understanding how AMZU generates distributions and its structural risks is critical before investing.\nHow AMZU Generates Income AMZU doesn't generate income through traditional dividends. It uses derivatives, swaps, and daily rebalancing to achieve 200% exposure to Amazon's daily price movements. When Amazon pays a dividend, AMZU receives the distribution amplified through leverage, but at significant cost. The ETF paid a $1.20 special dividend in December 2025, but this must be evaluated against substantial NAV erosion from volatility decay.\nThe fund holds only 13.57% in direct Amazon equity, with the remainder in derivatives for daily 2x leverage. This structure resets leverage daily, creating compounding drag that destroys long-term returns even when the underlying stock performs well.\nThis infographic explains the mechanics, use cases, and inherent risks of holding the AMZU ETF, emphasizing its short-term tactical trading purpose over long-term investing.\nThe Devastating Math of Leverage Decay While Amazon declined 1.64% over the past year, AMZU lost 23.15% - nearly 20 percentage points beyond what 2x leverage predicts. The S&P 500 gained 12.63% and the Nasdaq-100 surged 20.70% over the same period.\n\nYear-to-date through December 2025, Amazon gained 3.63%, which should theoretically produce a 7.26% return for AMZU. Instead, the fund lost 13.99% - a 21-percentage-point shortfall from volatility decay. This occurs because daily resets lock in losses during choppy markets. When Amazon drops 2% one day and rises 2% the next, AMZU doesn't return to breakeven due to compounding effects.\n\nRecent volatility illustrates the problem. In December 2025, Amazon experienced multiple 3-4% daily swings, with intraday ranges exceeding $7. On December 17, the stock dropped 4.4%. These moves amplify decay as AMZU rebalances derivatives at the worst times.\n\nStory Continues\nDistribution Sustainability and Total Return Reality While AMZU's $1.20 special dividend might seem attractive, total return matters more. High yield means nothing if the ETF price collapses. Since inception in September 2022, AMZU has consistently underperformed its theoretical 2x target during volatile periods.\nAmazon's fundamentals remain strong—Q3 2025 revenue of $180.2 billion and net income of $21.2 billion both beat estimates. AWS sales grew 20%, and the company maintains 24.3% return on equity with a healthy balance sheet. However, these positives don't translate to AMZU performance due to daily resets.\n\nThe ETF's $321.5 million in assets and limited three-year track record provide insufficient data for long-term distribution patterns. The structure guarantees volatility will erode returns over extended periods, making dividend sustainability irrelevant when capital losses exceed income received.\nA Better Alternative for Leveraged Exposure For leveraged technology exposure without single-stock concentration risk, ProShares UltraPro QQQ ( NASDAQ:TQQQ ) offers better diversification. TQQQ provides 3x daily exposure to the Nasdaq-100 Index, including Amazon alongside 99 other leading technology companies.\nTQQQ generates income from dividends across the entire Nasdaq-100. The fund's $24 billion asset base and track record since 2010 provide more reliable performance data. While TQQQ still suffers from volatility decay inherent to leveraged ETFs, diversification across 100 stocks creates smoother daily movements than AMZU's single-stock concentration. For tactical traders seeking short-term leveraged exposure, TQQQ's broader base and deeper liquidity make it more practical than betting 200% on Amazon alone.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "These AI Stocks Could Still Deliver Big Upside in December and Beyond\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Nvidia still can't keep up with demand for its data center GPUs.\nAfter a tepid stock performance in 2025, Amazon is looking to bounce back in 2026.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator chips are growing in popularity with hyperscalers.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nAlthough we're nearly at the end of a year during which the S&P 500 gained a strong 16%, there are still plenty of stocks that look like top-tier buys. Some of the biggest names in the market have retreated from their recent highs, and I think investors should consider scooping them up before 2026 arrives. At the top of my last-minute shopping list are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) .\nNvidia Nvidia has been the poster child for the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout since it began. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the computing power for the vast majority of AI workloads today, but investors are worried about two things.\nFirst, they are concerned that there is a general bubble in the AI space. However, with all of the hyperscalers having announced that 2026 will be another year of record-setting capital expenditures, I don't see that thesis as valid. Second, some are worried that Nvidia's dominance in the AI accelerator chip niche is slipping. While there have been several promising product launches from its competitors, Nvidia's GPUs are still the top option. In its earnings release for its fiscal 2026 third quarter, which ended Oct. 26, CEO Jensen Huang stated that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs.\n\nThis is a company that brought in $57 billion in revenue during Q3, and it's clear that it could have made more if it had more chips to sell, so it's hard to say Nvidia's dominance is slipping with a straight face.\nWith Nvidia's stock price down nearly 20% from its all-time high and Wall Street analysts expecting the chipmaker's revenue to grow by 48% next year, I can think of few better buys heading into 2026.\nAmazon Amazon stock is essentially flat for the year. However, some recent events have me bullish about it as we prepare to enter 2026.\nFirst, its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, delivered 20% revenue growth rate in Q3 -- its best rate in years -- showing that it's resurging as the go-to place to bring workloads online. Second, growth in Amazon's advertising service business is also reaccelerating. This segment has become a major part of the company's business over the past few years.\nI think Amazon's stock will come roaring back in 2026, and it will be on the backs of these two important business units.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Broadcom is up by an incredible 40% or so year to date. However, it was previously even higher: The stock sold off heavily after a poorly received earnings report.\nIn its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ended Nov. 2, revenues grew by 28% as diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose 37%. Its AI semiconductor business was a bright spot, with revenue rising 74% year over year. Management expects this trend to continue into Q1, forecasting that its AI semiconductor revenue will more than double. That all sounds impressive, but the stock sold off in part due to revenue timing.\n\nBroadcom told investors that some of its customers wouldn't be purchasing some of their custom AI chips until 2027 and beyond. That was a letdown for investors, and many headed for the exit. As a result, Broadcom's stock is down by more than 20% from its all-time high.\nFollowing the sell-off, Broadcom's stock now trades for about 32 times expected forward earnings.\nConsidering the monster AI-related growth the company expects over the next few years, I think this is a great price to pay for Broadcom's stock. Its AI semiconductor revenue will continue to rise throughout 2026, which will eventually get the market excited about the stock again. But until it does, the stock looks like a great value.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Cloud Company Could Be the Next Amazon of the 2030s\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nCRWV\n\nKey Points Amazon's success can be tied to cloud computing.\nCoreWeave is focusing on AI cloud computing.\nCoreWeave has a long way to go before turning a profit.\n10 stocks we like better than CoreWeave ›\nWhen most people think of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , they think of its sprawling e-commerce business. That shouldn't be surprising, as it's the part that most people interact with weekly (sometimes daily). However, the e-commerce part of Amazon's business isn't what has made it a successful investment in recent years.\n\nIts cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has been a huge reason for its success. However, cloud computing isn't unique to Amazon, and there are several other viable competitors in this space, including one upstart that could be well-positioned to thrive over the next few years. Could this company become the Amazon of the 2030s? Let's take a look.\nAmazon isn't as focused on AI as CoreWeave is The company that has the potential to be the Amazon of the 2030s in the cloud realm is CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) . CoreWeave operates in the cloud computing industry, but is focused on clients that need artificial intelligence computing power. This changes what computing units are most appropriate for users and how the infrastructure is set up when its sole purpose is AI workloads, and CoreWeave is delivering.\n\nAmazon and its peers in the cloud realm also have AI-specific offerings, but CoreWeave's rapid growth shows that it's doing something right. It has major clients like OpenAI, Microsoft , and Meta Platforms , and expects its monster growth to continue in the future. During Q3, CoreWeave's revenue rose 134% year over year to $1.4 billion. That's a drop in the bucket compared to what's coming, as CoreWeave has a $55.6 billion revenue backlog from contracts that it has signed. Forty percent of that revenue is expected to be realized over the next 24 months.\nCoreWeave's revenue totaled $4.3 billion over the past 12 months. If it realizes 40% of its backlog in the next two years, that would indicate $22.2 billion in revenue. This indicates that CoreWeave's revenue will nearly double each of the next two years (just shy of $8 billion in 2026 and $16 billion in 2027).\n\nThat's exciting growth that investors love to see, and it could propel CoreWeave to duplicate Amazon's impressive performance over the next few years. However, there's one catch.\nCoreWeave's capital expenditure costs are mind-boggling It's no secret that data centers and the cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) that go into them are expensive. As the old saying goes you need to spend money to make money, but CoreWeave is taking that to the max. Despite generating $4.3 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, it spent nearly $10 billion on capital expenditures.\n\nStory Continues\nThat doesn't include the costs to pay employees or electricity to run the data center, so it's clear that CoreWeave is losing a ton of money. This is a huge problem, as the lifespans of GPUs may be as short as one year when run in hard use cases like AI training.\nThe only way CoreWeave becomes the next AWS is if it becomes profitable, which may be a few years from now. CoreWeave must continue signing new clients to its servers in order to maintain investor interest; otherwise, it may have a tough time finding capital to fund its buildings if it keeps losing money.\n\nWhile I love the cloud computing business model and believe CoreWeave could be successful in the future, I want to see further progress toward profitability before I invest. There are far too many great opportunities to invest in right now, like those providing the computing units, that are profitable and are still growing at a rapid pace. CoreWeave hasn't come close to profitability, and until it does, I think investors are better off investing elsewhere.\nShould you invest $1,000 in CoreWeave right now?

      "Content": "Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of Amazon.com Inc\n\nGuruFocus News\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2025-12-22, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $188.41. It's currently trading at a price of $227.35. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -20.67%. The company is fair valued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.03\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n35.51\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n15.1\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n188.41\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $11.33. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -1906.62%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Should You Worry About an AI Bubble in 2026? Evidence is Piling Up, and Here's What it Shows.\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Investors see AI as the next game-changing technology, and this has helped many AI stocks soar.\nBut in recent weeks, some investors have started to worry about the possibility of an AI bubble forming.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nInvestors always are on the lookout for the next big thing. And over the past few years, this has been artificial intelligence (AI). The technology has promised to transform processes and operations as well as spark game-changing discoveries -- and the idea is that all of this could lead to massive earnings growth across the corporate world. Some companies, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon , already are generating billions of dollars in revenue thanks to AI.\n\nAnd that's why investors have piled into these players, driving the S&P 500 to what soon may be three straight double-digit annual gains. But in recent times, some investors have worried about the enormous spending levels at certain AI companies, as well as the high valuations of stocks. This has led to a pullback among AI stocks and other growth companies.\nNow, as you think of what's ahead in 2026, should you worry about an AI bubble? The evidence is piling up, and here's what it shows.\nThe AI boom so far First, let's consider what's unfolded so far in this AI boom . Companies have understood that by applying AI to their operations, they may gain in efficiency or set themselves up to make new discoveries. This has prompted them to turn to sellers of AI products and services for the tools they need to harness the power of AI. Players like Nvidia sell the world's top chips, and cloud businesses from Amazon Web Services to Microsoft 's Azure offer these and other systems to customers.\n\nCompanies aiming to use AI also might turn to software players with platforms that allow them to apply the technology to their businesses -- Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), offering software that aggregates and analyzes data, is a perfect example of this. And then you'll find others, such as SoundHound AI , that specialize in developing one particular area of AI -- in this case, it's voice AI that can be used to take orders at a restaurant or for communications with your car.\nAll of these companies, selling AI products and services, have seen explosive revenue growth, but they've also had to heavily invest to keep up with demand and continue innovating.\nInvestors' big concern As mentioned, AI players across the board have seen their share prices soar in recent years due to optimism about AI-driven growth. But investors have started to worry that, in some cases, future earnings won't justify the spending and stock prices we're seeing today.\n\nStory Continues\nThe S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio, a measure of stock prices in relation to earnings over a 10-year period, has climbed to a high it's only reached once before throughout its history. And that other time was before the dot-com bubble burst.\nSo, stocks clearly have become expensive, and this is something that happens before a bubble deflates. But before declaring that a bubble is here, it's important to consider additional clues. An important one is that companies driving the AI revolution aren't small or new players, as was the case during the dot-com boom. Today, companies with the financial strength to invest, such as Nvidia or Meta Platforms , are leading the charge. Meta has the resources to invest in growth and continue paying a dividend to shareholders. And cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft have been profitable for years.\nAnother element to consider is that major players have been growing revenue and net income quarter after quarter, and demand for their AI services has been extremely strong. Palantir is a great example of this.\nOf course, there still is the risk that AI won't take off to the extent that analysts expect, and that certain companies will have spent too much considering the actual revenue opportunity.\nAn AI bubble? So, what does all of this evidence suggest about the possibility of an AI bubble in 2026? It shows us a few things. First, the fact that this boom is led by market-powerhouses with long track records of profitability makes it less fragile than the dot-com boom. Second, the earnings growth and level of demand for AI remain positive signs for the future. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang recently said today's situation doesn't look like a bubble.\n\nOne risk is that certain companies may overspend, though I would expect a tech giant to carefully pace spending and monitor demand so that any overspend wouldn't be catastrophic. And, as I said above, it's true that valuations have reached high levels -- some companies may grow into their valuations, while some may not.\nAll of this suggests that, in 2026, we might not see an actual AI bubble bursting -- but we could start to see the emergence of AI winners and losers. And while even the strongest AI players may experience turbulence here and there, they should go on to deliver growth over time.\nFor you as an investor, to win in such an environment, it's key to buy quality players that have the financial strength to develop and grow, pick them up for good prices, and hold on for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "$7.7 Billion of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Is Invested in 2 Quantum Computing Stocks\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Buffett owns two quantum computing stocks -- Alphabet and Amazon.\nBoth companies focus on much more than just quantum computing, of course.\nAlphabet and Amazon are good picks for other investors, too.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nNobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Richard Feynman once stated, \"No one understands quantum mechanics.\" I mention Feynman's quote because many investors are excited about quantum computing stocks these days – and quantum computing is based on the principles of (you probably guessed it) quantum mechanics.\n\nThat leads me to another quote, in this case a statement made by Warren Buffett: \"Never invest in a business you cannot understand.\" Buffett has also written about only investing in companies within your \"circle of competence.\"\nWith all of this in mind, you might think that Buffett wouldn't touch a quantum computing stock with a 10-foot pole. However, $7.7 billion of his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio is invested in two quantum computing stocks.\nBuffett's two quantum computing stocks Has Buffett quietly bought shares of D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) , IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) , or Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) ? Nope. I doubt that he'd give any of these up-and-coming quantum computing stocks a second of his attention. However, the legendary investor has acquired shares in two other companies that are investing heavily in quantum computing.\n\nIn 2019, Berkshire initiated a new position in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . Buffett later acknowledged that one of the conglomerate's two investment managers decided to buy Amazon. But Buffett also admitted that he had been \"an idiot\" for not investing in the company earlier.\nAmazon is a bigger player in quantum computing than you might think. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers Amazon Braket, a cloud service that allows researchers to test quantum computing algorithms, test quantum hardware, and develop quantum software. Amazon also introduced its Ocelot quantum computing chip earlier this year. Ocelet supports quantum error reduction by up to 90%.\nBuffett has also expressed regret for not investing in Google's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , earlier. He corrected that mistake in 2025. Berkshire bought over 17.8 million shares of the tech giant.\n\nAlphabet's Google Quantum AI is another pioneer in the field of quantum computing. In 2019, the unit developed a quantum system that performed a calculation in 200 seconds that it said \"would have taken the best-known algorithms in the most powerful supercomputers at the time 10,000 years to accomplish.\" Google Quantum AI also demonstrated the first logical qubit prototype in 2023.\n\nStory Continues\nMore than quantum computing Today, Berkshire's stakes in these two quantum computing stocks amount to around $7.7 billion. However, Buffett and his team didn't buy shares of Amazon or Alphabet because of their quantum computing initiatives. I doubt that the companies' quantum computing efforts even factored into the investing decisions at all.\n\nAmazon's dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing was a significant attraction for Berkshire when it first invested in the company in 2019. Over six years later, Amazon remains the No. 1 player in both markets.\nAlphabet is, at its heart, an advertising company. Ads on Google Search, YouTube, the Google Network, and other apps generate roughly 72% of Alphabet's total revenue. While Buffett may not fully understand quantum computing and other advanced technologies, he certainly has a firm grasp of advertising.\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet offer more than their core businesses, though. For example, Amazon is preparing to launch a satellite internet service. Google Cloud is a key growth driver for Alphabet. Also, the company's famous \"other bets\" include self-driving car leader Waymo and high-speed internet provider GFiber.\n\nAre Alphabet and Amazon good stocks to buy? Don't buy Alphabet and Amazon just because Buffett owns the stocks. However, I think both are good picks for many investors.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) presents a massive tailwind for AWS and Google Cloud. Amazon and Google should especially profit as the adoption of agentic AI grows. Both giants have significant opportunities in the robotaxi market.\n\nBuffett's two quantum computing stocks are more than just investments in quantum computing. However, I think Alphabet and Amazon could be big winners as quantum computing advances – whether you understand the technology or not.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Meet the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Pays More Dividends Than Any Other S&P 500 Company. Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

      "Content": "Alphabet vs. Amazon: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:52 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Alphabet was able to change investor perception in 2025, leading to huge gains in the stock.\nAmazon has the same opportunity to do that in 2026.\nBoth stocks trade at attractive valuations.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nTwo of the big three cloud computing companies are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . While both Google Cloud and AWS (Amazon Web Services) have seen solid growth, Alphabet's stock far outpaced Amazon's in 2025, climbing nearly 60% as of this writing, versus a modest gain for Amazon.\nLet's look at which stock is set to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Alphabet Alphabet has been one of the best-performing mega-cap tech stocks in 2025, largely because it was able to flip the script from being viewed as an AI loser to perhaps having the potential to be one of the biggest AI winners. While the company turned in some strong numbers, its performance was much more about changing perceptions.\n\nIt did this largely through the advancements with its Gemini foundational large language model (LLM) and custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips. Gemini has become one of the best LLMs in the market today, and Alphabet has infused it throughout its products, including its core search business. AI-powered features, like AI Overviews, AI Mode, and Lens, have helped the company accelerate its search revenue, while its Gemini stand-alone app has also gained traction.\nAt the same time, its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) have become increasingly viewed as one of the top alternative AI chips to Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips are in their seventh generation, and Alphabet uses them to power much of its internal workloads, giving it a huge structural cost advantage. Meanwhile, the chips are so highly regarded that Anthropic has committed to buying $21 billion worth of them next year.\n\nAs time progresses, the advantage Alphabet has of owning both top-notch AI chips and a top-tier LLM should only widen, as it creates a powerful flywheel that will make both better over time.\nThe case for Amazon While Alphabet was able to change investor perceptions this year, Amazon was not. However, the company could now be in a similar spot to where Alphabet was heading into 2025.\nMuch of Amazon's lackluster recent performance can be tied to the growth of AWS, which trails that of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. However, Amazon saw AWS revenue growth accelerate to 20% last quarter, and the company said it was capacity-constrained. As such, it's boosting its capital expenditure (capex) budget to try to meet growing demand.\n\nStory Continues\nAt the same time, the data center that it built for Anthropic, featuring its custom Trainium chips, is still ramping up. It is also in talks with OpenAI about making an investment in the company, where OpenAI would start to use some of its AI chips. The two companies already signed a $38 billion cloud computing deal, although that was to use Nvidia GPUs.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon's e-commerce business is really clicking. The company is seeing huge operating leverage come from its robotics and AI investments, while its high-margin sponsored ad business is growing quickly from a large base. This could be seen in its third-quarter results, as its North America revenue rose 11%, while its segment adjusted operating income soared 28%.\nThe verdict Alphabet and Amazon are two of my favorite stocks heading into 2026. Both stocks are trading at attractive valuations with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) of below 30 times and solid growth prospects ahead.\nI think Alphabet is going to become one of the biggest winners in AI over the long term, but for 2026, I think Amazon's stock can outperform. As AWS revenue continues to accelerate and Trainium gains some traction, Amazon can begin to shift perceptions, much like Alphabet did last year. I think that will really help power a stock that is trading well below other leading retailers like Walmart and Costco, which have forward P/Es nearing 40 times.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Buy With $1,000 for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Alphabet is considering selling its custom AI chips.\nTaiwan Semiconductor will thrive as long as AI spending stays elevated.\nAmazon is due for a comeback in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nWith 2026 quickly approaching, investors need to have a game plan for what stocks they will buy. Several interesting trends are brewing in the market, and may cause investors to think differently about how they want to invest. Still, I think some smart investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm could result in monster returns in 2026.\nThree smart stocks to buy with $1,000 right now for 2026 are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . All three of these are primed to outperform the market in 2026, making them great buys now.\nAlphabet Alphabet has been one of the best performing stocks in 2025, rising more than 60% so far. Alphabet's performance can be tied to multiple successes, including the continued dominance of its core business, Google Search; developing a leading generative AI model in Gemini; and considering selling its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to outside clients.\n\nThose are all significant developments that have answered many outstanding questions surrounding Alphabet's stock at the start of 2025, clearing the way for another successful year in 2026. Wall Street analysts expect Alphabet to grow its revenue by nearly 14% next year, which is impressive considering its business maturity. That isn't going to dramatically outperform the market, but it should be enough to propel Alphabet over the 10% threshold that many investors wish to exceed when picking individual stocks.\nAlphabet has transformed from an artificial intelligence laggard to an AI leader in 2026, and I believe that trend will continue to power the stock higher in 2026 and beyond.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Keeping up with which company is providing the best computing unit possible is exhausting. While Nvidia and its graphics processing units (GPUs) have dominated so far, other companies like Alphabet are starting to challenge its dominance. This sparring will go back and forth forever, but what won't change is where most of the chips are sourced from.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest foundry by revenue and is the primary source for high-end computing chips, such as those used in various computing units within AI data centers. As long as AI hyperscalers continue to build out their AI computing power, Taiwan Semiconductor will remain an excellent investment. With the AI hyperscalers informing investors that 2026 will be another year of record-setting capital expenditures, this thesis is on track.\n\nStory Continues\nTaiwan Semiconductor also trades for less than 23 times next year's earnings, making it the cheapest company on this list. Taiwan Semiconductor is set up for a great 2026 with all of the massive spending occurring, positioning it as a great stock to buy now.\nAmazon Amazon has had a disappointing 2025, with the stock essentially flat for the year. That's frustrating for investors, especially when stocks like Taiwan Semiconductor and Alphabet have done so well. However, this sets the stage for a comeback in 2026, especially behind the strength of its growing business units.\n\nWhile most view Amazon as an e-commerce company, that segment doesn't provide the majority of the profits. Instead, its cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services (AWS), does. In Q3, AWS generated the majority of Amazon's operating profits while growing revenue at a 20% pace. That's faster than the companywide 13% growth rate. When the most profitable business unit is also growing faster than the overall business, that's an excellent sign for investors.\nAnother area to watch is Amazon's advertising business. Amazon's ad business is the company's fastest-growing division, rising 24% in Q3. It has also grown to become a huge part of the business, allowing it to boost Amazon's margins as well.\nThe continued strength of both segments is key for 2026, and if they continue to do well, Amazon will make a comeback and be an excellent stock to buy and hold in 2026.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Amazon Could Invest $10 Billion in OpenAI. Should You Invest in AMZN Stock First?\n\nSubhasree Kar\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 11:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nIn a tech world where artificial intelligence (AI) has become the ultimate growth frontier, Amazon (AMZN) might be making one of its most audacious strategic moves yet. News is swirling that the e-commerce and cloud giant is in early talks to invest around $10 billion in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and one of the industry’s most influential AI innovators. This deal could value OpenAI at over $500 billion and further cement AI’s role in reshaping global markets. Also, there is an agreement for OpenAI to use Amazon’s custom AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon has already invested at least $8 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic and appears eager to deepen its exposure to generative AI.\nMore News from Barchart Did Nvidia Just Lose Its Spot as Wall Street’s AI Chip Darling? JPMorgan Says This ‘Overall Top Pick’ Is Better.\nThe Saturday Spread: How a Little-Known Options Strategy Targets Asymmetric Upside (ORCL, NEE, IRM)\nThe 2 Riskiest Stocks Investors Are Betting On With Over 300% Upside\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nThe talks underscore the growing importance of AI infrastructure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has developed its own AI chips for years, including Inferentia and the latest Trainium, aimed at meeting surging compute demand. On the other hand, OpenAI has made over $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments recently, partnering with chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO), and signing its first AWS contract last month for $38 billion in cloud capacity.\nThis move could redefine Amazon’s competitive posture in the cloud wars, supercharge demand for its custom AI infrastructure, and reshape expectations for future earnings.\nAbout Amazon Stock Amazon.com is a global technology and e-commerce behemoth, headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Today, the company operates across a dazzling range of businesses, cloud services via AWS, digital streaming, subscription services, advertising, physical retail, consumer electronics, and more. Its diversified growth model has placed it among the world’s most valuable public companies, with a market cap of $2.4 trillion, and it has a secure position in the Magnificent Seven (MAGS).\n\nAmazon’s stock has experienced a relatively muted performance compared with the broader market and many of its big-tech peers. Over the past 52 weeks, AMZN is up 1.82%, and year-to-date (YTD) it delivered 3.6% returns, reflecting its relatively weak performance compared with double-digit gains of the S&P 500 Index ($SPX).\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon’s stock underperformed in 2025 amid heightened investor concerns over its competitive position in the AI race and a perceived slowdown in the growth rate of its highly focused AWS division relative to rivals.\nSpecifically, while AWS continued to grow and secure large deals, its revenue growth rate was slower than that of competitors like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, leading some investors to fear Amazon was falling behind in the critical AI infrastructure push. These anxieties were compounded by the substantial capital expenditures and heavy spending Amazon committed to building out its AI infrastructure and data center capacity, which raised questions about near-term profit margins without immediately translating into faster revenue growth.\nAMZN currently trades at a premium compared to the sector median but below its own historical average at 31.7 times forward earnings.\nQ3 Results Beat Expectations Amazon released its third-quarter 2025 earnings on Oct. 30, reporting results for the period ended Sept. 30. In the quarter, the company delivered net sales of $180.2 billion, up about 13% year-over-year (YOY), above analyst expectations. The company’s North America segment grew 11% YOY to $106.3 billion, while International sales rose 14% to $40.9 billion.\n\nAWS continued to reaccelerate, growing 20% YOY to $33 billion, its fastest growth pace in several quarters and driven in part by strong demand for cloud and AI infrastructure.\nOn the profitability front, net income jumped to $21.2 billion, or $1.95 per share, up significantly from $15.3 billion, or $1.43 per share, in Q3 2024 and above the consensus estimate. Operating income remained flat at around $17.4 billion compared with the year-ago quarter. However, free cash flow decreased to $14.8 billion for the trailing twelve months, largely due to a substantial increase in capital expenditures tied to data center and infrastructure build-out.\nFor the important fourth quarter of 2025, Amazon guided net sales in a range of about $206 billion to $213 billion, implying 10% to 13% YOY growth versus Q4 2024, and projected operating income between roughly $21 billion and $26 billion, compared with $21.2 billion in Q4 2024. This guidance suggested continued expansion into the holiday season, albeit at a growth pace that is not spectacular relative to past periods.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Amazon Stock? Analysts remain upbeat, projecting EPS of $7.17 for fiscal 2025, up 30% YOY, and anticipating a further 9.5% annual increase to $7.85 in fiscal 2026.\nThis month, BMO Capital Markets raised its price target on Amazon to $304 from $300 while reiterating an “Outperform” rating, citing accelerating cloud commitments and strengthening demand trends at AWS. BMO also reaffirmed Amazon as a Top Pick, highlighting improving cloud momentum and longer-term enterprise AI adoption.\n\nAlso, TD Cowen reiterated its “Buy” rating and $300 price target on Amazon following the company’s AWS re:Invent conference, citing strong product momentum and long-term AI upside. The firm highlighted major announcements, including new Nova generative AI models, custom Trainium 3 UltraServers, and expanded agentic AI capabilities via AgentCore and QuickSuite. Updates on Zoox autonomous ride-sharing, which runs on AWS infrastructure, further reinforced confidence in Amazon’s AI ecosystem.\nWall Street is majorly bullish on AMZN. Overall, AMZN has a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 56 analysts covering the stock, 49 advise a “Strong Buy,” five suggest a “Moderate Buy,” and two analysts recommend a “Hold” rating.\nThe average analyst price target for AMZN is $295.80, indicating a potential upside of 29.8%. The Street-high target price of $360 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 58.4%.\nOn the date of publication, Subhasree Kar did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns.

But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Business\nA $1 trillion IPO looms, and Amazon may have just locked in early\n\nFaizan Farooque\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 10:47 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAmazon is increasingly aggressive and smart in its battle to acquire a greater role in AI .\nAmazon will reportedly make a huge $10 billion investment in OpenAI, which shocked Wall Street and rattled Silicon Valley. If the Reuters report is confirmed in the not-so-distant future, the deal won't simply be about getting in on the hottest name in AI.\n\nIt would mean that Amazon is willing to put real money behind its chips, cloud, and reputation, even if it has long been seen as behind in the AI arms race.\nIt's also an uncommon move for Amazon that will have ramifications for chip stocks, cloud computing, and the planned OpenAI IPO .\nAmazon's AI problem and how $10 billion could fix it Amazon is a cloud powerhouse thanks to AWS, but when it comes to high-profile AI projects, it has fallen behind Microsoft and Google.\nYears ago, Microsoft put $13 billion into OpenAI. Google is sponsoring both its own DeepMind subsidiary and its competitor Anthropic.\nAs for Amazon, people have spoken a lot about its Trainium and Inferentia chips and released services like Bedrock, but investors weren't very impressed — until now.\n\nRelated: Nvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nIf Amazon invests in OpenAI, it will get one of the world's most valuable AI workloads.\nOpenAI previously inked a $38 billion cloud agreement with AWS , but this arrangement might go much further and require OpenAI to employ Amazon's proprietary processors. That goes directly against Nvidia 's supremacy and strongly supports Trainium's claim of low cost and high performance.\nIt also has a number of strategic uses:\nGets AWS a big-name AI customer.\nShows Wall Street that Amazon's story about bespoke silicon is true.\nTells clients that Amazon is decreasing the cost of AI computing.\nPortrays Amazon as a legitimate \"AI arms dealer\" with tangible infrastructure.\nAnd the market saw it. The revelation made Amazon's stock rise, and some experts say this is when investors started to see Amazon as a real \"AI play.\"\n\nA high-stakes deal, just as the cloud gets crowded The timing couldn't be better. AWS is still the leader in cloud market share , but it is seeing more competition from Microsoft, Google, and fast-growing \"neo-cloud\" firms such as CoreWeave and Crusoe.\nBig companies, including Capital One, have voiced concerns about the escalating prices of AWS. Some people are even thinking about switching suppliers or creating their own AI infrastructure.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nBank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nBank of America sets AI stocks to buy list for 2026\n\nStory Continues\nA collaboration with OpenAI helps Amazon respond to that criticism. It sends a message: AWS isn't simply selling computing power; it's constructing the infrastructure for AI on a large scale and at a lower cost.\nWhat if OpenAI trains GPT-5 on Trainium chips instead of Nvidia processors? That's a big gain for believability.\n\nIt's also a way to protect investments. Anthropic has already gotten money from Amazon. It might now be supporting both of the top independent AI laboratories, which would guarantee its victory.\nRelated: Intel CEO deals spark controversy, debate\nMore broadly, the deal:\nStrengthens Amazon’s grip on multi-billion dollar AI workloads.\nUndermines \"single-cloud\" dependence criticism.\nAdds pressure on neo-cloud startups and rivals like Oracle.\nCould slow defections from AWS by enterprise clients concerned about cost.\nA trillion-dollar AI IPO? Amazon wants in The other side? OpenAI's plan to go public.\nOpenAI may now accept money from people who don't work for Microsoft after a big restructuring in 2025.\nAmazon entering the cap table gives it more weight, which probably raises OpenAI's value toward the projected $1 trillion IPO goal in 2026 or 2027.\nAmazon isn't only about using the cloud. It's a gamble that OpenAI will be a key player in the next tech era. And if OpenAI leverages Amazon's infrastructure to get there, that's even better.\n\nRelated: US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding\nThe acquisition does, however, pose certain dangers. Some experts are concerned about how \"circular\" these investments are: Big Tech gives money to startups, which then spend that money on Big Tech's platforms. That kind of thing has happened before in tech bubbles.\nBut Amazon's effort is plainly different in one way. It's not simply buying enthusiasm; it wants to sell the infrastructure that makes it work.\nHere’s why the deal could reshape the landscape:\nAmazon would join Microsoft as a top-tier OpenAI partner.\nOpenAI gains multi-cloud flexibility (Azure, AWS, Oracle).\nTrainium adoption could reduce Nvidia dependence.\nOpenAI gets a financial runway to delay IPO if needed.\nAmazon may lock in rights to exclusive OpenAI features.\nRelated: Box office is booming in 2025 but Netflix’s $82.7 billion surprise raises alarms\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Starbucks makes a bold move beyond coffee\n\nFernanda Tronco\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 9:33 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SBUX\n\nAMZN\n\nStarbucks has faced mounting challenges after decades as a seemingly untouchable coffee giant, in part due to its heavy focus on transactional growth at the expense of loyal customers who helped make it an iconic brand.\n\"In trying to scale faster, Starbucks has drifted away from the emotional core that built its global following,\" Amazon Business Analyst Saswat Sidhant Prusty told Coffee Intelligence .\n\nExternal pressures, including economic uncertainty, rising operational costs, a slowdown in consumer spending due to inflation , and ever-evolving industry trends, have also impacted the company's overall financial performance, mirroring the struggles faced by the broader foodservice sector.\nAfter learning from its missteps, Starbucks has begun implementing significant changes across its business through the \"Back to Starbucks\" turnaround plan, aiming to rectify its mistakes.\nThis time, however, the company is making a surprising move by expanding into an unexpected category that has nothing to do with coffee.\nStarbucks enters the fashion and beauty business Starbucks ( SBUX ) has hired Neiv Toledano as its new Head of Fashion and Beauty for the Brand Activation team. While the company has collaborated with fashion and beauty partners in the past, this newly created role is the first of its kind, since it's dedicated solely to the development of strategy and execution in the space.\n\nToledano brings her experience working with major consumer brands across social media and marketing. She previously served as a senior manager for brand marketing at E.l.f. Beauty and as a social media manager for Chipotle, according to her LinkedIn profile.\nAlthough Starbucks has launched several collaborations with fashion and beauty-related brands over the years, most have been released in its international markets. The addition of this dedicated position could signal that the company plans to further invest in these types of limited-time releases, particularly for its U.S. customers.\nStarbucks' previous partnerships with fashion and beauty Starbucks x alice + olivia: Released designer merchandise multiple times in Asia with the fashion brand.\nSource: Starbucks\nStarbucks x Vera Wang: Collaborated with the fashion designer on a limited-edition merchandise line in Asia.\nSource: MEGA Magazine\nStarbucks x FARM Rio: Launched a tropical-print merchandise collection with the Brazilian fashion brand in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America.\nSource: WWD\nStarbucks x Diane Von Furstenberg: Worked with the fashion designer on a drinkwear collection in Asia.\nSource: Starbucks\nStarbucks x Stonebrick: Partnered with the cosmetics brand to release a limited-time makeup line in Korea.\nSource: Zula\n\nStory Continues\nStarbucks' new strategy to stay relevant Starbucks' push into fashion and beauty extends beyond marketing; it is a cultural strategy aimed at strengthening its relevance by staying current with trends and fostering a deeper connection with consumers. These collaborations could help attract new audiences, increase brand visibility, and boost sales.\n\nThe move is also part of Starbucks' \"Back to Starbucks\" turnaround plan, designed to reverse declining sales by returning to its roots and creating a more personalized coffeehouse experience rather than remaining transactional.\nLimited-time merchandise releases have already proven effective for Starbucks. On November 6, the day of the Bearista launch, Starbucks' visits increased by 37.8% above the daily average for the last 12 months, outpacing even the brand's successful August Pumpkin Spice Latte debut , which drove a 23.1% spike in visits, according to Placer.ai .\nMore Starbucks News:\nStarbucks makes changes to win customers back\nStarbucks sells its second-largest business\nStarbucks unveils holiday collaboration fans have been waiting for\nEven after the initial rush, traffic remained elevated for several days as customers hunted for remaining inventory, which ultimately sold out. The sustained demand shows that the launch was more than a one-day phenomenon, prompting Starbucks to roll out a second drop.\n\n\"People lining up to pay $30 for a bear-shaped glass – albeit a super-cute one – wasn't on anyone’s bingo card this year,\" said Placer.ai Industry Expert Lila Margalit in the study. \"Even in an era of trading down, consumers are still willing to splurge on items that feel special – especially those that offer a sense of belonging to a cultural moment. Value matters, but it isn't everything.\"\nStarbucks continued to face broader challenges Despite the momentum behind these merchandise initiatives, financial recovery and regaining lost customers will take time to show results. In the meantime, Starbucks continues to face challenges as it manages high restructuring costs and ongoing sales declines .\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 , Global comparable store sales increased by 1% year over year. However, comparable store sales in North America and the U.S. remained flat, offset by a 1% decline in comparable transactions.\n\nOperating margin contracted by 1,150 basis points to nearly 3%, largely due to restructuring costs associated with Starbucks' turnaround efforts.\n\"Q4 was a milestone quarter in getting 'Back to Starbucks,' having delivered global comp growth for the first time in seven quarters,\" said Starbucks CFO Cathy Smith in the earnings report. \"We know this continues to be a multi-year turnaround. We remain focused on driving our topline while managing the costs that are within our control to deliver durable, sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value.\"\nNonetheless, traffic has shown improvement. Starbucks visits rose 0.7% year over year in the third quarter, marking the first visit growth in 2025, according to Placer.ai .\nRival chains dive into retail merchandise Other quick-service restaurant chains have also launched their own merchandise lines with exclusive collaborations and limited-time seasonal drops to diversify revenue streams, keep customers engaged, and turn fans into walking advertisements.\nRival food chains launch merchandise collections Chick-fil-A: Operates an online merchandise shop featuring apparel, accessories, home goods, and gifts.\nSource: Chick-fil-A\nMcDonald's: Runs an online merchandise shop offering apparel, accessories, and seasonal drops.\nSource: Golden Arches Unlimited\nParis Baguette: Sells branded apparel, accessories, and home goods through its online shop.\nSource: Paris Baguette\nRelated: Starbucks closes more stores in a key market\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Restaurants section.

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index.

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds in 2025 . Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) on December 18 and set a $303 price target. The analyst based the rating on the company’s solid position in cloud computing and AI, citing Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported discussions for the investment of over $10 billion in OpenAI. This strategic move is aimed at expanding AI workloads on AWS, deepening AI collaboration, and reflecting the capabilities of the company’s Trainium chips.\nPost also highlighted the recent AI-focused leadership changes that took place in the company, and considers the appointment of Peter DeSantis to oversee AGI Labs as a significant step to boost internal model innovation and customer silicon development, as DeSantis’s track record in launching and scaling AWS infrastructure should allow accelerated progress in AI offerings, according to the analyst.\n\nPost further stated that while he acknowledges the unlikeliness of OpenAI’s latest frontier models to be hosted on AWS due to its Microsoft agreement, he believes potential advertising, eCommerce, and enterprise AI partnerships with OpenAI to be incremental positives with the potential to reinforce Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) ecosystem while safeguarding its high-margin ad business.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a multinational technology company that provides online retail shopping services. It operates through the North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) segments.

I can barely stand for my live show Opening Bid each day.\n\nOn Wednesday, I almost passed out on a rowing machine. My trainer told me, while I was on the ground, \"No one is coming to save you. Get your ass up.\"\nIt was much-appreciated motivation for the self-motivated me.\nAnd I want to give you a similar shot of inspiration as we get ready to enter 2026: No one is coming to save your portfolio from complacency on AI stocks.\nHow's that Oracle ( ORCL ) you bought in September working out? Still riding the once-buzzy CoreWeave ( CRWV )? I imagine in both cases, things are not looking too rosy. Why? Because you did no homework on these companies — and simply bought them because they were AI-related and in the news.\nDo better!!\n\nThe reality is you have to think beyond the obvious AI stocks in 2026 to drive gains. Beyond the richly valued \"Magnificent 7.\" Beyond a company like Oracle, whose billionaire CEO, Larry Ellison, is also trying to help his son buy a struggling Warner Bros. ( WBD ). You have to think deeply about where else the AI trade will appear and create value.\n\nMap this stuff out on a whiteboard if you have to!\nAI is having a profound impact inside companies. As a result, it will drive a good bit of positive earnings surprises in many of the other 493 companies housed in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nHere are two examples of the work you need to be doing on AI investing.\nThe appetite to own AI plays is broadening to more under-the-radar names, including companies that are using the technology aggressively in the industrial sector. One of those companies is logistics giant C.H. Robinson ( CHRW ), led by one of the best CEOs you probably never heard of: David Bozeman .\nBozeman has led the 120-year-old logistics player for more than two years, after stints in transportation operations at Amazon ( AMZN ), Harley-Davidson ( HOG ), and Caterpillar ( CAT ).\n\nSince Bozeman's arrival, C.H. Robinson has leaned hard into AI to improve operating profits. Its stock price is up 55% in 2025. FYI, Meta's ( META ) stock is only up 11% this year! That's despite Bozeman telling me in a new episode of my Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (video above) that the economy isn't growing too quickly and the freight recession continues.\n\nStory Continues",

      "Content": "The Secret to Finding the Next Broadcom Is Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Broadcom's custom AI chips are growing in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's.\nNow, Amazon has created its own custom AI chip, Trainium3, to carve out its own niche.\nAmazon needs to sustain its strong AWS growth in 2026 to be a successful stock pick.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nSemiconductor company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has enjoyed an incredible year, rising some 50% so far, even after a large pullback due to poorly received fourth-quarter results. This has investors searching for the next Broadcom, as who wouldn't want those incredible one-year returns?\n\nThe secret to Broadcom's rise is tied to the custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips it's developing. These compete directly against Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are incredibly costly due to their impressive performance and flexibility. Broadcom's custom AI chips can outperform Nvidia's GPUs at a lower price point when the workload is set up properly, giving them a huge advantage at the cost of flexibility.\nDesigning custom AI computing units is going to become more popular, as Nvidia's chips are far too expensive not to explore this avenue. While many companies are choosing to partner with Broadcom, others are opting to do it themselves. One of these companies is hiding in plain sight, and its recent release is incredibly promising.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has dived into designing its own AI chip, and the results have been phenomenal. This innovation could provide Amazon with the growth it needs to be a monster stock pick over the next few years, making it an excellent investment today.\nAmazon's new device provides incredible performance Amazon's new computing chip is known as Trainium3. It is built on cutting-edge 3nm (nanometer) chip architecture and delivers impressive performance at a lower price point. Compared to previous generation Trainum2 servers, they offer 4 times the computing performance while improving energy efficiency by 4 times as well. That helps reduce operating costs and run time, which allowed several generative AI clients to reduce training and inference costs by up to 50%, including Anthropic.\n\nThose are huge boosts for Amazon, and it could attract new clients to its servers. One of those is OpenAI, which is reportedly considering using Amazon's Trainium3 chips in exchange for a $10 billion investment. This could be the first of many companies flocking to Amazon's training servers, as cost is starting to become a large bottleneck in the artificial intelligence investing realm.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors want to see real innovation in exchange for their dollars, and companies may need to stretch their funding to achieve better results. Switching from GPUs to alternative computing units like Amazon's is one way to do that, and it could grow in popularity in 2026.\nDepending on how popular this product is, Amazon could become the next Broadcom. We'll see success tied to Amazon's cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), if it has any boost in 2026. Fortunately for Amazon and its investors, it's already looking up.\n\nAWS is critical to Amazon's success Despite AWS accounting for only 18% of Amazon's total revenue, it represents 66% of its operating profits. That's because AWS' margins are far better than the base e-commerce business, so as AWS goes, so will Amazon.\nIn Q3, AWS posted its best growth rate in multiple years, rising at a 20% pace. This indicates that more workloads are coming online at AWS, which is an excellent sign for 2026. If Amazon can continue this momentum in 2026, combined with the rise of Trainium3 workloads, Amazon's stock could dramatically rise in 2026.\n\nWhile I doubt it can duplicate Broadcom's 50% rise this year, I think Amazon is prepped to be a market-beating stock, especially after its underperformance this year. Amazon is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing AI workload, and with the rest of its business also producing strong results (advertising in particular), I think Amazon has what it takes to be a top stock pick in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Amazon Stock in 2026: Key Catalysts and What Investors Should Watch\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:57 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nKey Points Amazon is sparing no expense when investing in AI-related infrastructure, especially when AWS demand is strong.\nDigital advertising should continue to be a major growth driver next year.\nThe stock’s EV-to-EBIT ratio is near a decade low, which can provide near-term upside.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIt's not like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) to trail the overall market. However, with shares up 2% this year (as of Dec. 17), investors should ask what's going on. Amazon is dealing with competitive forces, regulatory issues, and macro headwinds. But it's easy to be optimistic.\nHere are some of the most important catalysts and factors that investors need to watch as attention turns to 2026.\nAmazon's AI-related spending is sizable Amazon is known as a hyperscaler because it's spending significant sums of money on artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. Management forecasts $125 billion in capital expenditures (capex) this year for things like building data centers and developing chips. That figure will likely increase next year.\n\nPeers like Microsoft and Alphabet are spending ridiculous amounts on expanding their AI infrastructure as well. Amazon must keep up, or risk getting left behind in what could be a revolutionary technology shift.\nMacro and industry forces can't be overlooked. AI bubble fears are swirling. If pessimism becomes prevalent, all this spending will be ill-timed, and investors will lose confidence in companies like Amazon that will likely be most affected.\nAWS' success is critical to the overall business A lot of that capex relates to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's industry-leading cloud computing platform. It's a major financial contributor, with third-quarter revenue of $33 billion and operating income of $11.4 billion. In 2026, AWS should remain top of investors' minds.\nAWS has received a boost from strong customer interest in leveraging AI tools in their own operations. OpenAI is a notable customer, and Nvidia is a longtime partner. AWS' ongoing success should lift Amazon's financial results in 2026.\n\nDigital advertising revenue is soaring During the last quarter, Amazon's digital advertising revenue jumped 22% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company is deserving of a seat at the table with industry heavyweights Alphabet and Meta Platforms . Amazon's online marketplace provides a valuable marketing channel for merchants. Its popular streaming platform, Prime Video, is another avenue to monetize viewer attention.\nUnless there's a severe recession, expect digital ad revenue to keep rising meaningfully next year.\n\nStory Continues\nThere might be valuation upside For a business that has a huge market cap of $2.4 trillion, it can be surprising to see a cheap valuation. Amazon shares currently trade at an enterprise value (EV) that's 30.5 times its earnings before interest and taxes . This level is near its lowest ratio in the past decade.\nIn 2026, valuation expansion might be a key driver of investor returns. Market sentiment can improve with strong financial results. This tailwind could be a catalyst in the near term.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory Continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has 18% of His Portfolio Invested in 3 Trillion-Dollar AI Stocks. Wall Street Says They Can Soar in 2026.\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:16 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve user engagement and advertising outcomes across its social media networks.\nMicrosoft has added generative artificial intelligence features (Copilots) to many of its software products, and its data center footprint is expanding rapidly.\nAmazon is leaning on artificial intelligence to makes its e-commerce business more profitable and to increase cloud computing sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, a hedge fund that outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points over the last three years. That makes him an excellent source of inspiration.\nLaffont had nearly 18% of his portfolio invested in three artificial intelligence stocks (each worth well over $1 trillion) as of the third quarter: 7.3% in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , 5.9% in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and 4.7% in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . He clearly has a great deal of confidence in those companies, and Wall Street anticipates substantial upside in all three stocks in the next year.\nHere are the important details.\nMeta Platforms: 28% upside implied by the median target price Meta has a strong presence in two industries: digital advertising and smart glasses. It owns three of the four most popular social media networks , which lets it collect user data and target media content. That advantage has made Meta the second-largest adtech company in the world. But the company also dominates the nascent smart glasses market.\n\nMeta is using artificial intelligence (AI) -- from custom chips to proprietary large language models -- to improve user engagement and advertising conversions across its portfolio of industry-leading social media. It is also developing a superintelligence system to integrate with its smart glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says glasses will be our \"primary computing devices\" in the future.\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look quite reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842 per share. That implies 28% upside from its current share price of $658.\nMicrosoft: 30% upside implied by the median target price Microsoft has a strong competitive position in two markets: enterprise software and cloud computing. It is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for its office productivity suite Microsoft 365, its portfolio also includes popular applications for business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning. Meanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud services provider.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft is monetizing AI across its software and cloud businesses. CEO Satya Nadella says customers are adopting Microsoft 365 Copilot (a generative AI assistant) faster than any new product. Additionally, its entire family of Copilot applications topped 150 million monthly active users in the quarter ended in September, up from 100 million in the quarter ended in June.\n\nMicrosoft Azure has gained about 3 percentage points of market share since the AI boom started, despite compute capacity constraints. However, the company is building out its data center capacity faster than any other cloud provider, according to Satya Nadella. Azure plans to double its data center footprint in the next two years.\nWall Street expects Microsoft's earnings to increase at 14% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 35 times earnings look somewhat expensive, though investors eager to own the stock could still buy a small position today. Among 62 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 30% upside from its current share price of $485.\nAmazon: 32% upside implied by the median target price Amazon has a strong competitive position in three industries: e-commerce, advertising, and cloud computing. It runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. The company dominates retail media, one of the fastest-growing verticals in the broader digital advertising market. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services.\n\nIn retail, Amazon has built an artificial intelligence shopping assistant called Rufus that is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales in 2025. Shoppers who engage the conversational chatbot are 60% more likely to make a purchase. Amazon has also developed generative AI tools that improve inventory placement, robot productivity, and last-mile delivery.\nMeanwhile, AWS is introducing artificial intelligence features at a rapid clip. In the last few months, the company added tools to Bedrock AgentCore that help developers build and deploy generative AI agents. AWS also added agents for software development, security fixes, and performance monitoring. And it expanded its portfolio of pre-trained models.\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 32 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 73 analysts, Amazon has a median target price of $300 per share. That implies 32% upside from its current share price of $228.\n\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:25 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) innovations have been lackluster, but its ecosystem is as powerful as ever.\nAmazon is driving tremendous growth in its AWS cloud division thanks to strong AI demand.\nValuation should always play a part in proper investment analysis.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nWhen looking at stocks to buy, investor attention might go to the most dominant and well-known businesses out there. This will naturally lead to technology companies that have strong market positions, popular products and services, and perhaps a presence in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) come to mind. Over the long term, they have both been fantastic stocks to own, doing a great job compounding shareholder capital. And today, they command multitrillion-dollar market caps .\nBoth businesses have their own investment merits. But which is the best stock to buy right now?\nApple is moving slowly with AI, but the moat couldn't be wider The biggest knock on Apple in recent years has been its unhurried approach to AI. Major tech enterprises across the board are moving incredibly fast at building out the necessary infrastructure and software capabilities to position themselves to become leaders in the AI market.\nApple, in typical fashion, started out being cautious, as its usual strategy isn't to be first, but to be the best. However, the Apple Intelligence features on its smartphones aren't turning any heads. And an upgraded Siri launch has been delayed until next year.\n\nThat still doesn't take away from Apple's wide economic moat. The company's competitive position is supported by its strong brand, with Apple arguably being the most recognizable business on Earth. The brand resonates with consumers across the globe, thanks to the company's beautifully designed hardware and software offerings, superior user experience, and premium positioning. The elevated retail experience also has an impact.\nThe moat is also helped by Apple's powerful ecosystem . This combination of products and services is what makes the business truly one-of-a-kind. Customers are essentially locked in, with Apple being able to generate profits on its hardware devices, while also raking in high-margin revenue on its fast-growing services segment.\nThere are very few companies as financially sound as Apple. Its net profit margin has averaged 25.5% in the past five years. It collects massive amounts of free cash flow . And the balance sheet is clean, with $34 billion of net cash on the books (as of Sept. 27). This reduces risk for investors.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon has multiple growth drivers that will push it forward Amazon, on the other hand, is already atop the AI race. It's planning to spend a whopping $125 billion on capital expenditures this year to bolster its technical infrastructure. That's an easy capital allocation decision for the leadership team to make, as they are seeing robust demand from customers for AI-related products and services.\n\nThis shows up in Amazon Web Services (AWS), whose revenue shot up 20% year over year in Q3. This booming segment is also very profitable, bringing in trailing-12-month operating income of $43.8 billion.\nBesides cloud computing, which itself is poised to be a $2.4 trillion market worldwide in 2030, Amazon dominates online shopping. Nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce activity happens on its marketplace, giving it an advantageous position as buyer behavior keeps moving to digital channels.\nInvestors might not realize that Amazon reported $17.7 billion in digital ad sales in the third quarter, a major growth engine that is likely also producing high margins. Amazon also has a presence in streaming entertainment, autonomous driving, and healthcare.\n\nI believe Amazon is in a better position to increase its revenue and earnings power at a faster rate than Apple, thanks to those secular trends working in its favor. Valuation matters as well. Amazon stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 32.1 is below Apple's multiple of 36.6, given the former the upper hand.\nWith a time horizon looking out over the next five or 10 years, I view Amazon as the best stock to buy right now.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "‘It felt so wrong’: Colin Angle on iRobot, the FTC, and the Amazon deal that never was\n\nConnie Loizos\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 1:31 PM PST 12 min read\n\nIn this article: IRBT\n\nAMZN\n\nWhen iRobot filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last Sunday , it marked the end of an era for one of America’s most beloved robotics companies. The Roomba maker, which had sold over 50 million robots since its 2002 launch, had survived 35 years of near-death experiences and technical challenges only to be undone by what founder Colin Angle calls “avoidable” regulatory opposition.\n\nThe collapse followed Amazon’s January 2024 decision to scuttle its $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot after 18 months of investigation by the FTC and European regulators. In this candid conversation, Angle reflects on what he describes as a profoundly frustrating process, the chilling message it sends to entrepreneurs, and his determination to move forward with a new venture in consumer robotics.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nTC: You called the bankruptcy “avoidable” and a “tragedy for consumers.” Walk me through what you think regulators got wrong in blocking the Amazon acquisition.\nCA: I think there’s a real lesson around the role of the FTC and the European Commission. The goal, of course, is to avoid the abuses that can happen in monopolies and with the goal of protecting consumer choice and protecting innovation.\n\nWhat happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot’s trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier. In the EU, we had a 12% market share [but it was] declining where the number one competitor was only three years old in the market, which is nearly the definition of a vibrant and dynamic marketplace. And in the United States, iRobot’s market share was higher, but it was declining and there were multiple growing competitors bringing outside innovation into the marketplace.\nThis should have been a no-brainer. This should have been three, four weeks of investigation. What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked.\n\nWhat was that 18-month process actually like? What were you being asked to do?\nThe amount of money and time spent was indescribable. I would not be surprised if over 100,000 documents were created and delivered. iRobot invested a significant part of our discretionary earnings against fulfilling the requirements that went along with doing the transaction. Amazon was forced to invest many, many, many times that. There was a whole team, both internal and external employees and lawyers and economists working to try to, in as many different ways as possible — because it seemed like our message was falling on deaf ears — demonstrate that this acquisition was not going to create a monopolistic situation.\n\nStory Continues\nThere was daily activity for 18 months associated with this. Perhaps most telling, when I was testifying as part of being deposed, I had a chance to walk the halls of the FTC. The examiners on their office doors had printouts of deals blocked, like trophies.\nTrophies?\nTo me, it felt so wrong as an entrepreneur who started this thing literally in my living room and lived six and a half years never having enough money in the bank to make payroll, finally making it through succeeding. Here’s an agency whose stated mission is protecting consumer interests and helping the United States economy, celebrating as victories every time they shut down M&A, which in a very real way is the primary driver of value creation for the innovation economy.\n\nI went into this deposition looking for a friend. It’s like, “Here we are, we’re obviously not in a stronger place, and here’s a great opportunity for us. Are you excited for us?” Maybe this is just my naïve take coming out, but that’s not the reception I got. It was, “Why should we ever let them do this?” It’s like: because it’s good for the consumer — because it’s going to catalyze innovation.\nHow do you think what happened here changes the calculus for startup founders who see acquisition as their exit strategy? Do you think we’re in a world where American tech companies can’t scale through M&A?\nRisk has a chilling effect. If you’re an entrepreneur, your only option is to hope that it doesn’t happen again. The reason you and I are talking is I hope by my words I can make it less likely that it will happen again.\n\nI founded a new company and my outlook on exit strategy and even commercialization strategy is impacted by the experiences I had at iRobot. How can it not be? That precedent creates risk of it happening again, and only through positive experiences do we start to dial down the anxiety that the exits I’m depending on — or as a venture capitalist, the exits I’m investing in assuming will happen — will actually come through. That risk is factored into the willingness to invest, the valuation of deals, and the rate of new company formation.\nIt’s hard to say there’s X percent fewer entrepreneurial starts or exits as a result of the chilling message, but it certainly didn’t help. Entrepreneurs can use every leg up that we as a nation can provide. It is a rugged journey. When it actually works out, it should be a celebration. The FTC is there as a safeguard against very real examples of things gone too far. I’m a big believer in checks and balances. But when things get out of whack, the country suffers.\n\nLet’s talk about iRobot’s journey. The Roomba didn’t come out for 12 years after the company was founded. Tell me about those early days.\niRobot was a bunch of people in an academic lab saying, “We were promised robots. Where are the robots?” If I could be pissed off that I don’t have the robots we were promised, I should do something about it. If not us, who? If not now, when?\nOne of the co-founders, my professor Rod Brooks, had pioneered an AI technology which allowed the embedding of machine intelligence in low-cost robotics. The mission of the company was to build cool stuff, deliver a great product, have fun, make money, and change the world.\nThe first business plan was “private mission to the moon, sell the movie rights.” We were maybe the first company to fail to do exactly that. But the technology we developed led to additions to the Mars Pathfinder mission — my name’s up on Mars. We built robots that went into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. We built the PackBot, which was the first robot ever deployed in a combat mission for the US Army, went into caves in Afghanistan, and became the primary methodology for diffusing improvised explosive devices. We would get postcards: “You saved my life today.”\n\nWhen the Fukushima disaster happened, we donated half a million dollars worth of robots to Japan. We sent six people over to train Tokyo Electric Power Company employees. Those robots were the first inside the reactor doors, mapped out radiation levels, and found a path where an employee could run in, get to the control room, work for a minute and a half, run back out, and only receive a lifetime dose of radiation. We were credited with enabling the shutdown of the reactor.\nAnd then year 12, the Roomba?\nI had a team that was working on toys, and one of the guys said, “Colin, I think it’s time we can do this. We can finally make the vacuum.” I’m like, “Okay, here’s $15,000. Two weeks. See what you can do.” Two weeks later they came back and said, “Hey, that’s not bad. Maybe there’s something here.” We scraped and found a little bit of money [to build these]. A year and a half later, I convinced my board that we could build 10,000 of these robots and we launched them.\n\nIt’s really the media that picked up the story. We had no money for marketing. Reporters were fascinated because we tended to do interesting things that were real, and they couldn’t believe that robot vacuuming could possibly be real. [The reaction was:] “My God, it actually worked.” We ended up selling 70,000 robots in the first three months. Then we nearly went out of business the next year.\nBecause you couldn’t accommodate demand?\nBecause we screwed up. The press drove this huge initial demand — 70,000 robots. So next year we’re going to do four times that. We made 300,000 robots. We even made a television commercial, but we were a bunch of geek engineers, so it totally failed. After Cyber Monday we were sitting with 250,000 robots in our warehouse like, “Oh my God, the world’s going to end.”\n\nThen something good happened. The guy running our website said, “Why did sales quadruple yesterday?” We hadn’t done anything. What had happened was Pepsi had started running a TV ad with Dave Chappelle. He walks into this beautiful home, picks up a potato chip, and a Roomba comes out. He’s like, “A vacuum cleaner!” He throws down the potato chip, the vacuum eats it, then chases him. His pants are ripped off. He stands up in boxers. A beautiful woman appears, and he says, “Your vacuum cleaner ate my pants.” We sold 250,000 robots in two weeks and realized we knew nothing about marketing.\nWow! You had no idea Pepsi was incorporating your product into its commercial?\nNo idea. It was wild. You try to do good for so long and you get smacked in the face so many times, and then sometimes something good happens. You could say because of that crazy moment in time, we have robots. When we think about just how fragile a journey it is — cats riding Roombas was a big part of why we succeeded. Does that make any sense? No, not at all. But we certainly didn’t expect tens of billions of views of cats riding Roombas.\n\nAt some point you started seeing Chinese competitors like Roborock and Ecovacs adopting lidar navigation years before iRobot. Why did you stick with vision-based navigation for so long?\nWe explicitly did not put lasers on the robot. We had the technology decades ago because it’s a dead-end technology. Under my strategic direction, we were going to invest every penny of cost against a vision-based nav and situational understanding system. Your Tesla does not have a laser on it. It is all vision-based. At least Elon agrees with me.\nOur strategic plan was for Roomba to be much more than just a vacuum cleaner in the home. To do that, it needs to understand more. Lasers are not advanced technology — they’ve been around for decades. They’re an expedient solution to a subset of the problems that a robot at home needs to take on. A laser will never tell you whether you actually cleaned the floor or not.\n\nIt is absolutely true that Chinese competition was coming in at lower price points. We were late in building a two-in-one robot — we believed that by separating mopping and vacuuming you could give a better customer experience. The customer voted that we were wrong, and that’s okay. We certainly were first in auto-evac, first in navigation. We were also importantly excluded from the Chinese marketplace, which is the largest market for consumer robotics in the world. That didn’t help.\nWhat learnings from your iRobot experience would you share with other robotics entrepreneurs?\nThe first thing I tell all robotics entrepreneurs is: make sure you understand your market so that you are building something that delivers more value than it costs to create. Robots are so exciting, so sexy that it’s really easy to convince yourself that you’re doing something that is going to change the world, if only consumers were smart enough to realize it. That’s a pretty tough equation.\n\nTechnology is oftentimes in the robot space well ahead of the business plans that can take advantage of the technology. One of the traps is thinking of robotics as a thing as opposed to a toolkit. As soon as you say, “I’m going to build a robot,” and head off building your humanoid — are you really doing it because you understand a problem you’re trying to solve, or are you enamored with building your thing?\nWhen I started iRobot, it was just assumed that robots were going to vacuum floors by building humanoids to push upright vacuum cleaners. When we first built Roomba, we would ask people, “Is that a robot?” People would say, “No, that’s not a robot. A robot has arms and legs and a head.” Yet Roomba at the time cost 10,000 times less than a humanoid pushing an upright vacuum.\n\nThe challenge of entrepreneurship is breaking through the romance and opportunity and falling in love with your technology and getting to the application that you’re trying to solve. Understand your consumer, understand the problem you’re trying to solve — because it’s complicated, robotics is expensive, and it takes a lot of energy to get right.\nYou mentioned you’ve founded a new company . What can you tell me about it?\nWe’re in stealth mode, but I’ll give you a broad hint. It’s consumer-facing. We’re really looking at the fact that most of the things robots can do to meet outstanding needs require us to interact with other people. So how do we build a robot that actually has sufficient emotional sophistication — not human-level, but enough — to build an enduring co-character that can make sense over time and use that for health and wellness related applications?\n\nIt’s going to be awesome. I’m so excited about it. It’s given me enthusiasm and energy to have a chance to use this new toolkit and continue on my journey to build the robots we were promised. I really haven’t changed that much from a grad student in college saying, “Oh my God, we’ve been promised robots and we don’t have the ones that I want yet.” I spent 30 years focused on building the world’s greatest floor care robot, and now I have a chance to do something else.\nFor more from this interview with Angle, including his take on whether humanoid robots will ever work, check out TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast — new episodes drop every Tuesday, and the full conversation will be available soon .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Should You Buy Amazon Stock in 2026?\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 12:23 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Amazon's cloud computing division is accelerating its growth, while e-commerce keeps rising steadily.\nThe stock looks cheap if you believe in the company's margin improvement.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nDid you know that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has actually underperformed the stock market indexes over the last five years? In that time frame, the S&P 500 index is up 98%, while Amazon's share price has risen by only 40%.\n\nWhile that's not a terrible outcome, this is an unexpected development for one of the investing world's beloved technology stocks, which led the pack in both cloud computing and e-commerce in North America.\nHowever, Amazon's underlying business still appears to be performing well. Does that make the stock undervalued and a buy for your portfolio in 2026?\nAccelerating cloud growth Amazon has been deemed a loser in the artificial intelligence ( AI ) race, as revenues for its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), have grown more slowly than those of rivals Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.\nHowever, last quarter, AWS' growth did accelerate to 20% year over year as its revenue hit $33 billion. It has an extensive relationship with the start-up Anthropic, which is growing its own revenue at a blistering clip and spending tens of billions of dollars on computing power to train and run its AI. A lot of that spending is going to AWS.\n\nIt may not be a monopoly, but AWS is highly profitable and should be a durable grower for Amazon, with or without the exposure to AI. With $44 billion in trailing-12-month operating income, this is a highly valuable part of the Amazon business, and one that is apparently being underrated by investors today.\nDon't forget e-commerce It seems like all the investing world can discuss right now is AI, cloud computing, and computer chips. But there is a much bigger part of the Amazon business that many investors are ignoring: online shopping. Its e-commerce and shipping business keeps chugging along as the entire e-commerce sector continues to take more market share in the retail space.\n\nAmazon's North American retail sales grew 11% year over year last quarter to over $100 billion. Over the trailing 12 months, that division has now done over $64 billion in advertising revenue, $166.8 billion in third-party seller services revenue, and $48 billion in subscription revenue. Combined, that was almost $300 billion in annualized sales from business lines with higher margins than Amazon's original first-party e-commerce model, and should lead to expanding profit margins in the years to come.\n\nStory Continues\nEven in 2025, the North American retail division only has an operating margin of 6.6% as Amazon keeps investing in its growth efforts. In 2026, I expect these figures to slowly keep expanding.\nWhy the stock is a buy in 2026 Amazon's stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31, which is fairly low when compared to its big tech peers. With its potential to keep compounding its revenue growth as well as margin expansion opportunities in 2026, I think the stock is a good deal for any investor looking to buy today.\n\nFor example, let's do some math with Amazon's revenue and earnings growth. Its trailing revenue figure is $691 billion. If that grows at 10% annually for the next three years, it will hit $919 billion in annual revenue.\nToday, its margin, calculated on the basis of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), is 11.5% on a consolidated basis. With fast growth from AWS and steady margin expansions in the retail business, it is reasonable to expect Amazon's operating margin to grow to 15% three years from now.\nThat would bring the company's operating earnings at that point to $138 billion compared to $80 billion today. The combination of that expected steady rise in earnings and Amazon's currently reasonable P/E makes the stock a buy in 2026 and a hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Should You Buy Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks In 2026?\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft have struggled in the last few months, bringing their valuations down with them.\nOther AI stocks like Amazon still look cheaper at today's prices.\nCyclicality risks should keep investors away from Nvidia stock in 2026. Amazon looks like a better buy.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence ( AI ) trade began to sputter in late 2025. Stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are flat since August of this year after seemingly going up at an insatiable rate for three straight years. Similar results have occurred for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shareholders, with its stock actually down over the last six months.\nInvestors have begun to lose faith in the growth-at-any-cost mindset among these AI start-ups even though underlying revenue growth is still strong for the sector.\nDoes that make now a perfect time to buy AI stocks for 2026? Let's take a look at the numbers and find out.\nHigh multiples and fast-growing businesses Stagnant share prices have helped some of the fundamentals for these AI stocks catch up to their share prices. Last quarter, Nvidia's revenue grew 62% year over year to $57 billion, with net income up 65% to $31.9 billion. Microsoft's revenue was up 18%, with 24% growth in operating income.\nAI companies are still paying big paychecks to buy Nvidia's advanced computer chips or to utilize them in AI data centers run by cloud providers such as Microsoft. OpenAI is the leader in AI spending, with commitments in the hundreds of billions of dollars across various sources. A lot of this spending will go to Nvidia computer chips.\n\nStill, even with soaring earnings, both Microsoft and Nvidia (two of the largest companies in the world by market cap) do not have dirt cheap earnings ratios. Nvidia has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 44, while Microsoft's is 34. If earnings keep growing quickly, these ratios will come down in a hurry, but it puts high expectations on future growth.\nMore exposure to AI and cyclicality than others Booming spending in any industry can lead to supply gluts. This has happened in the computer chip space many times throughout history, as well as in other infrastructure build-outs like telecommunications and railroads.\nDon't ignore this risk with the AI winners like Nvidia. There is a major downside risk to Nvidia's earnings power if the company's revenue growth declines along with its profit margin, a double whammy to net income.\n\nSome stocks are more exposed to the AI trade than others, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, or Oracle . Others have been less aggressive on spending or winning contracts, such as Amazon , and are therefore less at risk to an AI or computer chip spending downcycle. With a P/E ratio of 31, Amazon's valuation is lower based on its trailing earnings as well.\n\n繼續閱讀\nDon't ask whether you should buy AI stocks Investors shouldn't ask whether they should buy AI stocks, as there are dozens, if not hundreds, of stocks exposed to the AI trade, all with different stories and valuations. You have direct beneficiaries such as Nvidia that may be a risky bet right now, or even wilder companies like CoreWeave , laden with debt.\n\nDon't ask if you should buy AI stocks. Ask which AI stocks you should buy today. Amazon looks like a good candidate at today's prices because of its lower P/E ratio, dual growth engines from cloud computing and e-commerce, as well as its growing relationship with start-up Anthropic. Amazon has not gotten as much enthusiasm from Wall Street in 2025, which just might make it a good pick for 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Instacart Is Under Investigation. Should You Buy the Dip in CART Stock?\n\nAnushka Mukherji\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 8:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CART\n\nAMZN\n\nMaplebear’s Instacart (CART) has been on shaky ground this year as competition in grocery delivery intensifies. Well-funded rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), and other delivery platforms are leveraging their scale, logistics networks, and partnerships to squeeze Instacart’s market share. At the same time, mounting business and regulatory challenges have dented investor confidence.\n\nThat pressure intensified on Dec. 18, when CART shares slipped about 1.5% following reports that Instacart agreed to pay $60 million in consumer refunds as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC alleged that the company used deceptive tactics tied to subscription sign-ups and its “100% satisfaction guarantee” advertisement, resulting in higher fees and making refunds difficult to obtain.\nMore News from Barchart 5 \"Best of the Best\" Dividend Stocks to Own in 2026\nThis 1 Lesser-Known Stock Is Set to Dominate with Nvidia and Broadcom in 2026\nNike, Tilray, and Palantir: Their Unusually Active Put Options Will Boost Your Wallet After Christmas\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nCompounding those concerns, Instacart is reportedly facing a separate FTC probe into its pricing practices, after a recent study suggested its algorithmic pricing tools led shoppers to pay different prices for identical items at the same store. With regulatory headwinds intensifying, does this pullback present a buying opportunity, or are the risks still too high?\nAbout Instacart Stock Founded in 2012, Instacart has become a central player in North America’s grocery ecosystem, operating at the intersection of retailers, consumers, and on-demand fulfillment. The company works with more than 1,800 national, regional, and local retail banners, enabling online shopping, delivery, and pickup from nearly 100,000 stores through the Instacart Marketplace.\n\nThis network allows millions of consumers to shop from familiar retailers while supporting roughly 600,000 shoppers who earn income by picking, packing, and delivering orders on flexible schedules. At the same time, the California-based company has expanded beyond delivery into a broader technology platform for retailers. Its enterprise-grade tools help power e-commerce experiences, fulfill orders, digitize brick-and-mortar stores, deliver advertising solutions, and generate actionable insights.\nPublic since 2023, Instacart currently has a $12 billion market capitalization, but the stock hasn’t lived up to broader market strength. Shares peaked at $53.50 in August this year and have since fallen nearly 17%. So far in 2025, CART is up about 10.9%, a respectable gain, but one that still lags the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which has advanced 16.2% over the same stretch.\n\nStory Continues\nInside Instacart’s Q3 Earnings Report On Nov. 10, Instacart dropped its fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings report, which blew past both Wall Street’s top and bottom line expectations. Total revenue for the quarter jumped 10% year-over-year (YOY) to $939 million and also came in ahead of Wall Street’s expected figure of $934.1 million. Gross transaction value (GTV), which tracks the value of goods sold, also climbed 10% YOY to $9.17 billion, while total orders surged 14% to 83.4 million, driven by higher demand for essentials and optimized logistics.\n\nRevenue growth was broad-based. Transaction revenue reached $670 million, up 10% year over year and representing 7.3% of GTV. At the same time, advertising and other revenue increased to $269 million, also up 10%, accounting for 2.9% of GTV. The company’s profitability story also strengthened meaningfully. Adjusted EBITDA jumped 22% to $278 million, reflecting operating leverage and the impact of deeper retailer partnerships.\nA key highlight was the expansion of Instacart’s relationship with Kroger (KR), which reaffirmed Instacart as its primary delivery fulfillment partner across all Kroger digital properties, supporting fast and reliable delivery from nearly 2,700 stores nationwide. On the bottom line, EPS came in at $0.51, up 21.2% YOY and just ahead of the $0.50 consensus forecast.\n\nMeanwhile, Artificial intelligence (AI) remains a growing driver across the business. During the quarter, Instacart upgraded its ad-relevance systems using large language models, boosting engagement and increasing the number of items added to carts via Sponsored Product units. The company also expanded its one-click, AI-powered recommendation tools to around 3,000 brands, helping them better optimize bids, budgets, and creative execution.\nIn addition, AI-generated landing pages are now available to all brands, allowing faster creation of dynamic, high-performing content for both on- and off-platform campaigns. To reinforce confidence in its long-term value creation, Instacart authorized a $1.5 billion increase to its share repurchase program and plans to initiate a $250 million accelerated share repurchase, while continuing to buy back shares opportunistically.\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects fiscal 2025 Q4 GTV to land between $9.45 billion and $9.60 billion, alongside adjusted EBITDA of $285 million to $295 million. That outlook implies 9%-11% YOY GTV growth, with order volumes projected to grow even faster. Management cited strong October trends and continued momentum from new and expanded enterprise partnerships, while acknowledging that potential EBT SNAP funding impacts could partially offset those gains.\nWhat Do Analysts Have to Say About Instacart Stock? Even as regulatory concerns hang over the stock, Wall Street’s outlook on Instacart remains more constructive than bearish. CART currently carries a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 32 analysts covering the company, 13 call it a “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” 17 advise “Hold,” and only one has a “Strong Sell” view.\n\nThat cautious confidence is also evident in price targets. The average target of $50.48 implies roughly 10% upside from current levels. At the same time, the most bullish call on the Street sees shares climbing to $66, indicating a 43.7% rally if Instacart can successfully navigate its regulatory challenges.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

DJT6 is now the fifth Amazon facility in Southern California to join the Teamsters, along with the KSBD Air Hub in San Bernadino, DFX4 in Victorville, DAX5 in City of Industry, and DAX8 in Palmdale.\nWorkers at the facility began their unionization efforts with the Teamsters earlier this week by staging a midnight walkout during the holiday peak season, when Amazon workers experience increased workloads and more dangerous working conditions. The newest members of Local 1932 are fighting to win better pay and respect from management for making Amazon one of the richest companies on the planet.\n\n\"Workers at DJT6, one of Amazon's most important facilities, have been on the front end of Amazon's abuse for years,\" said Randy Korgan, Director of the Teamsters Amazon Division and Secretary-Treasurer of Local 1932. \"It is a crime that Amazon makes billions off their backs while they can't even afford to buy a home near the warehouse. DJT6 workers showed tremendous courage in walking off the job to join the fight and demand their fair share.\"\nDJT6 warehouse workers are specifically demanding that Amazon provide an industry-standard minimum salary, health care, and safer working conditions. Workers at the facility report Amazon ignoring workplace injuries and threatening injured workers' jobs if they take time off.\n\n\"For too long, Amazon has profited off our labor yet denied our rights as workers,\" said Samuel Padilla, an Amazon DJT6 warehouse worker. \"Now, we are coming to take what we have rightfully earned. Amazon may not listen to any one individual worker, but we will force them to listen to us together as Teamsters.\"\nDJT6 is the latest Amazon facility to organize with the Teamsters, joining over 200 drivers in Queens, New York and Amazon CDL drivers in Shepherdsville, Kentucky. To date, nearly 10,000 Amazon workers nationwide are demanding Amazon end its illegal union-busting and recognize the Teamsters Union.\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents over 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

On December 17, Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski maintained an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $295. This is a reaffirmation of the firm’s earlier update on December 2.\nThis follows BMO Capital’s adjustment a day earlier when it lifted the price target on the stock to $304 from $300, while keeping an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm said it had conversations with two former AWS employees, with the discussions providing insights into increased cloud commitments, which became the basis for the revision.\n\nAs of the close of business on December 17, Wall Street analysts have a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock, with a one-year average share price target of $296.12, representing an upside of 33%.\nIn other news, press reports on Wednesday said that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in negotiations with OpenAI over a potential $10 billion investment that could see an agreement to use its AI chips. However, sources familiar with the matter described the talks as ‘fluid’ at this point.\nThe reports come at a time when the ChatGPT maker is preparing for an IPO as early as the second half of next year.

      "Content": "Amazon’s Retail Engine May Matter More Than AWS Right Now\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:23 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nQuick Read Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is positioned for a strong holiday quarter driven primarily by its core e-commerce business.\nThe stock’s underperformance this year has reset expectations and improved near-term risk-reward.\nAmazon’s scale, third-party marketplace leverage, and logistics dominance provide earnings durability even if AWS growth cools.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video Why Amazon stands out this quarter I started the conversation by saying that one of my favorite retail stocks right now is Amazon. This is not an AI call and it is not an AWS hype trade. It is about the holiday quarter. Amazon’s e-commerce platform is built to capture peak consumer demand, with massive scale, pricing leverage, and millions of third-party sellers operating inside its ecosystem.\n\nLower expectations help Lee pointed out that Amazon has underperformed the broader market this year, which matters more than most investors realize. Expectations are no longer stretched. Even a solid, not spectacular, quarter can move the stock if retail margins and volumes come through. Berkshire Hathaway still owns Amazon, making it one of the few major tech names it holds alongside Apple and Alphabet.\n\nAWS is not the swing factor right now We both agreed that AWS remains a long-term asset, but near-term cloud and AI spending has become more competitive and more capital intensive. That creates the risk of disappointment if investors expect too much too fast. The key point is that Amazon does not need AWS to be a home run this quarter to deliver strong results.\n\nThe e-commerce moat still wins I emphasized that controlling the leading e-commerce platform in the United States and many global markets is an enormous advantage. Amazon benefits regardless of which sellers win during the holidays because it controls fulfillment, advertising, and transaction flow. With expectations reset and retail momentum building, Amazon looks well positioned into year-end.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: So the other company that I love in retail right now is I love Amazon.\n[00:00:09] Lee Jackson: Really? Okay. That's interesting. I, I can see why.\n[00:00:13] Doug McIntyre: so I really love Amazon for this quarter, and it's not just because AWS is gonna do well or they're gonna say that they're doing well or doing badly with ai, they will have a very, very good quarter with just the Amazon e-commerce business, similar to Walmart, you know?\n\n繼續閱讀\n[00:00:32] Yep. Lots and lots of leverage. Lot of third parties. Um. You know, b basically host themselves on Amazon. Right. I, I lo I love Amazon for this holiday period.\n[00:00:42] Lee Jackson: Well, I do too. And it's underperformed this year, so Yeah. So, and, and, and Buffet owns some Amazon, so it's the only other tech stock really that's in there other than Apple and Google.\n\n[00:00:54] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. And I like the stock particularly because even if AWS isn't a home run for this, this quarter, uh, e-commerce could be.\n[00:01:03] Lee Jackson: Yeah. And, it's AWS is a home run for the long haul, that's for sure.\n[00:01:08] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Well, it has been the short haul too, but there it's one of those, uh, potential disappointments.\n[00:01:14] Yeah. In the AI growth they've put a lot of money in. So I would look at Amazon as a maybe AWS is now, uh, not as quite as attractive because AI is getting more competitive and it's expensive. But when you hold the lead in e-commerce in the United States and a bunch of other countries, that's a good poll position to have.\n[00:01:37] Lee Jackson: Yeah, it really is. It really is.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

(NASDAQ: ROKU ) ranks among the best high growth stocks to buy now . Guggenheim maintained a Buy rating on Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU), but increased its price target to $115 from $110 on December 4. According to the firm, Roku’s “core CTV building blocks and incremental revenue drivers into 2026” are expected to contribute to growth that exceeds expectations and boosts investor confidence.\nGuggenheim has increased Roku’s revenue, gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA projections for the fourth quarter of 2025 and 2026. The updated guidance takes into account new revenue streams, including data fees for off-platform inventory and contributions from a growing variety of DSP partners, such as Amazon, as well as heightened confidence in the market for connected TV advertising.\n\nIn addition, Guggenheim believes Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) will gain from Winter Olympics-related publicity in Q1, estimating 14% core growth versus consensus projections of 12%. Political marketing and World Cup-related spending are also expected to provide further tailwinds this year.\nOn the other hand, the firm addressed concerns about Netflix possibly acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, arguing that it does not believe the potential merger will have a meaningful impact on Roku’s distribution or video advertising revenue.\nFounded in 2002, Roku, Inc.

      "Content": "Billionaires Sell Amazon Stock and Buy a Quantum Computing Stock Up 3,050% Since 2023\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: RGTI\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Israel Englander, Ken Griffin, and Steven Schonfeld -- hedge fund managers who beat the S&P 500 over the past three years -- sold Amazon and bought Rigetti in the third quarter.\nAmazon is effectively using artificial intelligence to boost sales and improve efficiency across its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses, and the stock price is attractive.\nRigetti benefits from vertical integration and multi-chip processors that may give it an edge in building large-scale quantum computers, but the stock price is beyond absurd.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIn the third quarter, a few wealthy hedge fund managers sold shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and bought shares of Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) , a quantum computing stock that has advanced 3,050% since January 2023.\nIsrael Englander at Millennium Management sold 787,900 shares of Amazon, reducing his position by 17%. He also added 522,100 shares of Rigetti.\nKen Griffin at Citadel Advisors sold 1.6 million shares of Amazon, reducing his position by 35%. He also added 51,700 shares of Rigetti.\nSteven Schonfeld at Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 253,700 shares of Amazon, reducing his position by 72%. He also added 8,900 shares of Rigetti.\nImportantly, all three hedge fund managers beat the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the past three years, which makes them good sources of inspiration. Here's what investors should know about Amazon and Rigetti.\nAmazon: The artificial intelligence stock the billionaires sold Amazon has a strong position in three industries. It runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe by gross merchandise volume, it is the largest retail advertiser in the world by sales, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud by cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue.\n\nThe company is leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) to improve sales and efficiency. Its AI shopping assistant, Rufus, is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales this year; shoppers are 60% more likely to make a purchase when they engage Rufus. Amazon has also developed more than 1,000 generative AI tools to optimize tasks like inventory placement, demand forecasting, and last-mile delivery.\nMeanwhile, AWS has been introducing AI features at a rapid clip. In the past few months, it added tools to Bedrock AgentCore that help customers build and deploy generative AI agents. The company also added autonomous agents for software development, security fixes, and performance monitoring. And it expanded its portfolio of pretrained models.\n\nStory Continues\nStrong third-quarter financial results suggest those innovations are paying off. Revenue increased 13% to $180 billion, driven by particularly strong sales growth in the advertising services and cloud computing segments. Meanwhile, excluding two one-time charges, operating income increased 25% to $21.7 billion, meaning the company is becoming increasingly profitable (i.e., operating income outpaced revenue).\n\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 32 times earnings look reasonable, especially when the company beat the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 23% during the past six quarters.\nSo why did Israel Englander, Ken Griffin, and Steven Schonfeld sell shares of Amazon in the third quarter? Concerns about tariffs may have factored into the decision, or maybe they saw compelling buying opportunities elsewhere. Regardless, do not assume they have lost confidence. All three still own Amazon, and excluding options, the stock is still a top-10 holding for Englander and Griffin.\nRigetti Computing: The quantum computing stock the billionaires bought Rigetti specializes in superconducting quantum computing, a modality by which microscopic superconducting circuits are cooled to near absolute zero to create qubits, the basic unit of information in quantum computers. The company has two important competitive moats:\nRigetti benefits from vertical integration, meaning it realizes cost efficiencies by controlling much of its supply chain. The company owns a chip fabrication facility where it manufactures quantum processors; it also develops the infrastructure (hardware and software) required to deliver cloud-based quantum services.\nRigetti developed the first multi-chip quantum processor, a large chip comprising several smaller chiplets. Scaling quantum computers -- building systems with enough qubits to solve useful problems -- is difficult because of high error rates. But Rigetti believes its multi-chip architecture will help overcome that problem.\n\nHowever, widely useful quantum computers -- meaning systems that fix errors in real time and have enough qubits to solve complex problems -- are probably a decade or two away. Experts think quantum systems will need 10,000 to 1 million physical qubits to be widely useful, and Rigetti's product roadmap doesn't even contemplate 1,000-quibit systems until 2027.\nBasil Alsikafi, portfolio manager at White Brook Capital, in his third-quarter investor letter highlighted Rigetti's mismatched fundamentals. Year to date, Rigetti reported revenue of $5 million but a net loss of $198 million, meaning losses have exceeded sales 40 times over. Even more alarming is the valuation.\nRigetti trades at 860 times sales. For context, Palantir is the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 at 115 times sales, which itself is absurd. Rigetti is seven times more expensive. Also, the company has rapidly diluted shareholders by issuing stock to compensate for its losses. The number of outstanding shares rose 71% in the past year.\n\nSo why did Englander, Griffin, and Schonfeld buy shares of Rigetti? I think the decision is about momentum. They may hope to turn a quick profit and then sell the shares. It would be wrong to assume they have lasting conviction in Rigetti. None of the three hedge fund managers have a consequential amount of money invested in the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "3 of the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nDavid Jagielski, CPA, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:58 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSM\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points The stocks listed here all have market caps of more than $1 trillion.\nThey are among the leading companies in tech, but their valuations still aren't terribly high with respect to earnings.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAre you worried that you've missed out on the opportunity to generate a great return from artificial intelligence (AI) stocks? There are still plenty of good and reasonably priced AI stocks you can add to your portfolio today. And many of them are already large, safe, and established players in tech.\nHeading into 2026, three AI stocks that I think possess the most upside are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) . Here's why it's not too late to invest in these three tech giants.\nAlphabet It may come as a surprise to some that Alphabet is on this list. It is, after all, already one of the most valuable companies in the world. Its market cap of $3.7 trillion puts it not all that far behind the world's most valuable company, Nvidia , which is worth $4.3 trillion. Once a company gets that valuable, it becomes harder to keep the growth going.\n\nThe reason Alphabet still looks like a fantastic buy going into 2026 is that it can still go higher. For a while, investors were skeptical about its ability to continue to dominate in search, its core business, amid concerns that AI chatbots would steer users away from Google. And there may still be many skeptics out there, which is why Alphabet isn't the most valuable company in the world right now, which I believe is where it should rank given how massive its business is.\nAI has enabled Alphabet to enhance Google Search and add value for creators on YouTube. But don't forget that it also has a rapidly expanding robotaxi business in Waymo. Its cloud business is expanding, and the company is also making its own chips.\nIts operations are far more diverse than many other AI stocks out there, including Nvidia's. And yet, Alphabet's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28. That's modest in comparison to the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF where the average forward earnings multiple is just under 30. Alphabet should command a far higher premium than where it's at today, which is why, even at its current valuation, it can be a no-brainer buy heading into next year.\n\nAmazon Another obvious pick looks to be Amazon, whose valuation is $2.4 trillion, which remains firmly behind both Nvidia and Alphabet. Over the past 12 months, Amazon's stock price has actually declined by 4%. This is another example of an AI stock that may be worthy of a higher valuation.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company is known primarily for its online marketplace and its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a terrific growth driver. But in addition to that, Amazon also has a robotaxi business of its own, Zoox. It's not as big or popular as Waymo, but its toaster-designed vehicles look sleeker and more modern and could be more ideal for operating as robotaxis.\n\nAmazon has also been expanding its same-day delivery of fresh groceries to more markets recently, which can steal some market share from rival Walmart . Amazon has done a great job of predicting and anticipating purchases on its online marketplace, and replicating that success with groceries could make that an underrated opportunity where its AI capabilities can shine and give it an advantage.\nGiven the diversification of Amazon's business and plentiful growth opportunities, this is a stock that should also be worth more; it trades at a forward P/E of 27.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing In contrast to the other tech giants listed above, there's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC as it is also known. Its business is not as diversified, and that works to its advantage. TSMC makes chips for tech companies, including Nvidia. Its low-cost operations make it difficult for Intel and other rivals to compete. The Taiwan-based company plays an important role in the AI world due to the industry's dependence on its foundry.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30, TSMC's revenue rose by 30%, and its diluted per-share profit jumped by 39%. Not only has its growth been impressive, but it has incredibly strong operating margins of around 50%.\nThe stock has rallied more than 40% this year and has a $1.5 trillion market cap. But with a forward P/E of just under 24, it's the cheapest stock on this list.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.
