      "Content": "What Wall Street Thinks Amazon Will Be Worth 1 Year From Now. 1 Reason They Might Be Right\n\nThomas Niel, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 11:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Analysts at Wells Fargo and Oppenheimer raised their bullish price targets for Amazon to $295 and $305 per share, respectively.\nThis averages out to $300 per share, a price target that's definitely within the realm of possibility.\nThere may be a path for Amazon shares to reach far higher prices between now and December 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nAs the books close on 2025, what's top of mind among investors is which stocks will deliver strong returns in 2026. In terms of \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks, all eyes may be on how Nvidia or Microsoft perform from here. But another Magnificent Seven component you may want to take a closer look at is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) .\nBased on the latest major sell-search research published on the e-commerce and cloud computing giant, shares may be in for a moderately strong rally over the next 12 months.\nWith this in mind, let's take a closer look and see how this plays into Amazon price predictions for 2026 .\nAmazon analysts raise their respective price targets As one of the world's largest companies by market cap, Amazon receives heavy coverage from the sell-side analyst community. Since the start of December alone, analysts at two firms, Wells Fargo and Oppenheimer, have each issued ratings updates.\nAt Wells Fargo, analyst Ken Gawrelski reiterated his \"overweight\" rating on Amazon, raising his price target from $292 to $295 per share. Analysts at Oppenheimer also reiterated their \"outperform\" rating, raising their price target from $290 to $305 per share.\n\nAveraging out these two price targets results in a price target of around $300 per share. And $300 per share is a nice, round number. Split-adjusted, hitting it would also represent a new share price milestone.\nBetter yet, besides these two factors, there's something else about $300 per share: Hitting it is perfectly attainable within the next 12 months.\nOne reason why there's a clear path to $300 per share Yes, when it comes to share price appreciation, it's typically several factors, working together, that drive a stock to materially higher prices. In the case of Amazon and its potential to reach $300 per share by December 2026, a similar dynamic is at play. Earnings growth remains a major catalyst for the Magnificent Seven component.\n\nThe top end of sell-side forecasts call for Amazon to report earnings of $8.92 per share next fiscal year. This implies that shares sell for as little as 26 times forward earnings right now. That's a fair multiple, in line with the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of other Magnificent Seven stocks. Still, these stocks could experience valuation expansion in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nBefore fears of an AI slowdown fueled a pullback earlier this year, top tech stocks like Amazon were selling for nearly 35 times forward earnings. A return to such high valuations may be in the cards. With inflation easing, the chances of further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve may be climbing higher.\n\nLower interest rates are typically a positive for growth stock valuations. Moreover, further evidence may emerge that the AI boom will continue unabated in 2026, fueling a sectorwide rerating for AI-exposed major tech stocks.\nThe bottom line If Amazon meets or beats current earnings projections, and rerates to a mid-30s forward P/E, the stock could climb above $300 per share, specifically to around $312 per share.\nConsidering this path to the upside, as Amazon shares start slowly bouncing back, you may want to consider grabbing a position before this rebound gains further momentum.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $505,641 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,143,283 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 974 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

( RIVN , Financials ) wrapped up 2025 with 42,247 vehicle deliveries , coming in slightly below Wall Street's forecast and marking an 18% drop from the previous year.

Rodzianko said that Amazon's future multiple seems too high and might go back to its average, especially when the market processes the high costs of AI related investments.\nBased on a forward P/E of 25 and estimated FY27 profits per share of $10.25, the analyst set a 12-month price objective of $255 per share. That goal is lower than the current average estimate of $295.\nRodzianko also suggested moving portfolios toward lower-beta assets, such as government bonds, since he thought that equities prices may fall and the market might become tighter in the longer run.\nInvestors will turn to Amazon's next quarterly results for further information on margins and long-term AI monetization methods, which are still important factors in determining the company's value.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Here's how much the world's richest people made in 2025\n\nQuartz\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 9:03 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIt was a record-breaking year for the world's richest people.\nIn 2025, the world’s 500 wealthiest individuals saw their fortunes balloon by an unprecedented $2.2 trillion, driving their combined net worth to nearly $12 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nThis surge was fueled by robust gains across stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities, buoyed by President Donald Trump unleashing a free-market-blitz, cutting corporate taxes and loosening regulations.\n\nTo no surprise, Big Tech dominated the index , as a stock market frenzy for artificial intelligence saw market caps surge.\nAbout a quarter of the index's gains came from just eight people, with all but one in tech. This includes Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Alphabet co-founder Larry Page, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\nAlthough, that's down from last year, when the same eight billionaires accounted for 43% of the total gains.\nMusk continued to top the list. Even as Tesla stock oscillated amid supply chain concerns, Musk's waning popularity, and competition from Chinese electric vehicle makers, his fortunes grew to nearly $623 billion, up by more than $190 billion.\nBut Ellison briefly eclipsed Musk as the world's richest man in September, due to a sudden surge in Oracle's share price, rallying around 25% for the entire month, as the cloud infrastructure company unveiled a $300 billion contract with OpenAI and ramped up AI spending. Yet, since then, broader tech market corrections and concerns about Oracle's rising debt have tempered those gains, with its stock down about 40% since.\n\nTrump and his family saw their net worth reach $6.8 billion, up $282 million in a year, according to the index. Trump’s business ventures span real estate, social media, and financial services, with many explicitly capitalizing on his political following. Just three days before his inauguration, Trump launched the meme coin $TRUMP, and soon offered its top holders a private dinner with him. The president has been widely criticized for the coin, which had added more than $200 million to the family's wealth, according to the index. Columbia Law’s Richard Briffault called it “doubly corrupt,” as Trump simultaneously oversees the cryptocurrency industry’s deregulation.\nWhile U.S. equities posted strong returns, international markets outshone them. The S&P 500 Index posted an annual increase of 17%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng saw gain of 22% and 27%, respectively.\nBut it was a blockbuster year for precious metals, posting one of their best years in decades, as investors poured into safe haven assets like gold and silver. Copper and rare earths, key materials for producing the batteries and electrical wires needed to power green energy, were also in high demand. Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart and Chile’s Luksic family saw their fortunes balloon by billions.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Just Went All in on AI, Buying Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet. Could AI Stocks Still Deliver Big Returns in 2026?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Druckenmiller opened positions in these three AI leaders in the third quarter of 2025.\nThe billionaire has invested in AI stocks throughout this AI boom.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nWhen investing, it's often a great idea to consider the moves of billionaire fund managers. They've demonstrated their knowledge of the stock market over the years, so by following their lead on certain occasions, you might score an investing win too. This doesn't mean you should always copy their moves, though. They might have a tolerance for risk that differs from yours or a shorter or longer investment horizon, for example.\n\nAnd it's important to remember that even these experts often disagree -- while one billionaire may pile into a particular stock, another billionaire may sell or avoid it. So it's key to pay attention to their moves, but then consider your own strategy and budget before taking action.\nToday, I'm taking a look at the recent moves of Stanley Druckenmiller, who oversees $4 billion in 13F securities as head of the Duquesne Family Office. Managers of more than $100 million must declare the buying or selling of these securities to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis -- and this is great for us because it allows us a glimpse into the investment moves of these experts.\nLet's check out Druckenmiller's latest moves and consider whether AI stocks still may deliver big returns in 2026.\n30 years of investment success So, first, it's important to consider Druckenmiller's background. The billionaire operated Duquesne Capital Management for 30 years, and during that time, he didn't have any money-losing years -- and he delivered an annual average return of 30%. Druckenmiller closed the fund about 15 years ago, but he continues to manage money at the helm of his family office .\n\nDruckenmiller has been an investor in AI stocks in recent years, but he shocked the market when he exited top-performing players Nvidia in late 2024 and Palantir Technologies in early 2025. And only one AI stock -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- is among the top five positions in his portfolio. The stock has a 5.2% weight in the portfolio for the No. 4 spot.\nStill, in the third quarter of last year, Druckenmiller made three moves that could be seen as a renewed shift into top AI players. Here they are in detail:\nDruckenmiller opened a position in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , buying 437,070 shares. The stock now makes up 2.3% of his portfolio.\nHe opened a position in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , buying 76,100 shares. The stock makes up 1.3% of Druckenmiller's holdings.\nThe billionaire opened a position in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . He bought 102,200 shares, and the stock makes up 0.6% of his portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\nAI in 2026 These stocks may not be Druckenmiller's biggest positions, but it's clear that he's confident about the future of AI. Now the question is: Could AI stocks still deliver big returns in 2026?\nIt's true that AI players have soared in recent years, and the valuations of many also have climbed. But certain players, such as Druckenmiller's purchases, remain reasonably priced considering what I'm about to mention right now.\nAMZN PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nWe're still in the early stages of the AI growth story. While training of AI models has been a big thing in recent times, we have yet to actually apply these models to real-life situations in a major way. This will involve inferencing, or the powering of the models through their \"thinking\" processes so that they can serve their purposes. We should see growth here throughout industries -- and down the road, robotics, telecom, and many other areas should keep the AI growth engine running.\n\nJensen Huang's prediction And even in the next few years, we may see a huge wave of growth. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang predicts AI infrastructure spending may reach as much as $4 trillion.\nTrends tech companies have seen so far support these growth forecasts, with demand for AI products and services soaring in recent quarters.\n\nOf course, stocks may not continue to climb without any interruption -- and it's impossible to predict when temporary pauses may occur. But, considering these points I've mentioned, AI stocks could continue to deliver big returns in 2026, and even if they don't, they're well-positioned to do so over the long term. That's why, for growth investors, it's a great idea to follow billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller's moves and pick up a few reasonably priced AI stocks as we head into 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Amazon Downgraded to Hold Amid Valuation Concerns\n\nFaizan Farooque\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 7:02 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nAmazon.com Inc. ( AMZN , Financials ) was downgraded to Hold by Invictus Origin's Oliver Rodzianko , who warned that current valuation levels and macroeconomic risks justify caution despite the company's fundamental strength.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe downgrade comes after investors became excited about AI driven growth, which has pushed up P/E ratios across large-cap tech. Rodzianko said that Amazon's future multiple seems too high and might go back to its average, especially when the market processes the high costs of AI-related investments.\nBased on a forward P/E of 25 and estimated FY27 profits per share of $10.25, the analyst set a 12-month price objective of $255 per share. That goal is lower than the current average estimate of $295.\nRodzianko also suggested moving portfolios toward lower-beta assets, such as government bonds, since he thought that equities prices may fall and the market might become tighter in the longer run.\nInvestors will turn to Amazon's next quarterly results for further information on margins and long-term AI monetization methods, which are still important factors in determining the company's value.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "IBM Gains 33% in a Year: Is it Worth Investing in the Stock Now?\n\nSupriyo Bose\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 6:12 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IBM\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation IBM has surged 33% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 79.1%, driven by a strong demand for hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) products. The stock has outperformed peers like Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN. While Microsoft has gained 14.2%, Amazon rallied 2.9% over this period.\nOne-Year Stock Price Performance of IBM\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSolid Hybrid Cloud & AI Demand Buoy IBM IBM is poised to benefit from healthy demand trends for hybrid cloud and AI, which drive the Software and Consulting segments. The company’s growth is expected to be aided by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long run. A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investment in growth opportunities will likely boost profitability.\n\nWith a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management. This, in turn, has translated into a healthy demand for IBM hybrid cloud solutions. In addition, the buyout of HashiCorp has significantly augmented the company’s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. HashiCorp’s tool sets complement IBM RedHat’s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management and bolstering its hybrid multi-cloud approach.\n\nwatsonx: IBM’s Core Technology Platform IBM’s watsonx platform is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. This enterprise-ready AI and data platform comprises three products to help organizations accelerate and scale AI: the watsonx.ai studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning, the watsonx.data fit-for-purpose data store built on an open lake house architecture and the watsonx.governance toolkit to help enable AI workflows to be built with responsibility and transparency.\n\nIBM Focusing More on Quantum Computing IBM has collaborated with Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO to develop a connected network of fault-tolerant quantum computers by 2030. The companies aim to pool their individual resources and key expertise to create a pathway toward an exponentially large computational space, leading to the formation of a quantum computing Internet. This is likely to create a platform where many distributed quantum-based technologies, such as quantum computers, quantum sensors and quantum communications, are connected to share information across distances.\n\nAs part of this collaborative effort, IBM intends to develop a quantum networking unit (QNU) to serve as the interface linking several quantum computers to a quantum processing unit (QPU). This will facilitate the conversion of stationary quantum information in the QPU into \"flying\" quantum information for transfer across potentially multiple quantum computers through a network. Cisco is developing a high-speed software protocol framework that can continuously and dynamically reconfigure network paths to drive the quantum information transfer required for a given quantum algorithm or application.\n\nIt has also unveiled IBM Quantum Nighthawk – the most advanced quantum processor developed to date. With an architecture that complements high-performing quantum software, IBM Quantum Nighthawk boasts superior qubit connectivity that enables users to execute circuits with 30% more complexity than its predecessors. The quantum processor brings a new dimension to the realm of quantum computing by enabling users to increase the complexity of algorithms in the quantum hardware. As users seek to achieve quantum advantage — where quantum computers outperform the classical ones — the new quantum processor could pave the way for technological innovations across the quantum ecosystem, with future reiterations far exceeding the current performance.\n\nStory Continues\nEstimate Revision Trend of IBM IBM is currently witnessing an uptrend in estimate revisions.

So what should we be looking out for there?\n00:11 Sucharita\nYeah, I'm in Charlotte and it was in the 70s here too. So uh there definitely seems to be um an an issue with warmer weather which will adversely impact certain categories like for instance, apparel, um which typically relies on some of that colder weather to make its Q1 numbers. Um so the big factors that we're looking at, of course, are interest rates. That's going to influence some of the big ticket purchases um for anything from appliances to home goods. Um so that's certainly one factor. You have unemployment rates creeping up and that certainly affects um a a significant number of consumers. We've been hearing a lot about this K-shaped economy, um and particularly the bottom of the K is where we see that lower consumer confidence. We have an election year coming up in 2026. All of these are factors which may cause consumers to hesitate. On the other hand, at the top of the K, you're seeing um the stock market at uh approaching its all-time high. You have um the higher end um of the consumer demographic um continuing to spend, often driving the numbers higher. You have even luxury retailers, companies like Louis Vuitton seemingly having a little bit of a a rebound in the market as well.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAnd we got time for one more. So I'll just give you the floor here. What should we be looking out for in 2026 or anything else you want to hit on?\n01:29 Sucharita\nWell, with 2026, um there is just a lot of uncertainty. If there's one theme, it is just that we're still in the early innings and there is just not a clear um you know, kind of there's there's not a clear vision of what may happen with respect to retail. Um we heard with the earlier speaker also a lot of uncertainty around AI and how AI is impacting large businesses. Um a number of retailers almost on a weekly basis seem to issue press releases talking about how AI is positively impacting their business, but it still remains to be seen if they're actually seeing gains, if they're actually able to make their businesses more efficient, um because ultimately what drives retail success is both their location strategy as well as whether or not they actually have the merchandise that people want to purchase.\n02:26 Speaker A\nLots of wild cards. We are definitely living in interesting times. Thank you so much Sucharita.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The Amazon chair executed these sales under a pre-arranged 10b5-1 trading plan that coincided with his wedding to Lauren Sanchez. This brings his total stock sales since 2002 to over $50 billion.\n\nFormer Oracle CEO Safra Catz ranked second, selling 12.5 million shares valued at $2.5 billion. Catz, who stepped down as CEO in September to become vice chair of the board, exercised and sold performance-based stock options received earlier in the year.\nMichael Dell of Dell Technologies sold over 16.2 million shares worth $2.2 billion. Unlike most other executives on the list, Dell did not use a 10b5-1 plan for his transactions, which occurred in June and October. Dell and his wife recently announced a $6.25 billion donation to launch \"Trump Accounts\" for 25 million American children.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold 6 million shares for over $1 billion as the company became the world’s first $4 trillion company in July and first $5 trillion company in October.\n\nArista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal sold 7.56 million shares worth $975.8 million.

      "Content": "3 Reasons Why Amazon Will Be the Comeback Stock of the Year in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 3:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Growth at Amazon's cloud computing segment is reaccelerating.\nAdvertising services is the fastest-growing division within Amazon.\nYet, the tech giant's stock is at the same valuation level as its peers.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAmazon had a disappointing 2025, with the stock only rising around 6% while the S&P 500 gained around 18%. That's a sharp underperformance and will have been frustrating for investors since nearly every other big tech company had a much better year. However, thanks to its underperformance, Amazon may be slated to enjoy a much better year ahead.\nSo, could Amazon be the comeback stock of the year in 2026? I've got three reasons why I think that will be the case, and investors should consider adding Amazon to their portfolio as a result.\n1. Amazon Web Services is picking up steam Although Amazon Web Services (AWS) may not be the first thing you think of when you hear Amazon, it's the most important in my opinion. AWS is Amazon's cloud computing wing, and is benefiting from two massive tailwinds.\nFirst is the general migration to the cloud. Before cloud computing, companies had to host websites on premises and maintain expensive networking equipment. They also had to maintain servers to hold information, and if a server went down, it could have catastrophic consequences.\n\nNow, many companies are migrating these workloads to the cloud, and AWS is the largest cloud provider in the market.\nCloud computing is also a key part of artificial intelligence, as few companies have the resources to build out their own data centers to house expensive computing equipment. Instead, many are opting to rent computing power from AWS to run these workloads, which is kick-starting a new phase of growth for AWS.\nIn the third quarter, the AWS segment saw revenue rise 20% year over year -- its fastest growth rate in multiple years. This is a big deal for Amazon, as AWS accounted for 66% of operating profits during the quarter. With Amazon's most profitable business unit reaccelerating its growth rate and well-positioned to cash in on two massive trends toward the cloud, it bodes well for Amazon's future.\n\n2. Advertising services are boosting commerce margins Another key part of Amazon's business is advertising. Although Amazon doesn't break out its operating margin as it does with AWS, it's obvious that advertising services have played a key role in boosting Amazon's commerce operating margins over the past few years. Most advertising companies have an operating margin of around 30% to 40%. And so with Amazon's ad services generating $17.7 billion in revenue during Q3, the low end of that range would indicate $5.3 billion in operating profits.\n\nStory Continues\nIn Q3, Amazon's North American and international commerce businesses combined to produce about $6 billion in operating profits. This shows how critical Amazon's ad services are for overall profitability. With advertising services posting the fastest growth rate of any division in Q3 (rising 24% year over year), this sets Amazon up nicely for a strong 2026.\n\n3. Amazon's valuation is reasonable Before 2025, I would have been fine with someone calling Amazon's stock overvalued. Compared to other big tech players, Amazon's stock carried a premium valuation from an operating price-to-earnings ratio standpoint.\nNow, it's right in the middle of the pack, trading at a valuation level comparable to its peers. This allows the stock price for Amazon's stock to rise and fall alongside its business performance, rather than have its business gains go toward offsetting an expensive valuation.\nFor 2026, Wall Street analysts expect Amazon to grow sales at around 11%. That's about market average pace, which shouldn't come as a surprise to investors. The big deal will be how much Amazon's operating profits grow. As long as AWS and advertising services continue to post excellent results, its operating profit growth should be faster than revenue growth, leading to stock outperformance.\n\nIf Amazon can deliver that, I have no doubt that it will mount a huge comeback in 2026. If it fails to do that, then 2026 could be another disappointing year for Amazon shareholders.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

DefiLlama data shows $616 million in Ethereum ETF selling in December, adding to November’s $1.4 billion in liquidations.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 stock index is still hovering near all-time highs.\nOther assets, such as gold, are also pushing to record highs amid strong macroeconomic tailwinds.\nTo be sure, Ethereum has plenty of bullish institutional supporters.\nTom Lee, chairman of digital asset treasury firm Bitmine, said on X that he expects Ethereum to have a good 2026.\n“Gold moves lead crypto,” Lee said. “If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?”\nCrypto market movers Bitcoin is up 1.7% over the past 24 hours, trading at $89,135.\nEthereum is up 2% over the past 24 hours and trading at $3,040.\nWhat we’re reading Six blockbuster crypto IPOs to watch in 2026 — DL News\nBitcoin miners to tap Zaporizhzhia nuclear power — if there’s a peace deal in Ukraine — DL News\nCrypto.com to Hire In-House Market Maker for Prediction Markets — Unchained\nAlt season ‘26: What it will take — Milk Road\nFive crypto airdrops to watch for in 2026 — DL News\nLance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

      "Content": "2 Top Stocks to Double Up on Right Now\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 1:45 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nPM\n\nKey Points Amazon is seeing strong operating leverage in its e-commerce business, while AWS growth is starting to accelerate.\nPhilip Morris International is a strong growth stock in a defensive industry.\nBoth stocks are attractively valued.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nInvestors have been encouraged to double down on stocks they own that are down, but it can also be a smart move to add to stocks you own, even when you already have gains in them. This is an often overlooked strategy, but one that can be effective.\nLet's look at two growth stocks you can double up on right now.\nAmazon Amazon 's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock isn't too far from its highs, but it also hasn't moved a whole lot over the past five years, up less than 40%. However, now may be a good time to add to positions in the stock heading into 2026.\nThe company is already seeing strong operating leverage in its e-commerce business, as demonstrated by its North American segment's adjusted operating income climbing 28% last quarter on just an 11% increase in sales. This stems from its embrace of robots and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhile Amazon is widely known to have the world's largest e-commerce and cloud computing businesses, it is also the biggest operator and manufacturer of industrial robots. It just doesn't get the credit it deserves in this area, since it makes the robots for its own use. However, it's making big advancements in this area and deploys more than 1 million robots in its fulfillment centers, all coordinated by its DeepFleet AI model.\nAmazon has also become one of the leading digital marketing companies in the world through its sponsored ad program. The company is using AI in this business to help merchants create better campaigns and improve targeting. As a result, this was one of its fastest-growing businesses in Q3, with revenue for this high-gross-margin service climbing 24%.\n\nMeanwhile, its cloud computing unit, AWS, could be its biggest catalyst next year. The segment has been growing quickly and is starting to see revenue accelerate. With capacity constrained and demand for AI services growing, the company is investing heavily in capex to build out its AI data center footprint, which should drive strong revenue growth next year.\nWith Amazon's stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio less than 30 times 2026 analyst estimates, the stock is attractively valued both historically and versus retail peers like Walmart and Costco Wholesale , making it a great stock to double up on.\nPhilip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) stock has had a strong year, up around 35%, but it's off its highs and has been stuck in neutral since the summer. Meanwhile, the company is a unique growth stock in a defensive industry, which makes it a strong candidate to double up on.\n\nStory Continues\nPhilip Morris benefits from not selling cigarettes in the rapidly declining U.S. market. International markets are seeing volumes hold up much better, while the company continues to see strong pricing power across the globe. However, it is the company's smokeless portfolio that is powering its growth.\n\nIts popular nicotine pouch brand, Zyn, is leading the way. Shipments in its main U.S. market soared 37% last quarter, while retail sales volumes (offtake) jumped by 39%. The product is finally no longer capacity-constrained, and Philip Morris is beginning to invest more in promotions to help drive growth. Meanwhile, global shipments outside its original Nordic markets more than doubled.\nThe company's heated tobacco offering, Iqos, is also seeing strong growth in international markets. Volumes grew 15.5% in Q3, led by growth in Japan and Europe and increasing strength in new markets.\nMeanwhile, the company has a big opportunity after buying back its rights to sell the product in the U.S. It's currently waiting for approval from the FDA for its new Iluma delivery system before a full launch in the U.S. The best thing about Philip Morris' Zyn and Iqos growth is that both products have much better unit economics than its traditional cigarettes, helping drive gross margin and profits.\n\nPhilip Morris stock is also attractively valued, trading at around a forward P/E ratio of under 19.5, based on the analyst consensus for 2026, and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.85. Stocks with positive PEG ratios below 1 are generally considered undervalued.\nIts valuation and growth prospects make the stock a top option to double up on.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Nearly half of the increase comes from the MLB’s new rights deal in November, which expanded coverage to NBC/Peacock and Netflix, and the NBA’s 11-year megadeal. Renewing a partnership with ESPN/ABC while placing longtime partner Warner Bros. Discovery’s TNT on the bench in favor of NBC/Peacock and Amazon Prime, the NBA deal officially kicked off this season.\n\nFor WBD and the NBA, all’s well that ends well:\nNBA ratings climbed roughly 30% in the first month of the season this year , with national games drawing the most views in 15 years. The deal massively expanded the amount of games on broadcast networks, while tapping an Amazon Prime user base that now vastly outnumbers cable subscribers in the US.\nWBD, meanwhile, responded to the loss of the NBA by scooping up a decade of The French Open, which proved a ratings bonanza in its first year in May, as well as a slate of major college football games, the second-most watched sport in the US by far. Earlier this month, the company said it struck a deal to sublicense a group of College Football Playoff games previously scheduled for ESPN.\nFootball Night in America: Still, not every deal has been a clear winner. David Ellison’s new-look Paramount-SkyDance paid $7.7 billion to poach the UFC from ESPN this year. But in a recent filing urging shareholders to reject Paramount’s takeover bid, WBD flagged the price as “above-market” and added that the company could face further pressure if and when the NFL exercises its right to renegotiate a broadcast deal early. Such a maneuver by the top sports league is expected to break the bank for media companies. Just look at Disney: To secure a suite of tertiary NFL media properties this year, the company ceded a full 10% stake in ESPN to the league.\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside .

      "Content": "Joe Rogan Defends Billionaires, Saying 'They're Working 16 Hours A Day.' He Also Thinks Sharing The Wealth Would Make People Hate Them Less\n\nAdrian Volenik\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 7:01 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nWMT\n\nAMZN\n\nGM\n\nComedian Tom Segura joined Joe Rogan for a wide-ranging conversation that included a deep dive into wealth, corporate taxes, and how billionaires are perceived.\nIn the recent episode of “ The Joe Rogan Experience ,” both acknowledged the shady side of tax loopholes, but Rogan also pushed back against the blanket criticism of ultra-wealthy individuals.\n\nDon't Miss:\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nCorporations, Loopholes And Fairness Segura pointed out how some massive companies avoid taxes by moving profits overseas. “They’ll funnel it to Ireland and then not pay tax on it,” he said. Rogan agreed, saying that’s the game wealthy people and corporations play. “Supposedly, that’s what Jeffrey Epstein did for people. He helped people with tax loopholes and, you know, he helped rich people figure out how to save money,” he added.\n\n“[These loopholes] exist for a reason, right?” Segura asked. Rogan shot back, “They’re scumbags. Yeah. They’ve all put it in place. They just want to make sure that they keep the most amount of money possible.”\nEven though Rogan acknowledged these tactics as shady, he argued there’s more nuance when it comes to billionaire founders. “There’s that thing where like ‘no one should be a billionaire,'” Rogan said. “Well, okay, hang on. Do you like having a f***ing iPhone? Somebody had to make that. They’re working 16 hours a day.”\nTrending: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nRogan said that people often idolize tech leaders without realizing the personal toll it can take. He said that no one really wants to be Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) CEO Tim Cook or the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs , adding that Jobs died young because of the intense pressure and workload.\n\nSegura responded that critics aren't always against the success itself, but rather the inequality that follows. “These Amazon warehouse guys are like f***ing dying in the warehouse,” he said. “You have the people at the top with like hundreds of billions of dollars. You can’t trickle any of that down to some of your workers? That always seems like a legit complaint from people to me.”\nSegura said that some of these employees earn as little as $15 an hour, to which Rogan responded that while that’s true, if the founder hadn’t started the company, those jobs wouldn't even be there in the first place. He also added that they should “spread it around.”\n\nStory Continues\n“Seems like probably better for everybody if you spread it around,” he said. “Maybe people wouldn’t hate you as much.”\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth? Private Real Estate— Get Institutional Access Yourself\nPraise For Philanthropy And Simplicity They also highlighted rare examples of billionaires who went against the norm. Segura brought up Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard , who forfeited ownership of the company and profits to fight climate change. Rogan appreciated that kind of move, saying, “He probably did mushrooms one day. He was like, ‘What am I doing? I’m living in this prison.'”\n\nWalmart (NYSE: WMT ) founder Sam Walton was another example of humility. Despite becoming the richest man in America in 1985, Walton chose a modest life in Bentonville, Arkansas. Rogan read out his quote, saying, “Why do I drive a pickup truck? What am I supposed to do? Haul my dogs around in a Rolls-Royce?”\nBut both comedians pointed out that his kids and grandkids don't live the same way. “They’re nepo babies,” Rogan said. “That’s not good. That’s a tough way to live.”\nRead Next: From Moxy Hotels to $12B in Real Estate — The Firm Behind NYC's Trendiest Properties Is Letting Individual Investors In.\nImage: Imagn\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "Worried About an AI Bubble? Buy This Tech Stock in 2026.\n\nBen Gran, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 6:38 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points An estimated 75% of stock market returns since November 2022 have come from AI stocks.\nIn the past six months, Apple has outperformed most AI stocks.\nApple is expecting 10%-12% revenue growth in its current quarter, with strong iPhone sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom has been driving some of the biggest gains in the stock market in recent years. A report from JP Morgan Asset Management found that ever since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns. Major tech companies like Microsoft , Amazon , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in high-powered chips and vast data centers to build the infrastructure of AI, which they hope will lead the next transformative wave of innovation and economic growth.\n\nBut in the past few months, some investors have turned skeptical about the AI stock story. In August 2025, an MIT study was published showing that 95% of generative AI projects at businesses failed to deliver a measurable return on investment. This MIT study was a potential warning sign to investors. If businesses can't figure out how to use AI to make money, save money, or be more productive and efficient, all of this AI capital expenditure (capex) spending by these major tech companies might not pay off, and would be halted.\nSome investors are concerned that AI companies are spending too much on capital expenditures for AI, that AI is not demonstrating enough clear real-world use cases and profitable product opportunities, and that the expected returns on all of this AI capex might not arrive. The AI boom might turn into an AI bubble .\n\nThe good news is that no matter what happens next with AI companies, you can still invest in a major tech stock that might not be affected by a possible AI bubble. Here's a closer look at why this company could be a good stock to buy in 2026.\nApple is outside of any AI bubble Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the world's largest and most influential tech companies, but it's not an \"AI company\" or an \"AI stock\" in the same way as Oracle , Nvidia , Microsoft, or Alphabet is. That's because Apple's not spending nearly as much on AI as these other companies, and Apple's business model doesn't depend on the future promise of AI. In fact, earlier in 2025, Apple was widely criticized for not moving fast enough on AI and being \"behind\" on AI strategy.\n\nBut Apple's patient approach to AI might turn out to be a good thing for Apple shareholders. Apple has managed to avoid getting dragged into a costly AI arms race. Instead of plowing billions of dollars into data centers, Apple has focused on its core business of selling phones and laptops. If you're worried that valuations of AI stocks have gone too high, but you don't want to give up on \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, Apple could be a good choice.\n\nStory Continues\nApple is poised to thrive in 2026 During the past six months, Apple stock is up roughly 33% while the S&P 500 is up 11%. Apple also outperformed major AI stocks like Nvidia and Oracle, and other AI-related tech stocks like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. The launch of the iPhone 17 in September 2025 was a huge success, generating blockbuster demand. Apple is expected to ship 247.4 million iPhones in 2025, a 6.1% year-over-year increase, according to IDC.\nOn its most recent earnings call, in October, Apple announced record-breaking numbers. The company earned $416 billion of revenue in its fiscal year 2025 (an all-time record), and its fourth-quarter revenue of $102.5 billion was an 8% year-over-year increase. iPhone revenue was up 6% year over year and hit a new September-ended quarter record. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.85, another September-ended quarter record, and up 13% year-over-year, excluding a one-time charge from 2024.\n\nApple's services revenue was up 15% year over year in the quarter, which is an all-time record. Services have become a major profit engine for Apple because the margins on digital services are so high compared to physical products. Apple's gross margin for services was about 75% in its latest earnings report, compared to 36% for Apple products.\nAnd the services segment is becoming a bigger slice of Apple's overall revenue. In its Q3 earnings for fiscal year 2025, Apple made more sales from services ($28.75 billion) than it made from all of its non-iPhone products combined (Macs, iPads and Wearables made $24.69 billion of sales).\nAnd there are good reasons for investor optimism about Apple to continue into 2026. The company expects to see 10%-12% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2026, with double-digit iPhone revenue growth. That quarter is wrapping up now and includes the holiday selling period. Analysts have raised their estimate for Apple's earnings per share to $2.67 for the current quarter, up from $1.77 for Q4 of Apple's fiscal 2025.\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio of 34, Apple stock is not cheap compared to where its P/E ratio has been in the past few years. But if investors continue to shy away from high-priced AI stocks, and if more signs of real-world return on investment from AI don't materialize fast enough, Apple could look like a better deal than tech stocks that have more AI exposure.\nUnless some new must-have device gets invented that can replace the iPhone, Apple seems well-positioned to stay highly profitable for a long time to come. No matter what happens next with the possible AI bubble, Apple should be a good stock to buy in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

The retailer endured slumping sales and lagged significantly behind its peers. At the time of this writing, its stock is down more than 27% over the past year and over 40% in the past five years.\n\nToms pressures Target It was also recently announced that activist investor Toms Capital Investment Management increased its stake in the retailer. This adds more pressure to the company, as it could lead to further shakeups in management and strategy. Could this be the spark that ignites Target's comeback?\nIs now the time to buy Target? If Toms can push for real growth and change within the company, Target's stock may benefit over the coming year. Now may be a good time to buy this stock as it's trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of around 12, a steep discount compared to its rivals, Walmart and Amazon .\n\nThe retailer's third-quarter earnings were a mixed bag. Net sales were down 1.5% year over year, but digital sales were up 2.4%. Target remains a Dividend King, having raised its dividend now for 54 consecutive years.\nTarget is expanding its same-day delivery operations to compete with industry peers. Same-day delivery was up 35% in Target's latest quarter. The company is also planning $5 billion in capital expenditures to spur growth in 2026.\nThe company is at risk of shrinking consumer discretionary spending, but if the economy remains steady and the activist investment encourages a turnaround, brighter days could be ahead for shareholders.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Target right now?

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) founder has completed the five-year renovation of his Beverly Hills, California, estate, and the centerpiece isn't the three pickleball courts or the pool with aquatic creature motifs — it's a shiny, stainless steel NASA-inspired space capsule perched in his garden, the New York Post reported .\n\nAs Bezos and wife Lauren Sanchez Bezos settle into the estate, the addition of the futuristic pod signals that the billionaire's obsession with space has moved from the launchpad to the backyard.\nDon't Miss:\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAerial photos of the 10-acre property show a silver, cone-shaped structure that resembles the Apollo 11 command module, according to The Post. The piece is a custom creation from Timothy Oulton Studio, a boutique firm known for its replicas of the 1969 moon landing craft.\nWhile the studio markets the pods as versatile VIP lounges or workspace meeting capsules , the Bezos version is thought to be a space-themed sauna .\n\nThe installation of the capsule isn't just a quirky design choice. It's a thematic extension of the couple's 2025 highlights. Earlier this year, Sanchez Bezos blasted off with an all-female crew on a Blue Origin suborbital flight, celebrating the 11-minute flight with a bachelorette party ahead of her marriage to Bezos in April, the Post reported.\nBy placing a NASA replica next to the estate's Georgian architecture, Bezos is blending Hollywood with space.\nTrending: Sam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\nOther features of the property, once home to Warner Bros. co-founder Jack Warner , are a cactus garden, a stone path leading to a large pool, a viewing deck with a table overlooking the pickleball courts, a firepit and a beach volleyball court, according to The Post.\n\nBezos purchased the 10-acre estate in 2020 from media mogul David Geffen for $165 million. He later expanded the property, paying $10 million for an adjacent lot.\nLast year, The Post reported that Bezos was living in the $90 million Miami mansion he owns while renovations were made to two other properties he purchased nearby.\nBezos said he relocated from Seattle to Miami to be closer to his parents, but financial experts said financial reasons also contributed to the move, according to CBIZ .

The eight most highly valued companies in the world are all AI companies, and it looks like many of them are just getting started.\nWill 2026 be another winning year for AI, or is the bubble about to burst?\nSince there's no way to know, you can feel comfortable buying great AI stocks to gain exposure to the massive potential, but make sure your portfolio is well-diversified with other stocks, too. If you're looking for a top AI stock, here are five great recommendations.\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is a foundry, which means the company produces the semiconductors that its clients design. It's not developing the AI of the future but plays a key role in making it happen. On top of that, TSMC produces chips for all kinds of companies and technology, and that diversification gives it multiple growth drivers.\n\nEven though TSMC is a well-established industry giant, it's still reporting high growth. In the 2025 third quarter, sales were up 41% year over year, driven by smartphones and autonomous vehicles. The company is also highly profitable, with a gross margin of 59.5% in the third quarter, up from 57.8% last year, and an operating margin of 50.6%, up from 47.5% last year.\nTrading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31, TSMC stock looks very attractive today, and AI tailwinds should push it even higher in 2026.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is mostly known for its Google internet search engine, which has around 90% of global market share. That's an incredible moat, and it's a self-reinforcing moat. More searches give it more data, which the company uses to provide improved products and a better search experience.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is monetizing its user base with a robust advertising business. It uses AI in multiple ways to both increase user engagement with its ecosystem -- making it more attractive to advertisers -- and refine algorithms to get ads in front of the right people. It also offers its Gemini large-language models (LLM) for personal and business use.\nHowever, Alphabet is a lot more than Google these days, with many segments, including YouTube and Android, that diversify its business and make it an excellent stock to own for the long term. It also trades at 31 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is a great entry point.\n\nStory Continues\n3. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the largest cloud services provider in the world, with almost a third of the global market. That gives it an edge in the space, and it's working hard to keep its dominant position.\nCEO Andy Jassy is always talking about the shift from on-premises spend to the cloud and sees a huge change happening over the next 10 to 20 years. That's a long growth runway for Amazon.\n\nThe company plans to spend more than $125 billion on AI development in 2026, more than any other rival hyperscaler. Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth accelerated in the third quarter to more than 20% year over year, and at its size, that's an impressive feat.\nAI is a huge growth driver for Amazon today but the company has a varied business that makes it a strong bet for long-term growth. Amazon stock trades at an attractive P/E ratio of 33, giving it extra room to expand in 2026.\n4. Nvidia Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) growth may be slowing, and as more companies enter the AI development race, it's facing stiffer competition. But there's no question that it has built up a formidable AI platform, with a large array of vertically integrated products its clients are invested in, giving it a leg up on newer options. The company is not letting up on innovation and keeps launching new products with even better technology to protect its moat and industry dominance.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is expensive, trading at 47 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is why the stock will fall if growth begins to decelerate. However, the company is a profit machine, and analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) to more than triple through 2028. Nvidia tends to beat on the bottom line, and if it can continue to demonstrate high growth and soaring profits, it should keep beating the market in 2026.\n5. Lemonade Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) is a different type of AI company. It's an insurance company first but has used AI and machine learning from the ground up to create a better system for pricing and handling insurance claims. It has attracted young customers from inception who appreciate its digital technology, and as it becomes more well-known, it's onboarding millions of new customers for all kinds of policies.\n\nThe company has reported strong sales growth from the beginning, and growth has been accelerating. In-force premium, its top-line metric, was up 30% year over year in the third quarter. As its algorithms improve and it scales, Lemonade is also heading toward profitability, and management is expecting to hit adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven this year. If it does, expect the stock to soar much higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "'Two Old Dogs Trying To Learn New Tricks' — Dave Ramsey Steps In As $40,000–$50,000 Tax Bill And A 130-Year-Old Farm Trigger A Major Marriage Fight\n\nCasey B. Renner\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 11:01 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nA 130-year-old family farm and a looming $40,000–$50,000 tax bill pushed a routine housing decision into a serious marriage fight. Nearly two years into his marriage, Dan called \"The Ramsey Show\" amid rising tensions over housing and finances.\nAt the center of the disagreement is whether to sell a 130-year-old family farm now and pay an estimated $40,000–$50,000 in capital gains taxes, or keep the land for several more years while purchasing a home another way.\n\nAfter hearing the details, personal finance expert Dave Ramsey said the situation reflected \"two old dogs trying to learn new tricks,\" adding that the issue extended beyond financial calculations.\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nA 130-Year-Old Farm And A $50,000 Question The farm in western Kansas, has been in Dan's family for about 130 years and is valued at roughly $300,000. Dan said his accountant estimated that selling it now would result in combined federal and state capital gains taxes between $40,000 and $50,000.\nHis wife prefers selling the land immediately to buy their “forever home” in cash. Dan, however, proposed a complex alternative: keeping the farm for five more years and using the annual income from wheat and milo sales to “bank” the money for the future tax bill.\n\nCo-host John Delony was quick to point out that the tax bill was likely a sign of deeper issues. \"A capital gain sounds like a distraction to me,\" he said, adding that Dan's plan was a \"complex matrix\" of variables like rain and subsidies that only served to delay a difficult decision.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets?

When combined with the farm equity and $110,000 Dan received from a previous home sale, the couple controls close to $500,000 in assets. While Dan worried about the tax hit, Ramsey stressed simplicity over complex projections, saying, \"Life's a lot simpler — just know it now.\"\n\nStory Continues\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nWhen The Numbers Stop Being The Problem Ramsey asked whether Dan expected to sell the farm at some point regardless of timing. Dan said he did and noted the couple has no children, meaning the land would eventually leave the family.\n\"I'm 90% concerned in this conversation about the fact that you two can't resolve this argument, and I'm only 10% concerned with how you resolve it,\" Ramsey said, emphasizing that the timing of the sale and the tax impact mattered less than how the couple was handling the disagreement .\n\nUltimately, both hosts encouraged Dan to restart the conversation with his wife and focus first on how decisions are made together before determining how to proceed financially.\nRead Next: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nImage: USA Today Network\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

      "Content": "A $500 Investment in Amazon’s IPO Would Be Worth This Today\n\nSarah Sharkey\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 7:13 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nIn some ways, it’s difficult to imagine the world without Amazon. With over 310 million active customers and millions of items sold each day, according to AMZ Scout, the major corporation is deeply embedded in the lives of many.\nToday, Amazon enjoys the position as the world’s fifth-largest company , according to Forbes. But every company starts somewhere, even Amazon. If you had invested at the beginning, you’d have quite a lot of money. We explore exactly how much and how it performed relative to the market.\n\nAmazon’s IPO Price The company went public back on May 15, 1997, according to company records.\nIt entered the market with an IPO price of $18 per share. Since then, it has split four times. When you factor in these splits, the adjusted cost of the IPO is $0.075 per share. In other words, every single IPO share has been converted into 240 shares today.\n\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nFind Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nAmazon’s Current Price As of the close of business on Dec. 29, 2025, Amazon’s stock price was $232.07 per share, according to Yahoo! Finance.\nHow Much Money You’d Have If You Invested in Amazon’s IPO At first glance, considering the $18 original share price, Amazon’s share price has grown by more than 1,000%. But since it’s more appropriate to consider Amazon’s split-adjusted IPO price, the returns become truly staggering.\nWhen you consider the split-adjusted share price of $0.075 at the time of the IPO, Amazon’s stock has increased by 301,607%. That’s an amazing return for any investor.\n\nIf you had invested $500 in Amazon’s IPO and held it for the last twenty-seven years, your Amazon stock would be worth around $1,508,535.\nAmazon’s Growth Surprised that Amazon’s IPO value seems relatively low? Back in 1997, Amazon was primarily an online bookstore attempting to prove itself as an e-commerce alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar stores. In 1996, the company’s annual filings were around $16 million, according to SEC filing documents. While some certainly saw some potential in Amazon, many didn’t catch on to the genius of its e-commerce aspirations until much later.\n\nOver the years, Amazon has expanded to create an impressive logistics network that gets items to customers quickly. Beyond e-commerce, Amazon has branched out to provide other services, like its media streaming platform and Amazon Web Services.\nHow Has Amazon Performed Compared With the S&P 500? On May 15, 1997, the S&P 500 closed at $836.04 per share, according to Yahoo! Finance. As of market close on Dec. 29, 2025, the S&P 500 reached a value of $6,905.74, according to CNBC. That represents an impressive return of 700% for S&P 500 investors between May 1997 and today. But that’s not even close to the returns offered to Amazon’s initial collection of investors over the same time period.\n\nStory Continues\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nm\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : A $500 Investment in Amazon’s IPO Would Be Worth This Today\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Invest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Amazon.com Inc\n\nGuruFocus News\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2026-01-01, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $188.41. It's currently trading at a price of $230.82. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -22.51%. The company is fair valued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.03\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.16%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n35.51\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n15.1\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n188.41\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $11.33. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -1937.25%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could Spotify Be a Multimillionaire-Maker Stock?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 10:39 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SPOT\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Spotify leads its niche, despite having to compete with some tech giants.\nThe company boasts plenty of growth avenues and a strong competitive edge.\n10 stocks we like better than Spotify Technology ›\nEver since its 2018 initial public offering, Spotify Technologies (NYSE: SPOT) has produced strong returns for its shareholders, well above those of the S&P 500 . It has recorded an average compound annual growth rate of 19.3% through this period.\nHowever, for an investment in the streaming powerhouse to turn average investors into millionaires will take similarly impressive stock market performances across the next couple of decades. Can Spotify pull it off?\nWhat Spotify has going for it Spotify is the leader in the music streaming industry. This is impressive, considering it competes against tech giants such as Amazon , Alphabet , and Apple , all of which can afford to operate their music streaming businesses at a loss due to their large and profitable operations elsewhere. Still, Spotify's strategy has proven highly successful. It has a vast library of artists from record labels with which it has signed deals, so it benefits from strong network effects . The larger its music library, the more attractive its service is to consumers, and the more listeners its platform has, the more appealing it will be to musicians.\nSpotify has continued to post strong revenue growth, thanks to an increasing number of users, a rising number of paid subscribers, and growing ad revenue, which tends to improve as engagement does. All of these are still potential growth avenues. For instance, its premium subscribers are still less than 40% of its total users -- but those paying listeners account for close to 90% of its revenues. Although it is nearing its goal of 1 million monthly active users, it's not there yet.\n\nFurther, Spotify's podcast strategy could pay off in the long run. Although it has spent a small fortune acquiring exclusive rights to famous podcasters' shows, the company is betting that this will attract a larger audience, leading to substantial monetization (through engagement and ads) over the long run. Lastly, Spotify is embracing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), and has implemented AI features across its business, which have helped boost engagement.\nSpotify could remain the dominant player in music (and audio) streaming for a long time and deliver excellent returns along the way.\nMake sure to diversify Someone starting with an initial investment of $30,000 and a 30-year horizon would need a compound annual growth rate of 12.4% to turn that into $1 million. Can Spotify maintain that pace over the next three decades? It would be a tough task for any company. It assumes near-perfect execution for Spotify in a market for music streaming that, although fast growing, is still relatively small. Moreover, from its current market cap of around $119 billion, such gains would turn it into a $3.9 trillion company -- around the same size as Alphabet and Apple. It's hard to imagine the global music industry supporting that kind of valuation for a streamer, even if Spotify came to be the dominant way music and podcasts were delivered. And the reality is that competition from Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and others is likely to persist, which will weigh on the stock.\n\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, although Spotify has been profitable more often than not over the past two years, it still occasionally turns in a quarterly net loss, which is far from ideal.\nAll of these factors could somewhat limit Spotify's upside. But the good news is that near-perfect execution from one company isn't necessary for investors. Turning relatively small investments into a $1 million nest egg is best attempted with a well-diversified portfolio, and even accounting for potential threats, Spotify can contribute to that, as it could generate solid returns over the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Spotify Technology right now?

      "Content": "1 Reason I'm Never Selling Amazon Stock\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 9:20 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nKey Points Amazon is a leader across multiple industries.\nMost of these should prove to be excellent long-term tailwinds.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of my largest holdings. And I am a happy shareholder considering the amount of money it has made me over the years. The company does have its detractors. Some claim its current size severely limits its upside, while others argue that it is losing ground to some peers in the cloud computing market, making its outlook far more uncertain.\nHowever, I remain bullish on the stock, and I don't intend to sell my shares anytime soon. There are many reasons why. Let's consider just one of them.\nFollow the leader Amazon's business spans multiple industries, including e-commerce , cloud computing , artificial intelligence (AI), advertising, grocery shopping, video and music streaming, and healthcare. Here's something deeply impressive about the company: It has been able to establish itself as a leader, and oftentimes as the leader, in most markets where it has ventured. Amazon holds the lead in the U.S. e-commerce market and is the top player in the cloud computing industry as well.\n\nIn digital advertising, it is also near the top of the list. Even in video and music streaming, it has made a dent. Most corporations struggle to achieve a top market share -- or even come close to that level -- in a single industry. Amazon's ability to do so across multiple platforms speaks volumes.\nHere are at least two things it tells us. First, Amazon's management team knows how to plan ahead and identify potentially attractive growth avenues. Second, Amazon has an internal culture of innovation. Both of these factors are prerequisites for any company to perform well over a long period of several decades.\nA vast runway for growth ahead Amazon's prowess also tells us several things about its future. The company is still seeking to make significant waves in new sectors, including healthcare. Considering its track record, there is a good chance it will eventually achieve success. Amazon Pharmacy has managed to disrupt the well-established businesses of industry leaders. And here's something else that's important. Most of the markets Amazon dominates still have significant long-term growth prospects.\n\nE-commerce has captured less than 20% of retail transactions in the U.S., a figure that's likely lower in most other countries. CEO Andy Jassy has noted that 85% of IT spending still occurs on-premises. That means cloud adoption is still relatively low, a trend that is expected to change over the next few decades. Jassy is also extremely bullish on AI, and we are still in the early innings of that revolution.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon should be able to drive these tailwinds for many years to come, leveraging its leadership position, strong innovative capabilities, and economic moat from multiple sources to emerge as one of the winners. The company could deliver market-beating returns along the way. That's why, as a shareholder, I am staying put.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be the Next AI Stock That Berkshire Hathaway Buys\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Warren Buffett retired at the end of 2025, and Greg Abel will take his place in 2026.\nAmazon stock might be back on the menu for Berkshire, but there are a few caveats.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nWith legendary CEO Warren Buffett's time complete with Berkshire Hathaway , many investors are wondering where the company will go under the direction of new CEO Greg Abel. Buffett and Berkshire have been staunch value investors for multiple decades, but could this transition indicate a shift in investment philosophy?\nI wouldn't be surprised if Berkshire becomes more aggressive with Abel at the helm, and maybe invests in an artificial intelligence (AI) stock or two. But which one will it buy?\nBerkshire already owns some AI stocks The number of companies that fall under the artificial intelligence investing umbrella is quite large. There are software applications, facilitators, hardware plays, or even infrastructure, including energy companies. Berkshire already owns a few stocks that I'd consider AI plays, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Berkshire added Alphabet to its portfolio during Q3 2025, and this recent addition has already made it a ton of money.\n\nThe next AI stock Berkshire may purchase could be one it already owns, and I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon is one of the next stocks it adds to. Berkshire first took a stake in Amazon in 2019 and has added to that position over time, but hasn't purchased any Amazon shares in a while. Berkshire owns an even 10 million shares of Amazon, which sounds like a ton. However, Amazon is only a 0.8% stake in Berkshire's investment portfolio. With Amazon being an undersize portion of Berkshire's portfolio compared to the outsize returns it could generate, it makes sense that the conglomerate may elect to add shares in 2026.\nAfter a so-so start to 2025, Amazon is really starting to gain momentum in the second half of 2025. Net sales rose 13% year over year to $180 billion, with recent high growth rates in several of its key business units. Amazon Web Services (AWS, its cloud computing segment) and advertising services each posted the best growth in multiple quarters. This is key, as both of these business units have much greater operating margins than other commerce-focused business units.\nIn Q3, AWS made up 66% of Amazon's total operating profit despite only generating 18% of total sales. With AWS' growth reaccelerating and it projected to continue that strength into 2026, that bodes well for Amazon's profit picture.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon doesn't break out the advertising service's operating margin as it does with AWS. Still, if you look at other advertising-focused businesses like Alphabet and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , it's clear that this business unit likely has operating margins in the 30% to 40% range, which is far higher than the whole company's operating margin.\nContinued success of these two business units is key for Amazon, but is it enough for Berkshire to warrant purchasing shares?\nOne of the possible minds behind the first Amazon purchase is gone Buffett wasn't the only portfolio manager at Berkshire Hathaway. Todd Combs and Ted Weschler also had some purchasing power, and they were known to purchase more tech-focused investments than Buffett did. Todd Combs is no longer a part of Berkshire, as he accepted a position at JPMorgan Chase . If Combs was the original purchaser of Amazon shares, this may not bode well for Amazon's future inclusion in Berkshire's investment portfolio. But if it was Ted Weschler, it may be on his shopping list.\n\nOne of Berkshire's core investment philosophies is to buy great companies at good prices. Most investors would agree that Amazon is a great company, but what's a good price?\nThe best metric to value Amazon's stock is the operating price-to-earnings ratio. The standard P/E ratio isn't a great measure for Amazon, as it has a significant investment portfolio whose gains and losses can cause its diluted earnings per share (EPS) metric to rise and fall, even if Amazon didn't sell any of its investments. By this metric, Amazon is the cheapest it has been in some time.\nWith Amazon trading at the bottom end of its recent range and expected to have a strong 2026, I wouldn't be surprised if Berkshire decides to add some more Amazon shares to its portfolio. Time will tell where Greg Abel wants to lead this business, but I'd be shocked if he didn't start spending some of the cash Buffett piled up during his last few years as CEO.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

Tesla founder Elon Musk, currently the world’s richest man , raked in $190 billion in the past 12 months, taking his total net worth to $623 billion, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . He is on track to become the world’s first trillionaire, if Tesla hits the ambitious targets it has set.\nGoogle cofounder Larry Page also had a prosperous year, with a $101 billion gain pushing his personal fortune to $270 billion. Rounding out the top five, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made $16 billion (net worth: $255 billion), Google cofounder Sergey Brin pulled in $92.5 billion (net worth: $251 billion), and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison earned $57.7 billion (net worth: $250 billion). Ellison briefly overtook Musk as the world’s richest man in September, after his business software company reported unexpectedly strong financial results.

LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault , who has spent his fair share of time at the top of the list , enjoyed a $30 billion gain this year, taking his total fortune to $206 billion. LVMH, which helms the likes of Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., TAG Heuer, and Dom Pérignon, returned to growth in the third quarter of 2025, buoyed by the strong spending of wealthy North Americans.\nArnault sits ahead of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who made $30 billion and $23 billion in 2025, respectively. Huang sold nearly $1 billion worth of shares this year, cashing in on the soaring stock price of the computer chip maker. (Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company in October.)

It's one of several big C-suite shake-ups in 2026.\n\nBrooke DiPalma · Senior Reporter\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 9:56 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TGT\n\nKO\n\nLULU\n\nWMT\n\nPEP\n\nInvesting legend and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is handing off the reins at the conglomerate he founded on Jan. 1, 2026.\nThe Oracle of Omaha is far from the only big-name executive moving away from the top spot next year, with the retail industry seeing a raft of notable shakeups at some of America's most recognizable brands.\n\nAt Walmart ( WMT ), Target ( TGT ), and Lululemon ( LULU ), among other consumer names, CEOs who have served for years are stepping down and making way for new executives.\n“The skill set required for the future is not the same as the past,” TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen told Yahoo Finance .\nIn particular for retail, Chen added that there’s a growing need for supply chain expertise in light of President Trump’s tariffs, as well as a pulse on technology as Amazon and TikTok continue to change consumers' habits.\n“Retail is harder than ever; it is a fiercely competitive sector,\" Chen said.\nWalmart Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced in November that he will retire on Jan. 31, 2026.\nMcMillon has led the retail giant since Feb. 1, 2014. The company has reported more than four straight years of same-store sales growth.\nWalmart's market cap has risen from around $250 billion when McMillon took over to north of $800 billion today. Walmart's current US CEO, John Furner, will be the company's next CEO.\n\nTarget Target CEO Brian Cornell, who has served at the helm of the retailer for 11 years, will also retire on Feb. 1, 2026 .\nCornell's tenure has seen Target face more challenges than its larger rival, with flagging sales over the last several years resulting in sweeping executive changes at the company.\n\nCOO Michael Fiddelke, who has been with the company since 2003, will take over for Cornell, but he's already started reshaping the retailer.\nIn a memo in October, Fiddelke outlined Target's three key priorities: strengthening its retail leadership in style and design, the guest experience, and technology. That was alongside plans to eliminate 8% of corporate roles in the US. Analysts called the layoffs a necessary step in the turnaround attempt.\nThe pressure, though, is piling on Fiddelke even prior to his ascension: Activist investor Toms Capital Investment Management acquired a stake in the company last week.\nLululemon Athleisure retailer Lululemon is also getting a new CEO in 2026 . Who will take over at the top of the company remains to be seen.\nCEO Calvin McDonald joined the company in August of 2018, expanding the well-known yoga brand to other categories like running shoes and a more recent collaboration with the NFL .\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's CFO, Meghan Frank, and its chief commercial officer, André Maestrini, will serve as interim co-CEOs until a replacement for McDonald is named. Like Target, the company is also facing pressure from investors after a period of challenging sales and stock performance.\nElliott Investment Management took a $1 billion stake in the brand and is pushing for former Ralph Lauren executive Jane Nielsen to be at the helm. In late December, Lululemon founder Chip Wilson launched a proxy fight , nominating three candidates to join the board as the CEO search continues.\nMcDonald is set to leave the company at the end of January.\nOver the last five years, Lululemon stock is down almost 40%.\n\nCoca-Cola, P&G, and more The consumer leadership shakeup in 2026 will expand beyond big box retailers and one of the most notable apparel brands in the market.\nIn December, Coca-Cola ( KO ) announced that its CEO, James Quincey, would step down after nearly nine years running the company. Quincey will be replaced by the company's current COO, Henrique Braun, on March 31. During Quincey's tenure, Coke stock has outperformed rival PepsiCo ( PEP ) by about 40 percentage points.\nAt Procter & Gamble ( PG ), Shailesh Jejurikar will take over as CEO on Jan. 1 following a four-plus-year run from Jon Moeller. Jejurikar joined P&G in 1989.\nWhile Ramon Laguarta remains in PepsiCo's top role heading into 2026, the company in December announced several high-profile shifts among its leadership team, including the announcement of new CEOs for its North America and Latin America businesses. The shake-up followed its own settlement with Elliott Management , which will see PepsiCo look to clean up its product line and cut costs.\n\nIn the tech world, this year's leadership change at Intel ( INTC ) served as the most notable C-suite shift, with Lip-Bu Tan taking over after Pat Gelsinger was ousted in late 2024.\nAnd at Apple, while CEO Tim Cook remains in the top role, several of his key deputies were turned over during the second half of the year.\nBrooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan said that a $38 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI may go up by 31%.\nJustin Post of Bank of America kept his Buy rating and $303 price target. He also said that Amazon's $10 billion investment in OpenAI might make AWS more competitive and encourage more people to adopt its own AI infrastructure. Experts say that Amazon's foundations remain robust, even if the company cut off workers in late 2025. The company builds AI infrastructure while also expanding advertising and retail automation.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Will Greg Abel Reverse Warren Buffett’s ‘Mistake’ as Berkshire Hathaway’s New CEO?\n\nMohit Oberoi\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:56 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nJPM\n\nBeginning in 2026, Greg Abel will become Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A) (BRK.B) CEO, taking over the baton from long-time CEO Warren Buffett. It is not just another leadership transition at an enterprise but the end of an era as the “Oracle of Omaha” hangs up his boots. Buffett would go down in history as among the best—if not the best—investors of all time. Known for his value investing credentials and witty quotes, the nonagenarian’s investment principles are followed by many investors, including this writer.\n\nNotably, apart from Abel taking over as Berkshire’s CEO, several other significant changes are underway at the $1.1 trillion conglomerate. Tedd Combs, for instance, has resigned from the company to join J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM), where he will head the $10 billion “Strategic Investment Group.”\nMore News from Barchart Dear UiPath Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 2\nHow to Buy PYPL for a 29% Discount, or Achieve a 7% Annual Return\nApple is an Analyst Favorite, But AAPL Stock Has Been Flat - Shorting Puts Is the Best Play\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox.

Berkshire has appointed NetJets’ CEO, Adam Johnson, as the president of the company’s consumer products, services, and retailing businesses. The company also got its first general counsel in the form of Michael O’Sullivan.\nBuffett Has Admitted to Making Many Mistakes One of Buffett's hallmarks has been humility, and he has admitted to making many mistakes, which include both omission and commission. He, for instance, regrets not buying Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) early. The investing great has acknowledged that he was wrong about IBM (IBM) and airlines and said that he sold Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL) shares early. He also admitted to overpaying for Precision Castparts and Kraft during the merger with Heinz (KHC).\n\nMeanwhile, Berkshire bought 17.8 million Alphabet shares in Q3, which were valued at around $4.3 billion at the end of September. While we don’t know as yet whether the investment decision was taken by Buffett, Abel, or either of Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, the size of the investment seems to suggest that it was either Buffett or Abel.\nWhat Could Change at Berkshire After Buffett’s Departure? There are bound to be changes at Berkshire after Buffett retires as the CEO. However, since he will continue to be the chairman of the board of directors, there will be some continuity. Furthermore, Abel has vowed to preserve the culture at Berkshire that Buffett built over many decades.\n\nLeer más\nSpeaking at the annual meeting earlier this year, Abel said, “It’s really the investment philosophy and how Warren and the team have allocated capital for the past 60 years.” Abel emphasized, “Really, it will not change. And it’s the approach we’ll take as we go forward.”\nAll said, while it would be fair to expect changes once Abel takes over, we shouldn’t expect drastic changes in the investment philosophy, and Berkshire will continue to practice Buffett’s value investing principles. No one expects Berkshire to go out and start buying bitcoins (BTCUSD) from tomorrow or Abel’s investment philosophy to be closer to Cathie Wood rather than Buffett. However, the recent purchase of Alphabet shares indicates that the company might not be as averse to investing in tech stocks as it was under Buffett.\n\nBuffett Shied Away from Tech Stocks To be sure, Buffett did not hold any grudge against tech companies, and despite selling three-quarters of his Apple stake, the iPhone maker is still Berkshire’s top holding. It was just that he found tech companies to be outside his “circle of competence.” Abel hasn’t publicly talked about investing in tech stocks, but it would be fair to assume that he would take a more constructive approach than Buffett, who was using a flip phone until early 2020. He still doesn't have a computer at his desk in the office.\n\nAbel Could Invest in AI and Tech Stocks if Available at Reasonable Valuations It won’t be an easy task for Abel, though, as valuations of tech stocks are not cheap by historical standards, let alone on the higher (or rather lower) bar that Buffett has set. Meanwhile, while Buffett and Berkshire largely missed the tech boom, Abel now has the opportunity to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) companies. While the current valuations of AI stocks might not seem enticing enough to the new Berkshire CEO, I won’t be surprised to see him use any dips to add positions in tech names.\n\nAll said, despite shying away from tech companies and many admitted “mistakes,” Buffett managed to achieve market-beating returns, which is no mean feat, given that tech stocks have led the market rally this century. Abel has colossal shoes to fill as he takes over the baton from one of the most successful and admired investors of all time. While Berkshire's “circle of competence” might expand, particularly if Abel adds more people to the investment team, it remains to be seen whether he can beat the markets like Buffett did. It won't be prudent to expect the kind of outperformance as we saw under Buffett, as that was a different era and Berkshire was a much smaller company, making outperformance relatively easier. However, while Buffett had a nearly free hand despite periods of underperformance, the incoming CEO might not have that leeway.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: BRK.B, AAPL.

The expansion in wealth was supported following Donald Trump's election victory in late 2024, though momentum was briefly interrupted in April when tariff concerns triggered the largest one-day wealth decline since the pandemic. Bloomberg's analysis suggests Big Tech remained a central driver, with ongoing artificial-intelligence optimism supporting US mega-cap stocks and concentrating roughly a quarter of total gains among eight individuals, including Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) chief executive Elon Musk, Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) chairman Larry Ellison, Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) co-founder Larry Page and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, although that contribution was smaller than the year prior.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nIs ORCL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nBloomberg's wealth index shows Musk began the year as the most prominent figure among global billionaires, though his net worth appeared volatile as political involvement and time spent in Washington coincided with pressure on Tesla shares before a later rebound. The data highlight Ellison as a standout beneficiary of increased AI-related spending, briefly overtaking Musk in September following a sharp rise in Oracle shares linked to its cloud and AI infrastructure investments, even though the stock later retreated roughly 40% from its peak. Outside the United States, Bloomberg data show that wealth gains were broad-based, with the UK's FTSE 100 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng outperforming the S&P 500 through Dec. 30, while strong demand for safe-haven assets supported precious metals and boosted fortunes tied to copper and rare earths amid rising geopolitical significance.\n\nOther asset classes produced more uneven outcomes during the year. Bloomberg data show Bitcoin surged to record highs following Trump's election and the rollout of crypto-friendly policies, before a sharp selloff beginning in October erased those gains and weighed on crypto-focused billionaires including Michael Saylor. The index also highlights sharp reversals tied to company-specific events, including significant losses for property tycoon Manuel Villar after a collapse in Golden MV Holdings shares, and for Venture Global co-founders Bob Pender and Mike Sabel following a scaled-back IPO and subsequent stock decline. In China, Bloomberg data indicate Meituan co-founder Wang Xing saw his wealth fall as weakening domestic demand and intensifying competition offset a strong year for broader Chinese equity benchmarks, underscoring how market momentum in 2025 could be powerful but uneven across sectors and regions.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\nInvestors poured more than $150 billion into startups trying to ride the AI boom, while the big four hyperscalers — Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) — committed to investing over $300 billion this year in the opportunity.\n\nElon Musk's foray into government came and went, while Tesla ( TSLA ) stock ends the year near a record high and his rocket company SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) eyes an IPO that would value the company at $1.5 trillion in 2026 .\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took on celebrity status in the business world and beyond.\nAnd Warren Buffett will head to Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRK-B , BRK-A ) offices on Wednesday for his final day as CEO.\nWhat follows is a monthly overview of some of the biggest stories that shaped financial markets in 2025. Some are headlines we may have forgotten; others are those we never could. Let us know what we missed too.\nJanuary Jan. 20 — Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as US president. His first hours in office see the president sign a series of executive orders , including the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which will bring Elon Musk to Washington, D.C., for the first few months of the year.\n\nAfter topping $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, bitcoin hits a record high above $109,000 in the hours before Trump's swearing in.\nJan. 21 — Joined by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI chief Sam Altman, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison in the Oval Office, Trump announces the $500 billion \"Stargate\" project to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nStory Continues\nJan. 23 — The S&P 500 closes at a record high , its first of the year, on Trump's third full day back in office.\nJan. 27 — Nvidia stock falls 17%, shedding nearly $600 billion in market value , as investors punish the chip giant after Chinese startup DeepSeek releases an AI model it says can rival those from OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) for a fraction of the cost. This sets of the first of many investor debates about the costs of the AI build-out, and brings the \" Jevons paradox \" to the attention of investors the world over.\n\nFebruary Feb. 1 — Trump's second trade war kicks off, with the president implementing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China using authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). These tariffs will be delayed, altered, and face still-unresolved legal challenges throughout the year.",

      "Content": "These Stocks Are the Market’s Biggest Winners and Losers in 2025\n\nCarmen Reinicke\nUpdated Wed, December 31, 2025 at 3:53 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nPLTR\n\nLULU\n\nTSLA\n\nCOIN\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index is poised to end 2025 up more than 17% as the bull market continues for a third year driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence.\nThe AI trade broadened out this year, as chip stocks again led the S&P 500 but were joined by the shares of companies tied to building the data centers that will power the technology. Three of the index’s top 10 performers in 2025 were data storage companies, which are among the main beneficiaries of the hundreds of billions of dollars in pledged spending by the giant AI cloud service providers known as hyperscalers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York City’s Hunts Point Produce Market to Be Rebuilt\nOn the flip side, economic uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs weighed on the shares of consumer companies, while health-care stocks struggled with uncertainty surrounding the administration’s policies and pressure on drug prices.\nHere are some of the biggest winners and losers in the US stock market this year.\n\nWinner: New AI Leadership Technology stocks, especially those tied to AI, again dominated the market. But leadership shifted to the shares of companies associated with data — from storage to the building, heating and cooling of data centers. Hyperscalers like Microsoft ( MSFT ) Corp., Amazon.com ( AMZN ) Inc., Alphabet ( GOOG ) Inc. and Meta Platforms ( META ) Inc. have pledged to spend more than $440 billion over the next 12 months to build out AI capabilities, benefiting firms such as Sandisk ( SNDK ) Corp., Western Digital ( WDC ) Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc ( STX ), which were three of the four best performing stocks in the S&P 500.\nWinner: New S&P 500 Additions A slew of companies were added to the S&P 500 in 2025, including Robinhood ( HOOD ) Markets Inc., Sandisk, AppLovin ( APP ) Corp. and Carvana ( CVNA ) Co., all of which posted triple-digit percentage gains and landed among the top 20 performers in the index.\nOf course, not every stock that joined the S&P 500 got a boost. Trade Desk ( TTD ) Inc. shares were the worst performers in the index with a nearly 70% loss, while Block ( XYZ ) Inc. tumbled more than 20% and Coinbase ( COIN ) Global Inc. sank more than 6%.\n\nWinner: Palantir Palantir ( PLTR ) Technologies Inc. shares are set to notch a triple-digit gain for the third year in a row. The software developer got a boost from AI enthusiasm and strong buy-in from retail traders who are drawn to the company’s outspoken Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp.\n\nBut the stock is now rather pricey. With a multiple of more than 180 times forward earnings, it’s the third most expensive member of the S&P 500 behind Tesla Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWinner: Warner Bros. Discovery Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ) soared almost 175% in 2025 on the strength of takeover speculation. The company formally put itself up for sale in October, and there’s an ongoing battle between the top two bidders, Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ) Corp. and Netflix ( NFLX ) Inc., with both suitors jockeying to strengthen financial backing for their offers.\nThe Warner Bros. board prefers the Netflix bid and is reportedly planning to reject Paramount’s offer, but Larry Ellison, the billionaire chairman of Oracle Corp. and father of Paramount Chief Executive David Ellison, is personally guaranteeing the Paramount proposal.\nLoser: Consumer Staples Economic uncertainty, tariffs and concerns about the health of the US consumer as inflation creeps higher weighed on consumer stocks, especially some major staples names. Clorox ( CLX ) Co., frozen french fries maker Lamb Weston ( LW ) Holdings Inc., Campbell’s ( CPB ) Co. and beverage giant Constellation Brands ( STZ ) Inc. were among the 20 worst-performers in the S&P 500. Shares of fast-casual dining brand Chipotle ( CMG ) Mexican Grill Inc. sank nearly 40% after two years of double-digit gains.\n\nLoser: Retail The same economic uncertainty also hit shares of some retail companies. Deckers ( DECK ) Outdoor Corp., which owns brands such as Hoka and Ugg, was down almost 50% in 2025, snapping a nine-year streak of gains. The stock was hit hard by a few weak earnings forecasts and analyst downgrades.\nLululemon ( LULU ) Athletica Inc. shares are set to fall nearly 45% this year, their second consecutive double-digit annual decline, as the athletic apparel retailer struggles through an overhaul after a period of slow growth and the recent exit of its chief executive officer. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in the company.\n\nLoser: Managed Care Health insurance stocks underperformed in 2025 despite hopes that the group would benefit from a shift in policy by the Trump administration. Molina ( MOH ) Healthcare Inc. shares were down more than 40%, their second straight year of double-digit declines. UnitedHealth ( UNH ) Group Inc. and Centene ( CNC ) Corp. have both shed more than 30%, putting them among the 25 worst performers in the S&P 500.\nStill, there are signs of hope for the group as some investors view the beaten-down valuations as attractive, making the stocks possibly due for a rebond. Money manager Michael Burry has said he’s long Molina shares and that he views the company as acquisition target in 2026 if it remains this cheap.\n\n—With assistance from Matt Turner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "4 retail brands that shut down in 2025 — and reboots to come\n\nAlex Daniel\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 12:19 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nTGT\n\nThe American high street faced another reality check in 2025, as some of its most famous names finally called it a day. From the pharmacy counters of Rite Aid to the balloon aisles of Party City, the year saw a wave of bankruptcies.\nMany of these household names were hit by a combination of rising debt and shifting customer habits. As inflation stayed high, shoppers tightened their belts and left specialty shops for online competitors like Amazon or in-person giants like Target. For chains already struggling with high-interest loans and the cost of keeping huge, quiet stores open, the writing was on the wall.\n\nBut as some folded, others showed signs of life. Here are the brands that closed their doors — and the ones eyeing a return.\nForever 21 Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy for the second time in six years in March. The brand was founded in Los Angeles in 1984 and was making more than $4 billion in revenue a year at the height of its popularity with millennials in the early 2010s. It was known for affordable style and had more than 540 stores across the U.S.\n\nAs a generation of teens grew up, the retailer failed to evolve and ended up going bankrupt for the first time in 2019. Then, it was bought out by a group of investors, but the fast fashion giant Temu eventually helped undo the brand.\nIn a court filing, Stephen Coulombe, Forever 21’s co-chief restructuring officer, wrote that it was “materially and negatively impacted” by Shein and Temu’s use of the de minimis exemption, which “undercut” its business. De minimis was a trade loophole that allowed small-value parcels to enter the U.S. without tariffs — until President Donald Trump squashed the rule over the summer. The company also blamed “rising costs, economic challenges impacting our core customers[,] and evolving consumer trends.”\nForever 21 has said its U.S. stores will close permanently as part of the liquidation of its Chapter 11 proceedings, though the brand’s online presence is expected to continue under new operators.\n\nRite Aid For many Americans growing up in the 1990s, a trip to Rite Aid was a familiar part of everyday life, from picking up prescriptions to getting a scoop of its cult-favorite ice cream brand, Thrifty. Founded in 1962 in Pennsylvania, the chain became a ubiquitous pharmacy and drugstore with more than 5,000 locations nationwide at its peak.\n\nBut in 2023 it filed for its first bankruptcy after amassing a debt pile of more than $4 billion. Part of that was down to expensive legal battles over its alleged role in the opioid epidemic. The firm survived via a deal to cut its debt by closing some 500 stores, but it filed again in May 2025. It eventually shut down its final 89 stores in October, shifting millions of prescriptions to former rivals, including Walgreens, Albertsons, and CVS Pharmacy. Meanwhile, Thrifty was sold separately for around $19.2 million to a partnership linked to Monster Beverage executives, meaning the ice cream brand lives on.\n\nStory Continues\nParty City Party City first opened its doors in New Jersey in 1986, selling balloons, streamers, and pretty much anything else you might want for a party. At its height, the retailer operated more than 800 locations across North America and held a dominant 20% share of the U.S. party goods market.\nHowever it too filed for bankruptcy in early 2025, less than two years after a previous attempt to restructure its debt. While a 2023 filing eliminated some debt, the company remained burdened by $800 million in liabilities and a high-interest rate economy. Bosses pointed to a \"perfect storm\" of economic pressures, including a global helium shortage that crippled its balloon business.\n\nRetail giants such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target also eroded its business, alongside seasonal competitor Spirit Halloween, which often moved into neighboring storefronts to grab crucial October revenue. Party City eventually closed down in early 2025, and while the brand was sold on to survive as an online entity, the physical \"balloon walls\" that defined American birthdays for decades vanished.\nJoann Fabric and craft giant Joann eventually unravelled after 82 years in business this year, filing for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2025. Founded in Cleveland in 1943, the retailer had become a cornerstone of American DIY shopping, operating about 800 stores and holding a third of the U.S. sewing supplies market at one stage.\n\nManagement cited \"sluggish sales and constrained inventory levels\" as key drivers, noting that customers were increasingly trading down to cheaper alternatives or avoiding specialty trips altogether. Former CEO Michael Prendergast said the last several years had presented \"significant and lasting challenges\" that the firm’s financial position could not withstand.\nThe company name was eventually rescued by rival Michaels to launch \"Knit & Sew Shop\" sections within its own stores. But DIY enthusiasts have had to say goodbye to the sprawling warehouses that anchored the Joann brand for many years.\nClaire’s, Hooters, and the holdouts It wasn’t all bad news, with some familiar names making nostalgia-driven comebacks . Toys “R” Us has been edging back into shopping centres with physical stores, seasonal holiday sites, and small shop-in-shops at Macy’s.\nClaire’s, a go-to for first piercings and teen accessories for decades, also survived after its most recent bankruptcy — with a rescue deal keeping around 800 stores open, in a recovery many had written off.\n\nHooters also filed for Chapter 11 in early 2025 but has since been bought back by its original founders and franchise partners, who are moving to relaunch the brand with retro updates to servers' uniforms and a menu revamp.\nMeanwhile Bed Bath & Beyond, which closed in 2023, is preparing a return under new ownership, while the likes of Abercrombie & Fitch and Esprit have seen interest pick up again after rebrands. Even shoppers gripped by Amazon have long memories, and established brands can still attract investors looking for a turnaround.\nFor the brands that hit the wall this year, pared-down returns and reboots could yet be in the cards. Retail’s in its zombie era — never say never.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Can Netflix's Content Strength Drive Further Upside in the Stock in 2026?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:49 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NFLX\n\nROKU\n\nAMZN\n\nNetflix 's NFLX 2026 content slate emerges as a critical catalyst for stock performance as the streaming platform seeks to convert programming investments into sustained subscriber growth and engagement gains. NFLX serves globally while maintaining approximately 7% penetration of addressable consumer spending. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 revenues is pegged at $50.99 billion, indicating a 13.08% year-over-year increase, reflecting expectations that the robust content pipeline will drive both subscription and advertising revenue growth.\n\nThe streaming giant's film portfolio anchors the content strategy with high-profile releases including The Rip (Jan. 16), The Animals (March 27), Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man (March 20), APEX (April) and the marquee release Narnia: The Magician's Nephew (December 2026). These theatrical-quality productions aim to drive subscriber engagement during key periods, with expanded content inventory enhancing advertiser appeal as the platform scales its advertising business.\n\nThe breadth of new original series launches positions Netflix to capture diverse audience segments and drive subscriber acquisition momentum throughout 2026, with releases including Star Search (Jan. 20), People We Meet on Vacation (Jan. 9), Run Away Limited Serie s (Jan. 1), His & Hers (Jan. 8), Love Through A Prism (Jan. 15), How To Get To Heaven From Belfast Limited Series (Feb. 1), Cash Queens (Feb. 5), Salvador (Feb. 6), Strangers in the Park (March 6), Sons of Kujo Season 1 (April 2) and TRINITY Season 1 (July 16). Returning series demonstrate Netflix's content strength through established franchise renewals that sustain viewer retention and engagement, including Bridgerton Season 4 Part 1 (Jan. 29), Bridgerton Season 4 Part 2 (Feb. 26), One Piece Season 2 (March 10), Avatar: The Last Airbender Season 2 (second quarter 2026), Beef Season 2 (May), The Lincoln Lawyer Season 4 (Feb. 5), The Night Agent Season 3 (Feb. 19) and Berlin Season 2 (May 15).\n\nWhile the content strength positions Netflix for potential upside, substantial capital allocation requirements and existing debt obligations create financial considerations as elevated content spending pressures operating margins. The platform's ability to leverage its 2026 programming slate into sustained stock appreciation hinges on translating content investments into measurable revenue growth and profitability gains amid intensifying streaming competition.\n\nNetflix faces Intense Competition Netflix faces intense competition from Amazon AMZN and Roku ROKU as all three platforms rely on content to drive streaming hours. Amazon uses Prime Video to strengthen the broader Prime ecosystem. Amazon leans on franchises and live sports to support retention, while monetization is spread across its wider business. Roku follows a lower-cost approach. It combines platform distribution with The Roku Channel and Roku Originals. This keeps Roku’s content spending lighter and more advertising-focused.\n\nStory continues\nNFLX’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of Netflix have declined 27.2% in the past six months compared with the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s decline of 12.8%.\nNFLX’s Past Six-Month Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Netflix appears overvalued, trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio of 7.83X compared to the broader Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward sales multiple of 4.3X. NFLX carries a Value Score of D.\nNFLX’s Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFLX’s 2026 EPS is pegged at $3.21, up by 2 cents over the past 30 days.

To get there, it is speeding up its investments in cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence. The corporation is spending $125 billion to make AWS bigger and to develop new processors like Trainium3, which are four times faster than older ones.AWS, Amazon's most lucrative subsidiary, grew by 20% in late 2025 and might increase by 30% in 2026 as it works through a $200 billion backlog of customers. According to analysts, this comeback is the start of a new growth cycle driven by AI workloads and business demand.To save expenses, the corporation is also putting robots and AI-powered quality systems in all of its fulfillment locations. By 2026, analysts think that automation might take over 50,000 manual jobs and save nearly $7.5 billion a year.Analysts are still positive, even if the stock market did worse than other indices in 2025. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI picked Amazon as his best internet stock for 2026. Doug Anmuth of J.P. Morgan also kept his Buy rating with a $305 price target, saying the stock was undervalued and the company was doing well.There are 44 Buys and one Hold on Amazon, which means it is a Strong Buy. Investors are betting on AI, AWS, and automation to drive long-term profit growth, and the average price target of $296.12 suggests that the stock may go up by about 28%.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Coty E-Commerce Grows Mid-Single Digits: Is Digital the Backbone?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: COTY\n\nEL\n\nAMZN\n\nCoty Inc. ’s ( COTY ) first-quarter fiscal 2026 performance highlights the growing strategic relevance of e-commerce, even as it navigates broader top-line pressure from trade destocking. In the fiscal first quarter, Coty reported mid-single-digit e-commerce sell-out growth across both Prestige and Consumer Beauty, underscoring resilient consumer demand online.\n\nE-commerce now accounts for approximately 20% of Coty’s total sales, with penetration increasing during the quarter. This growth reflects more than channel mix benefits, it signals improved execution. Coty has embedded its digital and e-commerce teams directly within local markets and brand organizations, enabling faster decision-making and tighter omnichannel coordination. This structural shift allows brands to respond more dynamically to local demand patterns, promotions and product launches.\nPartnerships remain a critical lever. Coty continues to build on its long-standing collaboration with Amazon, adding Marc Jacobs to Amazon’s Premium Beauty Marketplace during the quarter. This move expands Coty’s reach in prestige beauty online while maintaining brand positioning and control in a curated digital environment.\n\nImportantly, e-commerce momentum is also supported by early-stage digital innovation. Coty is accelerating AI adoption across content creation, predictive analytics and virtual try-on tools, aiming to enhance the online shopper experience while improving return on digital media spend. While still in ramp-up mode, these initiatives point to e-commerce becoming not just a growth channel, but a testing ground for scalable, data-driven execution.\nOverall, Coty’s mid-single-digit e-commerce growth in the fiscal first quarter highlights the channel’s growing role in consumer engagement, even as it manages near-term retail disruptions in a changing beauty market.\nCoty’s Zacks Rank & Share Price Performance Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 8.4% in the past month against the broader Consumer Staples sector’s 0.1% growth. COTY has also underperformed the industry and the S&P 500 index’s growth of 10.6% and 1.7%, respectively, during the same period.\nCOTY Stock's Past Month Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIs COTY a Value Play Stock?

Each month, lucky followers will receive high-quality battery-powered home devices as a token of gratitude for their continued trust in Voniko's reliable power solutions. The giveaway launch comes as the Colorado-based company gears up for CES 2026 in Las Vegas, where it will show innovative new packaging and an expanded product line at booth South Hall 1 30538.\n\nThe Voniko Story: Quality Over Quick Profits\nFounded in Brighton, Colorado in 2019, Voniko entered Amazon's fiercely competitive battery marketplace with a clear mission: deliver superior performance through better engineering and materials. While competitors focused on rock-bottom pricing, Voniko invested in premium zinc materials and advanced chemistry to create batteries that truly last longer.\nThe path wasn't easy. For three challenging years, Voniko operated at a loss while competing against low-cost alternatives flooding the market. The temptation to cut corners was constant, but the company remained committed to its quality-first approach.\n\"We could have gone cheap like everyone else,\" said Voniko CEO Edward. \"But we believed that if we stayed true to making genuinely better batteries, customers would eventually notice the difference.\"\n\nThat belief proved prophetic. By 2023, customer loyalty began driving exponential growth. Repeat buyers praised Voniko's remarkable longevity – with alkaline batteries offering 40% longer lasting power compared to competitor brands and lithium batteries delivering 10x longer lasting performance compared to alkaline alternatives. Word-of-mouth recommendations spread rapidly, propelling Voniko into the Top 4 bestselling battery brands on Amazon in the United States.\nFrom Digital Success to Physical Expansion\nToday, Voniko operates as the world's one of the largest primary battery manufacturers with fully automated smart factories across multiple countries delivering 6.5 billion pieces annually. Despite this scale, the company maintains modest profit margins while continuing to outperform regular batteries in stability and quality.\nBuilding on its digital marketplace success, Voniko is now targeting brick-and-mortar retail expansion. In 2025, the company is actively seeking exclusive distribution partners to bring Voniko products into physical stores across America and internationally.\n\nStory Continues\nInnovation and Industry Leadership\nVoniko's commitment to excellence extends beyond manufacturing. As one of five permanent members of the IEC primary battery standards community, the company helps shape industry standards while demonstrating leadership in primary battery technology.\nThe brand's product lineup includes alkaline batteries with proprietary New Zinc Powder technology, lithium batteries with 15+ year shelf life, rechargeable options, and coin cell batteries with 7 year shelf life. Each product category delivers consistent performance backed by complete global certifications and rigorous quality control.\n\nPower That Goes With You\nVoniko's monthly giveaway program represents more than customer appreciation – it reflects the brand's core belief that quality builds lasting relationships. As the company expands from digital dominance to physical retail presence, this customer-first philosophy continues driving growth.\n\"Our journey proves that doing things the right way pays off,\" added CEO Edward.\"These giveaways are our way of saying thank you to the customers who believed in us when we were just starting out.\"\nAbout Voniko®\nFounded in 2019 in Brighton, Colorado, Voniko® is a U.S.-based battery brand known for great value household batteries. The company's mission is to shape the future of batteries, enabling consumers to live life to the fullest by powering everyday moments. Voniko fulfills this promise with their motto: \"Power that goes with you!\"\n\nOperating as the world's primary battery manufacturer, Voniko maintains fully automated smart factories across multiple countries from China to Vietnam, including Ultra Line and Premium Line with an annual production capacity of 6.5 billion pieces. The company serves distributors and OEM partners in over 100 countries, backed by complete global certifications and dependable performance.\nConnect with Voniko:\nAmazon Store: amazon.com/stores/Voniko\nOfficial Store: vonikoshop.com\nCorporate Website: vonikobatteries.com\nInstagram: @vonikoinc\nFacebook: facebook.com/vonikoinc\nYouTube: @vonikobatteries\nTikTok: @vonikobatteries3\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/company/voniko-inc\nMedia Contact:\nVONIKO Inc.\n36 S 18th Ave, Brighton, Colorado 80601\nPhone: +1 (720) 487-2253\nVoniko ® is a registered trademark of Sonluk Energy USA Inc.

      "Content": "Warren Buffett is retiring — here's what his favorite indicator reveals about the stock market\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nIt's time for one final check in with the investing GOAT's favorite stock market indicator before he rides off into the sunset.\nBerkshire Hathaway ( BRK-B ) CEO Warren Buffett , 95, will hand over the reins to his hand-picked successor Greg Abel on Wednesday.\nThe official passing of the torch caps a storied career for Buffett, which included buying a major US railroad (Burlington Northern), striking up a friendship with Microsoft ( MSFT ) co-founder Bill Gates, and offering up scores of pithy comments in annual shareholder letters.\n\n“Berkshire’s culture is pretty simple,” Howard Buffett told me in a 2024 episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (listen below). “You do what you say you’re going to do, and you do it when you say you’re going to do it. You’re honest about it. You make mistakes and you accept responsibility for those mistakes.”\nHoward is in line to succeed his father as Berkshire chairman.\n\nThrough it all, Buffett championed the art of value investing, as taught to him by mentor Benjamin Graham. The philosophy is rooted in an unwillingness to overpay for investments.\nThe \"Buffett Indicator\" takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual US GDP. It rose to fame following a 2001 Fortune Magazine article written by Buffett and longtime Fortune writer and Buffett insider Carol Loomis.\n\n\"The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know,\" Buffett explained in the article. \"Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\"\nThe indicator is at valuation levels never seen before, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. It suggests that stocks are long overdue for a healthy pullback in early 2026.\nPicking apart the numbers, the Buffett Indicator stands at about 221.4% — up a sharp 22% from April 30, per data from GuruFocus. The indicator has never been at a higher level dating back to the earliest data from GuruFocus in 1970.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) has shot up nearly 17% on the year amid major optimism surrounding the earnings potential of AI-related companies and the effect the technology will have on profits. Analysts in turn have scrambled to upwardly revise their profit forecasts on companies, supporting higher stock prices.\nFor his part, Buffett has bet on the AI future by maintaining stock investments in Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and more recently, Alphabet ( GOOGL ).\nWherever the stock market goes from here, one thing can't be questioned: Buffett's impact on investing.\n\nStory Continues\n\"I think Warren Buffett's the GOAT of capitalism,\" Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me on Opening Bid (video above) in October. \"There's so much guidance and wisdom that we've had from Warren over the years.\"\nBerkshire purchased Brooks in 2006. Each year at the storied Berkshire annual shareholder meeting, Brooks makes special edition sneakers with the face of Buffett as well as his longtime business partner Charlie Munger .\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nTuttle Capital Management Launches the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\n\nNewsfile\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:02 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: CBOE\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nGreenwich, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - December 30, 2025) - Tuttle Capital Management, a leading provider of thematic and alternatives ETFs, today announced the launch of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (CBOE: MAGO) , now trading on the CBOE.\nMAGO is an actively managed exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the equity performance of the \"Magnificent 7\" - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - using an options 1 -based strategy designed to harvest option premium while maintaining equity-like exposure to these market-defining companies.\n\nThe fund combines direct exposure to the Magnificent 7 with a systematic put-spread 2 program implemented with listed options and FLEX Options® 3 to potentially generate income. The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing. For a prospectus with this and other information about the fund, please call (833) 759-6110 or visit the Fund's website.\n\nDistributor: Foreside Fund Services, LLC\nMedia Contact:\nMatthew Tuttle\nTuttle Capital Management\nmtuttle@tuttlecap.com\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/279159\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Here’s what you should know about the US TikTok deal\n\nLauren Forristal\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nWMT\n\nAMZN\n\nAPP\n\nTikTok , owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government.\nAs a result, U.S. users have often found themselves caught in the middle of this tension. Earlier this year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February.\n\nA number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle is finally over. As of last week , TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors.\nThis comes nearly three months after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approves the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group.\nA week prior, President Trump announced that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.\nWho owns TikTok in the U.S.? According to a memo viewed by TechCrunch, the investor group consists of Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX. Collectively, they will hold 45% of the U.S. operation, with ByteDance keeping nearly a 20% stake. Axios first reported the news, citing sources who estimate TikTok U.S. is valued at approximately $14 billion—a figure also mentioned by Vice President JD Vance.\n\nIn September, a report indicated that a “framework” deal was established between the U.S. and China, with a consortium of investors— including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz—overseeing TikTok’s U.S. operations. These investors were expected to hold an 80% stake, and the remaining shares would belong to Chinese stakeholders.\nThe newly formed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” will oversee the app’s operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.\nOracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to the memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.\nA White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain.\n\nStory Continues\nByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok’s U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.\n​The deal is scheduled to close on January 22, 2026.\nWhat users in the U.S. should know Reports from Bloomberg indicate that when the deal is finalized, the TikTok app will be discontinued in the U.S. and users will need to transition to a new platform. However, the specifics of this platform remain largely unclear, including its features and how it will differ from the original app.\nHow did we get here? To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\nThe drama first began in August 2020 , when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\n\nA month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.\nIn response, TikTok sued the U.S. government , challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\n\nFast-forward to today: Trump has had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\nThere have been several contenders, including The People’s Bid for TikTok , a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt . This group has the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian , TV personality and investor Kevin O’Leary , inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.\nAnother group, called the American Investor Consortium, is led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki , Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast .\nOthers in the running included Amazon , AppLovin , Microsoft , Perplexity AI , Rumble , Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick , and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\nThe story has been updated after publication.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

( NVDA , Financials ) investing $20 billion in AI inference business Groq shows its desire to dominate the AI ecosystem. Groq may continue operating independently while Nvidia uses its inference tools thanks to its founder Jonathan Ross and several engineers.Nvidia's planned diversification beyond AI training hardware is shown by the deal. Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPUs fuel most large-scale model training, but the company is now targeting inference, which has a far larger and recurring revenue potential.Over 90% of the AI GPU market is Nvidia. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq protects market dominance and adds software and service income streams while Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft construct their own inference processors to save costs.AI applications increase inference workloads considerably. AI token usage at major tech businesses increases every few months, fueling inference hardware and platform demand, say analysts. Beyond inference, Nvidia is entering networking, robotics, and government. Last quarter, networking sales surged 162% to $8.2 billion, while automotive and professional visualization grew double digits.Nvidia's Strong Buy consensus has 39 Buys and one Hold rating with an average price target of $263.58, implying 40% upside over a year. To balance chip sales with long-term software, cloud, and inference revenue growth, Nvidia's Groq acquisition boosts its full-stack AI platform transition.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The 2 Smartest Stocks to Hold Into 2026 and Beyond\n\nSushree Mohanty\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nIn an uncertain market, owning the right businesses that have the ability to grow for a long time matters more than timing the market. Companies with dominant positions, expanding profit engines, and long growth runways tend to reward patient investors. That’s what makes these two smartest stocks stand out.\n\nSmart Stock #1: Amazon (AMZN) When it comes to long-term compounders, few companies check as many boxes as Amazon (AMZN). The stock has returned a whopping 9,763% over the last 20 years. With its cloud division reaccelerating on the back of artificial intelligence (AI) demand, a high-margin advertising business scaling rapidly, and a retail ecosystem that continues to dominate on selection, price, and speed, Amazon is no longer just a growth story.\n\nMore News from Barchart Micron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMicron Stock Stole the Show in 2025.

AWS revenue increased 20.2% year-on-year (YoY) to $33 billion in the most recent third quarter, the quickest pace in 11 quarters, bringing the annualized run rate to $132 billion. Backlog increased to $200 billion by the end of the quarter, excluding several large deals signed after the quarter, indicating that demand will remain strong well into the future. AWS operational income increased to $11.4 billion, indicating both scale and efficiency.\n\nAmazon is making substantial investments to meet AI-driven cloud demand. Over the last 12 months, AWS has added more than 3.8 gigawatts of electrical capacity, tripling its footprint since 2022 and on track to double again by 2027. Custom silicon, such as Trainium, has become a multibillion-dollar company, expanding 150% quarter after quarter, while Bedrock is being developed into what management expects could someday rival EC2.\nAside from AWS, Amazon's retail division continues to scale smoothly. Revenue in North America increased by 11% YoY, while overseas revenue increased by 10%, and paid unit growth reached 11%. Faster delivery, same-day grocery growth, and AI-powered shopping tools are all driving more engagement and conversion. Meanwhile, advertising income increased by 22% YoY to $17.7 billion, benefiting from Amazon's full-funnel ad ecosystem and new partnerships.\n\nStory Continues\nTotal revenue for the quarter totaled $180.2 billion, up 12% YoY, while adjusted earnings increased 36.4% to $1.95 per share. Importantly, trailing twelve-month free cash flow increased to $14.8 billion, indicating improved cash generation across the business. Amazon intends to spend approximately $125 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, with spending projected to increase in 2026, mostly to support AI, cloud infrastructure, and logistics. While margins may fluctuate, management is committed to long-term returns on invested capital and continuous customer value creation.\n\nAnalysts expect that Amazon's earnings will climb by 29.6% in 2025, followed by an increase of 9.5% in 2026. Amazon's reaccelerating AWS growth, AI leadership, growing cash flow, and robust core businesses make it one of the best companies to own through 2026 and beyond.\nIs AMZN Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell on Wall Street? Overall, AMZN stock is rated a “Strong Buy” on Wall Street. Of the 56 analysts covering the stock, 49 have given it a “Strong Buy” rating, five recommend a “Moderate Buy,” and two say it is a “Hold.” The average target price is $295.80, indicating a potential upside of 27% from its current price. Additionally, the highest target price of $360 suggests the stock could rise by as much as 55% over the next 12 months.\nSmart Stock #2: Alphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) is the second company on my list that clearly stands out as a solid long-term investment for 2026 and beyond, thanks to its solid fundamentals, expanding profitability, and deep leadership in AI, cloud computing, and digital platforms. GOOGL stock has returned 730% over the last decade.\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet recorded its first-ever $100 billion-plus quarter, with revenue of $102.3 billion, up 16% YoY. Just five years ago, quarterly revenue stood at $50 billion, underscoring how rapidly the business has scaled. The company saw double-digit increases in Search, YouTube, subscriptions, smartphones, and Google Cloud, indicating solid execution across the entire business.\n\nAI is increasingly driving real business results across Alphabet. The company's Gemini models currently process billions of tokens every minute via APIs, and the Gemini app has well over 650 million monthly active users. Token processing has increased more than 20-fold across all Google surfaces year after year, showing AI's expanding significance in how consumers search, create, and engage online.\nGoogle Cloud remains a solid growth driver. Cloud revenue increased 34% YoY to $15.2 billion, while operating income increased 85% to $3.6 billion, resulting in operating margins of 23.7%. The cloud backlog increased to $155 billion, up 46% sequentially, thanks to high demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, proprietary TPUs, and generative AI solutions built on Gemini. Notably, Alphabet closed more billion-dollar cloud deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the past two years combined.\n\nFinancially, Alphabet remains exceptionally strong. The company generated $24.5 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $73.6 billion over the trailing twelve months, ending the period with nearly $100 billion in cash and marketable securities. While capital expenditures are rising sharply to support AI infrastructure, management views these investments as critical to long-term value creation, with 2026 expected to see even higher spending.\nAnalysts predict Alphabet’s earnings to increase by 31.6% in 2025, followed by another 4.3% in 2026. All in all, Alphabet’s leadership in AI, rapidly expanding cloud profitability, durable advertising engine, and massive financial flexibility position it as one of the smartest stocks investors can hold into 2026 and beyond.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell on Wall Street? Overall, on Wall Street, GOOGL stock is a “Strong Buy.” Of the 54 analysts covering the stock, 43 rate it a “Strong Buy,” four say it is a “Moderate Buy,” and seven rate it a “Hold.” The stock’s average target price of $329.79 indicates the stock can rally another 5.2% from current levels. Plus, its high price estimate of $400 suggests the stock has an upside potential of 27.6% over the next 12 months.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "‘You Had to Be Brave’: Wall Street Remembers a Wild 2025\n\nMatthew Griffin\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 10 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\n^NDX\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Jed Ellerbroek barely slept.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nIt was the evening of Wednesday, April 2, and President Donald Trump had just appeared in the White House Rose Garden, brandishing a large placard with the punitive tariff rates he was slapping on countries around the world. On Wall Street, it quickly sunk in that Trump was serious about shattering a global trading system that he said was wired against the US.\nOver dinner with his family and throughout the night — as Asian markets tumbled, initiating a meltdown that would continue around the globe — Ellerbroek, a portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, tried to game out what would happen next.\nWhen he and his team hunkered down the next morning at their office in St. Louis, they sought to work through the implications for their stock holdings. As the selloff raged that day, Amazon.com Inc. — their largest position — tumbled nearly 10%.\nLike investors from Tokyo to New York, Ellerbroek was getting a frantic crash course in navigating what would be an unusually volatile year. The S&P 500 Index careened to the cusp of a bear market. Then sentiment reversed almost as quickly, unleashing one of the swiftest stock recoveries in decades and sending the benchmark back to new record highs. The overall lesson was that not panicking — or taking the leap to buy the dips — paid off.\n\nThe twists and turns of the US economy and the artificial-intelligence boom both played a role. But much of it could be traced to the White House.\n“Volatility is a feature, not a bug,” Irene Tunkel, chief US equity strategist at BCA Research, said of the Trump administration’s effect on markets. “This year rewarded people who were very nimble, very humble and were very willing to incorporate new information.”\nAlso, she said: “You had to be brave.”\nHere are some recollections from money managers and strategists about how they navigated the most pivotal market moments of 2025:\nJan. 27: DeepSeek\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen on Jan. 26 called it “AI’s Sputnik moment.” The rollout of a powerful, seemingly low-cost AI program by DeepSeek, a Chinese upstart, appeared to threaten the foundations of the recent US tech boom. When US markets opened the next day — a Monday — Nvidia Corp. shares plunged 17%, erasing nearly $600 billion from its value in the largest wipeout in market history. Semiconductor stocks had the worst day since March 2020.\n\nNancy Tengler, the head of Laffer Tengler Investments Inc., said her heart raced as she scrolled her phone, trying to catch up with the news while in the car on her way to CNBC for a television interview. As the details became clear, she said her reaction was, “This is an opportunity.”\n\nStory Continues\nLike some others, she was skeptical of DeepSeek, thinking it had low-balled its cost estimates. She struck a bullish tone toward tech stocks in her TV appearance. Her firm snapped up shares of Nvidia and other AI favorites.\nIt turned out to be a good call. DeepSeek didn’t sound the death-knell of the American approach to AI or stanch the flood of big-tech spending to develop the technology. The Nasdaq 100 Index was back at a record high within a month and went on to a 21% gain in 2025. Nvidia is up 40% this year.\n\nApril 2: ‘Liberation Day’\nGarrett Melson’s first reaction was shock. Then in the coming hours, as markets tumbled and social-media users tried to piece together what exactly Trump had just done, the fleeting relief of gallows humor: Trump’s trade war, as was soon caught, had gone so far as to penalize uninhabited islands near Antarctica that are populated by penguins.\n“Watching a sea of red on your screen, sometimes you have to laugh a little bit,” said Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.\nIt was the biggest two-day jolt to global markets since March 2020, when the pandemic started shutting down the US. It set off days of panicked selling when China retaliated, recession fears flared, and Treasuries slid — breaking from their typical haven role — as Trump’s willingness to challenge the global economic order cast doubt on the safety of US government debt.\n\nIn the days after the president’s announcement, Melson worked with his colleagues late into the evening and during the weekend running analyses, staring at charts and cranking out commentary for clients. In one portfolio model, the team increased its allocation to US stocks and corporate bonds.\nAt Argent, Ellerbroek sent an email to the investment team on April 4. “This is a scary moment,” he wrote. “If you made me pick whether we are closer to the start or finish of this episode, I’d probably say start.” Ellerbroek stuck to his positions, deciding against snapping up beaten-down stocks because there was simply too much uncertainty.\nNeil Sutherland, a fixed-income investor at Schroder Investment Management, and his colleagues started a project to track the fallout. They updated the average US tariff rate on affected countries as Trump kept rolling out new salvos, modeling the asset-price implications and relaying their findings to anxious clients. Eventually, they gave up.\n\n“It just honestly became meaningless because it would change in the space of five minutes,” Sutherland said. “We just had to come to realize that it’s a moving target.”\nApril 9: The Tariff Pause\nTunkel, the BCA stock strategist, had taken the day off to hunt for a house in Boca Raton, Florida. It had been a relatively quiet day for stocks, with the S&P 500 drifting sideways. But she stayed tuned to the radio during the three-hour drive from her home in Venice, on the Gulf Coast.\nThen, when she stopped for lunch and tuned out, the fear that descended on Wall Street days earlier quickly gave way to euphoria. At 1:18 p.m., after the bond-market selloff raised fears in Washington by pushing interest rates higher, Trump announced he was pausing many of his tariffs for 90 days. The S&P 500 surged 7% in less than 10 minutes and went on to a 9.5% gain — its biggest one-day jump since October 2008.\n\n“This magnitude of the moves in response to the piece of news — I think this is something that is historical,” Tunkel said. “We’ll always remember those moments.”\nJay Woods, the chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, saw the moment firsthand from his perch at the New York Stock Exchange. After the initial roar faded, he prepared to welcome a group of visitors. He was teaching a class in technical analysis at Fordham University. By chance, he had scheduled a field trip for his students to visit.\nBy the time they arrived, the Big Board was a sea of green — nearly everything up, with the so-called fear gauge, the VIX, one of the few exceptions. Alerts rang out constantly from brokers’ desks, including some with the ring of a cash register’s chime.\n\nThe day set up a dynamic that would occur repeatedly over the next several months and came to be known as the TACO trade, short for Trump Always Chickens Out. Traders started to discount his worst tariff threats, wagering they were only a negotiating tactic. Selloffs, therefore, were buying opportunities.\nChase Games, one of Woods’ students, was sucked in by the excitement. Visiting the exchange was “obviously a huge dream of mine,” said Games. “I lucked out.” In October, he started working as an intern at Woods’ firm, Freedom Capital.\nJune 21: Bombing of Iran\nIt was a Saturday evening in New Jersey, and Siebert Financial’s Mark Malek was celebrating his recent birthday when he learned the US had bombed Iran’s nuclear sites, a move that traders feared could dangerously escalate the conflicts in the Middle East.\n\n“If this is true, my phone is going to ring,” Malek told his family at the French restaurant in Asbury Park. Soon enough it did.\nFor all the risks, Malek wagered — counterintuitively — that stocks would rise. The S&P 500 had already pulled back recently as traders started fretting about a widening conflict between Israel and Iran. But he thought the US wouldn’t escalate the conflict from there and the market’s reaction would ultimately be relief.\nSure enough, the S&P 500 advanced roughly 1% on Monday — and then again on Tuesday — as Trump moved toward a ceasefire. It went on to end the week at another record high.\nOct. 10: Crypto Dives\n“What is going on?” Jeff Dorman thought as crypto markets nosedived. Trump had threatened an additional 100% tariff on China and traders were dumping risk assets. And Bitcoin, which had recently pushed over $125,000, was sliding as leveraged bets were unwound.\n\nMessages on Slack piled up at Arca, a crypto asset manager where Dorman is chief investment officer. He was at home, but soon he and his team were on a Zoom call. They made a plan to cover short positions by snapping up assets that had tumbled.\nIn their early days investing together, it would have taken them all night. After years of experience, they’d learned to draw up a plan and leave the execution to their traders. The CIO took stock of the situation, went to bed and “slept like a baby.”\nDorman remains bullish on segments of the crypto sector. Still, the moment, for now, has deflated the euphoria for crypto that swept through markets for much of the year as Trump championed the industry.\nIt also has bucked the buy-the-dip formula that’s paid off elsewhere in 2025. Bitcoin is heading to its first annual drop since the 2022 crash, and other popular cryptocurrencies have tumbled over the past two months. That has hammered crypto-linked shares like the stockpiler Strategy Inc. and the Trump-family-affiliated American Bitcoin Corp.\n\nNov. 21: Year-End ‘Sigh of Relief’\nIt had looked like the retreat from risk was poised to drag down the broader stock market, too, as worries about frothy AI valuations and the Federal Reserve’s rate-cut path weighed on the S&P 500.\nThe worries didn’t last. On Nov. 21, stocks started bouncing back on anticipation that the cooling labor market would prod the Fed to continue easing monetary policy, as it did when it met on Dec. 10.\nMeanwhile, the economy has kept on defying recession fears despite Trump’s trade war, federal-employee job cuts and a Congressional standoff that caused a record-long government shutdown. The AI boom, for all the bubble talk, hasn’t turned to bust. And whomever Trump picks to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell next year is seen as likely to back Trump’s push for even faster rate cuts.\n\nThat has sowed a late-year sense of optimism heading into 2026. After this year’s gains stung anybody who stuck to bearish calls, Wall Street strategists are anticipating that the S&P 500 will rise for a fourth straight year. If they’re right, that would be the longest winning streak in nearly two decades.\n“Overall,” Freedom Capital’s Woods said, “there’s a sigh of relief that we’ve gotten through some of the biggest waves that were thrown at this market.”\n--With assistance from Olga Kharif, Ye Xie, Carter Johnson, Alexandra Semenova, Michael MacKenzie and Yvonne Yue Li.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Amazon backs Flowers Foods at SCOTUS on delivery driver legal status\n\nJohn Kingston\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: FLO\n\nAMZN\n\nBeyond Flowers Foods itself, there may not be a company with as much at stake in the commercial baker’s case before the Supreme Court than Amazon.\nThat’s why the logistics and online retailer’s amicus brief in the Flowers Foods case, submitted earlier this month, stands out among several other filings in support of the core of Flowers Foods’ argument: that final mile workers fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) because the FAA’s exemption for transportation workers involved in interstate commerce should not apply to workers who never cross states lines in their activities.\n\nThe opposite of that finding was handed down by the 10th Circuit in the case of Brock vs. Flowers Foods. In that case, delivery drivers who transport such Flowers Foods products as Tastykakes and Wonder Bread were found by that circuit to be at the tail end of an interstate commerce supply chain and therefore fell under the exemption. That gives them the right to have their grievances aired in the legal system instead of an arbitration process.\nEmployers almost always favor arbitration; employees the opposite.\nConflicts in the circuits But there are decisions in the federal circuit courts that have ruled differently than the 10th Circuit, leading the Supreme Court to accept Flowers Foods’ petition for certiorari , presumably with the aim of straightening out the confusion.\nAmicus briefs filed in support of Flowers Foods’ (NYSE: FLO) argument featured several significant names besides Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . Among the filers in support of Flowers Foods were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Independent Bakers Association and five states that jointly filed an amicus brief: Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, Montana and Alaska.\n\nThe transportation exemption in the FAA says the act does not apply to “contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.” Although it does not say “transportation” in the final clause, courts have interpreted it as a transportation exemption.\nFlowers Foods already has been before the Supreme Court on the question of its bakery drivers’ legal status under the FAA. Last year, the Court rejected Flower Foods’ argument in a case known as Bisonette that its delivery drivers were actually bakery workers rather than transportation workers. If they were found to be bakery workers, the FAA would have applied in settling disputes. But the unanimous decision held that they were transportation workers.\n\nThe current case before the Supreme Court–the original named plaintiff was Angelo Brock, who was an independent contractor operating a route for Flowers Foods–is essentially part two of this dispute. Since the court already determined that bakery drivers are transportation employees and not bakery workers, the question is whether the FAA transportation exemption applies if the transportation workers never cross state lines.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is the real definition of interstate? In the opening paragraph of its brief, Amazon said that its local delivery services “characteristically take place wholly within a state.” It also notes that its various independently-owned delivery companies, like the Delivery Service Partners (DSPs) who ply the nation’s roads in their grey vehicles, or their Amazon Flex companies that often drive anything down to a car that could be 20 years old, pick up those goods for delivery at the end of a supply chain that in most cases did cross state lines at some point.\n\nAmazon comes down on the side that Brock and his co-plaintiffs are not engaged in interstate commerce and therefore not covered by the exception.\n“Congress designed a much simpler inquiry for the FAA exemption, and it is the inquiry this Court has identified: Does the relevant class of workers actively and directly engage in the transportation of goods across national or state borders, like seamen and railroad employees?” Amazon writes in its brief. “For local delivery drivers like Mr. Brock, who neither transport goods across borders nor interact with the vehicles and distinct classes of workers that actually do, the answer to that question is no.”\nBrock and the plaintiff’s supporters, Amazon writes, “fixate on the company’s objectives, like goods across state lines or completing transactions with customers in different states. But neither the transit history of the delivered goods nor the geographic scope of the company’s transactions affects what Mr. Brock and similar delivery drivers actually do.”\n\nA continuous journey A phrase from earlier decisions is whether the final mile is part of a “continuous interstate journey.” The 10th Circuit decision now before the Supreme Court said it was “convinced that Brock serves as the last-mile driver for Flowers, such that he is directly engaged in interstate commerce. Brock’s intrastate delivery route forms the last leg of the products’ continuous interstate route.”\n\nIn Amazon’s view, the courts that have made such a finding set a precedent that has “seen endless litigation and generated a massive body of decisions that reach arbitrary and inconsistent results.”\nThere are frequent references in the Amazon brief, and in others, to two cases that touch on the question of worker status under FAA. One is Bisonette, which after finding the bakery route drivers were in the transportation business and not the bakery business gave them the right to pursue grievances in court rather than arbitration.\nThe other is Southwest Airlines vs. Saxon. That 2022 Supreme Court decision found that a group of airline ground employees fell under the transportation exemption in the FAA even though all their work was done at one site.\n\nBut even as Amazon made references to those cases, it found differences between the workers in Bisonette and Saxon and the final mile delivery drivers in Brock. “The Saxon test requires more than merely playing a role in the sale and disposition of such products,” the Amazon brief said, citing precedents that dismissed the idea that pet shop employees or grocery store clerks “who move products onto and off of shelves, bag up customers’ purchases, and even wheel shopping carts out to their cars” could be considered part of an interstate commerce supply chain.\n“Helping interstate goods reach their ultimate destination does not make a class of workers actively engaged in those goods’ transportation across borders,” the Amazon brief says, again citing language in precedents.\n\nThe Saxon decision, Amazon says, “squarely rejected an employer-centered analysis,” that just because the employer is involved in interstate commerce that status cascades down the line to other economic activities conducted by the employer.\n“It is especially inappropriate to graft a transaction-based standard onto the FAA exemption when Congress made no mention of transactions in that provision,” the Amazon brief says.\nNot surprisingly, Amazon has particular disdain for the phrase “continuous interstate journey.” The brief reviews the many steps needed to get a product into a customer’s hands, including the very real possibility that it originated in a different state from the final delivery point.\nEven if that is the case, when the final delivery is made by an Amazon delivery service provider or Amazon Flex worker, the “transportation happened several steps, several different vehicles, and several classes of workers earlier. The local delivery work is the same regardless of the package’s place of origin.”\n\n“Under a ‘continuous interstate journey’ standard, however, the location of the original warehouse at the time the customer clicks ‘Buy Now’ may make all the difference,” the Amazon brief says. “If the customer’s item is in the same state as the customer, the Delivery Partner’s in-state delivery should not trigger the exemption. If the item is in a different state, it might.”\nAmazon wraps up its brief by saying that “the guiding consideration is what the relevant class of workers is doing, not what the business is doing. When workers neither transport goods across state lines nor interact with the vehicles that do so, they have no direct and active role in the cross-border transportation within the meaning of (the FAA).”\nFAA was at issue in New Prime case The question of status under the FAA led to a significant decision impacting long-haul trucking: New Prime vs. Oliveira in 2019 . In that case, the Supreme Court found that just because a truck driver is an independent contractor, he or she still is covered by the FAA in determining whether a dispute needs to go to arbitration or can be litigated in court. Arbitration in that case could not be forced under the terms of the FAA because the driver was engaged in interstate commerce. The independent contractor status did not negate the driver’s standing under the FAA.\n\nThe attorney who filed the brief for Amazon is Michael Kenneally. He had been a law clerk for Neil Gorsuch on the 10th Circuit (the same circuit as the Flowers Foods decision) and a Supreme Court clerk for Samuel Alito as well as the late Antonin Scalia.\nBoth Alito and Gorsuch will be hearing the Flowers Foods case though Kenneally will not be arguing it, having only filed an amicus brief.\nMore articles by John Kingston\nLove’s factoring business gets bigger, buying trio of companies\nNew York City bill that targeted Amazon won’t get taken up in 2025\nBenesch panelists: Why 2026 could be a strong year for logistics M&A\nThe post Amazon backs Flowers Foods at SCOTUS on delivery driver legal status appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Jeff Bezos Moved To Florida And That Impacted Washington State Budget, Says Ron DeSantis: 'States With No Income Tax Have A Major Advantage...'\n\nVishaal Sanjay\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said that Washington state’s fiscal outlook took a significant hit after Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) founder Jeff Bezos relocated from the state to Florida in late 2023.\n\nTaxpayers ‘Flee’ Due To Bad Policies On Sunday, in a post on X, DeSantis said that the state of Washington had “lost its biggest taxpayer,” referring to Bezos’ recent move to Florida.\nAccording to DeSantis, this single relocation of a billionaire entrepreneur has resulted in “a major impact” on Washington’s state budget.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\nFrom Moxy Hotels to $12B in Real Estate — The Firm Behind NYC's Trendiest Properties Is Letting Individual Investors In.\n\nWhile he didn’t mention any specific figures, Bezos’ move to his infamous “billionaire bunker” in the exclusive Indian Creek Village community outside of Miami in 2024 reportedly helped him save $1 billion in taxes . This is a considerable figure given Washington state’s annual revenue of $66.39 billion from 2023 through 2025.\nThis comes amid Washington’s plans for a new state income tax on its millionaire residents, which DeSantis said would be “counterproductive,” since it hands states that don’t have an income tax, such as Florida, “a major advantage over states that do.”\n“Washington has already driven taxpayers out due to bad policies,” he said, adding that the inevitable result of such bad policies is that “taxpayers will flee.”\n\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses— This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\nHe warned that states will continue spending, and eventually, what began as a tax on millionaires will expand to the rest of the tax base. “This will further erode the economic base — and the cycle will keep repeating,” he said in conclusion.\n\nStory Continues\nNeither Bezos nor the State of Washington immediately responded to Benzinga’s request for a comment on this matter. The story will be updated as soon as we receive a response.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nBillionaires Plan Exit From California Amid New Wealth Tax Other states, such as California, are headed in a similar direction, with a new proposal for a wealth tax on the state’s billionaires, called the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act.\nAccording to the proposal, a one-time levy of 5% would be imposed on all state residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion, with stiff penalties for understating wealth, and additional measures to prevent evasion among the state’s 200 billionaire residents.\n\nBillionaire investor Peter Thiel and Alphabet Inc.

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 30, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.\nBuy the \"Mag 7\" Hyperscalers Or Are They Spending Too Much?\nAlthough they are among the world&rsquo;s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\n\nThis includes Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms and Microsoft , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\nThere is no doubt that &ldquo;hyperscaling&rdquo; is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns\nNotably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billio\nROIC Comparison\nWith Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market&rsquo;s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\n\nAmazon&rsquo;s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance\nMagnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon&rsquo;s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon&rsquo;s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts\nAmazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500&rsquo;s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

Wilson's hoping for a change on the company's board as it searches for a new new CEO. That's according to the Wall Street Journal. Earlier this month, remember, Lulu Lemon announced current CEO Calvin McDonald's plans to step down from his role and as a member of the company's board of directors. Soon after the announcement, activist investor Elliott Investment Management took a $1 billion stake in the company, pushing for a former Ralph Lauren executive to take the helm.\n00:39 Speaker A\nTurning to tech, Amazon halting its plans for drone delivery in Italy.

      "Content": "2026 Big Tech Quantum Bets: IBM and Amazon's Edge Over Pure-Plays?\n\nUrmimala Biswas\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:00 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: RGTI\n\nAMZN\n\nQBTS\n\nIBM\n\nIn the first several months of 2025, pure-play quantum computing stocks such as Rigetti Computing RGTI and D-Wave Quantum QBTS delivered spectacular returns as investors chased early-stage breakthroughs and future potential. From January to September, while QBTS stock rallied 157%, RGTI gained 49%. These rallies were driven by rapid valuation expansion, growing venture investment in the sector and positive sentiment around promising revenue streams, despite overall revenues remaining modest.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, the momentum has cooled significantly lately. Pure-play names have shifted from parabolic gains toward more muted year-to-date performance and heightened volatility amid stretched valuations. From October 2025 to date, shares of QBTS gained just 2.3% while RGTI lost 24.9% during this period. As pure-plays struggled to sustain stock-price momentum, large technology companies such as Amazon AMZN and IBM IBM attracted stronger investor sentiment, supported by progress in their quantum initiatives embedded within diversified and profitable business models.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWho Stands to Benefit More From Quantum Computing in 2026?\nAs 2026 approaches, several Wall Street analysts have flagged the possibility of further downside for pure-play quantum stocks, noting that while engineering milestones and strategic partnerships are meaningful, revenue scale, margin visibility and sustainable profitability remain years away. This lack of near-term commercial clarity makes it difficult to confidently project outsized gains in 2026, even as the long-term promise of quantum computing remains intact.\n\nIn contrast, diversified technology leaders such as IBM and Amazon offer a structurally different risk profile. Their quantum initiatives are embedded within large, cash-generating businesses, allowing continued investment without dependence on near-term quantum monetization. IBM’s enterprise relationships and hybrid quantum-classical roadmap, alongside Amazon’s cloud-based quantum services through AWS, position both companies to benefit incrementally as adoption evolves. As a result, 2026 may favor steady, fundamentals-driven returns from Big Tech, rather than another speculative surge in pure-play quantum stocks.\n2 Best Picks\nAmazon : Amazon Web Services (AWS) is advancing quantum computing primarily through Amazon Braket, a cloud-based quantum research and development platform that gives users access to a wide array of quantum devices, including superconducting, trapped-ion and neutral-atom systems via a unified interface for building and running algorithms. In 2025, AWS announced Ocelot, its first proprietary quantum computing chip, designed with cat qubits to make error correction up to 90% more resource-efficient.\n\nStory Continues\nContinued enhancements like “program sets” to accelerate quantum task execution further strengthen Braket’s utility for researchers. In 2026, these developments may translate into deeper enterprise engagement with hybrid quantum-classical workflows and early commercial experimentation within AWS’s broader cloud ecosystem.\nAmazon, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has gained 5.9% from October 2025 to date. The stock is projected to report 2026 earnings growth of 9.5% on revenue growth of 11.3%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIBM : The company’s quantum computing strategy follows a public roadmap focused on achieving scientific quantum advantage by the end of 2026. In late 2025, IBM unveiled Quantum Nighthawk, a 120-qubit processor with enhanced connectivity and error-mitigation capabilities and plans to scale to higher gate counts through 2026, enabling more complex circuits.\n\nComplemented by its open Qiskit software stack and partnerships for a community-wide quantum advantage tracker, IBM’s ecosystem is structured to drive adoption across research and enterprise use cases. For 2026, IBM’s combination of hardware, software and cloud access positions it to deliver measurable quantum progress integrated with its broader technology offerings.\nIBM, another Zacks Rank #2 stock, has gained 8.1% from October 2025 to date. The stock is projected to report 2026 earnings growth of 7.5% on revenue growth of 4.9%.

The company has a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion as I write this, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a 21% return over the next year if it does cross the $3 trillion milestone.\nRead on, and let's consider Amazon's growth prospects in the year ahead.\nAll eyes on Amazon Web Services Amazon's potential pathway to the $3 trillion club next year starts with its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It used to be a place where businesses would simply store data and host their critical digital applications, but it has evolved to become the center of Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAWS operates state-of-the-art data centers and it rents the computing capacity to AI developers who don't have the financial resources to build their own infrastructure. These data centers are filled with advanced AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia , but Amazon also designed its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium. Top developers like Anthropic are using hundreds of thousands of the latest Trainium2 chips, which offer up to 40% better price performance than competing hardware when training AI models.\nThen there is the AWS Bedrock platform, where businesses can access hundreds of completed AI models from third-parties including Anthropic and Meta Platforms . Developing models from scratch is time consuming and expensive, so using a ready-made solution can help businesses achieve their AI goals much faster.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), which was up 20% year over year. That was the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, which highlights the platform's incredible AI-driven momentum. But it gets better, because AWS has a whopping $200 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online, so the strong top-line results are likely to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's earnings continue to crush Wall Street's estimates The $33 billion in third-quarter revenue that AWS brought in accounted for just 18% of Amazon's total revenue of $180 billion. However, the cloud business is the company's most profitable by far, contributing 65% of its total operating income. E-commerce is actually Amazon's largest source of revenue, but its profit margins are very thin because its Amazon.com site focuses on selling a high volume of products at low prices.\n\nHowever, Amazon is pushing to improve profitability in its e-commerce business by boosting efficiency and implementing new technologies. In 2023, it broke its U.S. logistics network into eight distinct regions, so now the products in each fulfillment center are specific to their geographic region. As a result, orders travel shorter distances to reach customers, which brings down packing and shipping costs.\nAmazon also uses AI-powered software like Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers, which uses computer vision to identify defective products before they ship. This reduces returns and refunds, creating further cost savings.\nThe accelerating growth at AWS combined with improved efficiency in the e-commerce business is driving a huge increase in Amazon's overall profit. The company generated earnings of $5.22 per share during the first three quarters of 2025, which was a whopping 42% jump from the same period in 2024. Plus, Amazon's earnings have beaten Wall Street's consensus estimates in every single quarter of 2025, by an average of 22%.\n\nHow Amazon can cross the $3 trillion milestone in 2026 Amazon stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.8 as I write this. That's roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so Amazon stock is basically sitting at fair value relative to its peers in the tech sector.\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate earnings of $7.86 per share in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6.\nAssuming Wall Street is right, Amazon stock would have to climb by 11% next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 32.8, lifting its market cap to $2.75 trillion. But remember, the company has a habit of beating Wall Street's expectations.\nIf its 2026 earnings beat the consensus estimate by 22% like they have so far in 2025, then its stock could be poised for a 35% gain next year instead. That would catapult its market value to a whopping $3.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, even an earnings beat of just 9% next year would be enough to see Amazon join the $3 trillion club. Given the incredible momentum across its e-commerce business and AWS, I think that's an achievable target.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Amazon Data Centers Aren’t Raising Your Electric Bills—They May Be Lowering Them\n\nAaron Larson\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:23 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nPCG\n\nETR\n\nD\n\nAs electricity demand from data centers continues to surge, a persistent question has dogged the industry: Are residential ratepayers footing the bill for massive tech infrastructure? According to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and an independent study it commissioned, the answer is a definitive no. As a guest on The POWER Podcast , Mandy Ulrich, senior manager of energy and water for Americas East at AWS, outlined the company’s energy strategy and discussed findings from a study by Energy and Environmental Economics Inc. (E3) that examined how Amazon data centers impact local power systems .\n\nStudy Finds Data Centers Generate Surplus Revenue The E3 study evaluated Amazon data centers across a diverse set of utility territories, including large investor-owned utilities such as Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and Dominion Energy, mid-size utilities like Entergy, and cooperatives such as Umatilla Electric Cooperative in the Pacific Northwest. “The simple answer is that Amazon data centers are not being subsidized by other utility customers,” Ulrich said. The study projects that Amazon’s data centers will generate $33,500/MW of surplus value in 2025, increasing to $60,650/MW by 2030. For a typical 100-MW Amazon data center, that translates to $3.4 million in surplus revenues in 2025 and approximately $6.1 million by 2030. These surplus funds—revenues above the utility’s regulated rate of return—can be used by utilities to modernize grid infrastructure, improving reliability for all customers.\n\nGrid Investment Benefits All Customers The study found that Amazon data centers are driving investments in grid infrastructure that support not just their own operations but also local residential and commercial growth. Ulrich pointed to Entergy Mississippi as a prime example, where the utility is using investments from Amazon and other large customers to fund a $300 million “Superpower Mississippi” grid reliability campaign —at no cost to residential customers—targeting a 50% reduction in outages within five years.\n\nInnovative Rate Structures Prevent Cost-Shifting While the E3 study validates that existing rate policies have been effective in preventing cross-subsidization, Ulrich emphasized that AWS continues to work with utilities on innovative approaches to ensure large industrial customers pay their fair share. She highlighted a Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO) project as a “groundbreaking model.” Under this first-of-its-kind agreement, Amazon is investing in 3 GW of electrical capacity, with 2.4 GW dedicated to data center operations and 600 MW reserved specifically to support grid reliability for all NIPSCO customers. The structure creates a separate generation company (GenCo) that operates under a “commercial contract term,” Ulrich explained. By operating as a separate entity, GenCo isolates the cost of new growth to data centers. “The data center companies that drive new demand for electricity will fund the generation and transmission infrastructure they require, ensuring that regular customers don’t shoulder those costs, even if the customer leaves before contract completion,” NIPSCO said in a Nov. 24 press release . “NIPSCO’s existing customers will have no financial responsibility for powering Amazon data centers,” Ulrich said. NIPSCO said, “This structure is expected to provide value to customers by generating approximately $1 billion in cost savings that will be returned to current NIPSCO customers as credits on monthly electric bills over the project’s 15-year duration.”\n\nStory Continues\nPartnering with Communities In the Pacific Northwest, AWS announced a self-supply agreement with Umatilla Electric Cooperative (UEC) in 2023 that allows Amazon to take responsibility for sourcing its own energy supply, enabling the company to include additional renewable resources in its portfolio. Meanwhile, UEC has lauded AWS as a strong supporter of the entire community . It said the companies have collaborated “to provide energy assistance, support local aid organizations, and bolster student connectivity and virtual learning.” “AWS continues to be an outstanding community partner for the Umatilla Schools and this community,” Heidi Sipe, Umatilla School District Superintendent, said in a spotlight post on UEC’s website.\n\nEfficiency as Part of the Strategy AWS is also focusing on fundamental efficiency improvements. Ulrich noted that the company designs its own purpose-built chips, with Graviton-based instances using up to 60% less energy for equivalent performance. More than 70,000 customers have adopted these chips. The company’s Inferentia2–based instances offer up to 50% better performance per watt for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. On the facilities side, AWS has achieved innovative designs that provide 12% more compute power per data center, more efficient cooling systems that reduce mechanical energy consumption by up to 46%, and the use of lower-carbon concrete and steel that has cut embodied carbon by 35%, Ulrich reported. The results show in AWS’s global power usage effectiveness (PUE) score of 1.15 in 2024—significantly better than the 1.25 public cloud industry average and far below the 1.63 average for on-premises corporate data centers.\n\nCarbon-Free Energy at Scale AWS has positioned itself as the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for five consecutive years, enabling more than 600 renewable energy projects globally—enough to power 8.3 million U.S. homes, according to Ulrich. She said the company achieved its goal of matching 100% of electricity consumption with renewable energy seven years ahead of schedule. Beyond renewables, AWS has invested billions in nuclear energy, including projects in Pennsylvania and Washington state. The company has also invested in 11 solar-plus-battery storage projects to deliver stored solar energy during peak demand periods.\n\nLooking Ahead As data center demand continues to grow—driven by AI adoption, streaming services, and increasing digital dependence—the question of who pays for infrastructure will remain a key policy debate. The E3 study and AWS’s innovative agreements with utilities offer one model for how large electricity consumers and utilities can work together without burdening residential customers. “We want to ensure that we’ve got the right reliable power to support [our customers], and we want to do that in a way that is collaborative with our local utility partners,” Ulrich said. “We intend to be there for the long haul.” To hear the full interview with Ulrich, which contains more about data centers and the work AWS is doing to keep them sustainable, listen to The POWER Podcast .

      "Content": "Can Strong Platform Revenues Support Further Upside in Roku Stock?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ROKU\n\nDIS\n\nAMZN\n\nRoku 's ROKU platform revenues are driven by advertising activities and streaming services distribution. Advertising includes video ads delivered across the Roku platform and The Roku Channel, while streaming services distribution covers revenues from Premium Subscriptions, transaction fees on content purchases and Roku-billed subscriptions. This dual revenue structure provides diversification and gives Roku multiple levers to drive platform growth.\n\nAdvertising remains the key driver of platform momentum. Roku has expanded integrations with major demand-side platforms such as Amazon DSP, Trade Desk and FreeWheel, allowing advertisers to access inventory through preferred buying channels. Programmatic transactions account for a rising share of video ad impressions, improving demand access and monetisation efficiency. Roku Ads Manager is broadening the advertiser base by attracting small and medium-sized businesses and performance marketers. Nearly 90% of advertisers using Ads Manager are new to Roku, pointing to incremental demand rather than dependence on traditional brand budgets. Video advertising growth continues to outpace the broader U.S. OTT and digital advertising markets, supporting visibility into platform revenue trends.\n\nStreaming services distribution adds a second growth driver. Subscriptions are benefiting from improved content discovery and AI-powered recommendations that support higher conversions. Roku’s 2026 content slate is expected to strengthen The Roku Channel with originals such as Broad Trip, The Laguna Beach Reunion and The Great American Baking Show Season 2 , alongside third-party titles including The Spiderwick Chronicles and Die Hart Season 3 . Engagement is expected to be further supported by The Roku Sports Channel, which features MLB Sunday Leadoff, NBA G League and Formula E content. Howdy, Roku’s $2.99 ad-free subscription service with nearly 10,000 hours of content targets a value-focused audience and expands monetisation opportunities.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 platform revenues is pegged at $1.12 billion, indicating 14.5% year-over-year growth. With advertising execution and subscription expansion progressing together, Roku’s platform revenues appear well-positioned to support further upside.\n\nROKU Faces Intensifying Competition Roku’s platform competes with Netflix NFLX and Disney DIS as both expand ad-supported streaming and subscription monetization. Netflix is scaling its ad tier alongside subscriptions, while Netflix continues to monetise viewing inside its own app. Disney follows a similar path across Disney+ and Hulu, with Disney using premium content to support ads and subscriptions. Unlike Netflix and Disney, Roku monetises viewing across apps at the platform level rather than single-service control models.\n\nStory Continues\nROKU’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates ROKU shares have risen 27.5% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s decline of 15.5% and the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s plunge of 6.7%.\nROKU’s Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Roku stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio of 3.11X compared with the industry’s 4.3X.

Like I said, this is really an evolving space. So I I would be careful with something that's so specific as Nvidia. Uh we kind of like to barbell this with, you know, something like the the big hyperscaler like a like an Alphabet Google, uh because that's really the type of name that uh you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because they just\n01:14 Adam\noverall, the AI story is just benefiting an already existing business model that was doing well. So, I think you would just want to be careful with what we're calling kind of the one trick ponies, like a Nvidia, uh a Core Weve or a Patier right now.\n01:31 Speaker A\nUh, Brooke, let me get over to you because I think what you're seeing in industrial metals and some of the things that Adam's talking about fits nicely with what we heard from Ed Yardini this morning that he might see it is likely to see we are likely to see a broadening out in this rally. Investors doing their homework, trying to get outside of the tried and true Mag 7.\n01:53 Brooke\nYeah, Brian, what we did hear from Ed Danny over the weekend was really ongoing momentum in this market in 2026. He maintained that year end target for the S&P 500 of 7,700 and he said largely it won't be really led by uh the Mag 7, but also what he called the impressive 493 of the S&P 500 as really this broadening out, this boost in productivity growth really leads to overall returns for the\n02:26 Brooke\nS&P 500 in 2026. Specifically, you know, he went on to say that that is really where exactly investors should be thinking about this mindset. You know, not really overweight technology, but more so thinking about the other users of AI as opposed to just the producers of AI. And so certainly he's not alone in this uh momentum that he thinks will exist within 2026 ongoing from what we've seen so far in the returns in 2025.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Stocks Slip Due to Weakness in Megacap Technology Stocks\n\nRich Asplund\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CDE\n\nHL\n\nSPY\n\nDIA\n\nFCX\n\nThe S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is down -0.24%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down -0.09%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is down -0.24%. March E-mini S&P futures (ESH26) are down -0.28%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH26) are down -0.27%.\n\nStock indexes are moving lower today, led by losses in megacap technology stocks. Also, today's plunge in metals prices is weighing on mining stocks. Lower bond yields are supportive of stocks, with the 10-year T-note yield falling to a 1-week low of 4.10% today.\nMore News from Barchart Santa Claus Rally, Fed Minutes and Other Can't Miss Items this Week\nMicron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMP Materials Gained 230% in 2025.

The recent surge in both metals has taken prices to overbought levels, sparking technical selling. Also, the CME today raised margin levels for precious metals trading, which has sparked some long liquidation pressure.\nCrude oil prices are up by more than +2% today, lifting energy producers and limiting losses in the broader market, as advanced peace talks over the weekend to end the Ukraine-Russian war failed to yield a breakthrough. Geopolitical tensions from Venezuela to Nigeria are also supporting crude prices. In addition, crude prices rose after China's Ministry of Finance on Sunday pledged to broaden its fiscal spending base next year, signaling government support to drive economic growth.\n\nSeasonal factors are bullish for stocks. According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.\nMarket attention this holiday-shortened week will focus on US economic news. Later today, Nov pending home sales are expected to climb +1.0% m/m. On Tuesday, the Dec MNI Chicago PMI is expected to rise by +3.5 points to 39.8. Also, the minutes of the December 9-10 FOMC meeting will be released. On Wednesday, initial weekly unemployment claims are expected to increase by 1,000 to 215,000. On Friday, the Dec S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unrevised at 51.8.\n\nStory Continues\nThe markets are discounting the odds at 19% for a -25 bp rate cut at the FOMC's next meeting on January 27-28.\nOverseas stock markets are mixed today. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.17%. China's Shanghai Composite climbed to a 6-week high and closed up +0.04% for the ninth consecutive daily gain. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.44%.\n\nInterest Rates\nMarch 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) today are up by +4 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is down -1.6 bp to 4.112%. Mar T-notes rose to a 1-week high today, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1-week low of 4.102%. Today's stock market weakness is boosting safe-haven demand for T-notes. Also, geopolitical risks in Venezuela and Nigeria have added to the safe-haven appeal of T-notes.\nEuropean government bond yields are moving lower today. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.836% and is down -1.4 bp at 2.848%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 1-week low of 4.459% and is down -0.7 bp to 4.500%.\nSwaps are discounting a 2% chance of a +25 bp rate hike by the ECB at its next policy meeting on February 5.\n\nUS Stock Movers\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly lower today, pressuring the broader market. Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) are down more than -1%.

      "Content": "Quantum computing works — now investors will see if the stocks do too\n\nCharlie Garcia\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: IBM\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nIONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nEditor’s note: Columnist Charlie Garcia shares select emails and online comments from his virtual mailbag each week.\nDear Charlie, I see three investment lanes for quantum computing : pure plays like IonQ IONQ and Rigetti RGTI; the “Magnificent Seven” giants with quantum divisions; and infrastructure picks-and-shovels.\nMost Read from MarketWatch I make more than my wife. Can she claim Social Security at 62 and later switch to spousal benefits?\n‘Is it a case of them or us?’ We’re in our 40s. Do we retire early in our 50s — or save for our kids’ education?\nLogan Paul’s $5.3 million Pokémon bet raises a bigger question: Do collectibles belong in your portfolio?\nThe hot AI trade faces a 1980s style trap and these risks, says this market bull\n\nWhich lane has the best risk-reward?\nMason\nDear Mason, All three lanes lead somewhere. The question is which one fits your risk tolerance.\nPure plays like IonQ, Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum QBTS are lottery tickets with better odds. They’re not competing with the Magnificent Seven; they’re auditioning to be acquired by them. If one of these companies cracks a genuine commercial advantage, it becomes a buyout target overnight. High risk; asymmetric upside.\n\nThe Mag Seven are already in: Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon.com AMZN have billion-dollar quantum programs. So does IBM IBM. You’re not betting on whether they’ll participate. You’re betting on whether quantum becomes material to their earnings this decade. Safer, but the quantum upside is diluted by everything else in the stock.\nInfrastructure is where the near-term money lives. Post-quantum cryptography is already a compliance issue. NIST standardized new algorithms in 2024, and every government contractor, bank and defense company needs to upgrade. That’s not speculative. That’s a budget line-item.\nThe picks-and-shovels play isn’t qubits. It’s the classical-quantum interface: cryogenic systems, control electronics, error-correction software. Less sexy than “we built a quantum computer” — and more likely to generate revenue this decade.\n\nMy bias? I own positions across all three lanes, but I’m most interested in security infrastructure. That’s the toll road everyone has to drive on.\nDiversified but opinionated,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best investors in the mobile revolution didn’t bet on which phone would win. They bet on Qualcomm’s QCOM chips inside all of them.\nDear Charlie, Quantum computing is just another fantasy — like AI was for decades. Error correction is still unsolved.\nThis is vaporware.\nNancy\nDear Nancy, Error correction was unsolved. Past tense.\n\nStory Continues\nIn December 2024, Google’s Willow chip became the first quantum processor to demonstrate “below threshold” error correction. That’s the holy grail physicists have chased for 30 years. The chip showed that scaling up qubit arrays, from 3×3 to 5×5 to 7×7, reduced error rates instead of compounding them. That’s never happened before.\n\nThree weeks later, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in topological qubits. Amazon’s Ocelot chip cut error-correction costs by 90%. IBM confirmed it’s on track for a 100,000-qubit system by 2029. A University of Chicago professor called it “escape velocity.”\nYou’re right that quantum computing was vaporware for decades. So was AI. In 2020, experts said artificial general intelligence was 50 years away. In 2024, AI writes code, passes the bar exam and diagnoses cancer better than radiologists.\nThe difference between “decades away” and “here” is usually about 18 months of denial.\nStill skeptical after all these years,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best time to invest in a technology is when smart people still think it’s a fantasy.\nDear Charlie, North Korea stole $2 billion in crypto in 2024. When quantum computing matures, all encryption is at risk. What makes you think bitcoin BTCUSD survives?\nAlex\nDear Alex, You’re conflating two different problems: hackers and hardware.\nNorth Korea didn’t crack bitcoin’s cryptography. It compromised employees. The Bybit heist, around $1.5 billion, came from social engineering and insider access, not supercomputers. That’s not a quantum threat. That’s a human one.\nNow, the real question: What happens when quantum computers can break elliptic curve cryptography?\n\nAnswer: Everything breaks. Not just bitcoin. Google, Microsoft, the U.S. Federal Reserve, every bank, every military system, every government database on earth. If quantum computing cracks bitcoin, it’s already cracked the entire digital infrastructure of modern civilization. Bitcoin isn’t the first domino. It’s somewhere around the 40th.\nBut here’s what the doomsayers miss: bitcoin upgrades. The U.S. government’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) — the same agency that sets the standards for everything from weights and measures to cybersecurity — standardized quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms in 2024.\nThe bitcoin network can migrate to post-quantum signatures. Active coins move to new addresses with new encryption.\n\nLost bitcoins, including founder Satoshi’s, stay frozen in old addresses. That’s roughly 4 million coins in vulnerable P2PK addresses that become unspendable. Security goes up. Circulating supply goes down. That’s not a death sentence for bitcoin. That’s a supply shock.\nTimeline? Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang says 15 to 30 years before quantum computers can break current encryption. Bitcoin security expert Jameson Lopp estimates bitcoin needs five to 10 years to complete a migration. The math works.\nQuantum computing is a threat to everything. That’s exactly why it isn’t a special threat to bitcoin.\nWatching the sausage get made,\nCharlie\nP.S. North Korea’s hackers don’t need quantum physics. They just need your password.\nDear Charlie, Horizon scanning is no longer optional. First movers will be those who translate technical complexity into business strategy.\nDon’t you agree?\nSarah\nDear Sarah, Exactly right. The companies that win won’t be the ones with the most qubits. They’ll be the ones who figure out what to do with them first.\nQubits are a vanity metric. Error-corrected, commercially viable quantum systems are the real race. The winners will be the ones that turn physics experiments into recurring revenue.\n\nYou’re right that horizon scanning is no longer optional. The companies that spot quantum’s commercial applications first will own the decade. The ones still waiting for proof of concept will be writing case studies about what they missed.\nEyes on the horizon,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best business strategies are written by people who understand what the technology can’t do yet.\nDear Charlie, You’re right that “wafer-scale cryogenic integration” makes investment decisions difficult. But when the railroad was hard to explain, the travelers were few.\nWhen it worked, they were 100 times more numerous. I’m buying the complexity.\nPierre\nDear Pierre, You understand something most investors don’t: The more revolutionary the technology, the harder it is to evaluate. “Wafer-scale cryogenic integration” doesn’t fit in a spreadsheet.\nNeither did “horseless carriage” in 1905.\nThe best investors in transformational technologies aren’t the ones who understand physics. They’re the ones who understand the implications.\n\nYou’re buying the complexity. I’m right there with you.\nFellow traveler,\nCharlie\nP.S. Nobody who bought Standard Oil stock could explain fractional distillation either.\nHe has no position in any of the companies or investments mentioned in this article.\n\nMore from Charlie Garcia:\nQuantum computing is the stock market’s next big tech play — and these stocks are still cheap\nChina is quietly destroying the dollar — and that’ll cost you. Fight back with these money moves.\nThe real money in AI chips is in these stocks — and you’ve probably never heard of them\nThe dollar is losing the world’s respect — but you’re losing much more\nMost Read from MarketWatch Here are the ideas that could really help solve America’s affordability crisis in 2026\n‘I completely trust her’: Should I name my daughter as beneficiary on all my accounts — or add her name instead?\nHow the New Year’s tax deadline poses a risk for gold, silver and the Dow\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Amazon stock could have nearly 50% upside in 2026\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 5:14 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nAmazon's ( AMZN ) stock has hardly had a prime performance in 2025.\nShares of the e-commerce and cloud giant are only up 6% year to date, badly lagging the 18% advance for the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ). Experts cite slowing sales growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) business and mixed sentiment on the company's ability to monetize artificial intelligence as the drivers of the \"mixed\" sentiment.\nAmazon didn't do much to bolster sentiment in October when it announced its largest-ever round of layoffs in its history, eliminating 14,000 corporate roles.\nThe stock is likely to close out the year with the unenviable award for worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" member.\n\nFor perspective, the top performer of the Magnificent Seven, Alphabet ( GOOG ), has surged 66% this year on the back of optimism for its new Gemini 3 model .\nBut Wall Street has stuck with Amazon, with some even putting it on their \"top picks\" lists for 2026.\nEvercore ISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney wrote that he thinks Amazon has about 50% upside potential. He was one of the Street analysts slapping a top pick stamp on the stock.\n\nMahaney cited several catalysts coming into focus soon, including reaccelerating growth at AWS, demand for new Trainium AI chips, further strong growth in advertising revenue, and a ramp in the new Alexa+.\n\"At the end of the day, Amazon remains a high quality compounder (25% EPS compound annual growth rate), with solid double-digit revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and free cash flow likely to inflect up materially in a 24-month timeframe,\" Mahaney said.\nYahoo Finance data shows of the 67 sell-side analysts that cover Amazon, 96% rate the stock a Strong Buy or Buy. The average $295 price target for the Street assumes 27% upside from current levels.\nInput from Polymarket, a Yahoo Finance partner for prediction market data, reveals Main Street has a more skeptical take on the stock, however. About 96% of users think the stock will be little changed by the end of January 2026 compared to today.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth is in Mahaney's bull camp on Amazon, with a more subdued projection on the stock that estimates 30% upside potential.\nAnmuth's thesis on Amazon is similar to Mahaney's, though he noted that Amazon's new $38 billion, seven-year cloud services deal with OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) could \"add upside\" to the company's top line.\n\"Amazon is the most diversified mega-cap across revenues and profit and has various large growth opportunities — mixed sentiment and attractive valuation,\" Anmuth added.\n\nStory Continues\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "Amazon Halts Italy Drone Delivery Plans After Strategic Review\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:52 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nAmazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) said on Sunday that it has paused plans for commercial drone deliveries in Italy following a strategic review, signaling a recalibration of its ambitions in the market. While the company pointed to constructive engagement with Italian aerospace regulators, it said the broader business and regulatory framework in Italy does not currently support its longer-term objectives for the drone delivery program.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe decision follows positive discussions earlier this year between Amazon and Italy's aviation regulator, Ente Nazionale per l'Aviazione Civile, including a June meeting focused on the progress of the drone delivery project in the San Salvo area. Those talks had centered on regulatory progress and operational development, but Amazon said the wider structural environment ultimately led it to halt commercial plans for now.\nAmazon added that its drone delivery initiatives in other regions continue to move forward. The company said projects in the U.S. and the UK are progressing positively, with ongoing test flights and commercial deliveries described as successful and well received by customers, suggesting that drone delivery could remain a selective, market-specific opportunity rather than a uniform global rollout.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Amazon\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:49 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 29, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nMeta Platforms' AI Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\nMeta Platforms is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META&rsquo;s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META&rsquo;s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms&rsquo; initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company&rsquo;s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet and Amazon , are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space\n\nMeta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\nAlphabet&rsquo;s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans. This is driving GOOGL's advertising revenue growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Amazon&rsquo;s advertising revenues increased 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company announced partnerships allowing advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify and SiriusXM Media through Amazon Ads, expanding its advertising reach beyond its own properties. The strong performance in advertising reflected successful AI-powered optimization of the platform and growing market share in digital advertising, providing a high-margin revenue stream that supports investments in other parts of the business.\n\nMETA&rsquo;s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\nMeta Platforms shares have climbed 11.3% in the trailing 12 months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 24.6%.\nMeta Platforms stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.22X compared with the broader sector&rsquo;s 6.62X. META has a Value Score of C.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.16 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, suggesting 1.75% year-over-year growth.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc.

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:33 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 29, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\n3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. , Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\nGlobal e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN&rsquo;s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon&rsquo;s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is &ldquo;Growing at a pace we haven&rsquo;t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we&rsquo;ve been focused on accelerating capacity &mdash; adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.&rdquo;\nExtensive AI Applications\n\nAmazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called &ldquo;Project Rainier.&rdquo; This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers&rsquo; queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\nAMZN&rsquo;s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance\nAmazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\nMicrosoft Corp.\nMicrosoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT&rsquo;s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company&rsquo;s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT&rsquo;s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength\nMicrosoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN&rsquo;s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT&rsquo;s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nAlphabet Inc.\nThe undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company&rsquo;s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\n\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business\nGoogle Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon&rsquo;s AWS and Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\n\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions\nZacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Online Shoppers, Say Goodbye to Free Returns\n\nMallika Mitra\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:01 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNothing in life is free. Not even online returns.\nFor years, consumers got used to treating their bedrooms like fitting rooms as e-commerce grew in popularity and eventually boomed during the pandemic. Sure, there was the convenience of ordering a new pair of shoes and having them delivered to your doorstep. But one of the other major bonuses of online shopping was that you could send back your purchases with no questions asked and no money asked for.\n\nThat benefit — once an industry norm — is going by the wayside. In the US, 72% of merchants charge for at least some return options, up from 66% last year, according to a report published by the National Retail Federation (NRF) and UPS-owned logistics company Happy Returns in October. That’s in part due to the same reason that shopping is more expensive across the board nowadays: tariffs.\nSUBSCRIBE: Receive more of our free The Daily Upside newsletter. READ ALSO: Holiday Shoppers Brace for 2026 Payments on Record BNPL Loans and Another No Good, Very Bad Year for Retail Stores\nGot Membership? Tariffs have pushed up the costs of goods and labor. As companies’ overall cost of doing business increases, so has the cost of managing returns — think everything from shipping prices to labor at distribution centers.\nAs a result, retailers have had to pivot. Free returns are now a perk, not a guarantee:\n\nMore retailers are offering free online returns as a reward for signing up for their membership or loyalty programs, says David Morin, vice president of customer strategy at returns technology company Narvar. At Macy’s, for instance, return shipping is free for Star Rewards members, but $9.99 plus tax for non-members.\nFirst-party data is critical to retailers, and having customers sign up for those programs gives them access to it, Morin says. Customers don’t seem to mind: 73% of the roughly 3,500 consumers Narvar surveyed for its 2025 State of Post-Purchase Report said they would share more personal data with trusted retailers if it gave them better loyalty perks and experiences.\nGo Old School: You can also almost always just head to a physical store to avoid the return fee (and get a faster refund). Amazon, which has upended the way we think about online shopping, lets customers return items at Whole Foods, Kohl’s, Staples and UPS in addition to its own physical stores.\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside .

      "Content": "Buy the Dip on This Logistics Leader Before Its Next Leg of Compounding Growth Kicks In\n\nMatt DiLallo, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 2:35 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: UPS\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Several headwinds have weighed on shares of UPS over the past few years.\nThe company is working to turn things around.\nIts plan is already starting to deliver improvements.\n10 stocks we like better than United Parcel Service ›\nUPS (NYSE: UPS) has experienced quite a dip in recent years. Shares of the global logistics giant are currently down more than 50% from their peak a few years ago. As a result, its dividend yield has skyrocketed to 6.5%. It has battled a barrage of headwinds, including high labor costs, tariffs, weaker market conditions, and a strategic decision to reduce its reliance on its top customer, Amazon .\nHowever, while shares of UPS are down, the logistics leader appears to be right on the cusp of turning things around. That makes now a great time to buy the dip before a reacceleration begins.\nSlowly changing course UPS has realized that not all volumes are worth the cost. As a result, the company made the strategic decision earlier this year to cut the volumes it ships for Amazon by over 50% by the end of next year. While Amazon contributes around 20% to 25% of its volume, it only supplied about 11% of its revenue last year. Most of the volumes it ships for the top e-commerce company have low profit margins.\n\nAs part of the transformational shift away from Amazon, UPS is undergoing a major restructuring. It aims to cut $3.5 billion in costs by the end of this year by reducing its headcount and closing locations.\nThe company is also investing to grow its more profitable business lines, including healthcare logistics. It closed its $1.6 billion acquisition of Andlauer Healthcare Group in November to enhance its complex healthcare logistics operations.\nThe green shoots of a recovery The slow shift away from Amazon will continue to negatively impact the company's results. Its revenue declined by 3.7% in the third quarter while its adjusted earnings per share fell 1.1%. However, the company is starting to see some underlying progress. Its U.S. revenue per piece grew by 9.8% during the quarter, while its domestic operating margin rose slightly.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the company's other headwinds appear to be slowly fading. Rival FedEx reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal second quarter, despite ongoing trade uncertainty and weak shipping markets. The company also increased its guidance for the fiscal year. It now expects sales to grow 5% to 6% (up from 4% to 6%) and adjusted earnings between $17.80 and $19 per share (increasing the low-end from $17.20 per share). UPS also provided investors with a better-than-expected outlook for the fourth quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, UPS' free cash flow is improving. It generated $2 billion during the third quarter alone, after producing only $742 million during the first half of the year. Free cash flow should continue heading higher as the company executes its cost-reduction strategy (it achieved $2.2 billion of its $3.5 billion target by the end of the third quarter). That's putting the company's high-yielding dividend on a more sustainable foundation.\n\nDelivering high total return potential UPS appears to be turning the corner. Its strategy to reduce its reliance on Amazon is improving its profitability, while some market headwinds seem to be abating. If these trends continue, UPS could deliver robust total returns to investors in the future as its stock price rebounds, and it continues to pay its lucrative dividend.\n\nShould you buy stock in United Parcel Service right now?

      "Content": "3 Supercharged Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Into the 2030s\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:33 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nVRTX\n\nTJX\n\nKey Points Amazon's profitability underscores the success of established and emerging growth sources.\nVertex Pharmaceuticals is launching several new products, and more approvals could be around the corner.\nTJX Companies has proven to be a rare, resilient winner in the retail space.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nGrowth stocks abound in a wide range of sectors, although they tend to fall in and out of favor with investors, depending on the macro and/or market environment. Quality growth stocks can augment your portfolio returns with time and offset the more value-oriented businesses in your basket of buys.\nIf you are looking for top growth stocks to buy and hold well into the 2030s, here are three no-brainer names to consider right now.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) continues to underscore the strength of its business and deliver fantastic growth for long-term shareholders. Over the three-year trailing period alone, the stock has delivered a total return of close to 173% for investors. Pull that time frame back 10 years, and you're looking at a total return of more than 600%.\n\nEven though past performance isn't a promise of future returns, Amazon has proven its ability to thrive in a wide range of macroenvironments and capitalize on new growth waves. Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains Amazon's primary profit engine and currently accounts for approximately 30% of the global cloud infrastructure market.\nThat said, advertising is Amazon's fastest-growing segment, with annualized revenue for the segment set to exceed $60 billion in 2025. By leveraging its unique first-party data and expanding into upper-funnel ads via Prime Video and streaming partnerships, Amazon's ad business could easily approach $100 billion annually within a few years.\nAmazon is investing heavily in AI across its entire ecosystem, and its planned capital expenditures are projected at $125 billion in 2025. Amazon's growing AI ecosystem includes its custom silicon chips, Trainium for AI model training, and Inferentia for running models. These chips aim to provide high performance at a lower cost compared to competitors like Nvidia and are used to power internal services such as the Rufus shopping assistant.\n\nTo sustain its e-commerce moat, Amazon has deployed over 1 million robots in its warehouses, and management projects this will save up to $4 billion annually in fulfillment costs. These efficiencies, alongside a shift to regionalized warehouse models, are expected to significantly lift operating margins for the retail segment by 2030.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's third-quarter revenue totaled $180.2 billion, up 13% year over year. AWS segment sales were up 20% from one year ago. The company's operating income came to $17.4 billion, which was flat year over year but included $2.5 billion for a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settlement and $1.8 billion in severance, without which it would have been $21.7 billion. Net income rose 38% compared to Q3 2024, to $21.2 billion. Amazon continues to look like a compelling buy.\n\n2. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) boasts a trailing-10-year return in the ballpark of 90%, thanks to its robust cystic fibrosis (CF) drug franchise and growing foothold on the lucrative rare disease drug market. Vertex holds a near-monopoly in the market for drugs that treat the underlying cause of CF, and its key product patents extend into the late 2030s, so it can rely on a stable and highly profitable financial foundation.\n\nThe company is actively diversifying its portfolio with several high-potential programs in late-stage clinical development that target large, underserved markets, including kidney disease, pain management, and type 1 diabetes. Vertex has a solid balance sheet with low debt, habitually high profit margins (over 30%), and substantial free cash flow, which gives it the flexibility to fund research and development (R&D) and pursue strategic acquisitions. The company ended Q3 2025 with about $12 billion in cash and investments on hand.\nVertex continues to actively launch Casgevy, the first-ever gene-editing therapy (which it developed with CRISPR Therapeutics ) and a functional cure for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics are expanding access to Casgevy through authorized treatment centers and securing reimbursement agreements in multiple countries. The therapy is approved in the U.S., the E.U., and the U.K. for eligible patients 12 years and older.\n\nAnother ongoing major launch is for Journavx, a non-opioid medicine for moderate-to-severe acute pain. Over 300,000 prescriptions have been written for the drug as of mid-October 2025, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just approved the drug for use in the U.S. in January.\nThe company is also advancing its candidates inaxaplin (for APOL1-mediated kidney disease) and povetacicept (for IgA nephropathy). Both treatments are in late-stage clinical development for their respective conditions. Vertex completed enrollment in the interim analysis cohort of the AMPLITUDE global phase 2/3 trial for inaxaplin in September 2025. The pre-planned interim analysis is expected once this cohort has been treated for 48 weeks. If the results are positive, this analysis could serve as the basis for seeking accelerated approval in the U.S.\n\nThe FDA already granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for povetacicept in IgA nephropathy. Vertex is on track to file for accelerated approval in the U.S. in the first half of 2026 if the 36-week interim analysis data is positive. Another key candidate to watch in late-stage trials is zimislecel, a potential one-time functional cure for type 1 diabetes using stem cell-derived islet cells. The phase 3 trial continues to enroll and dose patients, and the goal is to file for approval after one year of insulin-free follow-up.\nSo, there could be several new regulatory filings and approvals on the horizon for Vertex in 2026 and 2027. Vertex reported revenue that surpassed $3 billion in Q3 2025, up 11% from the year-ago quarter. It also generated net income of $1.1 billion in the quarter. If you want to invest in a growth-oriented healthcare stock with a tremendous runway still ahead, this looks like a business well worth buying. Its strategy of serial innovation and diversification beyond CF looks poised to drive significant revenue and earnings growth into the 2030s and beyond.\n\n3. TJX Companies TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX) has experienced a run-up of almost 150% over the last five years and has outpaced the growth of many of its fellow retailers thanks to its innovative, effective business model. TJX's off-price model, which involves opportunistically sourcing brand-name merchandise at a significant discount and creating a treasure hunt experience for shoppers, has proven resilient across various economic cycles and competitive threats, including the rise of e-commerce.\n\nManagement is targeting a long-term footprint of 7,000 stores globally, up from over 5,191 at the end of fiscal Q3 2026. So, there's a significant runway for physical growth in existing markets as well as new target markets. Unlike traditional retailers with seasonal stock, TJX stores receive new shipments several times a week to create an ever-changing inventory. This encourages frequent repeat visits from shoppers who enjoy finding hidden gems.\nThe unpredictability of the assortment creates a sense of adventure and reward, and because items are often unique and sell quickly, shoppers are incentivized to complete their purchases. Many TJX brands have a limited presence or no online presence at all, which also drives consumers to shop in person at their various brick-and-mortar establishments. TJX attracts a wide range of consumers across all income levels. In the current economic climate of 2025, TJX is thriving as cost-conscious consumers shift away from full-price department stores toward off-price options.\n\nIts stores tend to lack fixed walls between departments, which allows managers to quickly expand or contract categories based on current trends or local consumer demand. With over 21,000 global vendors, TJX's massive buying power ensures it is a preferred partner for brands looking to clear inventory discreetly and keep shelves stocked with desirable labels.\nTJX Companies performed well in the third quarter of its fiscal year 2026, beating Wall Street's expectations for both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue. The company reported EPS of $1.28 on $15.1 billion in revenue, 12% and 7% increases year over year, respectively. The company also returned $1.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends.\n\nTJX Companies pays a dividend that yields around 1% based on current share prices and has raised its dividend every year for almost three decades and counting. This looks like a top retail growth stock to buy and hold for the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "The Only Battle-Tested Retail Stock I Flat-Out Refuse to Sell\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:13 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: WMT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Consumers gravitate towards Walmart when they're looking to save money.\nShares of the retailing behemoth tend to overperform the market during recessions.\nAmazon is the e-commerce king, but it can't compete with Walmart's physical presence.\n10 stocks we like better than Walmart ›\nI don't generally buy stocks with the intention of selling them within a short period. However, there are situations -- whether business-specific, industry-related, or economy-related -- that cause me to finally cut ties with a stock.\nOn the other hand, there are a few stocks in my portfolio that I refuse to cut ties with, regardless of the environment. One of those is retail giant Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) . Walmart is a staple in the business and investing world and is a stock that has been battle-tested and stood the test of time.\nWalmart provides what people always seek There is no truly recession-proof stock in the sense of being completely immune to the negative effects of a recession. However, if we're referring to a company that historically overperforms during a market downturn, Walmart checks the box. And it all comes back to the company's core DNA: Selling everyday items at low prices.\n\nThe retail giant has done a great job of expanding its business with its annual membership, growing advertising business, and e-commerce presence, but when it's all said and done, Walmart's bread and butter will likely always be its brick-and-mortar presence throughout the country.\nWalmart sells products that consumers buy regardless of economic conditions, and during periods of higher inflation, it's generally the go-to for consumers seeking discounts they likely won't find at retailers focused on more premium brands and experiences. It's true that Amazon also offers lower prices than most retailers, but Walmart stands out because of physical convenience -- especially in more rural areas.\nThriving through some rough economic times Below is how Walmart's stock has performed since January 1990, with the grey vertical bars representing U.S. recessions (as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research):\nFor perspective, here's a quick rundown of Walmart's performance compared to the S&P 500 during some notable recessions:\nFrom the beginning of March 2001 to the end of November 2001 (the dot-com bubble bust), Walmart's stock rose about 14%, while the S&P 500 declined about 8%.\nFrom the beginning of October 2007 to the end of March 2009 (the Great Recession), Walmart rose about 8%, while the S&P 500 declined about 36%.\nFrom the beginning of February 2020 to the end of March 2020 (the COVID-19 crash), Walmart declined by less than 1%, while the S&P 500 declined about 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nPast results don't guarantee future performance, but Walmart has consistently proven it can thrive through tough economic and stock market conditions. It will experience volatility like any other stock, but it remains a reliable long-term anchor.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now? Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "3 Must-Know Facts About Costco Before You Buy the Stock\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: COST\n\nWMT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Costco doesn’t try to maximize revenue from merchandise sales, instead leaning on its membership model.\nThe company’s massive sales base, coupled with a limited SKU count, gives it a tremendous cost advantage.\nThe stock still trades at an expensive valuation, but the market might never offer Costco at a bargain.\n10 stocks we like better than Costco Wholesale ›\n\nCostco (NASDAQ: COST) is a massive business. In fiscal 2025 (ended Aug. 31), it registered $270 billion in net sales. This huge sum makes it the world's third-biggest retailer, behind only Walmart and Amazon .\nCostco shares have historically performed very well. Over the past decade, for example, they're up 429% (as of Dec. 23), providing a nice boost to investor portfolios. The retail stock is down 7% in 2025, though.\nBefore you hit the buy button, here are three must-know facts about Costco.\n1. Costco's memberships are its money maker Through its 921 warehouse clubs, Costco sells merchandise ranging from groceries and apparel to electronics and home goods. But making lots of money on merchandise sales isn't Costco's key focus. The gross margin was just 11.3% in Q1 2026 (ended Nov. 23), which reveals that management implements low mark-ups on its inventory. Retail peers typically have much higher mark-ups on their goods.\n\nInstead, Costco runs a thriving membership model. Consumers must pay an annual fee to enter a warehouse and shop for items. Costco's membership count grew 5.2% year over year to 81.4 million in the last quarter, helping increase membership income to $1.3 billion. The worldwide renewal rate usually hovers around 90%, showcasing strong loyalty.\nMemberships introduce a high-margin and recurring revenue stream. And they have proven pricing power. They also drive customers to visit stores more frequently, so they feel that the annual fee is worth it. This might explain why Costco has a stellar track record of posting same-store sales growth.\n2. Having a massive scale helps tremendously Great businesses are those that have economic moats, a term popularized by Warren Buffett. Costco excels in this area. Its moat is supported by a powerful cost advantage . Credit directly goes to the company's incredible scale, as demonstrated by the previously mentioned fiscal 2025 net sales of $270 billion.\n\nThe average Costco club has about 4,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs). This is a significantly smaller number than the 30,000 SKUs a normal supermarket might carry. As a result of a narrow product focus, Costco buys large quantities of a limited number of goods. This gives it immense buying powerful and negotiating leverage over its supplier base, leading to low costs and everyday savings for shoppers. This cost advantage only improves over time, as greater sales support more supplier leverage that leads to ongoing savings. It's a positive feedback loop .\n\nStory Continues\n3. Even after a stock dip, the shares are expensive Since hitting a peak in February 2025, shares have fallen 21%. That drop has occurred despite Costco putting up solid financial results that don't indicate at all that it's losing its competitive edge. Investors might be interested in buying the dip.\nThe valuation still doesn't look like a bargain, though. Investors can purchase the stock if they are willing to pay a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45.7. This is an 81% premium to the S&P 500 index. Value investors might not be comfortable with this setup, as it evidently provides no margin of safety .\n\nThere's an optimistic view that investors can adopt as well. Perhaps the market will always give Costco a higher valuation because it's a durable, predictable, and stable business. This seems to have always been the case, as the financials are robust. Net income soared 241% between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2025. Costco continues to open about 25 new stores each year, too.\nIt's impossible to accurately assess market sentiment to figure out what the right valuation should be. But I believe there is some merit to the argument that Costco shares will never trade at an optically cheap P/E multiple.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?

      "Content": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy and Hold for at Least a Decade\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:35 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNFLX\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Amazon's AI solutions are getting a lot of attention, but its advertising business is another key tailwind in addition to e-commerce.\nNetflix is getting a lot of coverage for a potential acquisition, but its flagship businesses are sticky on their own.\nNvidia is arguably one of the most popular AI stocks, and for good reason.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCompanies usually perform a stock split when their stock price has risen due to strong performance and management is optimistic about continued growth. The announcement of a split can be interpreted as a bullish signal by company insiders, which may attract more investor interest. Plenty of stocks have initiated splits over the last few years, but not all of these companies are created equal.\nOn that note, here are three stock-split stocks to buy and hold for at least a decade if you have investment capital to put to work right now.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has split its stock four times, with the most recent being a 20-for-1 split in June 2022 following earlier splits in June 1998, January 1999, and September 1999. The 2022 split was a significant event, as it was the first in over two decades. Since that recent split, shares have soared by around 170%.\n\nAmazon Web Services ( AWS ) is the world's leading global cloud infrastructure provider and the key catalyst behind Amazon's exceptional operating profits. The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) presents a significant tailwind for AWS, as companies require massive computing power and infrastructure to support AI applications. Amazon's heavy investment in custom AI chips (like Trainium and Inferentia) positions it to offer cost-effective solutions and maintain its market leadership in the AI era.\nAmazon's advertising business has emerged as a major profit driver, growing faster than its e-commerce business and operating at high margins. By owning the point of sale and leveraging vast amounts of first-party customer data, Amazon provides highly effective, intent-driven advertising opportunities that are a major draw for sellers and brands.\n\nWhile the e-commerce segment's growth rate is maturing, it still has an unrivaled scale and a strong competitive moat built on its vast logistics network, wide selection, and low prices. The company's investments in automation and robotics are expected to further boost efficiency and expand profit margins in the coming years.\nThe Prime membership program, with over 240 million members worldwide, creates strong customer loyalty and a powerful network effect. Its integrated benefits, including fast shipping, streaming business (Prime), and healthcare (Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical), encourage members to spend more within Amazon's ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nIn Q3, net sales grew 13% year over year to $180.2 billion. Amazon reported operating income of $17.4 billion, and AWS delivered accelerated growth to 20% (totaling $33 billion), thanks to its dominance in supporting AI workloads. The advertising segment's revenue rose 22% to $17.7 billion. Amazon still looks like a compelling buy to hold on to for many years to come.\n\n2. Netflix Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has split its stock multiple times, with three significant stock splits in its history: a 2-for-1 split in 2004, a 7-for-1 split in 2015, and most recently, a 10-for-1 split in November 2025. That most recent split took effect Nov. 17.\nWhile subscriptions remain core to its revenue and profitability model, Netflix is successfully expanding into new, high-growth areas. The ad-supported tier is growing rapidly and is on track to double its revenue in 2025. The company is also venturing into gaming, live sports events, and merchandising, all of which could create multiple avenues for future growth.\n\nNetflix has shifted its focus from pure subscriber growth to profitable expansion, which has effectively to expanded its operating margins and achieved significant free cash flow generation. In Q3 2025, Netflix's revenue was $11.5 billion (up 17% year over year), but its operating margin was 28%, while its free cash flow surged to $2.7 billion. Netflix also expects to report free cash flow of approximately $9 billion in 2025 on the whole.\nNetflix has established itself as the preeminent global streaming service. While the U.S. and Canadian markets are nearing saturation, there remains significant room for subscriber growth in international markets, such as Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The company's strategy of producing high-quality, localized original content that resonates globally (e.g., Squid Game , Stranger Things ) helps drive retention and attract new subscribers.\n\nNetflix has also demonstrated robust pricing power, increasing subscription costs without experiencing significant subscriber losses. The brand name is synonymous with streaming, and its vast library of content, combined with data on viewer habits, creates a strong competitive advantage that is difficult for rivals to match.\nProposed acquisitions, such as the potential purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery studios (though it certainly faces regulatory hurdles), could further solidify its content library and market dominance. Now looks like a great time to scoop up some shares of Netflix.\n3. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has split its stock six times, with the most recent split being a 10-for-1 split enacted on June 10, 2024. Before that, Nvidia executed a 4-for-1 split in 2021. Since the 2024 split, Nvidia shares have increased by about 55%.\nNvidia's strong position as the foundational technology provider for the AI revolution, combined with its robust financial performance and competitive moat, has driven the company to new heights of financial growth. Its most recent results for its 2026 third quarter (ending October 2025), included record revenue of $57 billion (up 62% from a year ago) and EPS of $1.30, thanks to booming data center and Blackwell GPU sales. Its data center division delivered $51.2 billion in revenue, up 66% from one year ago.\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 80% to 90% market share in the data center AI chip market, and its GPUs are considered the gold standard for AI training and inference. The company's key competitive advantage lies in its proprietary CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software platform, which has become the de facto standard for GPU-accelerated computing.\nMajor AI frameworks are optimized for CUDA, and the platform boasts an ecosystem of millions of developers globally who rely on CUDA to build and accelerate their applications. This large community creates a powerful network effect, offering extensive support, shared code, and third-party tools that competitors struggle to match.\nThe deep integration of CUDA into existing workflows and institutional knowledge creates prohibitively high switching costs for developers and organizations. Nvidia continuously optimizes the CUDA software stack for its latest GPU architectures, which ensures top-tier performance that often outpaces hardware-only competitors.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's next-generation chips (Blackwell and Rubin architectures) remains exceptionally high, with an order backlog of $500 billion through the end of 2026. Beyond data centers, Nvidia is expanding into robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial digital twins, which positions the business to tap into new, multitrillion-dollar market opportunities. That's a value proposition many long-term investors won't want to miss out on.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "2 Unstoppable AI Stocks That Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway Own\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Amazon is set for a comeback in 2026, helped by its cloud computing segment.\nAlphabet answered a ton of questions about the future of its business in 2025.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAlthough Warren Buffett is on his way out as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , studying his stock picks is a smart move for investors. He's known to be a value investor and only picks stocks that he understands, so when artificial intelligence (AI) companies show up in Berkshire Hathaway'w portfolio, investors would be wise to pay attention.\nTwo AI stocks Berkshire owns that I'm excited about are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Both of these stocks look primed to soar higher in 2026, and I think they make for excellent investments right now.\nBuffett may not have bought these stocks Although Buffett has been the primary money manager at Berkshire Hathaway, there are others who also have management over some funds. Todd Combs (who now works for JPMorgan ) and Ted Weschler ran a portion of the Berkshire portfolio and were known to invest in more tech-centric stocks than Buffett did. So, it's possible that the Amazon and Alphabet purchases were made under their direction.\n\nAlphabet is Berkshire's most recent purchase, and accounts for about 1.7% of its total portfolio. Amazon is a far older holding, and Berkshire has owned shares since 2019, although it only makes up 0.7% of its portfolio. With the size of the positions in Berkshire's investment portfolio, Buffett likely gave them the thumbs up to purchase these shares. So even if they weren't originally his purchase, he has still hung on to them.\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet look like great investments right now, so I'd be surprised if Berkshire were looking to pivot away from them.\nAlphabet and Amazon look primed to soar in 2026 Alphabet has had a great 2025, while Amazon's has been lackluster. Alphabet's stock is up around 60%, while Amazon's is nearly flat, rising only 3%.\nAlphabet's stellar performance comes after many doubted it could be successful in the artificial intelligence realm at the start of the year. There were concerns about Alphabet being broken up for a monopoly, falling behind in generative AI technology, and its cash cow, Google Search, being replaced by generative AI. However, none of those investment theses panned out in 2025, which is why the stock soared.\nThese same points that allowed it to soar in 2025 shoould continue in 2026, allowing Alphabet to continue down its path of dominance next year. With Alphabet leading the way in generative AI after trailing for so long, it opens up new revenue streams that could trickle in.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, it's potentially selling its custom AI chip, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), as an alternative to graphics processing units (GPUs) on the open market for the first time. So 2026 could be a monster year for Alphabet, and owning shares like Berkshire is a smart move.\nAmazon's lackluster 2025 isn't on account of its business. Amazon has grown quickly for its size, with revenue rising 13% in the third quarter. The highlight of its sprawling business is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing unit. AWS is a critical part of Amazon, as it accounts for 66% of operating income despite making up just 18% of revenue.\n\nFurthermore, AWS just posted its fastest growth quarter in multiple years, which should have gotten the market excited about its prospects. However, the market mostly ignored Amazon in 2025, setting it up for success in 2026.\nI think Amazon could easily be the comeback stock of the year in 2026, and its dominance in the cloud computing realm, as well as its content strength in the commerce business, support that prospect. Buffett may be on his way out at Berkshire Hathaway, but his investment picks remain. With Alphabet and Amazon still being fairly large holdings, it's another vote of confidence for these two stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Ahead of 2026, According to Wall Street Analysts (Hint: Not Palantir)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Morningstar analysts recently ranked Nvidia and Microsoft as the two best artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now.\nBrian Colello at Morningstar says Nvidia has an economic moat due to its leadership in GPUs, networking, and software tools needed for artificial intelligence.\nDan Romanoff at Morningstar says Microsoft’s cloud computing unit has emerged as a leader in artificial intelligence due to investments in OpenAI.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nPalantir Technologies has been one of the best-performing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in recent years. Shares have advanced 1,000% since January 2024, but many analysts worry about its valuation. That may explain why Palantir did not appear on Morningstar 's recent list detailing the best AI stocks to buy now.\nInstead, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) took the top two spots, followed by Amazon , Broadcom , and Meta Platforms . But optimism concerning Nvidia and Microsoft is not limited to Morningstar. Most Wall Street analysts believe the stocks are undervalued.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $190.\nAmong 63 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 29% upside from its current share price of $488.\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft.\n1. Nvidia Morningstar analyst Brian Colello writes:\nTo summarize, Nvidia has an important competitive advantage in its full-stack strategy. The company is best known for its GPUs, chips that accelerate demanding data center workloads like AI training and AI inference. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it pairs best-in-class GPUs with CPUs, high-speed interconnects, and networking platforms, such that the company essentially builds entire data centers.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has spent the better part of two decades creating its CUDA software platform, which comprises an unparalleled number of code libraries, pretrained models, and application frameworks that assist developers. While custom AI chips developed by Broadcom may be cheaper, the total cost of ownership is often higher because they lack pre-built software tools.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia has over 90% market share in data center GPUs, a market where sales are projected to grow at 36% annually through 2033, and the company is likely to maintain its dominant position due to its full-stack strategy. Wall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 48% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2028. That makes the current valuation of 47 times earnings look cheap.\n\n2. Microsoft Microsoft is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for Microsoft 365 (a suite that includes office applications like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word), the company also has a strong position in other software verticals, including business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning.\n\nMicrosoft has added generative AI copilots to several software products and monthly active users surpassed 150 million in the September quarter, up from 100 million in the June quarter. And CEO Satya Nadella told analysts, \"Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot faster than any other Microsoft 365 suite. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.\"\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services sales. \"Azure has several distinct advantages, including that it offers customers a painless way to experiment and move select workloads to the cloud,\" according to Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff. \"Based on its investment in OpenAI, the company has also emerged as a leader in AI.\"\n\nMicrosoft owns a 27% equity stake in OpenAI and it has exclusive rights to the AI start-up's most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 and GPT-5). Also, The Information reports that OpenAI shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft under the agreement. Those payments will top $1 billion this year, up from about $500 million last year, according to TechCrunch.\nWall Street estimates Microsoft's adjusted earnings will increase at 16% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look somewhat expensive. But Microsoft topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 8% during the last four quarters, which makes the current valuation look more reasonable. Nvidia is still the more attractive option, but I think patient investors should consider buying a small position in both stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Watch: DebitMyData Human Energy Grid .\nThe Crisis: Billions Spent, Projects Stalled\nSince 2022, the world’s largest AI companies have pledged more than $200 billion to build data centers powering generative intelligence. Yet projects remain paralyzed across multiple jurisdictions — halted by community opposition, regulatory confusion, and growing fears that “AI progress” benefits only corporations, not citizens.\n\nDebitMyData’s solution reframes the equation.\nBy valuing human participation in data exchange, energy contribution, and consent verification, the Human Energy Grid introduces an economic model where infrastructure growth yields tangible local and individual benefits — aligning corporate expansion with community trust.\n“Before the Genesis Order, we already understood the next frontier,” said Preska Thomas,, Founder and CEO of DebitMyData, Inc. “The challenge isn’t building more compute — it’s building more trust. Without societal consent and economic inclusion, the AI revolution can’t scale sustainably.”\nPhase One: Building the Workforce Trust Layer\nDebitMyData.com serves as the activation point. Through it, the company is organizing and credentialing a next-generation digital workforce — those displaced or at risk from AI automation — into the coming grid economy.\n\nParticipants gain:\nVerified Digital Identities (DID): Anchored in secure, LLM-backed protocols enabling individuals to control, monetize, and consent to their data usage.

This isn’t just technology—it’s economic realignment.”\nThe Path Forward\nDebitMyData is not waiting for AI to displace millions before responding. It is architecting the response mechanism itself: a data economy that rewards human contribution as much as computational horsepower.\nFor workers,it’s a new revenue channel and pathway back into participation.\nFor governments,it’s a verifiable consent framework.\nFor investors, it’s the foundation of the world’s most scalable ethical infrastructure.\nFor hyperscalers, it’s the bridge from resistance to readiness.\n\nAbout DebitMyData, Inc.\nDebitMyData, Inc. is a U.S.-based technology company building the intersection of AI, energy, and human participation.

      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 10:50 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: WMT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nLLY\n\nABBV\n\nKey Points Amazon and Alphabet are key leaders in the AI race on top of their flagship businesses.\nWalmart benefits from consistent non-discretionary spending like groceries.\nEli Lilly and AbbVie are major pharmaceutical players that have impressive portfolios.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAttempting to time the market by identifying the exact bottom of a dip is very difficult, even for experienced investors. What appears to be a dip can turn into a prolonged decline or a falling knife, and you could just as easily miss out on the best market days to invest as you could the worst.\n\nInstead, by focusing your attention on making quality investments and additions to your portfolio in all market environments, you can withstand the highs and lows of market whims while enriching your portfolio over time.\nIf you have $50,000 to invest right now, you could choose to diversify that capital across a handful of different businesses. Here are five names that you might want to include on that list.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is known for its leading cloud infrastructure business and flagship e-commerce platform, but also boasts an ever-expanding presence across various sectors, including digital entertainment, groceries, advertising, and autonomous vehicles. Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) isn't just the most profitable segment for the company -- it's also the dominant player in the competitive cloud computing market and controls about 30% of this lucrative space.\n\nThe company remains the leading online retailer in the United States, with a market share of around 40%. Amazon is heavily investing in AI across its operations, from logistics optimization to developing custom AI chips like Trainium and Inferentia to offer clients a less expensive alternative to Nvidia GPUs . These innovations are designed to improve efficiency and attract new customers to AWS.\nOpenAI has signed a landmark, multi-year deal to use AWS's infrastructure for running its AI workloads, including the training of future models. Until recently, Microsoft was OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider. The deal is a significant win for Amazon, as it reassures investors that AWS can compete effectively with other dominant players in providing AI infrastructure.\n\nThe deal involves a massive commitment of computing resources, and Amazon plans to build dedicated data center capacity for OpenAI. It's also reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion or more in OpenAI. The investment would likely involve OpenAI using Amazon's custom-designed AI chips for some workloads to compete with Nvidia's dominant chips.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon remains extremely financially sound thanks to its strong balance sheet, consistent profitability, and expanding margins. Despite its status as a growth stock, the stock looks reasonably valued at approximately 27 times forward earnings.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has integrated AI seamlessly into its core products and created new tailwinds of growth for the business that long-term investors can capitalize on. The Gemini app alone has over 650 million monthly active users. There have been rumors that the company plans to monetize this user base through various forms of advertising, an area where Alphabet has long remained an indomitable leader.\n\nHowever, Google's Vice President of Global Ads, Daniel Taylor, and the official Google Ad Liaison account have publicly stated otherwise, so that remains unlikely, at least for now. The company is still actively monetizing AI in other areas, including AI Overviews in Google Search, and testing ads in AI Mode within Search. Meanwhile, the core Google Search business, along with YouTube, continues to drive profitable growth for the Alphabet ecosystem.\nGoogle Search & Other revenue reached $56.57 billion in Q3, a 15% year-over-year increase. YouTube advertising revenue surpassed the $10 billion mark for the first time in the third quarter (a 15% increase year over year). The Google Services segment, which includes Search and YouTube, also reported operating income of $33.53 billion (up about 9% from a year ago), despite absorbing a $3.5 billion European Commission fine during the quarter. And, consolidated revenue for Alphabet rose 16% to $102.35 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3 2025, and this segment's operating income increased by an eye-popping 85% in the same quarter. Alphabet's backlog of future cloud deals increased 79% in Q3. Alphabet also has potential future growth engines beyond its core businesses, including Waymo and advancements in quantum computing.\nDespite the stock's strong performance in 2025 (up over 60%), it trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 30. Alphabet also retains approximately $98.5 billion in cash against $22 billion in long-term debt. This stock continues to look like a no-brainer buy.\n3. Walmart Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) is the world's largest retailer by sales. Its massive scale allows it to offer lower prices and negotiate better terms with suppliers, a significant advantage that helps it attract cost-conscious shoppers, including in inflationary periods.\nWalmart has effectively integrated its vast network of thousands of stores into its e-commerce operations and uses them as fulfillment hubs to offer fast delivery and easy in-store pickup options. This strategy has driven robust e-commerce growth (e-commerce sales were up 27% globally in Q3 FY26).\n\nThe company continues to expand into higher-margin areas like advertising and its membership program, which are contributing a meaningful share of operating income and bolstering overall profitability. Walmart also continues to invest in technology, automation, and AI-driven systems to improve its supply chain efficiency, inventory management, and customer experience, which could position it for long-term success against major retail competitors.\nIn Walmart's Q3, the company generated total revenue of $179.5 billion, up about 6% year over year. Its global advertising business clocked growth of 53%, bolstered by the integration of VIZIO and strong performance from Walmart Connect, while membership income increased 16.7% thanks to double-digit growth in Walmart+ and Sam's Club China memberships.\n\nHouseholds earning more than $100,000 accounted for 75% of Walmart's market share gains during the quarter. Approximately 35% of store-fulfilled orders in the U.S. were delivered in under three hours, with expedited delivery sales growing nearly 70%.\nWalmart is also a Dividend King, having raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years. This history of reliable payouts could appeal to income-focused, long-term investors and underscores its cash flow durability. Its current yield is in the ballpark of 0.8%, a bit below the average S&P 500 stock. While Walmart's trading higher than historical averages (about 38 times forward earnings), this stalwart consumer staples stock could be a smart addition to a long-term investor's portfolio.\n\n4. Eli Lilly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) leads the market for GLP-1 medications and has officially surpassed its rival Novo Nordisk . The market for these drugs is projected to reach over $100 billion by 2030, so there's a considerable long-term growth opportunity for the company to continue to capitalize on.\nIts dual-acting drugs, Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss), have shown superior efficacy compared to competitors in clinical trials, which has fueled a significant increase in Eli Lilly's market share.\n\nThe company has promising late-stage candidates, including the once-daily oral weight-loss pill orforglipron and the triple-agonist injectable retatrutide, which could further expand its market reach and offer more treatment options to patients. Eli Lilly has filed for FDA approval for orforglipron. It's a small molecule, easier to manufacture than peptides, and shows promise for diabetes as well as cardiovascular risk factors.\nRetatrutide replicates the effects of three different natural hormones: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon. By combining the effects of all three hormones, retatrutide is designed to be a highly effective treatment for conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and could serve as a future pillar of Eli Lilly's portfolio.\n\nEli Lilly has consistently beaten analyst expectations, with its third-quarter 2025 revenue soaring 54% year over year to $17.6 billion. The company has invested billions in expanding its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and internationally to meet the explosive demand for its drugs.\nDespite the stock's high P/E ratio of around 34 on a forward basis, the company's strong growth prospects and dominant position in a revolutionary therapeutic area could warrant a long-term investment in this powerhouse healthcare stock. The company has also paid a dividend in some form since the 1800s, and regularly increases its payout. It's increased its dividend by a notable 15% for seven years in a row and counting.\n5. AbbVie AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) is benefiting from the burgeoning sales of its flagship immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which delivered combined revenues of about $7 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone. These drugs are more than making up for the decline in sales of Humira, which was once the top-selling drug in the world, and have patent protection into the 2030s.\n\nThe drugmaker's overall net revenue for the three-month period totaled just shy of $16 billion, up 9% year over year. AbbVie has around 90 programs in its R&D pipeline across various therapeutic areas. Recent acquisitions have added promising new candidates to the mix.\nThese include candidates like Bretisilocin (from Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals) and ISB 2001 (from Ichnos Glenmark Innovation), and signal AbbVie's push into novel neuroscience and oncology, including psychedelic-inspired therapies and advnced antibody-based cancer drugs. Bretisilocin is a serotonin receptor agonist designed for major depressive disorder (MDD), while ISB 2001 is a T-cell engager for multiple myeloma.\nThe company has increased its dividend for 54 consecutive years (including its time as part of Abbott Laboratories ), which makes it another Dividend King on today's list. The current forward dividend yield is an attractive 3.05%.\n\nAbbVie stock trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 16. If you're looking for a quality healthcare stock to buy and hold for the long run, definitely don't overlook AbbVie the next time you go stock shopping.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Analysis-Waymo's San Francisco outage raises doubts over robotaxi readiness during crises\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPCG\n\nTSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - A widespread power outage in San Francisco that led to Waymo robotaxis stalling and snarling traffic earlier this month has raised concerns about the readiness of autonomous vehicle operators to tackle major emergencies like earthquakes and floods.\nDriverless taxis from Alphabet unit ​Waymo, a ubiquitous feature on the city's streets, were stuck at intersections with their hazard lights turned on as traffic lights stopped working following a fire ‌at a PG&E substation that knocked out power to roughly one-third of the city on December 20, videos posted on social media showed. Waymo halted operations, resuming a day later.\n\nThe incident has renewed calls for ‌stricter regulation of the nascent but fast-growing industry as other companies including Tesla and Amazon's Zoox race to expand robotaxi services in several cities.\n\"If you get a response to a blackout wrong, regulators are derelict if they do not respond to that by requiring some sort of proof that the earthquake scenario will be handled properly,\" said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Waymo said that while its robotaxis are designed to handle non-operational traffic signals as four-way stops, they occasionally request a ⁠confirmation check. Though the vehicles successfully traversed more than 7,000 ‌darkened signals on Saturday, \"the outage created a concentrated spike\" in confirmation requests that \"led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets,\" Waymo said.\n\nRobotaxi operators around the globe use remote access by humans - known in the industry as \"teleoperation\" - in varying degrees to monitor and control ‍vehicles. Waymo, for example, has a team of human \"fleet response\" agents who respond to questions from the Waymo Driver, its bot, when it encounters a particular situation.\nBut such remote assistance has its limitations, and the Waymo outage highlights the need to regulate how robotaxi operators use the technology, said Missy Cummings, director of the George Mason University Autonomy and Robotics Center and former adviser to ​the U.S. road safety regulator.\n\"The whole point of having remote operations is for humans to be there when the system is not responsive in the way it should ‌be,\" she said. \"The federal government needs to regulate remote operations,\" Cummings said. \"They need to make sure that there's backup remote operations when there's some kind of catastrophic failure.\"\n\nStory Continues\nCalifornia's Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulate and issue permits for the testing and commercial deployment of robotaxis, have said they are looking into the incident.\nThe DMV said it was talking to Waymo and other autonomous vehicle makers about actions related to emergency response. It also said it was formulating regulations to ensure remote drivers \"meet high standards for safety, accountability and responsiveness.\"\n\n'A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW'\nDeploying and commercializing fully autonomous vehicles have been harder than expected with high investments to ensure the technology is ⁠safe and public outcry after collisions forcing many to shut shop.\nFollowing a high-profile accident in 2023 ​when a robotaxi from General Motors' Cruise dragged a pedestrian, regulators revoked its permit, eventually leading the ​company to cease operations.\nBut robotaxis have returned to the spotlight with Tesla rolling out its service in Austin, Texas earlier this year and CEO Elon Musk promising rapid expansion. Waymo, which has grown slowly and steadily over the years since its launch as Google's self-driving project in ‍2009, has also accelerated expansion.\nWith a fleet of ⁠more than 2,500 vehicles, Waymo operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Metro Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe company said the confirmation processes its vehicles follow were established during early deployment and that it was now refining them to match its current scale. Waymo is implementing fleet-wide updates that provide vehicles with \"specific ⁠power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.\"\nBoth Cummings and Koopman said robotaxi operators should face additional permitting requirements once their fleets grow beyond a certain size to ensure that they have adequate ‌capabilities to deal with large-scale failures.\n\"If this had been an earthquake, it would have been a problem,\" Koopman said. \"This is just a shot across ‌the bow.\"\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Alistair Bell)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 Unbelievable Growth Stocks to Buy Before They Soar in 2026\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 5:06 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI) represent tremendous opportunities for consumers and investors alike.\nIonQ is in its early growth stages, but has recently made some stunning breakthroughs.\nAmazon continues to derive growth from its flagship businesses, and its investments in AI are ushering in a new era of gains.\n10 stocks we like better than IonQ ›\n\nAs investors near the end of 2026 and look ahead to 2026, some use this time to make resolutions about their finances and portfolios. If you have cash to invest in the stock market, money that you don't need for near-term obligations like bills, there are plenty of quality stocks vying for your attention that offer the opportunity to invest.\nWhen investing for the long term, you should be focused on quality businesses that you would feel comfortable buying and holding stock in for at least three to five years, if not longer. If you're looking for top growth stocks to buy that could easily see a run-up in 2026 and well beyond, here are two names to consider.\n1. IonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is a pure-play quantum computing company. If you're not familiar with this one, the company builds quantum computers using a unique trapped-ion technology, which uses individual ions (charged atoms) manipulated by lasers to perform computations. This method offers high accuracy and can operate at room temperature, which distinguishes IonQ from its quantum computing competitors, who often use expensive, cryogenically cooled superconducting systems.\n\nIonQ makes its quantum computers available through third-party cloud platforms, including Amazon 's (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS Amazon Braket, Microsoft 's Azure Quantum, and Alphabet 's Google Cloud. A significant portion of IonQ's resources are dedicated to R&D to improve the performance, accuracy, and scalability of its quantum systems. Through strategic acquisitions, IonQ is expanding into quantum networking, security, and sensing applications as it works to achieve its goal of building a full-stack quantum platform.\nIonQ's revenue streams are centered on making its quantum power accessible and applicable to real-world problems. Its primary revenue source is selling access to its quantum computing power on a per-use or subscription basis through cloud partnerships and its own cloud service. IonQ also earns revenue from selling specialized quantum computing hardware systems to select customers like government labs and research institutions, along with associated maintenance and support services.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company has also secured contracts with various entities (e.g., the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and AstraZeneca ) for research collaborations, technology development partnerships, and consulting services to co-develop algorithms for specific applications like materials science or drug discovery.\n\nIonQ exceeded its revenue guidance in Q3 2025, driven partly by recent strategic acquisitions like Oxford Ionics and Capella Space, and delivered $39.9 million on the top line. That was a 222% increase year over year. Despite operating at a loss, IonQ ended the quarter with a robust cash and investment position of $1.5 billion.\nPerhaps the most standout development from the quarter was the fact that IonQ achieved an Algorithmic Qubit score of #AQ 64 on its fifth-generation IonQ Tempo system, three months ahead of its original year-end schedule. #AQ is a benchmark that measures a quantum computer's ability to run practical algorithms. Reaching #AQ 64 means the system can simultaneously evaluate over 18 quintillion possibilities.\nBut what does this mean for practical, real-world applications? Well, for one thing, achieving #AQ 64 means IonQ's quantum computers can tackle problems classical supercomputers can't. This includes real-world improvements in areas like drug development and discovery, financial modeling, logistics/supply chain optimization, and so much more.\n\nQuantum computing is a disruptive technology that could unlock trillions in economic value. This is a market expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 30% or more through 2035. IonQ's recent breakthrough in quantum networking could also expand its long-term addressable market. For risk-tolerant investors, this growth stock could be a compelling buy for the next decade and beyond.\n2. Amazon Amazon remains a powerhouse in e-commerce, cloud computing, and other core growth areas that continue to make this business a compelling business to buy and hold. The company's total revenue for 2024 was over $638 billion, and its net income nearly doubled from $30.4 billion in 2023 to $59.2 billion in 2024. The company is aggressively investing in infrastructure, especially for artificial intelligence applications, and Amazon plans to double its data center power capacity by 2027.\n\nAWS is the company's most profitable business and a primary driver of overall growth. AWS revenue in Q3 2025 grew 20% year over year to $33 billion, and delivered an annualized run rate of $132 billion. Strong demand for AI-related services is a key growth catalyst that's leading to a substantial infrastructure backlog.\nAdvertising services is emerging as a high-margin, fast-growing segment for Amazon, as advertising generated almost $18 billion in revenue in the third quarter alone, a 22% increase from the prior year. The introduction of ads on Prime Video and expansion into connected TV present significant future opportunities for Amazon to grow its foothold in the lucrative advertising space.\nOf course, there's still the core online retail business that continues to demonstrate solid revenue growth. In Q3 2025, revenue from online stores totaled about $67.4 billion, and third-party seller services brought in $42.5 billion. Those two segments realized growth of 8% and 11%, respectively, from the year-ago period.\n\nThe Prime subscription service bundles fast shipping and digital content, and creates a powerful customer loyalty network that reinforces Amazon's entire retail ecosystem, as well as its entertainment segment.\nAdditionally, Amazon is integrating AI across virtually every facet of its business, from physical warehouse robots to the digital shopping experience, as management aims to capitalize on operational efficiency and high-margin service growth.\nFor example, Amazon's generative AI-powered shopping assistant Rufus is fully integrated into the mobile e-commerce app and allows customers to discover products through natural language conversations. Amazon is using AI to customize search results, product descriptions, and even web store sessions for individual shoppers based on their intent and behavior. Increasingly effective agentic capabilities allow its fulfillment center robots like Proteus and Vulcan to understand natural language commands and act autonomously to handle complex tasks.\n\nAmazon is developing its own AI chips, Trainium3 and Inferentia, to lower costs for training and deploying AI models compared to traditional GPUs. And AWS's Amazon Bedrock service allows businesses to build their own AI applications using a choice of foundational models, including Amazon's new Nova family.\nBear in mind that we're still in the relatively early stages of the growth potential that AI is expected to unleash, and Amazon stands to be a direct beneficiary of that trajectory. Long-term investors would do well to start or add to a position in this dynamic growth stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now? Before you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and IonQ wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\n\nMarketBeat Staff\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: EVTL\n\nEVTWF\n\nMU\n\nPLTR\n\nCART\n\nA better-than-expected read for fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) is adding fuel to hopes for a Santa Claus rally. But with thin trading volume, investors won&rsquo;t really know if that rally will take shape until next week.\nEither way, investors continue to climb the wall of worry that includes tariffs, inflation, jobs, and the potential bubble in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Much of this is due to the relative strength of the consumer, which will continue to be something to watch in 2026.\n\nNext week will be another shortened trading week. Markets will be closed on Jan. 1. This is a time for many investors to step away, but the MarketBeat analysts will continue to stay on top of the stocks and stories moving the market. Here are some of our most popular stories from this week.\n&rarr; Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nArticles by Thomas Hughes\nEarnings season is the time when many companies announce share buyback activity. This week, Thomas Hughes highlighted five companies that have some of the most aggressive share buyback programs and why those buybacks may drive stock price growth in 2026.\n&rarr; These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nHow do you know when a dividend stock is a keeper? This week, Hughes highlighted three companies that are raising their dividends within an environment where analyst sentiment continues to be bullish, suggesting capital growth to go along with that dividend growth.\n\nDarden Restaurants Inc. (NYSE: DRI) had a strong earnings report, but DRI stock has pulled back since the report. Hughes explained why investors should view this as a strong buying signal based on strong technical signals as well as bullish sentiment from analysts and institutions.\n&rarr; MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nArticles by Sam Quirke\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been a volatile stock in 2025, but Sam Quirke explained why the stock continues to have a bullish upside. In his latest article, Quirke explained why a recent failed pullback is likely to be the catalyst for the TSLA share price to move above $500.\nQuirke was also examining the recent price action in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). The reminder to investors is that, in periods of consolidation, watch what analysts are signaling, which in this case suggests bullish upside for AMZN stock.\n\nArticles by Chris Markoch\nThe S&P 500 has continued to make new highs. However, investors may want to watch the Russell 2000, which has been outpacing the market and could signal a surge in small-cap stocks. This week, Chris Markoch made a case for five small-cap stocks that could benefit as investors rotate out of big tech.\n\nStory continues\nPalantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) has rallied from a recent sell-off. Markoch gave investors three reasons Palantir will continue to be an essential stock in the AI infrastructure trade.\nIt&rsquo;s been a brutal year for beer stocks. However, a recent report from Goldman Sachs suggests that 2026 may be a time for beer to make a comeback. If that&rsquo;s true, Markoch analyzed two brewers that could give investors a buzz in 2026.\n\nArticles by Ryan Hasson\nRyan Hasson also looked at small-cap stocks this week by pointing investors to MarketBeat&rsquo;s list of the highest-rated small-cap stocks. Hasson highlighted the top five names on the list and explained the case for future growth.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the best-performing technology stocks of 2025. So, is the recent pullback a healthy pause or the first sign of a correction? Hasson argued for the buy-the-dip story based on technical signals and institutional conviction.\nArticles by Leo Miller\nMarkets are expected to remain volatile in 2026. That's why buying stocks of dividend growers could be a smart strategy. This week, Leo Miller highlighted three companies that have aggressively raised their dividends and why each offers investors a reason to believe in capital growth that drives a higher total return.\n\nOn Dec. 22, three companies began trading as part of the S&P 500 Index. This stamp of approval generally gives stocks a short-term pop, but Miller explained why each company may give investors reasons for a solid growth story in 2026.\nSpace stocks have been strong performers in 2025, but three of these names have had strong insider selling in the last 30 days. Miller reminded investors that not all insider selling is equal, and that only one company may be sending a concerning signal.\nArticles by Nathan Reiff\nQuantum computing stocks have given off a &ldquo;hurry up and wait&rdquo; vibe in 2025. That can frustrate traders, but it may give risk-tolerant investors an opportunity to accumulate shares on every pullback. This week, Nathan Reiff provided investors with several reasons to believe that D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) could be setting up investors for a strong 2026.\n\nPrecious metals have been one of the strongest trades in 2025, and that strength is spreading to mining stocks. This may be a case where bigger is better, and Reiff highlighted three large miners with attractive setups for 2026.\nThe oil sector has been on the opposite side of the commodities trade. However, Reiff noted that the weakness in oil may create an opportunity for contrarian, risk-tolerant investors.

That may have some investors thinking about buying the dip in some Bitcoin stocks. Dan Schmidt explained why that may be a mistake for two notable crypto-linked stocks that carry risks because of their cryptocurrency exposure.\n\nFor many investors, the end of the year is a time to set goals for the following year. For investors who are resolving to take more profits in 2026, Schmidt offers up three stocks that look ripe for profit-taking as 2025 comes to an end.\nArticles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson\nThe &ldquo;AI bubble&rdquo; doom loop has been getting debunked this earnings season. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) was the latest company to deliver results that showed high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand extending well into the future. Jeffrey Neal Johnson wrote this week that Micron&rsquo;s results also point to a more balanced revenue mix and pricing power that will boost earnings.\nJohnson also pointed investors to a value disconnection with Vertical Aerospace (NYSE: EVTL). The company doesn&rsquo;t get as many headlines as competitors in the emerging eVTOL sector, but Johnson pointed out that the company achieved a significant milestone that could vault it into the lead in 2026.\n\nMany investors are hearing about sector rotation, which raises the question of what smart moves investors should make in 2026. Johnson put a spotlight on two ETFs that provide exposure to sectors likely to be part of a catch-up trade in 2026.\nArticles by Jordan Chussler\nIn many cases, investors are better off ignoring headline noise. Jordan Chussler explained why that appeared to be the case for Maplebear Inc. (NASDAQ: CART), better known as Instacart. The company is the target of investigations into its pricing practices and transparency. However, investors have shrugged off the news and are instead focused on the company&rsquo;s strong financials.\nOil stocks are down, but energy stocks tied to rising electricity prices had a strong year. This week, Chussler highlighted one exchange-traded fund (ETF) that allows investors to capitalize on the historic and multi-year trend of higher electricity prices.\nThe article \" MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Where Will Alibaba Stock Be in 5 Years?\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 2:04 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: BABA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Alibaba's tailwinds include strong generative AI demand and expansion beyond China.\nIts key challenges include increasing competition and regulatory uncertainty in China.\nAlibaba should be able to deliver robust growth over the next five years despite its challenges.\n10 stocks we like better than Alibaba Group ›\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) is often referred to as the \" Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of China.\" The two companies' businesses are similar enough for the nickname to stick.\nOver the last five years, however, Alibaba's stock performance has diverged significantly from that of its American counterpart. While Amazon's share price recovered from the bear market sell-off of 2022 and is now up more than 40% since late 2020, Alibaba's shares have declined by roughly 40%.\nThat's water under the bridge now, though. Where will Alibaba stock be in five years?\nAlibaba's tailwinds You don't have to look hard to spot Alibaba's greatest tailwind. It's artificial intelligence, especially generative AI .\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Alibaba reported that AI-related product revenue soared by a triple-digit percentage year-over-year for the ninth consecutive quarter. Sales for the company's Cloud Intelligence Group unit jumped 34% year-over-year, with CEO Eddie Wu attributing the growth to \"robust AI demand.\"\n\nAlibaba Cloud ranks as the leader in China's AI cloud market with a market share of 35.8%. The company's full-stack approach to AI, providing infrastructure, large language models (LLMs ), and internally developed chips, gives it a solid competitive advantage.\nE-commerce remains a cash cow for Alibaba. The company's Alibaba.com, Tabao, and Tmall platforms are popular in China. Its Quick Commerce business, which provides super-fast delivery of groceries and essential daily products, is gaining momentum.\nAlibaba is also expanding beyond China. Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) operates globally and has achieved particular success in Europe and the Middle East.\nLike Amazon, Alibaba continually looks for new growth opportunities. A key focus for the company is the robotaxi market. Alibaba recently made a strategic investment in Hello's robotaxi business.\nKey challenges Don't think that Alibaba has a cakewalk ahead of it, though. The company faces several significant challenges.\nIncreasing competition perhaps deserves a spot at the top of the list. PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD) , which operates the Pinduoduo and Temu e-commerce platforms, has escalated the price war in China. ByteDance's Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) has disrupted how younger people shop online.\n\nStory Continues\nAlibaba can't buy the most powerful GPUs made by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . This challenge has forced the company to invest more heavily in developing its own chips. It also increases the risk that Alibaba will be left behind in terms of technology.\nBeing based in China comes with a web of issues. Regulatory uncertainty is probably the most worrisome problem. Although the Chinese government is currently supportive of tech companies, the threat of a policy change always hovers over Alibaba like a dark cloud.\n\nAnother factor that Alibaba must manage is the steep cost of building AI data center infrastructure. The company's capital expenditures could squeeze earnings over the next few years.\nA prediction for where Alibaba stock will be in 2030 Will Alibaba's tailwinds be sufficient to overcome its challenges through the end of the decade? I think so.\nDespite intense competition, the company's e-commerce revenue continues to grow robustly. The restrictions on purchasing Nvidia's GPUs could prove to be a net positive for Alibaba over the long term. The Chinese government knows that for China to remain competitive in the AI race, companies like Alibaba must remain strong.\n\nMost importantly, I expect that Alibaba's investments in AI infrastructure spending will yield significant returns. In particular, my hunch is that the adoption of agentic AI will generate tremendous growth for Alibaba Cloud.\nWhere does this leave Alibaba's stock in 2030? I predict that the Chinese internet giant's share price will soar by around 90% over the next five years to roughly $285. Alibaba's future should be brighter than its past.\nShould you buy stock in Alibaba Group right now?

      "Content": "My 3 Favorite Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nBROS\n\nELF\n\nKey Points Amazon has been seeing great operating leverage, while its cloud computing growth should continue to accelerate.\nDutch Bros has both same-store sales drivers and a long runway of expansion in front of it.\ne.l.f. Beauty has a big opportunity with Rhode.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nWhile technology stocks have been getting much of the investor attention, the consumer space has some attractive opportunities to invest in right now.\nLet's look at three stocks to buy heading into the new year.\nAmazon E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) hasn't gotten a lot of investor love in the past few years, pushing it to one of its lowest ever valuations. However, the company has been doing a lot of good things behind the scenes that are helping improve its business.\nThis all starts with its robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. The company now has over 1 million robots operating in its fulfillment centers, all of which are coordinated with its DeepFleet AI model. Meanwhile, it's also using AI to help speed up delivery and save costs by predicting the best warehouses to store items, optimizing delivery routes, and helping drivers find difficult-to-locate drop-off locations in places like large apartment complexes. AI is also driving its high gross margin ad business, which has been one of its fastest-growing businesses. This is all leading to strong operating leverage in its e-commerce operations.\n\nMeanwhile, AWS, its cloud computing unit, is seeing strong growth. This should only start to accelerate in the coming years as the company has increased its capital expenditures (capex) budget to capture the demand it is seeing for AI services, and it has several large deals in place with Anthropic and OpenAI.\nDutch Bros Coffee shop operator Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) is one of the best growth stories in the consumer space, as the company has both same-store sales drivers and a long runway of expansion in front of it. The company has already been seeing strong comparable shop sales, driven by mobile order-ahead, menu innovation, and increased marketing. However, that is just the start.\n\nThe introduction of hot food items is set to be the next big same-store sales catalyst, as it rolls out these items to the three-quarters of its shops that can support them. In tests, shops with hot food items have seen a 4% sales lift, but that is likely to increase even more as it becomes more widely available and it throws more marketing toward the initiative.\nAt the same time, Dutch Bros has a big expansion opportunity ahead. At the end of Q3, it had under 1,100 locations, with plans to have more than 2,000 by 2029 and supporting around 7,000 in the U.S. over the longer term.\n\nStory Continues\ne.l.f. Beauty If my daughter's Christmas present haul is any indication, e.l.f Beauty (NYSE: ELF) is going to have a strong quarter led by Rhode. But in all seriousness, the Rhode acquisition looks set to be a big growth driver for the company over the next few years. Before being acquired, the skincare brand saw huge sales growth from just a small product assortment, little marketing spend, and no distribution outside its website. Once put inside the e.l.f. structure, this should change.\n\nRhode recently started being sold at Sephora, and after its exclusivity period ends, e.l.f. will likely begin to increase its distribution to other outlets, like Ulta Beauty . Meanwhile, the company has only offered around a dozen products, so e.l.f. also has a nice runway to expand its assortment, as well. And of course, the company can always put Rhode into its marketing engine.\nMeanwhile, e.l.f. still has solid opportunities with its namesake and Naturium brands, as well. The company should continue to take shelf space in the U.S., while it is still in the early days of international expansion. A price hike following the introduction of tariffs should also help boost revenue growth.\nThe beaten-up stock is not expensive, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of around 22.5 times a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio below 0.4 times (with below 1 times considered undervalued), making it a strong rebound candidate in 2026.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Amazon vs. Microsoft: Which Stock Is a Better Buy for 2026 and Beyond?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:26 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Amazon and Microsoft have both seen their cloud revenue growth accelerate recently.\nBoth companies are spending massive sums of money to capture soaring demand for AI computing.\nOne stock's valuation arguably looks more attractive.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) enter 2026 with the same headline tailwind: enterprises are rebuilding their tech stacks around cloud computing and generative AI (artificial intelligence) . Even more, they have similar headwinds: the capital-intensive nature of building out AI infrastructure -- and more AI demand than they can handle (or is that a tailwind?).\nRegardless, these are two great companies with stocks likely to perform well over the long haul, but one looks slightly more attractive than the other.\nAmazon: More than an e-commerce business If you think Amazon is primarily an e-commerce business, think again.\nThe company's third-quarter net sales rose 13% year over year to $180.2 billion, while operating income came in at $17.4 billion -- and AWS (Amazon's cloud business, called Amazon Web Services) alone produced $11.4 billion of that operating income.\n\nEven more, this lucrative cloud business is seeing accelerating growth. AWS revenue increased 20% year over year to $33.0 billion in the third quarter. That is a clear step up from the 17.5% AWS growth Amazon posted in the second quarter.\nAnd it gets better. Amazon has another fast-growing profit lever beyond e-commerce: advertising. The company's third-quarter advertising services revenue rose 24% year over year in Q3.\nBut free cash flow is moving in the wrong direction. Amazon's trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased to $130.7 billion in Q3, yet free cash flow fell from $47.7 billion to $14.8 billion as capital spending rose.\nMicrosoft: a fast-growing software giant In a win for Microsoft over Amazon, its overall business is growing faster. The software giant's revenue grew 18% year over year to $77.7 billion, and operating income rose 24% to $38.0 billion.\nLike Amazon, Microsoft's cloud business is the primary driver behind the tech company's growth. Microsoft cloud revenue, for instance, grew 26% year over year to $49.1 billion. With that said, Microsoft's cloud business includes more than cloud computing. It's made up of Microsoft 365, Commercial Cloud, Azure, Dynamics 365, commercial revenue from LinkedIn, and more. Still, Azure (Microsoft's could computing business) is a key driver for Microsoft's overall cloud revenue. The company's \"Azure and other cloud services\" revenue increased 40% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's not surprising that, like Amazon, Microsoft is investing heavily in AI-capable cloud computing. The company is not only seeing growing demand from Azure customers looking for AI computing, but it is also integrating AI across its products and services.\n\"Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high-value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings release. \"It's why we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.\"\n\nThe tiebreaker So, Microsoft may be growing faster than Amazon. However, Amazon's AWS is the leading cloud infrastructure platform -- a position that may make its recent aggressive investments less of a gamble for its shareholders. Whatever the case, both companies notably have diversified businesses and have enough excess capital to invest heavily in the AI boom to capture any opportunities.\n\nThe tiebreaker probably ultimately boils down to valuation. Amazon's forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 28 is slightly below Microsoft's of about 31, giving it the edge (albeit a small one) in a head-to-head comparison.\nSo, if I had to choose a winner here, I'd choose Amazon. That's arguably the better of the two stocks for 2026 and beyond.\nOf course, there are risks for both stocks. The main one is that both companies' huge spending on AI computing doesn't pay off in the revenue and profits that management anticipates. Investors should keep a close eye on these evolving risks; if the AI boom fizzles out, investors may have to reassess whether these stocks deserve the premium valuations they currently have. But, ultimately, these are two stocks I believe will do well over the long haul.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that these stocks will almost certainly trade with meaningful volatility, given the constantly changing nature of their industries and their stocks' premium valuations. Investors who think Amazon or Microsoft look attractive today, therefore, should consider keeping any position in these stocks small, given the risks. They could always add more to their positions if the stocks take a hit.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?
