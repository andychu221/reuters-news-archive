      "Content": "Nvidia, Tesla dominate Dec. trading as 2025 options demand surges\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 1:48 PM PST\n\nIn this video: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nINTC\n\nCboe vice president of market intelligence Henry Schwartz joins Market Domination with Yahoo Finance Data and Markets Editor Jared Blikre to discuss the state of the options landscape.\nWatch the video above to hear Schwartz's outlook for the options market in 2026.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n2025 will be another record year for options volume, but how are retail traders gearing up for 2026 as the demand for leverage keeps surging? We're digging into all of this in today's options pit, sponsored by Tasty trade.\n00:15 Speaker A\nAnd Henry Schwartz, CBOE Vice President of Market Intelligence is here to discuss. Uh, let's talk about this surge in options demand. We were just talking offline. You said it's up what three times since uh COVID?\n00:32 Henry Schwartz\nYeah.\n00:33 Speaker A\nThat is incredible. So, what is this trend tell you?\n00:36 Henry Schwartz\nSo, I mean, this year we're going to see 15 billion option contracts trade. Uh if you go back to to just before COVID, it was about 4 billion contracts a year. So, and in fact, I've been doing the calculations. It looks like the 15 billionth contract will trade on Christmas Eve.\n00:52 Speaker A\nMhm.\n00:52 Henry Schwartz\nI think we should have a door prize or something. Let's see if we can figure out what trade.\n00:56 Speaker A\nThere might be some binary option futures betting markets that could uh take care of that.\n01:00 Henry Schwartz\nAbsolutely. Well, I mean, that that's actually kind of one of the big themes, right? As we've seen this the evolution of risk taking, betting, you know, there's a lot of different ways to discuss it. Um, you know, the the you know, COVID really or you know, that whole kind of market environment really changed the landscape for options trading. And basically, uh we saw growth of about 50% in 2020 and it has kept up and it is retail that is really driving most of that. You know, we continue to see, you know, a healthy institutional business. Uh we see, you know, we see, you know, the the big theme really for this year is kind of everything is just stronger. Across the board, no matter what asset classes you look at, if you're talking about index options like SPX or VIX. If you're talking about ETF options, which you know, we were just talking about kind of the explosion in in number of ETFs and single stock option flow, which is really, you know, primarily retail driven. And when you have a year like, you know, like we're seeing this year with, you know, basically the broad averages up, you know, between 15 and 20%, uh that just brings in more and more activity.\n02:08 Speaker A\nSo, I've been thinking about this and tell me if I'm just way offline here. But if we take it back to early late 2020, early 2021, that's when we had the whole Reddit GameStop phenomenon going on. Arguably, a lot of it was fueled with the stimulus checks, the stimmies. and next year is going to be a blockbuster record year for fiscal stimulus. Um there's going to be a lot of tax refunds and I'm just wondering, is there any way we could have some kind of a repeat of that, maybe not to the same extent, but do you think that we just get another surge, um perhaps just because people have more money to play with?\n02:46 Henry Schwartz\nI I mean, I think you have you have a lot of dynamics going on at the same time. You know, we do have a a a rate, you know, the rates are going down in the cycle, but you also do have some concerns about the labor market, you have concerns about, you know, just fundamental valuations. So there's a little bit of push and pull. I think, you know, that the the COVID situation and you know, zero interest rates and stimulus and meme stock, uh that that was such a perfect storm of just kind of\n03:28 Speaker A\nAgreed, perfect storm.\n03:29 Henry Schwartz\nexplosive bullish activity and and and retail were able to capitalize on it. You know, in a large part because they were at home and they kind of had the freedom to trade. You also had commissions that basically gone to zero just leading into that. So, everything came together and you know, a lot of these traders found each other and learned from each other on Reddit and on, you know, social media. Uh I don't know if 2026 is going to be quite the same. I think there's a little bit more kind of back and forth. Uh but you know, at least in terms of the options activity, you know, we continue to see new brokerage firms coming uh online. We see the existing brokerage firms, you know, innovating and and rolling out new platforms and doing some really interesting things. So, you know, I see the business, at least in the options world continuing to to do very, very well. And you know, in terms of assets, uh you know, I think that you have this environment now where, you know, the US has had an amazing run and there's a lot of people that say, oh, you know, I don't know, this is getting a little bit tired. Uh but at the same time, you you you know, every time we have a dip, uh,\n04:36 Speaker A\nAnd that's arguably better for options traders. I mean, option traders like volatility. I I I want to make sure we get to a couple other things here. The other is the rise of zero-dated options. And so that just gives more opportunities. Back in the day, you only had monthlies, so you had to wait every month. Then we had weeklies, then basically we have dailies now. And that has just increased uh this volume of options. Talk to me about some of the other innovations. I know CBOE has a bunch of new products, too.\n05:08 Henry Schwartz\nYeah, so the so we pioneered the zero DTE or the daily option option cycle starting 2022 and those are now about 2/3 of the activity uh in SPX and um and some of the big ETFs. Uh and there there's no signs of that slowing down. Uh we just rolled out the Mag 10 index, which is the Mag 7 plus uh Broadcom, uh AMD and Palantir. And you know, those 10 symbols together do about a third of the single stock option. Out of almost 4,000 single stocks. So you you can see how concentrated it is. That's what the trader, that's what the investing public really, really is interested in. They're following the stories, they're getting in and getting out of these stocks. And so the Mag 10 index which launched about a month ago, I'm very proud to say I was the very first trade in in Mag 10. and that option expired today and I made a little bit of money at it. Uh we actually have daily options coming in those just uh in two weeks. So that's, you know, and that's new, right? This this is the first time that that there's been a uh an index that's not quite as broad-based with the daily options on it as well. So, um you know, there's you know, the the industry just continues to keep innovating. You know, we see a lot of work going on in complex order execution, which is you know, basically about a third of the activity is customers trading one option against another, vertical spreads, calendar spreads, exactly. Uh and that you know, CBOE and all the other exchanges continue to kind of take steps to make that uh easier to do, add functionality. You can now trade flex options versus listed options, which is a kind of a special option that lets people pick their own expiration date and um and strike price and even exercise style.\n06:56 Speaker A\nAll right, Henry, we got to leave it there, but congratulations on your Mag 10 trade. I hope it pretends a bullish 2026. Thanks for joining us in studio here.\n07:05 Henry Schwartz\nAwesome.\n07:06 Speaker A\nAll right, we'll\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Things to Know About Amazon Stock Before You Buy\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 1:00 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points AWS drives most of its profit growth.\nIts advertising business is becoming its second profit engine.\nThose higher-margin businesses subsidize the expansion of its e-commerce business.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , the world's largest e-commerce and cloud infrastructure company, has been an outstanding growth stock for long-term investors. Over the past decade, its stock has rallied nearly 590%, outperforming the S&P 500's advance of about 240%.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, Amazon's revenue grew at a CAGR of 22% -- even as the pandemic, inflation, high interest rates, and other macro headwinds rattled the global economy. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share ( EPS ) to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 20%, respectively, as its e-commerce and cloud businesses continue to expand.\nAmazon's stock looks reasonably valued at 29 times next year's earnings, even as the S&P 500 hovers near its all-time high. I believe it's still a rock-solid investment, but investors should be aware of these three key things about the company before making a decision.\n1. AWS is its core profit engine Amazon generates most of its revenue from its e-commerce business, but its profits primarily come from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud infrastructure platform. In the first nine months of 2025, AWS generated 18% of its net sales and 60% of its operating profit. Here's how rapidly that core profit engine grew over the past few years.\nMetric\n2022\n2023\n2024\n9M 2025\nAWS Net Sales Growth (YOY)\n29%\n13%\n19%\n18%\nAWS Operating Margin\n28.5%\n27.1%\n37%\n35.6%\nAWS Operating Income Growth (YOY)\n23%\n8%\n62%\n16%\n\nData source: Amazon. YOY = Year-over-year.\nThe rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market is driving that growth as more companies upgrade their cloud infrastructure to handle the latest AI applications. AWS has also been rolling out more tools for developing and deploying agentic AI applications.\n\nAWS operates at higher margins than other smaller cloud platforms -- including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure and Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud -- because it's the entrenched market leader with superior scale and pricing power. According to Canalys, AWS controlled 32% of the global cloud infrastructure market in the second quarter of 2025, while Azure and Google Cloud held 22% and 11% shares, respectively.\n2. Its advertising business is booming Amazon isn't typically considered an advertising company, but it generates significant ad revenues from its promoted listings, integrated display ads, and streaming media ads. In 2024, its advertising service revenue increased 20% to $56.2 billion, accounting for 9% of its top line.\n\nLa historia continúa\nIn the first nine months of 2025, its advertising service revenue increased by 22% year-over-year to $47.3 billion, accounting for 9% of its top line. It doesn't break out the segment's operating profits separately, but it likely operates at higher margins than its retail business.\nTherefore, Amazon's advertising business -- which could easily surpass $60 billion in revenues this year -- will likely become its second profit engine alongside AWS. It's also well-poised to challenge Google's and Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) dominance of that booming market.\n\n3. Its Prime ecosystem is expanding Amazon's rising cloud and advertising profits enable it to expand its e-commerce business with lower-margin and loss-leading strategies. The bedrock of that expansion is its Prime ecosystem, which has locked in more than 240 million paid members worldwide.\nBy offering more discounts, free shipping options, cloud storage tools, streaming media services, and other benefits to its Prime members, Amazon enhances the stickiness of its e-commerce marketplace and widens its moat against other retailers. As long as its cloud and advertising businesses continue to grow, it can afford to take some losses to gain more members.\n\nIs it the right time to buy Amazon's stock? Amazon's growth will inevitably slow down as its business matures. However, it remains one of the most balanced plays in the secular expansion of the e-commerce, cloud, AI, and digital advertising markets. Its takeover of Whole Foods Market in 2017 also expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint and strengthened its online grocery business. It continues to expand its media businesses to challenge stand-alone streaming video and music companies. All of those long-term catalysts make it an excellent stock to buy, hold, and forget for a few decades.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

But here’s what to know before you click-to-finance\n\nSarah Sharkey\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:56 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nPlush, temperature-controlled seating. Ample legroom for a family of four and even your dog. Space for your mugs. Amazon is betting that the couch is the best place to shop for cars — particularly if you’re a busy family.\nSince launching Amazon Autos a year ago, the online retail juggernaut is keen to expand its reach and selection and is directly appealing to parents to promote the service (1).\n\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nAt first, you could only buy a new Hyundai on Amazon Autos. By August 2025, dealers could list any brand’s used cars on the platform (2). Then in November, Ford joined, but is also limiting its offerings to used cars only. The platform is partnered with 130 dealers in 48 markets.\nAmazon Autos Global Director Fan Jin says there have been growing pains.\n“I would love to see more selection,” she said at the Presidio Group Auto Technology Conference in October (3). “That’s the No. 1 customer feedback.”\nShe added that based on feedback, the company is shifting gears to give online car buyers more time for everything: choosing the vehicle they want, deciding what extras they’d like to go with that choice — and considering the total cost associated with those decisions.\n\n“We’re slowing that process down so that customers really understand of course the vehicle decision, but also the financial and product decision,” she said (5).\n“So how do we build flexibility there and give them the time to think about it before they press that Place Order?”\nThat’s important. While the process is undeniably fast and convenient — no haggling, just picking up the car — it flips the entire script on the traditional car purchasing process.\nAnd because financing happens before the test drive, it’s easy to feel locked in even when the car isn’t what you expected.\nSmall details can derail the speedy transaction. For example, any mistakes in the trim selection or disappointments during the test drive could make it difficult to walk back from the purchase, as financing is already finalized.\n\nIf you want to use the online car shopping experience and it’s available in your area, here’s what to know before jumping in.\nFinancing a click-to-buy transaction when it’s a car, not a coffee pot Amazon Auto’s click-to-buy shopping experience starts with an easy-to-use interface that allows you to search for vehicles that suit your needs and compare options.\n\nStory Continues\nOnce you pick out a car you like, you’ll jump straight into the financing process. This skips past the traditional next step of test-driving the vehicle.\nRead More: Vanguard reveals what could be coming for U.S. stocks, and it’s raising alarm bells for retirees. Here’s why and how to protect yourself\n\nShoppers will find a variety of loan options, lease terms and an option to pay with cash — with a transparent breakdown of costs and any savings or rebates you might qualify for.\nIf you have a trade-in, you’ll receive an instant estimate of value for the vehicle from an independent evaluator (6).\nThe financing process starts with a loan application, which includes a credit check. If approved and you accept the terms of the deal, the dealership will prepare your final paperwork and you’ll receive loan contracts to e-sign before you pick up the vehicle.\nFinally, you’ll go pick up your vehicle from the lot.\nIt’s a straightforward process that works, unless the vehicle you’ve picked out doesn’t meet your expectations.\nHow to protect yourself in an online auto purchase What happens if you get to the lot and don’t like the vehicle?\nYou might not like anything from the trim selection to the smells inside or even the way the car handles. Particularly if it’s a used car.\nIf you’ve already signed a retail installment sales contract, it might be too late to back out of the sale.\n\nEven if you are legally within your rights to get out of the contract, many dealerships will pressure you to stick with the original vehicle and contract, creating a hassle if you want a different car.\nKeep in mind that submitting a loan application and receiving a financing offer doesn’t mean you have a binding contract.\nWhile you’ll have to agree to a hard credit check, which can ding your credit, you aren’t required to accept the loan offer, take the car or commit to regular monthly payments at that point.\nBut when you sign a loan agreement or retail installment sales contract, that’s when the financing is final (7). If you sign this paperwork before heading to the dealership, this could lock you into the purchase.\nFederal laws have a ‘cooling off’ period built into large transactions like auto loans. In some situations, this can give you three business days to cancel the transaction, but it’s better not to rely on this option.\n\nIn order to protect yourself from getting stuck with a vehicle you don’t love, ask the dealership upfront if you can walk away after a test drive.\nAlso, consider skipping dealership financing altogether. If you shop around across several lenders, like credit unions and online banks, you may find more affordable financing you can finalize after a test drive\nAlthough this might mean spending a little time doing paperwork at the dealership and with a lender, it could save you a major headache if the vehicle isn’t up to your expectations.\nYou May Also Like Become the landlord of Whole Foods and Walmart without lifting a finger.

B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist Art Hogan joins Opening Bid with Brian Sozzi to talk about his expectations for the Magnificent Seven and the broader AI trade.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat is the future of the AI trade and how are you playing it next year? Art, is it Max 7 or bust for you?\n00:09 Art\nUh, it's not. and I'll tell you this. I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nCharleston-Based Law Firm Yarborough Applegate Leads Nation in Holding Amazon Accountable for Delivery Driver Wrecks\n\nBusiness Wire\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C., December 19, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--The Charleston-based personal injury law firm of Yarborough Applegate, having secured the nation’s first-ever jury verdict holding Amazon liable for delivery driver negligence , is now leading national efforts to enforce that precedent. The firm is actively pursuing multi-state litigation against the e-commerce giant for catastrophic harm caused by its massive Delivery Service Partner (DSP) fleet, a public safety risk amplified by the billions of packages delivered during the peak holiday season.\n\nIn December 2023, the firm secured a landmark $44.6 million verdict in the South Carolina case of Shannon Shaw v. Amazon.com Inc. This victory successfully dismantled Amazon's long-standing defense that its drivers are purely \"independent contractors\" and set the national legal standard that Amazon's overwhelming control over its drivers makes the company vicariously liable.\n\"When we went to trial for this case here in South Carolina, we were committed first and foremost to getting justice for the victim, Shannon Shaw. But we knew it was also an opportunity to expose Amazon’s dangerous business practices nationwide—and pressure the company to make a change,\" said David Yarborough, Partner at Yarborough Applegate. \"That verdict proved what we always knew: Amazon micromanages nearly every aspect of the delivery process. They monitor driver speed, route, and even behavior via required in-van technology. They cannot claim ignorance when that data clearly shows a driver is distracted or dangerous.\"\n\nHolding Amazon Accountable Nationwide\nStill the national leader in this unique area of complex litigation , Yarborough Applegate is leveraging the Shaw blueprint in jurisdictions across the United States. Active cases demonstrate a pattern of alleged negligence and catastrophic outcomes that the firm is working to address:\nWrongful Death in Washington : Representing the family of Delia Menera, a grandmother who was killed in a marked crosswalk in Longview, Washington, by an Amazon delivery driver who allegedly admitted to using a THC vape prior to the collision. The lawsuit is currently pending in King County, Washington. (Case No.: 25-2-13547-1 SEA)\nWrongful Death in Ohio : Representing the family of Lee Andrew \"AJ\" Watson, Jr., who was killed in a motorcycle collision involving an Amazon delivery driver in Montgomery County, Ohio, who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of operating a motor vehicle under the influence. (CASE NO.: 2024 CV 05871)\nWrongful Death in South Carolina : Representing the widow of Bobby Peake, who was killed when an Amazon Delivery Driver turned left directly into the path of the vehicle in which Peake was riding as a passenger. (C/A No. 2025-CP-44-00385)\n\nStory Continues\n\"These are not isolated incidents; they are the foreseeable consequences of a corporate culture that prioritizes delivery speed over public safety,\" said Alex Heaton, attorney at Yarborough Applegate. \"We’re here to ensure that innocent victims harmed by Amazon's delivery system have a pathway to justice.\"\n\nA Crucial Warning During Peak Delivery Season\nThe volume of Amazon deliveries surges exponentially during the holiday season, placing unprecedented pressure on DSP drivers and dramatically increasing the risk to pedestrians and motorists. Yarborough Applegate’s active litigation ensures that Amazon faces consequences for its alleged negligence, sending a clear message that the multi-billion dollar corporation must commit to more rigorous driver vetting, training, and supervision.\n\"The public relies on Amazon for their holiday deliveries, but they also have a right to safe roads,\" said Brandt Horton, attorney at Yarborough Applegate. \"We will continue to lead these cases, from South Carolina all the way across the country, until Amazon prioritizes the safety of the communities it serves.\"\n\nAbout Yarborough Applegate\nYarborough Applegate is a leading South Carolina personal injury law firm dedicated to representing victims of catastrophic injuries and wrongful death. Recognized for securing the first jury verdict in the nation to hold Amazon vicariously liable for its DSP drivers, the firm has established itself as the national standard-bearer in this unique area of litigation.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251218653683/en/\nContacts\nMedia Contact:\nEmily McGannon\nemily@yarboroughapplegate.com\n843-972-0150\nyarboroughapplegate.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI hyperscalers have room for ‘elevated debt issuance’ — even after their recent bond binge, BofA says\n\nJason Ma\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:44 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BAC\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThe tech giants fueling the AI boom generate so much cash relative to their debt that they have more than enough room to issue more, according to Bank of America .\nIn a note this week, analysts looked at the top five publicly traded AI hyperscalers: Meta , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon and Oracle .\nBofA pointed out that while the companies can fund their near-term capital expenditures with cash, they are tapping debt markets for balance-sheet flexibility and better cost of capital. Last month alone, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon raised tens of billions of dollars in the bond market.\n\nOperating cash flow for the big five hyperscalers is expected to hit $577 billion this year from $378 billion in 2023, while debt should climb from $356 billion to $433 billion.\nThat means their overall debt burden is actually getting lighter as the debt-to-cash ratio should dip from 0.94 to 0.75.\n“Given the hyperscalers’ historically conservative capital allocation and balance sheet policies, elevated debt issuance is possible, as evident by the recent bond deals from Meta, Alphabet and Amazon,” BofA said.\nAnd plenty of additional cash is on the way. By 2029, operating cash flow is seen jumping 95% to $1.1 trillion, while capex is forecast to grow at a much slower pace of 58% to $632 billion.\nBut then there’s Oracle. Unlike the other AI hyperscalers, it will have negative free cash flow until 2029, meaning its capex will exceed cash from operations, according to BofA. As a result, it doesn’t have much capacity to take on more debt.\n\nIndeed, fears about Oracle’s debt binge have rattled the overall AI stock trade as the company isn’t a cash machine like its AI peers.\nRecent earnings guidance was also weak, and the company raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 capex by another $15 billion. In addition, surging lease obligations have spooked Wall Street.\nA Financial Times report on Wednesday that said alternative investments firm Blue Owl didn’t team up with Oracle on a data center after all piled on more concerns. Shares fell on the news, though the company’s development partner, Related Digital, said Blue Owl was outbid on the project and didn’t back out of it.\nBut even though debt may not pose a limit on hyperscalers’ ambitions, they still face physical limits , namely in building enough infrastructure fast enough to meet demand.\nData-center researcher Jonathan Koomey told Fortune’s Eva Roytburg that capital can be deployed instantly, but the equipment that capital must buy cannot. Tmelines for turbines, transformers, specialized cooling systems, and high-voltage gear have stretched into years, he explained.\n\nStory Continues\n“This happens every time there’s a massive shift in investment,” Koomey added. “Eventually manufacturers catch up, but not right away. Reality intervenes.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "E-Commerce Powers Holiday Sales: 4 Stocks With Upside for 2026\n\nVasundhara Sawalka\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nFVRR\n\nFDX\n\nThe 2025 holiday shopping season has set remarkable records, with e-commerce emerging as the undisputed winner in retail's most critical quarter. Cyber Monday 2025 became the largest online shopping day in history, generating $14.25 billion in sales, up 7.1% year over year. Black Friday online sales reached $11.8 billion, marking an impressive 9.1% growth, while the five-day Cyber Week period delivered $44.2 billion in total online spending, up 7.7% from 2024. These stellar results position 2025 as the first quarter-trillion-dollar holiday season, with total online sales projected to hit $253.4 billion from November through December.\n\nDelivery Infrastructure Thrives The e-commerce boom has created unprecedented opportunities for logistics companies navigating peak season demands. FedEx FDX and Amazon AMZN each experienced 5-8% volume increases during the 2025 holiday season, handling an estimated 2.3 billion packages. Delivery performance remained exceptional, with FedEx achieving 98.3% on-time rates, UPS at 98.9%, and USPS at 97.2% during the crucial Cyber Week period. Amazon's logistics network, now handling delivery volumes comparable to traditional carriers, has fundamentally reshaped last-mile delivery expectations with same-day and next-day services becoming standard offerings.\n\nTechnology Drives 2026 Momentum Several transformative trends suggest strong continued growth heading into 2026. Mobile commerce dominated the 2025 holiday season, accounting for 57.5% of Cyber Monday purchases, while artificial intelligence influenced $9.3 billion in global online sales. A FedEx survey from November 2025 found that 97% of large U.S. retailers now employ AI tools for personalization, inventory management, and customer service.\n\nLooking ahead, 98% of global e-commerce brands forecast international order volume growth in 2026, with the worldwide e-commerce market expected to reach approximately $7 trillion. Key 2026 priorities include improving delivery speed, expanding into new markets, and reducing fulfillment costs while leveraging AI for logistics optimization. As brands invest in cross-border capabilities and automated fulfillment systems, the e-commerce ecosystem appears poised for sustained expansion throughout 2026.\n\n4 Strong E-Commerce Bets for 2026 Investors seeking exposure to the e-commerce expansion can consider several compelling opportunities. Expedia EXPE, GigaCloud Technology GCT, Fiverr International FVRR and Amazon represent stocks positioned to capitalize on the 2026 e-commerce boom following the robust holiday season. Each company carries a Zacks Rank of either 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

While Fiverr International declined 31.5% during the same period, the company is likely to benefit from potential upside as the digital services marketplace positions itself for the anticipated 2026 e-commerce acceleration, driven by increased online business activity and cross-border commerce expansion.\n\nStory Continues\n6-Month Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nExpedia represents a compelling buy for 2026 following strong third-quarter 2025 results, which beat estimates with $7.57 adjusted EPS and 12% gross bookings growth.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAs is the case with other technology giants, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has positioned itself to be a key player in the AI race. The firm differs from players such as Google and Amazon through the fact that it does not operate a cloud computing business. Yet, while Google, Amazon, and Microsoft spend on AI data centers to bolster their cloud computing capabilities, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) continues to spend just as much despite not being a major player in the industry. The spending has also seen the focus of analysts, with TD Cowen commenting on December 4th that the firm’s decision to cut back its metaverse spending could counter the increased spending on AI infrastructure. TD Cowen kept a Buy rating and an $810 share price target for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s shares.\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\nThe firm’s infrastructure spending includes a major data center it is building in Louisiana. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced on December 4th, 2024, that it was building a $10 billion data center in the state, and recent media reports have suggested that costs have ballooned to $27 billion. During this episode, Cramer and his co-hosts discussed reports of CoreWeave’s Texas data center project struggling, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) factored into the discussion:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a key player in the AI industry due to several factors. These include the firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business and its in-house Trainium AI chips. The highly competitive cloud computing industry, which sees investors demand high growth rates, has also affected Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in 2025. As an example, the shares dipped in August after the firm’s second-quarter earnings saw AWS post a 17.5% revenue growth, which was slower than Microsoft and Google’s cloud growth rates of 39% and 32%, respectively.\nZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.com\nAWS has also been the focus of recent analyst coverage for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s shares. For instance, Guggenheim initiated coverage on December 10th as it set a Buy rating and a $300 share price target. The research firm cited AWS as the reason behind its coverage and shared that the business’s 3.8-year backlog had touched $200 billion in Q2. Cramer also discussed the AWS business. He insisted that the cloud business will drive the narrative, and commented on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) after BMO Capital raised the share price target to $304 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating, and raised the Q1 2026 AWS cloud growth estimate to 24% from an earlier 23%.

      "Content": "Nvidia Vs. Alphabet: Which Could Be The World's Biggest Company By End-2026?\n\nPiero Cingari\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have quietly become the two most dominant forces inside the Magnificent Seven, riding different paths to the same destination: artificial intelligence supremacy.\nNvidia's GPUs remain the backbone of the global AI buildout, powering everything from data centers to cutting-edge model training.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is pushing its own vertically integrated AI stack — from custom TPUs to Gemini — embedding intelligence directly across Search, Cloud and consumer products.\nThe market thus far has rewarded both approaches. Nvidia is up 33% year-to-date through Dec. 17, while Alphabet has surged 62%.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nZooming out further tells an even more dramatic story: since early 2023, Alphabet shares are up roughly 250%, while Nvidia has delivered a staggering 1,120% return.\nThat explosive run has made Nvidia the world's biggest company today, with a market capitalization of about $4.318 trillion — even briefly touching $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet ranks third at approximately $3.7 trillion, behind Apple's $4.05 trillion valuation.\n\nYet traders see a far closer race ahead.\nOn Polymarket, both Nvidia and Alphabet are assigned a 35% probability of being the world's most valuable company by the end of 2026.\nA $100 bet on Alphabet overtaking Nvidia to become the world's biggest company by the end of next year would pay out $265 if it happens — with nearly identical returns available for those wagering that Nvidia holds onto the crown.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) trails with a 14% chance, followed by Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT ) at 9%.\nTesla Inc . (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) sit further back, at 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nHow Could Alphabet Overtake Nvidia As World’s Biggest Company? For Alphabet to dethrone Nvidia as world’s biggest company, it needs to outperform by a meaningful margin.\nThe current valuation gap between the two companies is about $600 billion.\nIf Nvidia's market cap were to grow 10% in 2026, it would climb from roughly $4.3 trillion to about $4.75 trillion. For Alphabet to leapfrog Nvidia in that scenario, its shares would need to outperform Nvidia by roughly 19 percentage points.\n\nStory Continues\nIn practical terms, that would mean Alphabet gaining about 29% in a year where Nvidia rises 10%, lifting Google's valuation to around $4.77 trillion.\nAny performance gap of 19 percentage points in Alphabet's favor could hand it the crown — assuming today's market caps as the starting line.\n\nThe bet, then, is whether Alphabet's AI monetization, advertising leverage and cloud growth can accelerate faster than Nvidia's already-dominant chip business.\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nWall Street Still Backs Nvidia Where traders see a coin flip, Wall Street analysts remain more decisive.\nBased on median 12-month price targets, analysts expect Nvidia's reign to continue. Consensus estimates point to Nvidia shares reaching about $250 over the next year, or roughly 40% upside from the current price near $177.\nAlphabet's outlook is far more muted by comparison. Analysts see a median 12-month target of $330, implying just 6% upside from its current level around $306.\n\nThat gap underscores the tension at the core of the debate: prediction markets see a neck-and-neck race for the world's largest company, while Wall Street analysts continue to model an extended run of Nvidia's dominance.\nBy the end of 2026, the outcome may hinge on a single question: will the AI arms race ultimately reward the company supplying the picks and shovels, or the one embedding intelligence into every layer of the digital economy?\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

      "Content": "2 Top Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nHIMS\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nKey Points Amazon's cost-cutting could supercharge its profitability.\nHims & Hers has explosive long-term growth potential.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nWe're coming to the close of 2025, and it has been an excellent year for stocks. The S&P 500 is up by a healthy 14%, while the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite has jumped 18%, propelled by the growth of new industries like generative AI .\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, investors will want to have exposure to continuing AI momentum as well as diversification into other aspects of the economy. In my view, for those looking to add new stocks to their portfolios now, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) could make great options for a $500 investment.\nAmazon The generative AI boom is beginning to mature, and it might be time for investors to pivot away from pure-play hardware stocks like Nvidia and start choosing companies that can benefit from the technology, but that don't have all their eggs in one basket. Amazon is unusual because it has significant exposure to the lucrative AI infrastructure market while also having the ability to incorporate the technology into its daily operations.\n\nFor starters, Amazon is a significant partner with (and minority owner in) leading AI company Anthropic, which specializes in creating large language models (LLMs) similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Anthropic has quickly overtaken its rival in the U.S. enterprise LLM market, attracting a market share of 32% compared to OpenAI's 25%, mainly because of its reliability and security.\nAs an equity partner, Amazon will see the value of its stake in Anthropic grow as the company gets larger, providing it with a source of noncash income. Furthermore, Anthropic relies on Amazon's cloud computing platform , Amazon Web Services (AWS), to build, train, and deploy its models, so it's also providing steady income to the tech giant.\nAnd Amazon is making strides to incorporate generative AI into its own business. In June, CEO Andy Jassy released a memo saying that the new technology could allow the company to reduce its corporate workforce through efficiency gains. Then in October, Amazon slashed 14,000 jobs, potentially saving it billions of dollars.\n\nThat said, Amazon's image as the poster child of AI layoffs (even if not all of its job cuts are AI-related) could introduce reputational risks. Investors should watch the situation carefully over the coming months.\nHims & Hers Health With all the talk about AI, it may seem like there are no other growth opportunities in the market. But that isn't true. Telehealth is shaping up to be a generational megatrend.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to analysts at J.P. Morgan , the so-called \"Internet of Medical Things\" could enjoy a compound annual growth rate of 24% through 2030 as a growing proportion of routine healthcare visits for needs such as psychiatric care and regular appointments are done virtually.\nHims & Hers Health stands out in the telehealth space in part because of its edgy Gen Z and millennial-focused branding. Instead of just offering a service, it has turned healthcare into an experience, focusing on addressing personal and sensitive issues like sexual health, hair loss, and weight loss, which some patients might be less comfortable seeing a doctor about in person. It also offers long-established drugs like Viagra in easy-to-take generic forms such as chewable mints, which makes it even more discreet for consumers.\nBusiness is booming. Third-quarter revenue surged 49% year over year to $600 million. A growing number of users are turning to Hims & Hers for personalized treatment plans, relying on the platform to serve several of their healthcare needs.\nFor example, a patient might use the Hims & Hers platform for sexual health, mental health, and weight loss. As a one-stop shop, Hims can save significant time and money for its users.\n\nHims & Hers is growing at an impressive clip, but it is still struggling to generate significant profits. Its third-quarter operating income actually fell by around half to just $11.8 million, which was relatively low compared to its $600 million in revenue.\nThat said, investors shouldn't be too worried about this. Management is pouring hundreds of millions into marketing to establish its brand. This long-term focus on winning market share will probably turn out to be more beneficial than chasing short-term profits.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "4 Key Cloud Computing Stocks to Include in Your Portfolio for 2026\n\nSupriyo Bose\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:41 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: IBM\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAn updated edition of the Nov. 04, 2025 article.\n\nLeveraging virtualization technology, which enables users to access and store data over the Internet without managing their physical servers and intricate IT infrastructure, cloud computing has gained increasing prominence in driving innovation and digital transformation. It enables multiple users to share the same hardware resources by connecting to the cloud platform through a web browser or dedicated applications, thereby creating a framework for seamless omnichannel customer engagement.\n\nFor investors seeking to invest in blue-chip tech firms, cloud computing has emerged as an attractive theme. This has made cloud computing companies like Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and International Business Machines Corporation IBM indispensable for any investment portfolio. But before digging deep into these prized possessions, let us examine a little more into why organizations are increasingly adopting cloud computing.\n\nBased on a pay-per-use pricing model, enterprises only pay for the computing resources they use. This has helped business enterprises to reduce operating costs for maintaining on-site data centers and deploying IT experts to manage the infrastructure, making it a highly cost-effective solution. With easy access to a plethora of innovative technologies, cloud computing increases productivity with greater agility and flexibility, and improves scalability with higher economies of scale. Moreover, cloud computing services are delivered over a highly secure network with low latency for applications and data backup facilities for improved reliability.\n\nCloud computing services fall into four broad categories, namely infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless and software as a service (SaaS), offering different levels of control, flexibility and management options to business enterprises. Cloud computing, which relies heavily on virtualization and automation technologies, provides the requisite infrastructure for AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning (ML) workloads. It delivers powerful computing abilities to process and analyze data, creating an ideal platform for Big Data management.\n\nPer Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market size is expected to swell to $2,390.2 billion by 2030 from $752.4 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 20.4% with a variety of capabilities across multiple industries. These include diverse use cases such as improved patient monitoring and outcomes in healthcare, personalized financial management and predictive spending, immersive learning in education, superior inventory management in retail and predictive maintenance and better supply chain management in the manufacturing sector.\n\nIf you intend to capitalize on this buzzing trend, our Cloud Computing Thematic Investing Screen could make it easy to identify high-potential stocks in this domain at any given time, just like the four mentioned above. By leveraging advanced tools, our thematic screens identify companies shaping the future, making it easier to benefit from emerging trends.\n\nReady to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas?

Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing platform, allows users to build, run and scale applications in the cloud. It offers a variety of services, including storage, networking, analytics and AI.\n\nMicrosoft has doubled down on the cloud computing opportunity. Azure&rsquo;s increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally has strengthened Microsoft's competitive position in the cloud computing market. Operating through a vast network of global data centers that ensure high availability and reliability for applications, Azure offers seamless access to all the services included in the portal once customers subscribe to it. Subscribers can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as virtual machines (VMs) and databases, which can then be assembled into running environments used to host workloads and store data.\n\nAs Microsoft continues to push the boundaries of networking technology, it aims to create innovative, resilient and secure solutions that enable businesses to leverage AI and the cloud to their fullest potential. It is heavily investing in AI-powered cloud services, integrating Azure OpenAI Service, Copilot and ML into various cloud solutions, making AI a central feature of Azure to empower organizations to manage their applications with greater confidence and efficiency. Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nAlphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search engine provider to a leading provider of cloud computing technology. Google Cloud has turned out to be the key catalyst behind the company&rsquo;s growth, driven by its strengthening cloud service offerings.\n\nThe solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace and continued investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI have helped Google to expand its cloud footprint worldwide. The increasing number of cloud regions and availability zones globally has been a hallmark of Google Cloud. Currently, Google Cloud has 42 cloud regions, 127 availability zones and 200 network edge locations across more than 200 countries. Google Cloud is considered the third-largest cloud player among numerous cloud providers worldwide.\n\nAlphabet&rsquo;s growing GenAI capabilities and significant investments in cloud computing are potential catalysts for the future amid stiff competition in the cloud space and increasing regulatory headwinds. This Zacks Rank #3 company&rsquo;s dominant position in the search engine market and the cloud boosts its long-term prospects.\n\nAmazon enjoys a leading position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the IaaS space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin-generating businesses. The expanding customer base of AWS, driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid Amazon's dominance in the global cloud space.\n\nAWS is the world&rsquo;s most comprehensive and broadly adopted on-demand cloud computing platform, offering more than 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers, including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises and leading government agencies, are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile and innovate faster. It reportedly offers the widest variety of databases that are purpose-built for different types of applications to enable subscribers to choose the right tool for the job.\n\nAmazon aims to extend AWS&rsquo; AI and ML capabilities to facilitate improved decision-making. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company intends to expand its global infrastructure for faster and more reliable service with low latency and maximum availability. From cloud-native applications and AI-driven solutions to edge computing and sustainability initiatives, AWS is likely to push the limits in the realm of cloud computing technology.\n\nIBM has gradually evolved as a provider of cloud and data platforms. The Red Hat acquisition, in particular, has helped it strengthen its competitive position in the hybrid cloud market. With the buyout, the company offers a Linux operating system&mdash;Red Hat Enterprise Linux&mdash;and a hybrid cloud platform&mdash;Red Hat OpenShift&mdash;aiding enterprises with digital transformation.\n\nWith a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management, translating into a healthy demand for IBM hybrid cloud solutions. In addition, the buyout of HashiCorp has significantly augmented IBM&rsquo;s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. HashiCorp&rsquo;s tool sets complement IBM RedHat&rsquo;s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management and bolstering its hybrid multi-cloud approach.\n\nIBM is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments. This Zacks Rank #3 company&rsquo;s growth is expected to be aided primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long run.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\n\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits , suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google , OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\n\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction .\nOpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

I’m particularly excited about entering an entirely new market by developing solutions tailored to the oil, gas, and energy industry, guided by the expertise of Mike McLaren and the team at Olenox. This new framework allows us to dedicate even more manpower to business development and the global rollout of our unique product offerings.”\nAbout Giant Containers\nFounded in 2017, Giant Containers is a leading designer and integrator of custom container-based solutions for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers.

      "Content": "M&C Saatchi boss under threat as headhunters called in\n\nJames Warrington\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SAA.L\n\nAMZN\n\nADDDF\n\nBBRYF\n\nThe boss of advertising agency M&C Saatchi’s position is under threat after the company began sounding out potential replacements amid rising pressure from an activist investor.\nHeadhunters have approached a number of industry figures to gauge their interest in taking over the role of chief executive, industry magazine Campaign reported.\n\nIt will cast doubts over the future of Zaid Al-Qassab, the former Channel 4 marketing boss who has led M&C Saatchi since May 2024. One industry source described Mr Al-Qassab as “a dead man walking”.\nIn an announcement to the stock market, M&C Saatchi said: “While the company is not commenting on any press speculation at this time, the board confirms that succession planning is something it keeps under review.”\nCompany losing ground to tech rivals M&C Saatchi, whose clients include Amazon, Adidas and Burberry , has come under growing pressure from investors as it grapples with a slowdown in sales amid wider economic uncertainty and growing competition from major tech rivals.\nLast month the company issued a profit warning, saying it expects revenues to decline by 7pc for the full year. Shares have dropped by more than a quarter so far in 2025, giving it a market value of just over £150m.\n\nHarwood Capital, an activist investor run by Christopher Mills, has built a stake of just over 4pc in M&C Saatchi, making it a top 10 shareholders.\nThe investment firm is understood to be agitating for change, including a break-up or sale of the entire ad group .\nM&C Saatchi last month rejected a £50m bid for its performance arm, which provides media planning and buying services.\nBosses rejected the unsolicited swoop by Brave Bison , a rival group backed by Rupert Murdoch, saying it “fundamentally undervalues” the division, which it said was crucial to its growth plans.\nIt is unclear whether Brave Bison, which counts Lord Ashcroft among its investors, will return with an improved offer.\nM&C Saatchi has been buffeted by scandals and hostile takeover bids in recent years.\n\nIn 2019, the advertising agency became embroiled in an accounting scandal that led to a clearout of almost its entire boardroom, including co-founder Baron Saatchi .\nThe agency, which is known for its longstanding ties to the Conservative Party, was then forced to fend off an unsolicited takeover bid from its biggest shareholder, Vin Murria. It also rejected a separate approach from rival Next 15.\nPrevious chief executive Moray MacLennan stepped down just weeks after veteran media executive Zillah Byng-Thorne joined as chairman. Ms Byng-Thorne, who was responsible for recruiting Mr Al-Qassab, then stepped down after just two years.\n\nStory Continues\nMr Al-Qassab has sought to turn around M&C Saatchi’s fortunes by selling off smaller loss-making divisions.\nThe ad firm, which has long held lucrative government contracts, was handed a boost last week when it was named as one of three agencies appointed to the Government’s creative roster.\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

      "Content": "2 Growth Stocks That Have Beaten the Market in Just 2 of the Past 5 Years\n\nJohn Ballard, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 1:45 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNFLX\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Netflix and Amazon underperformed the market over the past five years, having only outperformed in 2023 and 2024.\nHowever, these growth stocks are attractive based on recent business momentum and future opportunities.\nWall Street analysts project both companies to grow their earnings per share between 18% to 24% in the years to come.\n10 stocks we like better than Netflix ›\n\nInvestor patience has been tested over the past five years. Since the end of 2020, there has been one bear market in 2022, followed by a severe, but brief, market sell-off earlier this year due to concerns about tariffs and their impact on the economy. Despite all that turmoil, the S&P 500 has nearly doubled since December 2020, including dividends.\nUltimately, business fundamentals take over and drive stock prices higher over time. Investors in Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can certainly attest to this. These top growth stocks have been battered in recent years, yet their businesses continue to demonstrate excellent growth potential, making them solid long-term investments.\nNetflix Netflix stock has climbed 24,000% since 2005, but has underperformed the market since 2020, rising 80% compared to the S&P 500's 99% gain. It underperformed the market in 2021, 2022, and 2025, as of mid-December. Year to date, the shares are up 5% compared to the 17% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nThe stock experienced a steep decline in 2022 due to subscriber headwinds, but since then, it has been on a tear, surging 218%. The recent dip coincides with a broad sell-off in several growth companies in the technology sector. However, this could provide a great entry point for buying shares.\nThe business is performing exceptionally well. Netflix is dominating the streaming market, with more than 300 million paying households. It has paying members in more than 190 countries, yet there is still considerable potential for Netflix to continue growing.\nAnalysts expect its revenue to increase by 15% in 2025, according to Yahoo! Finance. Over the last year, Netflix generated $10 billion in net profit on $43 billion in total revenue, and these profits are potentially funding a significant expansion of its content offerings. If Netflix closes the recently announced acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery , including its film studios and HBO, it will only enhance the company's revenue potential through a deeper library of content.\n\nWith this momentum, the subscriber losses in 2022 that drove the stock down 51% seem like a distant memory. Netflix picked itself up by continuing to invest in expanding its content, cracking down on password-sharing, and launching an advertising-supported subscription tier to boost subscriber growth.\n\nStory Continues\nNetflix has a significant advantage due to its massive membership base, widening content offering, and extensive brand power. These advantages will continue to serve the company and its shareholders well for years to come. The consensus estimate among analysts predicts its earnings per share will grow at an annualized rate of approximately 24% for the foreseeable future. That should be enough earnings growth to potentially fuel market-beating returns for investors.\nAmazon Amazon is another wealth-building investment for investors who have patiently held it over the last 20 years, but the stock has only beaten the market in two of the past five years. Amazon's stock underperformed the S&P 500 in 2021 and 2022. It has also trailed the index in 2025, up about 1% vs the S&P 500's 17% gain at the time of writing.\n\nAmazon is known as the leading e-commerce business globally. Still, its expansion into cloud computing, advertising, entertainment services through Prime, and consumer devices puts Amazon in a different league than its competitors. These non-retail services account for 59% of the company's revenue and generate the majority of the company's profit.\nAll these businesses, taken together, are performing well. Amazon's total net sales growth has trended higher over the past three years. Third-quarter sales grew 13% year over year to $180 billion, driven by solid sales growth across all operating segments.\nThe acceleration in its cloud computing business, which is its most profitable segment, is good news for Amazon's bottom line. Over the past year, Amazon reported a net profit of $76 billion, and investors might be underestimating further growth.\n\nThe stock's underperformance in recent years is not justified based on the company's significant improvement in profitability. The stock is trading at a price-to-cash-flow ratio of 18, much lower than its previous 10-year average of 27 times cash flow. This seems low considering Amazon has grown its cash from operations to more than $130 billion on a trailing-12-month basis, representing a 229% increase over the past three years.\nOn a more traditional price-to-earnings basis, Amazon's forward multiple of 28 on next year's earnings estimate seems quite reasonable. As management focuses on growing the cloud business and rightsizing costs in the e-commerce operation, there is likely to be significant growth in the company's profitability, enabling it to deliver market-beating returns for investors over the next five years. Analysts predict Amazon's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 18% over the next several years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?

      "Content": "Gamestop Could Be Going to $0. Buy This Stock Instead.\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:51 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GME\n\nAMZN\n\nAMC\n\nKey Points GameStop stock has fallen 73% from its 2021 meme stock peak, and analysts expect more downside ahead.\nAmazon benefits from gaming's digital shift through Luna, Prime Gaming, Twitch, AWS infrastructure, and e-commerce.\nEvery trend hurting GameStop (digital distribution, cloud gaming, online infrastructure) seems to be a revenue stream for Amazon.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nRemember the skyrocketing meme stocks of 2021? Gosh, how time flies.\nIt has been almost five years since social media posts ignited short squeezes in GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC) shares. From the closing bell on Jan. 20, 2021, to the end of Jan. 27, 2021 (just one week later), AMC's stock spiked 570% higher while GameStop soared 788%.\nBut the joy didn't last long. AMC's stock is down 98% from that peak, and GameStop has lost 73% as of Dec. 17, 2025. The average analyst recommendation for GameStop is underperform with a price target 41% below the current level. Keep those expected price drops up for a few more years, and there won't be much left.\nI hate to say it, but GameStop is starting to look obsolete. When was the last time you bought a video game from a local store instead of just downloading it to your favorite console? GameStop's stock may very well go to zero in the long run.\nAmazon is eating GameStop's lunch On the upside, I can recommend one of GameStop's top competitors for new money in 2026. The same digital industry shift that's destroying GameStop has big winners too. In particular, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) benefits in several ways from the game-download trend.\nAmazon Luna: The e-commerce giant has its own cloud-based gaming service -- no discs, no downloads, just run the games on Amazon's servers and stream the experience to your favorite web browser or mobile device.\nPrime Gaming: Amazon Prime subscribers have free access to many Luna games and in-game items.\nDigital game sales: Amazon sells download codes for Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC games. You get the same product as GameStop's, with no retail footprint needed. It's true that each gaming platform also offers direct downloads, but Amazon helps you organize your gaming buys across many device types.\nAWS gaming infrastructure: Amazon Web Services (AWS) powers online multiplayer, game streaming, and patch/update delivery for many major publishers. This way, Amazon profits whether you play on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC.\nTwitch: Amazon owns the dominant game-streaming video platform. Twitch also integrates with Prime Gaming for cross-promotion.\nE-commerce for hardware: And Amazon is happy to serve if you're looking for consoles, controllers, or accessories (the physical stuff GameStop's brick-and-mortar stores rely on).\n\nStory continues\nGaming is just a bonus; Amazon is a great buy anyway And here's the best part. With or without its gaming industry muscle, Amazon stock is a fantastic buy right now.\nAmazon's annualized revenue growth has averaged 11.5% over the last three years, with 13% year-over-year jumps in the last two reports. The company generated $10.6 billion of free cash flow over the last year, based on a massive $691 billion in top-line revenues and $120 billion of capital expenses. Those artificial intelligence (AI) data centers won't just build themselves, you know.\n\nThis trillion-dollar tech titan is earning its market cap the honest way, with excellent financials and strong growth prospects. Sorry, GameStop, but Amazon is the first place I'd start looking for a buy related to the video game industry.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

The strongest near term catalyst remains broader AI-driven platform adoption, while a key risk is execution on new offerings and models like Falcon Flex. The latest SailPoint and Amazon Business Prime integrations reinforce the adoption story but do not materially change those near term drivers or risks on their own.\n\nAmong the recent updates, Falcon AI Detection and Response (AIDR) is especially relevant. It extends CrowdStrike’s reach into the AI interaction layer, aligning directly with the catalyst of deeper AI integration across cloud, identity and data protection. As AI powered attacks grow more sophisticated, AIDR helps keep the Falcon platform central to how customers think about securing new workloads and could influence how investors weigh CrowdStrike’s long term platform potential against its current valuation and profitability profile.\nYet despite this progress in AI security, investors should be aware that rising competitive pressures and the cost of rapid innovation could...\nRead the full narrative on CrowdStrike Holdings (it's free!)\nCrowdStrike Holdings' narrative projects $7.9 billion revenue and $691.1 million earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Company May Now Be Winning the AI War\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:52 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points After ChatGPT took some of its search traffic, Alphabet rebounded by introducing AI Overviews and AI Mode.\nAlphabet's Gemini 3 is considered a leading LLM.\nManagement will increase the tech giant's capital expenditures in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIt's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world in significant ways, and the major hyperscalers are all investing hundreds of billions of dollars in their efforts to capitalize on the trend. Companies like Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all developing robust AI businesses that are driving the charge, and companies like Nvidia and Broadcom are providing key parts of the hardware infrastructure that supports the technology.\n\nIf 2025 was a year of expansion, 2026 could be a year when those companies' investments start showing results, and when that happens, Alphabet could be a big winner.\nMore AI for more people The current types of large language models (LLMs) were first introduced to the public through OpenAI's ChatGPT three years ago, but Alphabet has actually used similar tech to power its Google search engine for years. However, the ChatGPT launch changed the AI landscape and led to a new LLM race, and Alphabet now offers its own generative AI services.\n\nAlthough it looked for a time like Google was in danger of losing its dominance in search as more people just asked questions to ChatGPT and had it do the legwork, Alphabet has responded effectively by rolling out its own competitive LLMs, and it flipped the script by offering AI Overview and AI Mode on its search pages. Recently, paid clicks have been accelerating, and Alphabet's revenue is soaring. Sales increased 16% year over year in the third quarter, with strong performances across the business.\nToday, its operation includes a broad spectrum of products and services, including YouTube, Android, Waymo autonomous vehicles, and others. Google Search remains its core business, but there's a lot more going on. Its varied revenue streams will provide it with diverse growth drivers in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHowever, of particular importance recently is the Google Cloud Platform. Alphabet's cloud services are where its clients engage with generative AI to create their own apps and agents, and cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3. The accelerating pace of growth in this area implies that the opportunity to create with AI is attracting more clients to the cloud, and Alphabet's newest LLM, Gemini 3, has been rated the top LLM to use right now according to several leaderboards. Gemini has 650 million active users, and the company is capitalizing on its strong user base to monetize these services.\n\nStory Continues\nNot just LLMs Beyond its robust LLMs, which may be winning the LLM wars at least for now, and its search feature, which still holds a market share of about 90%, Alphabet has other AI products that are driving growth. It designs its own AI accelerator chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it uses to train and power its LLMs, along with the Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that most of its rivals are using today.\n\n\"Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products, is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said.\nAlphabet has made several important deals recently for its TPUs, which are specialized chips designed for deep learning and inference workloads, in contrast with Nvidia's more general-purpose GPUs. TPUs give Alphabet an edge in AI development, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated and need more of this kind of processing power to deliver the results users want. Alphabet signed a key partnership with Anthropic, which makes the popular Claude LLM, and is rumored to be in talks with Meta to supply it with chips.\nMore in store for 2026 On the Q3 earnings call, management told investors that it expects to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from its previous forecast figure of $85 billion. It also plans a \"significant increase\" in capex in 2026.\nThe results of all this spending are already showing up in accelerated cloud growth, accelerating paid clicks, and higher overall sales, and those trends could get even better next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "BMO Keeps Outperform on Amazon (AMZN), Sees AWS Growth Accelerating\n\nVardah Gill\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:58 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is included among the 12 Best Long Term US Stocks to Buy Now .\nchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash\nOn December 16, BMO Capital raised its price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $304 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating on the stock. The update followed recent calls with two former AWS employees. Those conversations pointed to faster-growing cloud commitments, Claude emerging as a preferred model among developers, and expectations that enterprise AI applications could start scaling in 2027. Based on that feedback, BMO lifted its AWS growth assumption to 24%, up from 23%.\n\nSeparately, Reuters reported that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in discussions about investing in OpenAI. The talks could value the ChatGPT maker at more than $500 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter. Amazon may invest around $10 billion, though the source said the discussions remain fluid and could still change. The talks are private, and neither side has confirmed details.\nThe potential investment underscores how intense demand for computing power has become as companies push to build increasingly advanced AI systems. Several large tech firms have already made major commitments. NVIDIA and Oracle have each signed multi-billion-dollar AI deals with OpenAI this year. In November, OpenAI also agreed to a $38 billion cloud services deal with Amazon.\n\nThese discussions come as OpenAI prepares the groundwork for a possible IPO, which could value the company at as much as $1 trillion, according to an earlier Reuters report.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Amazon (AMZN) Surpasses Market Returns: Some Facts Worth Knowing\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nAmazon (AMZN) closed the most recent trading day at $226.79, moving +2.49% from the previous trading session. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.79%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.38%.\nThe stock of online retailer has fallen by 0.64% in the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 0.48% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Amazon in its upcoming release. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.97, signifying a 5.91% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $211.29 billion, indicating a 12.51% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $7.17 per share and a revenue of $713.67 billion, demonstrating changes of +29.66% and +11.87%, respectively, from the preceding year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Amazon. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.39% increase. As of now, Amazon holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Amazon is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 30.85. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 18.75 of its industry.\n\nOne should further note that AMZN currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.52. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Internet - Commerce stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.44 based on yesterday's closing prices.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 83, placing it within the top 34% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nTo follow AMZN in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

A separate suspension of its manufacturing license for 30 days was put on hold indefinitely.\nTesla Shareholders Approve Musk's $1T Pay Package\nDMV Director Steve Gordon told reporters on Tuesday that the regulator's concern is now focused on the term Autopilot, as Tesla took steps to address concerns around the term Full-Self Driving .\n\nTesla's Autopilot feature helps Tesla vehicles accelerate, brake and stay in lanes on highways, while its Full-Self Driving feature gives vehicles the ability to change lanes and obey traffic signals on city streets.\nThe company is now including the term \"Supervised\" in describing FSD in passenger vehicles. It uses an unsupervised version of the software when moving cars from assembly lines to deliver lots at some of its factories. It also uses FSD for a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with human safety monitors in front passenger seats and remote support.\n\nStory Continues\nReuters contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source: Elon Musk's net worth soars, now more than double his closest rival’s as Tesla stock continues to surge\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Feds pave the way for Big Tech to plug data centers right into power plants in scramble for energy\n\nMARC LEVY\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 12:23 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana .\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania .\n\nStory Continues\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n___\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Jefferies Says IonQ Stock Can Double Over the Next 12 Months. Should You Buy It Here?\n\nAditya Raghunath\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nJefferies just launched coverage of the quantum computing sector with a bullish call, sending IonQ (IONQ) shares surging. The firm slapped a $100 price target on IONQ stock, implying roughly 110% upside from current levels, while initiating with a “Buy” rating.\nIonQ develops trapped-ion quantum computers designed to solve complex problems across business, society, and scientific research. Founded on 25 years of academic research, the company uses ionized atoms to perform longer, more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors than competing quantum systems.\n\nMore News from Barchart Cathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock. Should You?\nIs Cathie Wood Jumping Ship on Tesla Stock?\nBroadcom Stock Is Up 120% in the Past Year. This Analyst Thinks It Is One of the Highest-Quality Stocks to Buy for the Next Year Too.\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nIonQ is the first quantum hardware provider integrated with all major cloud platforms, offering accessible quantum computing through partnerships with Amazon's (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, and Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google Cloud for applications in chemistry, medicine, finance, and logistics optimization.\nAnalyst Kevin Garrigan expects IonQ to benefit from powerful ecosystem tailwinds driving quantum computing adoption. The company's trapped-ion architecture differentiates in coherence, fidelity, and native all-to-all connectivity, technical advantages that matter as the technology matures.\nIonQ's roadmap targets fault-tolerant quantum computing with integrated 256 qubits by 2026, scaling to 10,000 physical qubits and 800 logical qubits in 2027, and ultimately 2 million physical qubits with 80,000 logical qubits by 2030.\n\nIs IONQ Stock a Good Buy Right Now? IonQ delivered a stunning third quarter, solidifying its position as the dominant force in quantum computing. It reported revenue of almost $40 million, beating its guidance by 37% and growing 222% year-over-year (YoY).\nThe Q3 results showcased IonQ's expanding quantum platform strategy, encompassing computing, networking, sensing, and cybersecurity capabilities that no competitor can match.\n\nIonQ's fifth-generation Tempo system achieved an algorithmic qubit score of 64, creating a computational space 36 quadrillion times larger than IBM's (IBM) leading commercial system. More significantly, the company demonstrated a world-record 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity, meaning IonQ has hit every key technical milestone needed for full fault tolerance.\n\n繼續閱讀\nIonQ's acquisition spree is proving transformative. The Oxford Ionics deal closed during the quarter, bringing Electronic Qubit Control technology that leverages standard semiconductor fabrication.\nThis matters enormously because IonQ can now manufacture quantum chips using mature 128-nanometer nodes at existing foundries rather than building custom infrastructure that would cost billions. The bill of materials for a 2-million-qubit machine comes in at under $30 million, much lower than competitors.\n\nVector Atomic's addition expands IonQ's total addressable market into quantum sensing for positioning, navigation, and timing applications critical to defense customers. With quantum key distribution capabilities from the ID Quantique acquisition, IonQ can now bid on massive Golden Dome-style infrastructure projects that require integrated quantum solutions.\nThe business is rapidly globalizing, with international revenue accounting for 30% of total sales, up from nearly zero a year ago. Government and enterprise partnerships validate commercial viability, while the company expands beyond pure compute into quantum networking and sensing applications.\nWhat Is the IONQ Stock Price Target? Guidance for full-year 2025 revenue increased to $106 million to $110 million, breaking historical seasonality patterns as fourth-quarter revenue is expected to exceed the third quarter.\nThe company's 256-qubit system launches in 2026, followed by a roadmap that reaches 80,000 logical qubits by 2030, compared with IBM's stated target of just 2,000 logical qubits by 2033.\n\nAnalysts tracking the quantum computing stock forecast revenue to increase from $108.5 million in 2025 to $746 million in 2029. Despite this significant top-line growth, IONQ is expected to remain unprofitable. Over the next four years, its free cash outflow is projected to surpass $1.2 billion.\nIonQ raised $2 billion in October at $93 per share, bringing the pro forma cash balance to $3.5 billion with zero debt. This war chest positions the company to continue aggressive investment in maintaining what management describes as a five-year technical lead over competitors.\nIONQ stock has been volatile, down about 40% from October highs alongside the broader quantum computing selloff. Yet Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish, with 75% of analysts recommending IonQ.\nOut of the 13 analysts covering IONQ stock, eight recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” and four recommend “Hold.” The average IONQ stock price target is $75.50, above the current price of $47.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "The AI efficiency illusion: why cutting 1.1 million jobs will stifle, not scale, your strategy\n\nKatica Roy\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:23 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nWe are witnessing a false dawn of efficiency. Throughout 2025, corporate America has engaged in a frantic restructuring of the labor market, cutting more than 1.17 million jobs in the first 11 months of the year, a 54% increase from 2024. From the 14,000 corporate cuts at tech giants like Amazon to the nearly 300,000 federal civil service reductions , the narrative driving this contraction is uniform: we are shedding excess labor to make room for the streamlined, high-margin future of artificial intelligence.\n\nBut the data tells a different story. This is not a calculated pivot toward higher productivity. It is a hollowing-out strategy that trades immediate payroll savings for a catastrophic erosion of human capital. By viewing AI as a mechanism for replacement rather than augmentation, leaders are incurring a strategic debt that will erase future value, stifle innovation, and, crucially, institutionalize the kind of algorithmic bias that costs companies billions.\nWe are trying to build the future of work by burning down the infrastructure required to support it.\nThe Mathematics of the Hollowed-Out Workforce The prevailing logic in the C-Suite is a simple subtraction equation: lower headcount plus automated tools equals higher margins. However, this ignores the negative externalities imposed on the workforce that remains.\nWhile companies explicitly cited AI for roughly 55,000 cuts through November , there are far more job losses buried under the umbrella of restructuring, which accounted for over 128,000 job losses. Expert estimates suggest the true automation-influenced displacement is likely above 150,000 . But the real cost isn’t on the severance line item; it is in the collapse of productivity among the survivors.\n\nSeventy-four percent of employees who survive layoffs report a decline in their own productivity, while 77% witness an increase in operational errors . This phenomenon, often called the layoff survivor syndrome , is a drag on performance fueled by anxiety and the erosion of institutional trust. Volatility sends a signal to your top performers: leave before you are pushed out.\nWhen companies cut costs by eliminating human capacity, they don’t get a leaner organization; they get an anxious, risk-averse, and error-prone one. The so-called productivity equation turns negative because the marginal productivity of the retained workforce plummets faster than the payroll costs decline.\nThe Tech-First Trap and the Compliance Gap This productivity collapse is compounded by a fundamental misunderstanding of how AI generates value. While 85% of organizations are increasing their AI investment, only 6% are seeing a payback in under a year.\n\nStory Continues\nThe answer lies in the implementation. A staggering 59% of organizations are taking a technology-first approach, treating AI as a bolt-on solution rather than undertaking organizational redesign. Even more alarming is where the cuts are happening. The 2025 layoffs are disproportionately targeting mid-layer management , including HR, talent acquisition, and compliance roles.\n\nThe result is a growing governance gap. At the exact moment companies are deploying black-box algorithms that require intense oversight, they are firing the overseers. 34% of organizations already expect a shortage in specialist compliance skills. By dismantling these internal guardrails, companies are not streamlining; they are removing the ethical braking systems required to prevent reputational and financial ruin.\nAI is not a replacement for human judgment; it is an accelerator of it. But you cannot accelerate what you have already liquidated.\nThe Equity Penalty Here is where the economic argument becomes inseparable from the equity argument. The hollowing out of 2025 has not been neutral. It has systematically targeted the very demographics that drive financial outperformance.\nThe data reveal a profound asymmetry in risk exposure. Women are significantly more vulnerable to the current wave of automation, with 79% of employed women concentrated in high-risk occupations compared to 58% of men. This differential means women are 1.4 times more exposed to displacement. We see this specifically in the hollowing out of critical pipeline positions that enable women to ascend to leadership.\n\nHowever, the canary in the coal mine for the broader economy is the crisis facing Black women. By November 2025, the unemployment rate for Black women remained at a staggering 7.1%, more than double the 3.4% rate for White women. This was driven by a perfect storm: high exposure to private sector automation combined with the erasure of 300,000 federal jobs , a sector where Black women have historically found stability.\nThe reality on the ground confirms this is a systemic failure, not a skills gap. Keisha Bross, Director of Opportunity, Race and Justice at the NAACP, reports that she has “not seen interventions happening” to support this displaced workforce. The result? At recent NAACP job fairs, 80% of applicants held bachelor’s degrees yet were lining up for same-day interviews for low-wage roles. We are witnessing the hollowing out of the Black middle class in real-time.\n\nLeaders often view these statistics as a social problem. They are wrong. This is a P&L problem.\nThere is a hard, quantitative link between intersectional equity and revenue. Research across more than 4,000 companies in 29 countries shows that for every 10% increase in intersectional gender equity, there is a 1% to 2% increase in revenue. Venture capital data further reinforces this, showing that investments in female-founded startups yield a 63% better return on investment than those with male founders. By allowing layoffs to disproportionately target women and people of color, companies are forfeiting a measurable economic dividend.\nThe Algorithmic Risk Multiplier The financial danger of a homogenous workforce extends directly into the AI models themselves. If your AI team and your data sources lack diversity, your algorithms will be biased. This is no longer a theoretical risk—it is a tangible liability.\nMore than one-third of organizations have already suffered negative impacts from AI bias, with 62% reporting lost revenue and 61% reporting lost customers. The legal doctrine of disparate impact creates massive liability for companies whose algorithms discriminate in hiring or lending, regardless of intent.\n\nThis tension is starkly visible. On one side, we have the nation’s largest civil rights organization, the NAACP, flagging systemic risk. On the other, we have tech giants like Google and Meta , recently crowned Time ’s ‘Person of the Year’ , who landed on the NAACP’s Consumer Advisory List by rolling back the very protections meant to ensure that revolution is equitable. This contradiction is not ideological; it’s economic: alienating a demographic with $1.7 trillion in annual buying power. When you remove the diverse talent capable of spotting bias, and the compliance officers capable of reporting it, you guarantee that your AI products will be flawed, biased, and ultimately, litigated.\nA Framework for Human-Centric ROI To reverse this erosion of value, executives must stop viewing labor as a cost to be minimized and start viewing work design as the primary investment vehicle for AI success.\n1. Governance as a Profit Center AI governance must move from the server room to the Boardroom. Boards must include members with the technical literacy to challenge management on model stability and data quality. We must recognize that responsible AI unlocks value and accelerates development by ensuring reliability.\n2. Redesign: From Automation to Augmentation We must shift our strategy from automation (replacing heads) to augmentation (increasing value). Data shows that job numbers actually grow in AI-exposed fields when companies focus on augmentation. This requires a massive investment in skilling, specifically targeting the non-degree holders who are 3.5 times more likely to lose their jobs .\n\n3. Equity as a Growth Engine Finally, we must embed intersectional equity into the core business strategy. This means using advanced analytics to monitor the talent lifecycle and ensure that restructuring efforts do not decimate the diversity pipeline. It means recognizing that the $12 trillion global economic opportunity of gender equity is only accessible if we actively retain women in the workforce.\n\nThe Choice The 1.17 million layoffs of 2025 represent a fork in the road.\nOne path leads to a hollowed-out future: a short-term spike in cash flow followed by a long-term decline in innovation, a rise in algorithmic liability, and a workforce paralyzed by fear.\nThe other path recognizes that in the age of AI, humanity is the premium asset. It acknowledges that the only way to capture the exponential ROI of automation is to pair it with a diverse, resilient, and empowered human workforce.\nYou can cut your way to a quarterly profit, but you cannot cut your way to the future. True productivity requires us to stop subtracting humans and start solving for the convergence of equity, economics, and engineering.\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune .\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What is Ethereum (ETH)? A Beginner's Guide to the Smart Contract Blockchain\n\nMatt Hussey,Jason Nelson\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:40 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: ETH-USD\n\nBTC-USD\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMETA\n\nEthereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It’s a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts —self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps , that run without banks, governments, or big tech.\n\nWhen programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain —not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games , digital art , and assets worth billions.\nUltimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.\nThis guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin’s big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.\nSmart contracts: Ethereum’s breakthrough The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.\nSmart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.\n\nWho Invented Ethereum? Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.\n\nDevelopment of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\nA crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.\n\nThe network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.\nThe switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.\nIn September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work\nThis shift, known as “ The Merge ,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.\nBlocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.\n\nEther (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether’s sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.\nWhat applications have been built on Ethereum? 👥 Social Networks: Get paid for your posts on social media dapps.\n📁 File Storage: Decentralized file storage at a fraction of the price.\n💸 Overseas Payments: Dramatically reducing the cost of sending cash overseas.\n💳 Payment Cards: Contactless debit card to pay in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n👀 Online advertising: Cutting out the middlemen in online ads. Users get paid directly for watching online advertisements.\n💱 Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) such as Uniswap enable users to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer, without middlemen.\n🏦 Loans: Blockchain-backed loans with no credit checks.\n\nTimeline: Major milestones in Ethereum Late 2013: Vitalik Buterin publishes the Ethereum white paper, introducing the idea of a programmable blockchain.\nMid-2014: Ethereum crowdsale (ICO) sells Ether for Bitcoin to fund development.\nJuly 30, 2015: Ethereum launches with the “Frontier” genesis block.\nSeptember 2015: “Frontier Thawing” update increases gas limits for more stability.\nMarch 2016: Homestead upgrade improves protocol security and usability.\nApril 2016: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund, launches via crowdsale.\nJune 2016: Hackers exploit The DAO and drain roughly $50 million in Ether. Community votes to hard-fork, creating Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\nOctober 2017: Byzantium hard fork enhances performance, privacy, and sets the stage for Proof-of-Stake.\nDecember 2017: CryptoKitties and CryptoPunk NFTs go viral, stressing network capacity and highlighting scalability issues.\nJanuary 2018: ERC-721 NFT standard is introduced, enabling unique digital assets.\nDecember 2020: Beacon Chain launches, beginning Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake.\nMarch 2020: Visa begins settling USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin transactions using Ethereum.\nApril 2021: Berlin hard fork reduces gas costs.\nAugust 2021: London hard fork activates EIP-1559 ; introduces fee burning, reducing inflation.\nSeptember 15, 2022: “The Merge” transitions Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, cutting energy use by more than 99 percent.\nApril 12, 2023: The Shanghai upgrade enables withdrawal of staked Ether from the Beacon Chain.\nMarch 13, 2024: The Dencun upgrade introduces proto-danksharding, a step toward reducing costs and increasing scalability.\nMay 7, 2025: The Pectra upgrade, combining Prague and Electra updates, aims to expand staking flexibility and improve Ethereum’s efficiency.\nDecember 3, 2025: The Fusaka upgrade introduces changes to Ethereum's data availability and block capacity.\n\nEthereum and DAOs One of Ethereum’s most radical innovations was the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts and community votes . Members typically hold tokens that grant them voting power on how the DAO operates and spends its funds.\nThe first major experiment was The DAO in 2016, which sought to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund. Investors pooled Ether, then voted collectively on how to allocate it. The project ended in disaster due to an infamous hack , but it demonstrated the potential of blockchains as platforms for decentralized governance.\n\nWhat Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?\nSince then, DAOs have grown into a vibrant sector. They range from DAO frameworks like Moloch and Aragon , to investment collectives like Syndicate , and governance DAOs such as MakerDAO , which manages a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, to social DAOs that organize communities online.\nSupporters argue that DAOs could redefine corporate governance by replacing traditional hierarchies with code and community control. Critics warn that legal frameworks remain murky, and smart contract vulnerabilities pose risks. Still, DAOs remain one of the clearest examples of Ethereum enabling something that could not exist without it.\nA network tested by crisis If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum is the oil that machines are powered on—but it has not been all smooth sailing.\nEthereum’s first major crisis arrived in 2016 with the DAO hack, when attackers exploited a vulnerability to steal $50 million worth of Ether.\nThe community was split: some argued the blockchain’s ledger should remain immutable, while others pushed to undo the damage. The decision to hard fork created two parallel blockchains—Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nEthereum and the NFT boom Ethereum also fueled the explosion of non-fungible tokens , or NFTs, unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles.\nThe breakthrough came in 2017 with the ERC-721 token standard, which let developers create unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs began to clog the Ethereum network as users spent millions trading CryptoKitties , CryptoPunks , and more, showing both the appeal and the limits of the technology.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\nBy 2021, NFTs had gone mainstream. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for $69 million , and the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched. One of the most prominent NFT collections, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of 10,000 primate-themed NFTs that became a cultural phenomenon, drawing celebrities and selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. At its height, in May 2022, all 10,000 BAYC NFTs collectively were valued over $1 billion.\nEthereum’s smart contracts made this possible by encoding ownership and authenticity directly into the blockchain. The NFT boom exposed Ethereum’s energy inefficiency, accelerating its shift away from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm.\n\nThe race to scale Ethereum’s biggest weakness? Scalability. At about 15 transactions per second, it cannot match Visa’s tens of thousands. That bottleneck has often caused sky-high “gas fees,” or transaction costs.\nTo address this, developers began a years-long upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 . The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, the Berlin and London upgrades in 2021, and the Merge in 2022 marked steps toward a more efficient, Proof-of-Stake network. Later upgrades, including Shanghai in 2023 and Dencun in 2024, tackled staking flexibility and lower transaction costs.\n\nVitalik Wants To Speed Up Ethereum By 100x, Make it as 'Simple as Bitcoin'\nEthereum and the Web3 vision Supporters see Ethereum as the foundation for “Web3”—an internet where users, not corporations, control data, money, and digital identities. Ethereum powers decentralized finance DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations, each of which experiments with alternatives to traditional financial and governance systems.\n\nBut competition looms. Rival networks such as Solana , Cardano , and Polkadot have positioned themselves as faster, cheaper alternatives. Meanwhile, Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum aim to process transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum’s main blockchain, reducing lag time and cost.\nEthereum and privacy In 2025, privacy has become a key focus of the Ethereum project. In November, Vitalik Buterin stated that \"Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene,\" building on a narrative in which he framed it as a fundamental requirement for digital systems such as blockchain platforms.\nEthereum Foundation Launches New Cluster Focused on Privacy\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has followed suit, launching a privacy cluster in October 2025 that includes 47 researchers, coordinators and cryptographers. The Foundation also launched Kohaku, a \"privacy-first\" toolkit for Ethereum, alongside a browser wallet and SDK. Upon its launch, Buterin commented that \"Full-stack privacy and security are first-class priorities in Ethereum.\"\nA decade in, Ethereum is still defining itself As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to test the boundaries of what a blockchain can do. Whether it will deliver on its vision of a decentralized internet—or cede ground to faster competitors—remains an open question.\nWhat’s certain is that Ethereum has already changed how we think about the internet, money, community, and governance.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Comparable used-vehicle sales declined 9% in the third quarter, a larger contraction than the 8.4% drop expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, though still within the company's previously communicated range of an 8% to 12% decline. The performance comes as the broader industry continues to deal with tariff-related cost pressures and signs of softer consumer credit conditions.\n\nWarning!

Interim Chief Executive Officer David McCreight said recent results suggest the business needs change, a message that follows the termination of former CEO William D. Nash at the beginning of December due to slumping sales. Despite the pressure on volumes, earnings came in at 43 cents a share, exceeding both the company's earlier guidance range of 18 to 36 cents and the 38 cents analysts had projected after revising estimates following preliminary disclosures.\n\nShares fell as much as 7% in premarket trading before recovering part of the decline, extending a challenging year in which the stock is down by about half since the start of the year. Investors are also weighing competitive dynamics, with CarMax continuing to lose ground to online-focused rival Carvana and facing potential new competition from Amazon.com, which plans to sell Ford used vehicles on its platform. Together, these developments suggest CarMax's turnaround efforts could remain under close investor scrutiny as management seeks to stabilize performance in an increasingly competitive used-car market.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

JPMorgan's 2026 outlook, backed by new CEO survey data, suggests markets are now recalibrating expectations — shifting focus from AI adoption to whether it actually delivers profits.\nGenAI Fell Short Of CEO Expectations PwC's latest global CEO survey, covering more than 4,700 executives across 109 countries, shows a clear expectation gap. While over 40% of CEOs entered 2025 expecting GenAI to boost revenue and nearly half anticipated a lift in profitability, only about one-third reported meaningful gains in either metric by year-end.

Adoption moved quickly, but translating that into top-line and margin expansion proved harder than forecasts implied.\nFrom Experimentation To ROI Discipline That gap is now changing behavior. JPMorgan notes that boards and CFOs are pressing harder on return on investment, favoring projects with clearer financial outcomes over open-ended experimentation. Growth alone is no longer enough; it needs to come with margin discipline.\nAs a result, valuation frameworks are tightening.

The Delivery Protection Act would rein in abusive last-mile delivery operations by requiring basic licensing, safety standards, and accountability for companies like Amazon.\n\n\"Leaders from both parties across New York City support the Delivery Protection Act, but Speaker Adams has failed the council and the people of New York,\" said Thomas Gesuladi, President of Teamsters Joint Council 16. \"Amazon Teamsters won't let Speaker Adams get in the way of delivering for our workers and our communities. The Delivery Protection Act will become law in New York City.\"\nIntroduced by Councilmember Tiffany Cabán (D-22nd District), the Delivery Protection Act would require companies such as Amazon to directly hire workers at last-mile delivery facilities, making Amazon's abusive third-party Delivery Service Provider (DSP) model illegal in New York City. The legislation would also ensure that delivery companies abide by higher safety standards and are held responsible for the accidents they cause, addressing working conditions that have led to workers in New York City having triple the injury rate compared to the national average.\n\n\"In New York, we pride ourselves on supporting labor, taking care of our families, and protecting our communities. Speaker Adams has failed every worker in this city by choosing to let the Delivery Protection Act stall out during her final term,\" said Vincent Perrone, President of Teamsters Local 804. \"We're calling on the incoming council to pass the Delivery Protection Act expeditiously next year.\"\n\"The Delivery Protection Act is the only way for New York City to hold Amazon accountable for years of union-busting and endangering our communities,\" said Matt Multari, a worker at the DBK1 facility in Woodside, Queens. \"Amazon Teamsters at DBK1 and DBK4 have successfully taken the Delivery Protection Act from obscurity to supermajority support in just a few weeks, and we're confident we'll pass it under new leadership next year.\"\n\nStory Continues\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents over 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

Find the next big opportunity with these 26 smaller AI-focused companies with strong growth potential through early-stage innovation in machine learning, automation, and data intelligence that could fund your retirement.\nWilldan Group Investment Narrative Recap To own Willdan Group, you need to believe that rising U.S. electricity demand, AI-driven data centers and grid modernization will support continued demand for its software and consulting. The recent earnings strength and raised guidance reinforce that the key near term catalyst is large multi year utility and government contracts, while the biggest risk remains policy or budget shifts that could slow funding for efficiency and infrastructure programs. So far, this news appears to support, not change, that balance.\n\nThe acquisition of Alternative Power Generation looks especially relevant here because it expands Willdan’s capabilities in data center infrastructure and AI powered software at a time when utilities are wrestling with large new loads from AI and electrification. That expansion aligns directly with the company’s recent contract wins and raised 2025 revenue guidance, strengthening the case that software and analytics tied to fast growing power demand could be a central driver of future performance.\nYet for all this momentum, investors should still watch how dependent Willdan remains on utility and government funding, because...\nRead the full narrative on Willdan Group (it's free!)\nWilldan Group's narrative projects $867.2 million revenue and $76.9 million earnings by 2028.

And if you ever asked how to get rich , he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \" Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once .\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.\n\nStory Continues\nThat perspective also helps explain why Munger's career did not begin with stocks. Before becoming Buffett's longtime partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a real estate attorney. He understood early on how property, cash flow, and patience could work together over long periods. Real estate was not a side note in his thinking. It was foundational.\n\nFor people trying to apply that lesson today, real estate remains one of the most common ways to build toward that first six-figure milestone. Rental income, equity growth, and long holding periods can create momentum that wages alone often struggle to provide. While not everyone can buy an entire property outright, access to real estate no longer requires that level of capital.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nPlatforms like Arrived offer one example. Arrived allows investors to buy fractional shares of rental home s, giving them exposure to rental income and property appreciation without owning or managing a full property themselves. The best part? All you need is $100 to get started.\n\nFor people working toward their first $100,000, or its inflation-adjusted equivalent, steady real estate income can complement traditional saving and investing strategies.\nMunger never argued that the process was easy. He argued that it was worth it. The discipline required to build that first base — whether through work, saving, investing, or real estate — is the same discipline that keeps wealth intact later on. Once that base exists, compounding has room to operate, and the pressure to constantly scramble begins to fade.\nA financial adviser can help translate those principles into a plan that fits real life, weighing income, risk tolerance, time horizon, and how assets like stocks and real estate should work together. The goal is not to replicate Munger's fortune. It is to apply his logic: reach a solid foundation once, and let time do the rest.\n\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\nRead Next: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

      "Content": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nKO\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Beverage behemoth Coca-Cola is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s longest-held and biggest positions.\nYou know Amazon as an e-commerce powerhouse, but that’s not quite what makes it such a promising long-term prospect.\nGoogle’s parent Alphabet has proven it’s willing and able to successfully build or acquire businesses that expand its digital consumer-facing ecosystem.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nThe end of an era is almost upon us. After 55 years at the helm, at the end of this year, Warren Buffett will be stepping down as Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO and chief stock-picker.\nAnd when he goes, many members of the investment community could find themselves at a loss. Although Berkshire isn't just a mutual fund, plenty of investors took Buffett's lead by copying Berkshire's trades; now the conglomerate's stock picks won't necessarily be Buffett-approved holdings. So, if you want to know for sure that you're following in his footsteps, you'd better act soon.\nTo this end, here's a rundown of three names currently in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio that you not only know the Oracle of Omaha likes well enough to own them, but each of which could safely be bought and held forever.\n1. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) isn't just one of Berkshire's longest-held positions at 19 years. It's also become the conglomerate's third-biggest holding, currently worth $28 billion. That's 10% of Berkshire's entire publicly traded portfolio.\nIt's not hard to see why Buffett's been such a long-term fan of the beverage giant, either. Not only is it the biggest and best-known name in the business, but it's a dividend machine! In addition to paying a dividend like clockwork for decades, The Coca-Cola Company has raised its per-share dividend payment for 63 consecutive years (and counting). This year, Berkshire's 400 million shares of KO will provide Buffett and his lieutenants with more than $200 million in cash. Never even mind the near-200% gain this stock's price alone has produced since Buffett first bought it back in late 2006.\n\nIt's also a great \"forever\" stock for two other reasons. One of these is simply that the world will always need something to drink. With brands like Gold Peak tea, Powerade sports drinks, Minute Maid juices, Dasani water, and, of course, its namesake cola, The Coca-Cola Company has something to offer everyone.\nAnd the other reason this name's got staying power worth buying into? Its sheer size (read \"deep pockets\") -- the drinks giant can afford to outspend its competitors. For perspective, Coca-Cola spent more than $5 billion on advertising last year alone.\n\nStory Continues\nNo, it may not be fair. Investors don't want a fair fight, however. They want the companies they own to have an unfair advantage over their competition.\n2. Amazon Yes, Berkshire Hathaway holds a stake in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . It's not a big stake, mind you -- just 10 million shares currently worth about $2.2 billion. That's less than 1% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\nStill, the fact that he's willing to let Berkshire hold any Amazon at all is noteworthy just because Buffett has typically eschewed such flashy technology stocks, explaining that he doesn't always fully understand their business models. And to be sure, the pick was likely encouraged by Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler, who help oversee the conglomerate's equity holdings.\n\nThe pick also makes much more sense to Buffett now, however, than it would have several years ago.\nWhile Amazon may have been something of an unknown in its infancy (when the internet itself was still young and evolving, and when Buffett was forming his previous opinion on most technology stocks), even he would have to agree that uncertainty no longer applies. E-commerce is clearly here to stay, and Amazon clearly leads at least the U.S. e-commerce market; it isn't doing too badly overseas either. All told, despite its already-massive size, this company's product sales are up more than 8% through the first three quarters of this year. This growth rate accelerated last quarter, too, despite the lethargic economy here and abroad.\nAmazon isn't just e-commerce anymore, either. Although it only accounts for a minority of its revenue, its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, contributes roughly 60% of the company's total operating income. And the cloud computing industry is here to stay as well. Indeed, Straits Research expects the worldwide cloud computing industry to grow from less than $1 trillion this year to nearly $3.7 trillion per year by 2033.\n\nWhat makes this name such a great forever holding, however, is that -- not unlike Berkshire Hathaway itself -- Amazon has proven that it's willing and able to adapt to an ever-changing marketplace of opportunities.\n3. Alphabet Finally, add Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy and hold forever for yourself.\nThere are actually several clear parallels between Berkshire's positions in Amazon and Alphabet. Both are holdings that wouldn't have likely even been considered as potential picks a few years ago, for instance, yet both businesses have clearly solidified in the meantime. Both companies are also flexible; Amazon added cloud computing to its repertoire several years ago and is now turning its online shopping platform into an advertising medium, while Alphabet has moved well beyond its Google search engine with profit centers like YouTube and its own cloud computing service. Berkshire doesn't exactly have a huge stake in either outfit, only holding 17.8 million shares currently worth about $5.5 billion. That's less than 2% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\n\nIt's also a pretty safe bet that this position is the result of prodding from Todd Combs or Ted Weschler.\nWhatever the case, Buffett's pseudo-endorsement of Alphabet serves as a green light of sorts for you, plugging you into the company that still handles 90% of the world's web searches (according to Statcounter).\nThat's not the chief reason Alphabet is such a great long-term bet, though. The biggest and best bullish argument here is a more philosophical one. That's Alphabet's willingness and ability to build or buy a business, anything that allows it to expand its digital ecosystem.\nYouTube is one example; Google acquired it back in 2006. Alphabet's chat-based artificial intelligence platform Gemini is another example, as is 2004's launch of Gmail and 2005's acquisition of mobile operating system Android, which Statcounter says is installed on 72% of the world's mobile devices.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" arm is home to developing self-driving taxi service Waymo and life-science outfit Verily.\nSome of these projects pan out. Others don't. There's a reason, however, that Alphabet has only failed to produce year-over-year quarterly revenue growth once in the past 10 years. That's the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 -- and that was a short-lived headwind. Its profit growth has been almost as persistent. There's no end in sight to this growth streak, either. There's just too much worldwide dependence on Alphabet's offerings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

Should You Too?\n\nNeha Chamaria, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:24 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: VIRT\n\nSMR\n\nAMZN\n\nUNH\n\nKey Points Virtu Financial bought 579,353 shares of NuScale Power valued at nearly $21 million.\nThe new stake represents 1.16% of 13F reportable assets under management.\nThis is Virtu Financial's first SMR purchase, signaling its bullishness on the stock.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nWhat happened According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated Nov. 14, 2025, Virtu Financial LLC established a new position in NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) . The fund reported holding 579,353 shares valued at $20.86 million at the end of the third quarter, representing its first disclosed stake in the company for the period ending Sept. 30, 2025.\n\nWhat else to know This new position in SMR represents 1.16% of Virtu Financial LLC’s $1.79 billion in reportable U.S. equity assets.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNYSE: BRK-A : $224.00 million (12.5% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AMZN : $42.50 million (2.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: UNH : $38.63 million (2.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: LLYVA : $33.61 million (1.9% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: FOX : $32.42 million (1.8% of AUM)\nAs of Nov. 14, 2025, shares of NuScale Power were priced at $22.45, down 9% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.6 percentage points. Shares have fallen further by nearly 30% since.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close 11/14/25)\n$22.45\nMarket Capitalization\n$6.69 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$63.90 million\nNet Income (TTM)\n$-379.94 million\n\nCompany Snapshot NuScale Power is developing modular, light-water reactor nuclear power plants called VOYGR built on NuScale Power Modules. Each module can generate 77 megawatts of electricity, scalable up to 924 megawatt electric capacity.\nThe company generates revenue by designing, developing, and selling modular nuclear reactors and related energy solutions for electricity generation and industrial applications.\n\nNuScale Power develops and sells modular nuclear energy technology, offering scalable reactor solutions designed for electricity generation, district heating, and process heat applications.\nFoolish take It's been a wild ride for NuScale Power stock so far in 2025. Nuclear energy stocks surged after President Donald Trump signed executive orders in the middle of the year, outlining ambitious plans to boost the nuclear energy industry. Plans include support for SMRs, which is also NuScale's specialization.\n\nAlthough NuScale Power is still developing modules, it has an exclusive commercial partnership with ENTRA1 Energy. With ENTRA1 Energy recently securing some contracts, including a contract to deploy up to six gigawatts of nuclear power capacity to the Tennessee Valley Authority across seven states in the U.S., NuScale Power is already locking in some sales.\n\nStory Continues\nNuScale stock, however, has come under selling pressure in recent weeks, mainly on profit-booking across the board. NuScale's large shareholder, Fluor (NYSE:FLR) is also selling its stake in the nuclear energy company to cash in on its investment. That has also contributed to NuScale Power's stock fall. Investors like Virtu Financial, however, saw an opportunity in the dip to buy shares of a company building SMRs amid Trump's aggressive push for nuclear energy.\n\nGlossary 13F reportable assets: Assets that institutional investment managers must disclose quarterly to the SEC, showing their equity holdings.\nAUM (Assets Under Management): The total market value of investments managed by a fund or financial institution.\nPosition: The amount of a particular security or asset held by an investor or fund.\nStake: The ownership interest or share held in a company by an investor or fund.\nQuarterly average pricing: The average price of a security over a specific quarter, used for valuation purposes.\nModular light water reactor: A type of nuclear reactor designed in small, standardized units using ordinary water as coolant and moderator.\nMegawatt: A unit of power equal to one million watts, commonly used to measure electricity generation capacity.\nProcess heat: Heat energy produced for industrial or commercial processes, not just electricity generation.\nVOYGR plant configurations: NuScale's branded modular nuclear power plant setups, offering scalable electricity generation solutions.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

In this video, we break down key findings from Clootrack’s 2026 U.S. Men’s Denim Brand Switching Study, based on Voice-of-Customer (VoC) analysis of 55,287 customer reviews and discussions across major retailers and brand channels.\n\nNEW YORK, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Based on a new Voice of the Customer (VoC) analysis of 55,287 U.S. men’s denim reviews and discussions across Amazon, Target, Walmart, Macy’s and official brand stores (Q4 2022 - Q4 2025), the category appears to be settling around a familiar trio - fit, style and comfort - while loyalty is increasingly decided by something less glamorous: predictability . As brands plan 2026 assortments amid higher return sensitivity and “not as described” frustration, the strongest signal is clear: shoppers reward brands that reduce risk at the moment of purchase.\n\nThe study, conducted by Clootrack , introduces a directional switching momentum view called Net Flux (incoming minus outgoing brand switches expressed in customer language). Net Flux indicates directional movement in preference, not audited sales or market share. In the dataset, American Eagle, Gap and Old Navy showed the strongest net gains.\nFour signals that matter heading into 2026\nFigure 1: U.S. Men’s Denim VoC Theme Map (Category-Level).\nIn figure 1, the bubble chart shows the category’s key experience themes by positivity (%) and volume of opinions .\nClootrack applies a four-level unsupervised theme hierarchy to drill from broad drivers to specific, actionable fixes.\n1) Fit is the top driver - but loyalty is won by predictability.\nFit leads the category conversation (~ 21.8% share) with strong positivity (~ 80.7% ). Customers describe “good fit” in precise terms: leg silhouette control, thigh/seat room, reliable waist fit, more rise/inseam options, and stretch that flexes without losing shape.\n\n2) The loyalty breaker is sizing predictability (not comfort).\nSizing sentiment is low (~ 43.6% positive) and waist fit is similarly low (~ 42.7% ) with growing attention. Shoppers consistently cite the same risk factors: variation across washes/colors, measurement guides that don’t match delivered product, and inconsistent online sizing. In practice, this shows up as churn and returns when shoppers can’t trust what will arrive.\n3) “Trust triggers” are emerging right before checkout.\nTwo smaller themes show outsized impact because they introduce doubt at purchase:\nOdor & Chemical Safety: doubled in prevalence ( +100% ) with very low fulfillment ( 1.19/5 ).\nSustainability & Ethical Considerations: up 150% with low fulfillment ( 2.47/5 ).\nThese signals behave like multipliers when handled credibly — and like trust destroyers when they’re vague or inconsistent.\n\nStory Continues\n4) Product information accuracy is now a measurable performance lever.\nCustomers repeatedly flag mismatches and confusion in key product details (including closure type), alongside function/QC issues. “Truth-in-spec” is increasingly tied to conversion confidence and “not as described” returns.\nSwitching momentum: where preference is moving\n\nUsing Net Flux, Clootrack found American Eagle, Gap and Old Navy gained the most net switchers in the dataset. For Gap specifically, inbound switching was driven by reasons customers cite directly: Fit (41%) , Price (26%) , and Quality (~20%) .\n“What’s different here is connecting switching momentum to the fixable drivers customers explicitly cite - not just what they complain about,” said Shameel Abdulla, CEO of Clootrack.\nFigure 2: Net Flux snapshot\nInflux vs. outflux switching mentions by brand.\nWhat this means for brands\nThe data points to three priorities for 2026 planning:\nMake sizing predictability the loyalty lever.\nMove beyond “fit” as a brand promise and focus on reducing shopper risk - consistency across washes and colors, and measurement guidance that reliably matches what arrives.\nMake durability visible, not implied.\nShoppers increasingly judge denim by concrete failure points (seams, pockets, crotch reinforcement, wash durability). Strengthen those stress areas and communicate durability with a small set of clear, comparable cues.\nTreat “trust cues” as part of the product experience.\nAs odor/chemical concerns and sustainability expectations rise, credibility matters. Tighten claims, clarify product specs on PDP, and remove ambiguity that drives “not as described” frustration and returns.\n\nMethodology at a glance\nDataset: 55,287 U.S. men’s denim reviews and discussions (Q4 2022 - Q4 2025) across major retailers and official brand stores; six leading denim brands in scope.\nPositivity (%): share of positive opinions within a theme.\nFulfillment score (1 - 5): how effectively brands meet the underlying job to be done.\nNet Flux: incoming minus outgoing switches expressed in reviews/discussions; a directional indicator, not audited sales or market share.\nReport availability: Full theme hierarchy, verbatims, and drill-down cuts (persona, price tier, fit type) available on request.\nAbout Clootrack\nClootrack is an AI-powered Voice of the Customer analytics platform with AI Super Agents that help enterprises convert fragmented customer feedback into actions tied to business KPIs such as NPS, churn, returns, revenue, and operational efficiency.

      "Content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms.\nMicrosoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) lost 0.03% over the past five trading sessions after losing 0.27% the five prior. That brings MSFT's year-to-date gain to 13.75%, including a more than 3r4% gain since its year-to-date low on April 8.\nWhen the Magnificent Seven member reported FY 2026 Q1 earnings on Oct. 29, shares fell despite beating on EPS and revenue. The company announced earnings of $3.72 per share versus analysts' expectations of $3.67, and quarterly revenue of $77.67 billion versus analysts' expectations of $75.33 billion.\nOn Oct. 1, the company announced that it was increasing its Xbox Game Pass subscription by 50%. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft saw more than 8% of revenue derived from its gaming segment, which now boasts 50 million monthly active subscribers and nearly $5 billion in YoY revenue.\n\nMicrosoft's decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth.\nWhy Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) AWS.\nIn June, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 39% in FY25 Q4, driven by AI services.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect the company's capex to remain elevated to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth.\n\nTariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year.\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft's AI and cloud momentum.\n\nMicrosoft As a Stock Broadly, 34 Wall Street analysts' remain bullish, with 32 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a \"Buy\" rating, two assigning it a \"Hold\" rating and none assigning it a \"Sell\" rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating. Wall Street's price targets cover a significant range, spanning $500 per share on the low end to $700 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $632.22, which represents 32.78% potential upside from today's share price.\nInstitutional ownership currently stands at 73.74%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\n%Change From Current Price\nLow\n$500\n5.01%\nMedian\n$632.22\n32.17%\nHigh\n$700\n47.02%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s strong Azure revenue growth positions it for cloud and AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger.\n\n24/7 Wall St. ’s year-end price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying upside potential of 18.38% from the stock's current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and FY26 Q1 revenue guidance, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided.

      "Content": "2 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy No Matter What Happens in 2026\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points These two tech leaders had a challenging year but have demonstrated their resilience.\nThey also boast strong prospects and economic moats, making them excellent long-term investments.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nIn 2025, tariff threats and trade wars rocked equities and nearly triggered a full-blown bear market. Despite all that, stocks have performed pretty well this year.\n\nWhat's in store for 2026? Nobody knows. However, some companies can navigate the challenges ahead -- whatever they may be -- and perform well over the long run. These are the kind of businesses that investors want to set their eyes on.\nHere are two excellent, well-known candidates that fit the bill: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . These longtime market beaters are still worth investing in and sticking with next year and beyond.\n1. Amazon Amazon has basically moved sideways this year. The e-commerce specialist is lagging broader equities and most of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers. What's going on with the company?\nThere are several things, and here's one of the most important: Many investors are worried that the company is losing market share to its closest competitors in the cloud computing industry.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) accounts for most of Amazon's operating profits, as it boasts much juicier margins than its e-commerce operations. If it loses ground in this market, Amazon could see slower-growing earnings. That said, Amazon is showing it can perform well, despite this issue.\nDuring the third quarter, the company's sales growth within AWS accelerated, compared to recent quarters, and was stronger than anything investors have seen since 2022. Amazon maintains its lead at the top of the cloud computing industry.\nElsewhere, the company is seeking ways to enhance margins and profits within its e-commerce division. To that end, it has deployed a fleet of industrial robots in its warehouses.\nThe company's goal with this initiative is twofold. First, it will seek to cut costs while making shipping and deliveries faster, thereby improving the customer experience. Amazon's efforts here could help increase its razor-thin margin in its e-commerce division. Even a relatively small improvement may meaningfully boost the company's earnings.\n\nSecond, Amazon has several other potential growth drivers. Its advertising business is going strong, and it's making strides within its healthcare division, thanks to initiatives such as Amazon Pharmacy. And here's the best part: The industries and markets where it dominates still have significant long-term growth prospects.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's the case with e-commerce, which, despite its seeming ubiquity, still captures less than 20% of retail transactions in the U.S. It's also true of cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), which, CEO Andy Jassy has observed, are still in their early innings.\nLastly, Amazon has a wide economic moat due to its brand name, switching costs, and network effects. The company's investment thesis remains intact, despite the headwinds it has faced in 2025.\n\n2. Apple Apple is more exposed to the threat of tariffs than perhaps any of its similarly sized peers. The company still generates most of its sales from its hardware devices, particularly the iPhone, which is manufactured in countries such as China -- a country on which the Trump administration tried to impose steep tariffs.\n\nDespite all that, Apple's shares are up 12% year to date. That's below the performance of the S&P 500 but better than many expected six months ago.\nApple's strength lies in its ability to continue convincing new and existing customers to purchase more iPhones. The company's latest launch, the iPhone 17, was well received and is expected to drive a strong renewal cycle over the next three years, helping to maintain decent sales growth.\nHowever, Apple's hardware business isn't where the company's most important long-term opportunities lie. The company's services segment -- where Apple boasts more than 1 billion paid memberships -- arguably takes that crown. It accounted for a meaningful 39% of its sales, as of the last quarter.\n\nMoreover, the services segment has been growing its revenue, on average, faster than the rest of the business for years, a trend that should continue for the foreseeable future. Since services boast significantly higher margins than hardware sales, Apple's profits should increase meaningfully over the long run as the company expands this segment.\nRevenue from services will rise as Apple's large installed base of devices expands. The company routinely hits new highs in that department. And given the company's high switching costs -- Apple makes it hard to leave its ecosystem -- Apple's installed base should, at the very least, remain stable.\nApple has demonstrated that it can navigate the threat from tariffs, still maintains a solid hardware business, and boasts attractive tailwinds within services. To top it all off, it remains an excellent dividend stock . These are all good reasons to stick with Apple in 2026 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Can NBIS AI Cloud 3.1's Blackwell Ultra Launch Trigger Growth Momentum?\n\nShreya Majumder\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:14 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWV\n\nAMZN\n\nNBIS\n\nAs AI initiatives grow, enterprises face new operational challenges regarding GPU availability across regions, planning capacity for multiple teams and ensuring predictable access to resources. Nebius Group N.V. NBIS is addressing these needs with the launch of Nebius AI Cloud 3.1, the latest release of its full-stack AI cloud platform. Building on the Nebius AI Cloud “Aether\" framework, version 3.1 infuses next-generation NVIDIA NVDA Blackwell Ultra infrastructure, transparent GPU capacity management, expanded AI/ML developer tools and improved enterprise security and compliance features. These updates position Nebius AI Cloud as an ideal platform for enterprises scaling AI workloads in production.\n\nNebius is now rolling out NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra globally, including HGX B300 and GB300 NVL72 systems, becoming the first cloud provider in Europe to run both in production and the first worldwide to deploy GB300 NVL72 with 800 Gbps NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand. Paired with accelerated networking, storage and filesystem scaling, Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 removes AI infrastructure bottlenecks and reinforces its position with top MLPerf Training v5.1 results. Furthermore, version 3.1 introduces Capacity Blocks and a real-time dashboard, providing enterprises with full visibility into reserved GPU capacity across regions. Additionally, project-level quotas and new storage rules enable tighter control over resources and costs.\nBeyond infrastructure and operations, Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 expands its ecosystem to streamline AI development, offering simplified access to NVIDIA BioNeMo NIM microservices for healthcare and life sciences without requiring NGC keys or NVDA AI Enterprise licenses. The release also enhances developer experience with improved Slurm orchestration, FOCUS-compliant billing and a refined console, while strengthening enterprise security with HIPAA-ready audit logs, granular access controls, VPC security groups and Microsoft Entra ID–based IAM for regulated and government workloads.\n\nAs AI models grow larger and more complex, platforms like Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 are poised to play a key role in enabling enterprises to innovate faster, without compromising on performance, governance, or control. While capacity expansion supports NBIS’ revenue outlook, with 2025 guidance now set at $500–$550 million, up from the prior $450-$630 million, near-term risks remain. Power constraints, supply-chain uncertainty and intensifying competition from top players like Amazon AMZN and rivals such as CoreWeave, Inc . CRWV could limit capacity growth and weigh on execution in an increasingly crowded AI infrastructure market.\n\nStory Continues\nRising Rivalry to Cloud NBIS’ AI Infrastructure Growth Path CoreWeave continues to ramp up investments in data centers and server infrastructure to keep pace with the ongoing traction in customer demand. CRWV grew from a niche GPU provider into a leading AI cloud by buying large GPU inventories and carving out relationships with AI labs and companies that need lots of H100/Blackwell-class GPUs. A major force behind its momentum is its multi-billion-dollar agreements with NVDA. Third-quarter highlights include being the first to deploy NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems for large-scale frontier AI workloads and the first to offer NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances, giving CRWV an early lead in real-time AI and simulation workloads.\n\nAmazon is rapidly expanding AWS’ power capacity, doubling what it had in 2022 and on track to double again by 2027. In the fourth quarter alone, it expects to add another 1 GW. The expansion includes power, data centers and chips like AWS’ Trainium and NVIDIA GPUs. AMZN continues to deepen partnerships with NVIDIA, AMD and Intel, placing large chip orders and expanding these relationships over time. Backed by strong security, performance and enterprise focus, AWS continues to dominate major enterprise and government cloud migrations, driving AI demand. To support this, AWS added over 3.8 GW of capacity in the past year, more than any other cloud provider.\nNBIS’ Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Nebius have gained 179% in the past year compared with the Internet – Software and Services industry’s growth of 26.8%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation-wise, Nebius seems overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of F.

      "Content": "Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.: Why the Mag 7 needs to 'recalibrate'\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is concentrated primarily in the top ten technology stocks, according to Barclays.\nPNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati, Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré , and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss the market's concentration in tech and whether it's time for investors to start selling the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat I mentioned at the top about how much concentration risk there is in the S&P 500. What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
