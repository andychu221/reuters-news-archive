      "Content": "4 retail brands that shut down in 2025 — and reboots to come\n\nAlex Daniel\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 12:19 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nTGT\n\nThe American high street faced another reality check in 2025, as some of its most famous names finally called it a day. From the pharmacy counters of Rite Aid to the balloon aisles of Party City, the year saw a wave of bankruptcies.\nMany of these household names were hit by a combination of rising debt and shifting customer habits. As inflation stayed high, shoppers tightened their belts and left specialty shops for online competitors like Amazon or in-person giants like Target. For chains already struggling with high-interest loans and the cost of keeping huge, quiet stores open, the writing was on the wall.\n\nBut as some folded, others showed signs of life. Here are the brands that closed their doors — and the ones eyeing a return.\nForever 21 Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy for the second time in six years in March. The brand was founded in Los Angeles in 1984 and was making more than $4 billion in revenue a year at the height of its popularity with millennials in the early 2010s. It was known for affordable style and had more than 540 stores across the U.S.\n\nAs a generation of teens grew up, the retailer failed to evolve and ended up going bankrupt for the first time in 2019. Then, it was bought out by a group of investors, but the fast fashion giant Temu eventually helped undo the brand.\nIn a court filing, Stephen Coulombe, Forever 21’s co-chief restructuring officer, wrote that it was “materially and negatively impacted” by Shein and Temu’s use of the de minimis exemption, which “undercut” its business. De minimis was a trade loophole that allowed small-value parcels to enter the U.S. without tariffs — until President Donald Trump squashed the rule over the summer. The company also blamed “rising costs, economic challenges impacting our core customers[,] and evolving consumer trends.”\nForever 21 has said its U.S. stores will close permanently as part of the liquidation of its Chapter 11 proceedings, though the brand’s online presence is expected to continue under new operators.\n\nRite Aid For many Americans growing up in the 1990s, a trip to Rite Aid was a familiar part of everyday life, from picking up prescriptions to getting a scoop of its cult-favorite ice cream brand, Thrifty. Founded in 1962 in Pennsylvania, the chain became a ubiquitous pharmacy and drugstore with more than 5,000 locations nationwide at its peak.\n\nBut in 2023 it filed for its first bankruptcy after amassing a debt pile of more than $4 billion. Part of that was down to expensive legal battles over its alleged role in the opioid epidemic. The firm survived via a deal to cut its debt by closing some 500 stores, but it filed again in May 2025. It eventually shut down its final 89 stores in October, shifting millions of prescriptions to former rivals, including Walgreens, Albertsons, and CVS Pharmacy. Meanwhile, Thrifty was sold separately for around $19.2 million to a partnership linked to Monster Beverage executives, meaning the ice cream brand lives on.\n\nStory Continues\nParty City Party City first opened its doors in New Jersey in 1986, selling balloons, streamers, and pretty much anything else you might want for a party. At its height, the retailer operated more than 800 locations across North America and held a dominant 20% share of the U.S. party goods market.\nHowever it too filed for bankruptcy in early 2025, less than two years after a previous attempt to restructure its debt. While a 2023 filing eliminated some debt, the company remained burdened by $800 million in liabilities and a high-interest rate economy. Bosses pointed to a \"perfect storm\" of economic pressures, including a global helium shortage that crippled its balloon business.\n\nRetail giants such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target also eroded its business, alongside seasonal competitor Spirit Halloween, which often moved into neighboring storefronts to grab crucial October revenue. Party City eventually closed down in early 2025, and while the brand was sold on to survive as an online entity, the physical \"balloon walls\" that defined American birthdays for decades vanished.\nJoann Fabric and craft giant Joann eventually unravelled after 82 years in business this year, filing for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2025. Founded in Cleveland in 1943, the retailer had become a cornerstone of American DIY shopping, operating about 800 stores and holding a third of the U.S. sewing supplies market at one stage.\n\nManagement cited \"sluggish sales and constrained inventory levels\" as key drivers, noting that customers were increasingly trading down to cheaper alternatives or avoiding specialty trips altogether. Former CEO Michael Prendergast said the last several years had presented \"significant and lasting challenges\" that the firm’s financial position could not withstand.\nThe company name was eventually rescued by rival Michaels to launch \"Knit & Sew Shop\" sections within its own stores. But DIY enthusiasts have had to say goodbye to the sprawling warehouses that anchored the Joann brand for many years.\nClaire’s, Hooters, and the holdouts It wasn’t all bad news, with some familiar names making nostalgia-driven comebacks . Toys “R” Us has been edging back into shopping centres with physical stores, seasonal holiday sites, and small shop-in-shops at Macy’s.\nClaire’s, a go-to for first piercings and teen accessories for decades, also survived after its most recent bankruptcy — with a rescue deal keeping around 800 stores open, in a recovery many had written off.\n\nHooters also filed for Chapter 11 in early 2025 but has since been bought back by its original founders and franchise partners, who are moving to relaunch the brand with retro updates to servers' uniforms and a menu revamp.\nMeanwhile Bed Bath & Beyond, which closed in 2023, is preparing a return under new ownership, while the likes of Abercrombie & Fitch and Esprit have seen interest pick up again after rebrands. Even shoppers gripped by Amazon have long memories, and established brands can still attract investors looking for a turnaround.\nFor the brands that hit the wall this year, pared-down returns and reboots could yet be in the cards. Retail’s in its zombie era — never say never.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Can Netflix's Content Strength Drive Further Upside in the Stock in 2026?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:49 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NFLX\n\nROKU\n\nAMZN\n\nNetflix 's NFLX 2026 content slate emerges as a critical catalyst for stock performance as the streaming platform seeks to convert programming investments into sustained subscriber growth and engagement gains. NFLX serves globally while maintaining approximately 7% penetration of addressable consumer spending. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 revenues is pegged at $50.99 billion, indicating a 13.08% year-over-year increase, reflecting expectations that the robust content pipeline will drive both subscription and advertising revenue growth.\n\nThe streaming giant's film portfolio anchors the content strategy with high-profile releases including The Rip (Jan. 16), The Animals (March 27), Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man (March 20), APEX (April) and the marquee release Narnia: The Magician's Nephew (December 2026). These theatrical-quality productions aim to drive subscriber engagement during key periods, with expanded content inventory enhancing advertiser appeal as the platform scales its advertising business.\n\nThe breadth of new original series launches positions Netflix to capture diverse audience segments and drive subscriber acquisition momentum throughout 2026, with releases including Star Search (Jan. 20), People We Meet on Vacation (Jan. 9), Run Away Limited Serie s (Jan. 1), His & Hers (Jan. 8), Love Through A Prism (Jan. 15), How To Get To Heaven From Belfast Limited Series (Feb. 1), Cash Queens (Feb. 5), Salvador (Feb. 6), Strangers in the Park (March 6), Sons of Kujo Season 1 (April 2) and TRINITY Season 1 (July 16). Returning series demonstrate Netflix's content strength through established franchise renewals that sustain viewer retention and engagement, including Bridgerton Season 4 Part 1 (Jan. 29), Bridgerton Season 4 Part 2 (Feb. 26), One Piece Season 2 (March 10), Avatar: The Last Airbender Season 2 (second quarter 2026), Beef Season 2 (May), The Lincoln Lawyer Season 4 (Feb. 5), The Night Agent Season 3 (Feb. 19) and Berlin Season 2 (May 15).\n\nWhile the content strength positions Netflix for potential upside, substantial capital allocation requirements and existing debt obligations create financial considerations as elevated content spending pressures operating margins. The platform's ability to leverage its 2026 programming slate into sustained stock appreciation hinges on translating content investments into measurable revenue growth and profitability gains amid intensifying streaming competition.\n\nNetflix faces Intense Competition Netflix faces intense competition from Amazon AMZN and Roku ROKU as all three platforms rely on content to drive streaming hours. Amazon uses Prime Video to strengthen the broader Prime ecosystem. Amazon leans on franchises and live sports to support retention, while monetization is spread across its wider business. Roku follows a lower-cost approach. It combines platform distribution with The Roku Channel and Roku Originals. This keeps Roku’s content spending lighter and more advertising-focused.\n\nStory continues\nNFLX’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of Netflix have declined 27.2% in the past six months compared with the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s decline of 12.8%.\nNFLX’s Past Six-Month Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Netflix appears overvalued, trading at a forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio of 7.83X compared to the broader Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry's forward sales multiple of 4.3X. NFLX carries a Value Score of D.\nNFLX’s Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFLX’s 2026 EPS is pegged at $3.21, up by 2 cents over the past 30 days. This indicates a 26.93% increase from the previous year.\nNetflix, Inc. Price and Consensus Netflix, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Netflix, Inc.

      "Content": "Amazon Eyes $3 Trillion Valuation as AI and AWS Drive 2026 Growth\n\nFaizan Farooque\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:40 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nAmazon ( AMZN , Financials ) wants to be worth $3 trillion by 2026. To get there, it is speeding up its investments in cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence. The corporation is spending $125 billion to make AWS bigger and to develop new processors like Trainium3, which are four times faster than older ones.AWS, Amazon's most lucrative subsidiary, grew by 20% in late 2025 and might increase by 30% in 2026 as it works through a $200 billion backlog of customers. According to analysts, this comeback is the start of a new growth cycle driven by AI workloads and business demand.To save expenses, the corporation is also putting robots and AI-powered quality systems in all of its fulfillment locations. By 2026, analysts think that automation might take over 50,000 manual jobs and save nearly $7.5 billion a year.Analysts are still positive, even if the stock market did worse than other indices in 2025. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI picked Amazon as his best internet stock for 2026. Doug Anmuth of J.P. Morgan also kept his Buy rating with a $305 price target, saying the stock was undervalued and the company was doing well.There are 44 Buys and one Hold on Amazon, which means it is a Strong Buy. Investors are betting on AI, AWS, and automation to drive long-term profit growth, and the average price target of $296.12 suggests that the stock may go up by about 28%.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In the fiscal first quarter, Coty reported mid-single-digit e-commerce sell-out growth across both Prestige and Consumer Beauty, underscoring resilient consumer demand online.\n\nE-commerce now accounts for approximately 20% of Coty’s total sales, with penetration increasing during the quarter. This growth reflects more than channel mix benefits, it signals improved execution. Coty has embedded its digital and e-commerce teams directly within local markets and brand organizations, enabling faster decision-making and tighter omnichannel coordination. This structural shift allows brands to respond more dynamically to local demand patterns, promotions and product launches.\nPartnerships remain a critical lever. Coty continues to build on its long-standing collaboration with Amazon, adding Marc Jacobs to Amazon’s Premium Beauty Marketplace during the quarter. This move expands Coty’s reach in prestige beauty online while maintaining brand positioning and control in a curated digital environment.\n\nImportantly, e-commerce momentum is also supported by early-stage digital innovation. Coty is accelerating AI adoption across content creation, predictive analytics and virtual try-on tools, aiming to enhance the online shopper experience while improving return on digital media spend. While still in ramp-up mode, these initiatives point to e-commerce becoming not just a growth channel, but a testing ground for scalable, data-driven execution.\nOverall, Coty’s mid-single-digit e-commerce growth in the fiscal first quarter highlights the channel’s growing role in consumer engagement, even as it manages near-term retail disruptions in a changing beauty market.\nCoty’s Zacks Rank & Share Price Performance Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 8.4% in the past month against the broader Consumer Staples sector’s 0.1% growth.

Each month, lucky followers will receive high-quality battery-powered home devices as a token of gratitude for their continued trust in Voniko's reliable power solutions. The giveaway launch comes as the Colorado-based company gears up for CES 2026 in Las Vegas, where it will show innovative new packaging and an expanded product line at booth South Hall 1 30538.\n\nThe Voniko Story: Quality Over Quick Profits\nFounded in Brighton, Colorado in 2019, Voniko entered Amazon's fiercely competitive battery marketplace with a clear mission: deliver superior performance through better engineering and materials. While competitors focused on rock-bottom pricing, Voniko invested in premium zinc materials and advanced chemistry to create batteries that truly last longer.\nThe path wasn't easy. For three challenging years, Voniko operated at a loss while competing against low-cost alternatives flooding the market. The temptation to cut corners was constant, but the company remained committed to its quality-first approach.\n\"We could have gone cheap like everyone else,\" said Voniko CEO Edward. \"But we believed that if we stayed true to making genuinely better batteries, customers would eventually notice the difference.\"\n\nThat belief proved prophetic. By 2023, customer loyalty began driving exponential growth. Repeat buyers praised Voniko's remarkable longevity – with alkaline batteries offering 40% longer lasting power compared to competitor brands and lithium batteries delivering 10x longer lasting performance compared to alkaline alternatives. Word-of-mouth recommendations spread rapidly, propelling Voniko into the Top 4 bestselling battery brands on Amazon in the United States.\nFrom Digital Success to Physical Expansion\nToday, Voniko operates as the world's one of the largest primary battery manufacturers with fully automated smart factories across multiple countries delivering 6.5 billion pieces annually. Despite this scale, the company maintains modest profit margins while continuing to outperform regular batteries in stability and quality.\nBuilding on its digital marketplace success, Voniko is now targeting brick-and-mortar retail expansion. In 2025, the company is actively seeking exclusive distribution partners to bring Voniko products into physical stores across America and internationally.\n\nStory Continues\nInnovation and Industry Leadership\nVoniko's commitment to excellence extends beyond manufacturing. As one of five permanent members of the IEC primary battery standards community, the company helps shape industry standards while demonstrating leadership in primary battery technology.\nThe brand's product lineup includes alkaline batteries with proprietary New Zinc Powder technology, lithium batteries with 15+ year shelf life, rechargeable options, and coin cell batteries with 7 year shelf life. Each product category delivers consistent performance backed by complete global certifications and rigorous quality control.\n\nPower That Goes With You\nVoniko's monthly giveaway program represents more than customer appreciation – it reflects the brand's core belief that quality builds lasting relationships. As the company expands from digital dominance to physical retail presence, this customer-first philosophy continues driving growth.\n\"Our journey proves that doing things the right way pays off,\" added CEO Edward.\"These giveaways are our way of saying thank you to the customers who believed in us when we were just starting out.\"\nAbout Voniko®\nFounded in 2019 in Brighton, Colorado, Voniko® is a U.S.-based battery brand known for great value household batteries. The company's mission is to shape the future of batteries, enabling consumers to live life to the fullest by powering everyday moments. Voniko fulfills this promise with their motto: \"Power that goes with you!\"\n\nOperating as the world's primary battery manufacturer, Voniko maintains fully automated smart factories across multiple countries from China to Vietnam, including Ultra Line and Premium Line with an annual production capacity of 6.5 billion pieces.

      "Content": "Warren Buffett is retiring — here's what his favorite indicator reveals about the stock market\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nIt's time for one final check in with the investing GOAT's favorite stock market indicator before he rides off into the sunset.\nBerkshire Hathaway ( BRK-B ) CEO Warren Buffett , 95, will hand over the reins to his hand-picked successor Greg Abel on Wednesday.\nThe official passing of the torch caps a storied career for Buffett, which included buying a major US railroad (Burlington Northern), striking up a friendship with Microsoft ( MSFT ) co-founder Bill Gates, and offering up scores of pithy comments in annual shareholder letters.\n\n“Berkshire’s culture is pretty simple,” Howard Buffett told me in a 2024 episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (listen below). “You do what you say you’re going to do, and you do it when you say you’re going to do it. You’re honest about it. You make mistakes and you accept responsibility for those mistakes.”\nHoward is in line to succeed his father as Berkshire chairman.\n\nThrough it all, Buffett championed the art of value investing, as taught to him by mentor Benjamin Graham. The philosophy is rooted in an unwillingness to overpay for investments.\nThe \"Buffett Indicator\" takes the Wilshire 5000 Index (viewed as the total stock market) and divides it by the annual US GDP. It rose to fame following a 2001 Fortune Magazine article written by Buffett and longtime Fortune writer and Buffett insider Carol Loomis.\n\n\"The ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know,\" Buffett explained in the article. \"Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.\"\nThe indicator is at valuation levels never seen before, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. It suggests that stocks are long overdue for a healthy pullback in early 2026.\nPicking apart the numbers, the Buffett Indicator stands at about 221.4% — up a sharp 22% from April 30, per data from GuruFocus. The indicator has never been at a higher level dating back to the earliest data from GuruFocus in 1970.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) has shot up nearly 17% on the year amid major optimism surrounding the earnings potential of AI-related companies and the effect the technology will have on profits. Analysts in turn have scrambled to upwardly revise their profit forecasts on companies, supporting higher stock prices.\nFor his part, Buffett has bet on the AI future by maintaining stock investments in Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), and more recently, Alphabet ( GOOGL ).\nWherever the stock market goes from here, one thing can't be questioned: Buffett's impact on investing.\n\nStory Continues\n\"I think Warren Buffett's the GOAT of capitalism,\" Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan told me on Opening Bid (video above) in October. \"There's so much guidance and wisdom that we've had from Warren over the years.\"\nBerkshire purchased Brooks in 2006. Each year at the storied Berkshire annual shareholder meeting, Brooks makes special edition sneakers with the face of Buffett as well as his longtime business partner Charlie Munger .\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nTuttle Capital Management Launches the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\n\nNewsfile\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:02 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: CBOE\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nGreenwich, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - December 30, 2025) - Tuttle Capital Management, a leading provider of thematic and alternatives ETFs, today announced the launch of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (CBOE: MAGO) , now trading on the CBOE.\nMAGO is an actively managed exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the equity performance of the \"Magnificent 7\" - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - using an options 1 -based strategy designed to harvest option premium while maintaining equity-like exposure to these market-defining companies.\n\nThe fund combines direct exposure to the Magnificent 7 with a systematic put-spread 2 program implemented with listed options and FLEX Options® 3 to potentially generate income. The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing. For a prospectus with this and other information about the fund, please call (833) 759-6110 or visit the Fund's website.\n\nDistributor: Foreside Fund Services, LLC\nMedia Contact:\nMatthew Tuttle\nTuttle Capital Management\nmtuttle@tuttlecap.com\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/279159\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Here’s what you should know about the US TikTok deal\n\nLauren Forristal\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nWMT\n\nAMZN\n\nAPP\n\nTikTok , owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government.\nAs a result, U.S. users have often found themselves caught in the middle of this tension. Earlier this year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February.\n\nA number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle is finally over. As of last week , TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors.\nThis comes nearly three months after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approves the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group.\nA week prior, President Trump announced that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.\nWho owns TikTok in the U.S.? According to a memo viewed by TechCrunch, the investor group consists of Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX. Collectively, they will hold 45% of the U.S. operation, with ByteDance keeping nearly a 20% stake. Axios first reported the news, citing sources who estimate TikTok U.S. is valued at approximately $14 billion—a figure also mentioned by Vice President JD Vance.\n\nIn September, a report indicated that a “framework” deal was established between the U.S. and China, with a consortium of investors— including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz—overseeing TikTok’s U.S. operations. These investors were expected to hold an 80% stake, and the remaining shares would belong to Chinese stakeholders.\nThe newly formed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” will oversee the app’s operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.\nOracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to the memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.\nA White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain.\n\nStory Continues\nByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok’s U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.\n​The deal is scheduled to close on January 22, 2026.\nWhat users in the U.S. should know Reports from Bloomberg indicate that when the deal is finalized, the TikTok app will be discontinued in the U.S. and users will need to transition to a new platform. However, the specifics of this platform remain largely unclear, including its features and how it will differ from the original app.\nHow did we get here? To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\nThe drama first began in August 2020 , when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\n\nA month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.\nIn response, TikTok sued the U.S. government , challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\n\nFast-forward to today: Trump has had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\nThere have been several contenders, including The People’s Bid for TikTok , a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt . This group has the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian , TV personality and investor Kevin O’Leary , inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.\nAnother group, called the American Investor Consortium, is led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki , Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast .\nOthers in the running included Amazon , AppLovin , Microsoft , Perplexity AI , Rumble , Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick , and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\nThe story has been updated after publication.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

( NVDA , Financials ) investing $20 billion in AI inference business Groq shows its desire to dominate the AI ecosystem. Groq may continue operating independently while Nvidia uses its inference tools thanks to its founder Jonathan Ross and several engineers.Nvidia's planned diversification beyond AI training hardware is shown by the deal. Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPUs fuel most large-scale model training, but the company is now targeting inference, which has a far larger and recurring revenue potential.Over 90% of the AI GPU market is Nvidia. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq protects market dominance and adds software and service income streams while Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft construct their own inference processors to save costs.AI applications increase inference workloads considerably. AI token usage at major tech businesses increases every few months, fueling inference hardware and platform demand, say analysts. Beyond inference, Nvidia is entering networking, robotics, and government. Last quarter, networking sales surged 162% to $8.2 billion, while automotive and professional visualization grew double digits.Nvidia's Strong Buy consensus has 39 Buys and one Hold rating with an average price target of $263.58, implying 40% upside over a year.

Companies with dominant positions, expanding profit engines, and long growth runways tend to reward patient investors. That’s what makes these two smartest stocks stand out.\n\nSmart Stock #1: Amazon (AMZN) When it comes to long-term compounders, few companies check as many boxes as Amazon (AMZN). The stock has returned a whopping 9,763% over the last 20 years. With its cloud division reaccelerating on the back of artificial intelligence (AI) demand, a high-margin advertising business scaling rapidly, and a retail ecosystem that continues to dominate on selection, price, and speed, Amazon is no longer just a growth story.\n\nMore News from Barchart Micron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMicron Stock Stole the Show in 2025. Options Data Says It Will Trade at These Levels in 2026.\nQuantumScape Gained 100% in 2025 and Is Set to Generate Revenue for the First Time in 2025. Options Data Suggests You Should Play QS Stock Like This for 2026.\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nThe crown jewel remains Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS revenue increased 20.2% year-on-year (YoY) to $33 billion in the most recent third quarter, the quickest pace in 11 quarters, bringing the annualized run rate to $132 billion. Backlog increased to $200 billion by the end of the quarter, excluding several large deals signed after the quarter, indicating that demand will remain strong well into the future. AWS operational income increased to $11.4 billion, indicating both scale and efficiency.\n\nAmazon is making substantial investments to meet AI-driven cloud demand. Over the last 12 months, AWS has added more than 3.8 gigawatts of electrical capacity, tripling its footprint since 2022 and on track to double again by 2027. Custom silicon, such as Trainium, has become a multibillion-dollar company, expanding 150% quarter after quarter, while Bedrock is being developed into what management expects could someday rival EC2.\nAside from AWS, Amazon's retail division continues to scale smoothly. Revenue in North America increased by 11% YoY, while overseas revenue increased by 10%, and paid unit growth reached 11%. Faster delivery, same-day grocery growth, and AI-powered shopping tools are all driving more engagement and conversion. Meanwhile, advertising income increased by 22% YoY to $17.7 billion, benefiting from Amazon's full-funnel ad ecosystem and new partnerships.\n\nStory Continues\nTotal revenue for the quarter totaled $180.2 billion, up 12% YoY, while adjusted earnings increased 36.4% to $1.95 per share. Importantly, trailing twelve-month free cash flow increased to $14.8 billion, indicating improved cash generation across the business. Amazon intends to spend approximately $125 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, with spending projected to increase in 2026, mostly to support AI, cloud infrastructure, and logistics. While margins may fluctuate, management is committed to long-term returns on invested capital and continuous customer value creation.\n\nAnalysts expect that Amazon's earnings will climb by 29.6% in 2025, followed by an increase of 9.5% in 2026. Amazon's reaccelerating AWS growth, AI leadership, growing cash flow, and robust core businesses make it one of the best companies to own through 2026 and beyond.\nIs AMZN Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell on Wall Street? Overall, AMZN stock is rated a “Strong Buy” on Wall Street. Of the 56 analysts covering the stock, 49 have given it a “Strong Buy” rating, five recommend a “Moderate Buy,” and two say it is a “Hold.” The average target price is $295.80, indicating a potential upside of 27% from its current price. Additionally, the highest target price of $360 suggests the stock could rise by as much as 55% over the next 12 months.\nSmart Stock #2: Alphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) is the second company on my list that clearly stands out as a solid long-term investment for 2026 and beyond, thanks to its solid fundamentals, expanding profitability, and deep leadership in AI, cloud computing, and digital platforms. GOOGL stock has returned 730% over the last decade.\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet recorded its first-ever $100 billion-plus quarter, with revenue of $102.3 billion, up 16% YoY. Just five years ago, quarterly revenue stood at $50 billion, underscoring how rapidly the business has scaled. The company saw double-digit increases in Search, YouTube, subscriptions, smartphones, and Google Cloud, indicating solid execution across the entire business.\n\nAI is increasingly driving real business results across Alphabet. The company's Gemini models currently process billions of tokens every minute via APIs, and the Gemini app has well over 650 million monthly active users. Token processing has increased more than 20-fold across all Google surfaces year after year, showing AI's expanding significance in how consumers search, create, and engage online.\nGoogle Cloud remains a solid growth driver. Cloud revenue increased 34% YoY to $15.2 billion, while operating income increased 85% to $3.6 billion, resulting in operating margins of 23.7%. The cloud backlog increased to $155 billion, up 46% sequentially, thanks to high demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, proprietary TPUs, and generative AI solutions built on Gemini. Notably, Alphabet closed more billion-dollar cloud deals in the first nine months of 2025 than in the past two years combined.\n\nFinancially, Alphabet remains exceptionally strong. The company generated $24.5 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $73.6 billion over the trailing twelve months, ending the period with nearly $100 billion in cash and marketable securities. While capital expenditures are rising sharply to support AI infrastructure, management views these investments as critical to long-term value creation, with 2026 expected to see even higher spending.\nAnalysts predict Alphabet’s earnings to increase by 31.6% in 2025, followed by another 4.3% in 2026. All in all, Alphabet’s leadership in AI, rapidly expanding cloud profitability, durable advertising engine, and massive financial flexibility position it as one of the smartest stocks investors can hold into 2026 and beyond.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell on Wall Street? Overall, on Wall Street, GOOGL stock is a “Strong Buy.” Of the 54 analysts covering the stock, 43 rate it a “Strong Buy,” four say it is a “Moderate Buy,” and seven rate it a “Hold.” The stock’s average target price of $329.79 indicates the stock can rally another 5.2% from current levels. Plus, its high price estimate of $400 suggests the stock has an upside potential of 27.6% over the next 12 months.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "‘You Had to Be Brave’: Wall Street Remembers a Wild 2025\n\nMatthew Griffin\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 10 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\n^NDX\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Jed Ellerbroek barely slept.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nIt was the evening of Wednesday, April 2, and President Donald Trump had just appeared in the White House Rose Garden, brandishing a large placard with the punitive tariff rates he was slapping on countries around the world. On Wall Street, it quickly sunk in that Trump was serious about shattering a global trading system that he said was wired against the US.\nOver dinner with his family and throughout the night — as Asian markets tumbled, initiating a meltdown that would continue around the globe — Ellerbroek, a portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, tried to game out what would happen next.\nWhen he and his team hunkered down the next morning at their office in St. Louis, they sought to work through the implications for their stock holdings. As the selloff raged that day, Amazon.com Inc. — their largest position — tumbled nearly 10%.\nLike investors from Tokyo to New York, Ellerbroek was getting a frantic crash course in navigating what would be an unusually volatile year. The S&P 500 Index careened to the cusp of a bear market. Then sentiment reversed almost as quickly, unleashing one of the swiftest stock recoveries in decades and sending the benchmark back to new record highs. The overall lesson was that not panicking — or taking the leap to buy the dips — paid off.\n\nThe twists and turns of the US economy and the artificial-intelligence boom both played a role. But much of it could be traced to the White House.\n“Volatility is a feature, not a bug,” Irene Tunkel, chief US equity strategist at BCA Research, said of the Trump administration’s effect on markets. “This year rewarded people who were very nimble, very humble and were very willing to incorporate new information.”\nAlso, she said: “You had to be brave.”\nHere are some recollections from money managers and strategists about how they navigated the most pivotal market moments of 2025:\nJan. 27: DeepSeek\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen on Jan. 26 called it “AI’s Sputnik moment.” The rollout of a powerful, seemingly low-cost AI program by DeepSeek, a Chinese upstart, appeared to threaten the foundations of the recent US tech boom. When US markets opened the next day — a Monday — Nvidia Corp. shares plunged 17%, erasing nearly $600 billion from its value in the largest wipeout in market history. Semiconductor stocks had the worst day since March 2020.\n\nNancy Tengler, the head of Laffer Tengler Investments Inc., said her heart raced as she scrolled her phone, trying to catch up with the news while in the car on her way to CNBC for a television interview. As the details became clear, she said her reaction was, “This is an opportunity.”\n\nStory Continues\nLike some others, she was skeptical of DeepSeek, thinking it had low-balled its cost estimates. She struck a bullish tone toward tech stocks in her TV appearance. Her firm snapped up shares of Nvidia and other AI favorites.\nIt turned out to be a good call. DeepSeek didn’t sound the death-knell of the American approach to AI or stanch the flood of big-tech spending to develop the technology. The Nasdaq 100 Index was back at a record high within a month and went on to a 21% gain in 2025. Nvidia is up 40% this year.\n\nApril 2: ‘Liberation Day’\nGarrett Melson’s first reaction was shock. Then in the coming hours, as markets tumbled and social-media users tried to piece together what exactly Trump had just done, the fleeting relief of gallows humor: Trump’s trade war, as was soon caught, had gone so far as to penalize uninhabited islands near Antarctica that are populated by penguins.\n“Watching a sea of red on your screen, sometimes you have to laugh a little bit,” said Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.\nIt was the biggest two-day jolt to global markets since March 2020, when the pandemic started shutting down the US. It set off days of panicked selling when China retaliated, recession fears flared, and Treasuries slid — breaking from their typical haven role — as Trump’s willingness to challenge the global economic order cast doubt on the safety of US government debt.\n\nIn the days after the president’s announcement, Melson worked with his colleagues late into the evening and during the weekend running analyses, staring at charts and cranking out commentary for clients. In one portfolio model, the team increased its allocation to US stocks and corporate bonds.\nAt Argent, Ellerbroek sent an email to the investment team on April 4. “This is a scary moment,” he wrote. “If you made me pick whether we are closer to the start or finish of this episode, I’d probably say start.” Ellerbroek stuck to his positions, deciding against snapping up beaten-down stocks because there was simply too much uncertainty.\nNeil Sutherland, a fixed-income investor at Schroder Investment Management, and his colleagues started a project to track the fallout. They updated the average US tariff rate on affected countries as Trump kept rolling out new salvos, modeling the asset-price implications and relaying their findings to anxious clients. Eventually, they gave up.\n\n“It just honestly became meaningless because it would change in the space of five minutes,” Sutherland said. “We just had to come to realize that it’s a moving target.”\nApril 9: The Tariff Pause\nTunkel, the BCA stock strategist, had taken the day off to hunt for a house in Boca Raton, Florida. It had been a relatively quiet day for stocks, with the S&P 500 drifting sideways. But she stayed tuned to the radio during the three-hour drive from her home in Venice, on the Gulf Coast.\nThen, when she stopped for lunch and tuned out, the fear that descended on Wall Street days earlier quickly gave way to euphoria. At 1:18 p.m., after the bond-market selloff raised fears in Washington by pushing interest rates higher, Trump announced he was pausing many of his tariffs for 90 days. The S&P 500 surged 7% in less than 10 minutes and went on to a 9.5% gain — its biggest one-day jump since October 2008.\n\n“This magnitude of the moves in response to the piece of news — I think this is something that is historical,” Tunkel said. “We’ll always remember those moments.”\nJay Woods, the chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, saw the moment firsthand from his perch at the New York Stock Exchange. After the initial roar faded, he prepared to welcome a group of visitors. He was teaching a class in technical analysis at Fordham University. By chance, he had scheduled a field trip for his students to visit.\nBy the time they arrived, the Big Board was a sea of green — nearly everything up, with the so-called fear gauge, the VIX, one of the few exceptions. Alerts rang out constantly from brokers’ desks, including some with the ring of a cash register’s chime.\n\nThe day set up a dynamic that would occur repeatedly over the next several months and came to be known as the TACO trade, short for Trump Always Chickens Out. Traders started to discount his worst tariff threats, wagering they were only a negotiating tactic. Selloffs, therefore, were buying opportunities.\nChase Games, one of Woods’ students, was sucked in by the excitement. Visiting the exchange was “obviously a huge dream of mine,” said Games. “I lucked out.” In October, he started working as an intern at Woods’ firm, Freedom Capital.\nJune 21: Bombing of Iran\nIt was a Saturday evening in New Jersey, and Siebert Financial’s Mark Malek was celebrating his recent birthday when he learned the US had bombed Iran’s nuclear sites, a move that traders feared could dangerously escalate the conflicts in the Middle East.\n\n“If this is true, my phone is going to ring,” Malek told his family at the French restaurant in Asbury Park. Soon enough it did.\nFor all the risks, Malek wagered — counterintuitively — that stocks would rise. The S&P 500 had already pulled back recently as traders started fretting about a widening conflict between Israel and Iran. But he thought the US wouldn’t escalate the conflict from there and the market’s reaction would ultimately be relief.\nSure enough, the S&P 500 advanced roughly 1% on Monday — and then again on Tuesday — as Trump moved toward a ceasefire. It went on to end the week at another record high.\nOct. 10: Crypto Dives\n“What is going on?” Jeff Dorman thought as crypto markets nosedived. Trump had threatened an additional 100% tariff on China and traders were dumping risk assets. And Bitcoin, which had recently pushed over $125,000, was sliding as leveraged bets were unwound.\n\nMessages on Slack piled up at Arca, a crypto asset manager where Dorman is chief investment officer. He was at home, but soon he and his team were on a Zoom call. They made a plan to cover short positions by snapping up assets that had tumbled.\nIn their early days investing together, it would have taken them all night. After years of experience, they’d learned to draw up a plan and leave the execution to their traders. The CIO took stock of the situation, went to bed and “slept like a baby.”\nDorman remains bullish on segments of the crypto sector. Still, the moment, for now, has deflated the euphoria for crypto that swept through markets for much of the year as Trump championed the industry.\nIt also has bucked the buy-the-dip formula that’s paid off elsewhere in 2025. Bitcoin is heading to its first annual drop since the 2022 crash, and other popular cryptocurrencies have tumbled over the past two months. That has hammered crypto-linked shares like the stockpiler Strategy Inc. and the Trump-family-affiliated American Bitcoin Corp.\n\nNov. 21: Year-End ‘Sigh of Relief’\nIt had looked like the retreat from risk was poised to drag down the broader stock market, too, as worries about frothy AI valuations and the Federal Reserve’s rate-cut path weighed on the S&P 500.\nThe worries didn’t last. On Nov. 21, stocks started bouncing back on anticipation that the cooling labor market would prod the Fed to continue easing monetary policy, as it did when it met on Dec. 10.\nMeanwhile, the economy has kept on defying recession fears despite Trump’s trade war, federal-employee job cuts and a Congressional standoff that caused a record-long government shutdown. The AI boom, for all the bubble talk, hasn’t turned to bust. And whomever Trump picks to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell next year is seen as likely to back Trump’s push for even faster rate cuts.\n\nThat has sowed a late-year sense of optimism heading into 2026. After this year’s gains stung anybody who stuck to bearish calls, Wall Street strategists are anticipating that the S&P 500 will rise for a fourth straight year. If they’re right, that would be the longest winning streak in nearly two decades.\n“Overall,” Freedom Capital’s Woods said, “there’s a sigh of relief that we’ve gotten through some of the biggest waves that were thrown at this market.”\n--With assistance from Olga Kharif, Ye Xie, Carter Johnson, Alexandra Semenova, Michael MacKenzie and Yvonne Yue Li.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nJapan’s Viral Horse-Racing Video Game Has Players Flocking to Real-Life Stables\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nThe United States of Klarna\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Amazon backs Flowers Foods at SCOTUS on delivery driver legal status\n\nJohn Kingston\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: FLO\n\nAMZN\n\nBeyond Flowers Foods itself, there may not be a company with as much at stake in the commercial baker’s case before the Supreme Court than Amazon.\nThat’s why the logistics and online retailer’s amicus brief in the Flowers Foods case, submitted earlier this month, stands out among several other filings in support of the core of Flowers Foods’ argument: that final mile workers fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) because the FAA’s exemption for transportation workers involved in interstate commerce should not apply to workers who never cross states lines in their activities.\n\nThe opposite of that finding was handed down by the 10th Circuit in the case of Brock vs. Flowers Foods. In that case, delivery drivers who transport such Flowers Foods products as Tastykakes and Wonder Bread were found by that circuit to be at the tail end of an interstate commerce supply chain and therefore fell under the exemption. That gives them the right to have their grievances aired in the legal system instead of an arbitration process.\nEmployers almost always favor arbitration; employees the opposite.\nConflicts in the circuits But there are decisions in the federal circuit courts that have ruled differently than the 10th Circuit, leading the Supreme Court to accept Flowers Foods’ petition for certiorari , presumably with the aim of straightening out the confusion.\nAmicus briefs filed in support of Flowers Foods’ (NYSE: FLO) argument featured several significant names besides Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . Among the filers in support of Flowers Foods were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Independent Bakers Association and five states that jointly filed an amicus brief: Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, Montana and Alaska.\n\nThe transportation exemption in the FAA says the act does not apply to “contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.” Although it does not say “transportation” in the final clause, courts have interpreted it as a transportation exemption.\nFlowers Foods already has been before the Supreme Court on the question of its bakery drivers’ legal status under the FAA. Last year, the Court rejected Flower Foods’ argument in a case known as Bisonette that its delivery drivers were actually bakery workers rather than transportation workers. If they were found to be bakery workers, the FAA would have applied in settling disputes. But the unanimous decision held that they were transportation workers.\n\nThe current case before the Supreme Court–the original named plaintiff was Angelo Brock, who was an independent contractor operating a route for Flowers Foods–is essentially part two of this dispute. Since the court already determined that bakery drivers are transportation employees and not bakery workers, the question is whether the FAA transportation exemption applies if the transportation workers never cross state lines.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is the real definition of interstate? In the opening paragraph of its brief, Amazon said that its local delivery services “characteristically take place wholly within a state.” It also notes that its various independently-owned delivery companies, like the Delivery Service Partners (DSPs) who ply the nation’s roads in their grey vehicles, or their Amazon Flex companies that often drive anything down to a car that could be 20 years old, pick up those goods for delivery at the end of a supply chain that in most cases did cross state lines at some point.\n\nAmazon comes down on the side that Brock and his co-plaintiffs are not engaged in interstate commerce and therefore not covered by the exception.\n“Congress designed a much simpler inquiry for the FAA exemption, and it is the inquiry this Court has identified: Does the relevant class of workers actively and directly engage in the transportation of goods across national or state borders, like seamen and railroad employees?” Amazon writes in its brief. “For local delivery drivers like Mr. Brock, who neither transport goods across borders nor interact with the vehicles and distinct classes of workers that actually do, the answer to that question is no.”\nBrock and the plaintiff’s supporters, Amazon writes, “fixate on the company’s objectives, like goods across state lines or completing transactions with customers in different states. But neither the transit history of the delivered goods nor the geographic scope of the company’s transactions affects what Mr. Brock and similar delivery drivers actually do.”\n\nA continuous journey A phrase from earlier decisions is whether the final mile is part of a “continuous interstate journey.” The 10th Circuit decision now before the Supreme Court said it was “convinced that Brock serves as the last-mile driver for Flowers, such that he is directly engaged in interstate commerce. Brock’s intrastate delivery route forms the last leg of the products’ continuous interstate route.”\n\nIn Amazon’s view, the courts that have made such a finding set a precedent that has “seen endless litigation and generated a massive body of decisions that reach arbitrary and inconsistent results.”\nThere are frequent references in the Amazon brief, and in others, to two cases that touch on the question of worker status under FAA. One is Bisonette, which after finding the bakery route drivers were in the transportation business and not the bakery business gave them the right to pursue grievances in court rather than arbitration.\nThe other is Southwest Airlines vs. Saxon. That 2022 Supreme Court decision found that a group of airline ground employees fell under the transportation exemption in the FAA even though all their work was done at one site.\n\nBut even as Amazon made references to those cases, it found differences between the workers in Bisonette and Saxon and the final mile delivery drivers in Brock. “The Saxon test requires more than merely playing a role in the sale and disposition of such products,” the Amazon brief said, citing precedents that dismissed the idea that pet shop employees or grocery store clerks “who move products onto and off of shelves, bag up customers’ purchases, and even wheel shopping carts out to their cars” could be considered part of an interstate commerce supply chain.\n“Helping interstate goods reach their ultimate destination does not make a class of workers actively engaged in those goods’ transportation across borders,” the Amazon brief says, again citing language in precedents.\n\nThe Saxon decision, Amazon says, “squarely rejected an employer-centered analysis,” that just because the employer is involved in interstate commerce that status cascades down the line to other economic activities conducted by the employer.\n“It is especially inappropriate to graft a transaction-based standard onto the FAA exemption when Congress made no mention of transactions in that provision,” the Amazon brief says.\nNot surprisingly, Amazon has particular disdain for the phrase “continuous interstate journey.” The brief reviews the many steps needed to get a product into a customer’s hands, including the very real possibility that it originated in a different state from the final delivery point.\nEven if that is the case, when the final delivery is made by an Amazon delivery service provider or Amazon Flex worker, the “transportation happened several steps, several different vehicles, and several classes of workers earlier. The local delivery work is the same regardless of the package’s place of origin.”\n\n“Under a ‘continuous interstate journey’ standard, however, the location of the original warehouse at the time the customer clicks ‘Buy Now’ may make all the difference,” the Amazon brief says. “If the customer’s item is in the same state as the customer, the Delivery Partner’s in-state delivery should not trigger the exemption. If the item is in a different state, it might.”\nAmazon wraps up its brief by saying that “the guiding consideration is what the relevant class of workers is doing, not what the business is doing. When workers neither transport goods across state lines nor interact with the vehicles that do so, they have no direct and active role in the cross-border transportation within the meaning of (the FAA).”\nFAA was at issue in New Prime case The question of status under the FAA led to a significant decision impacting long-haul trucking: New Prime vs. Oliveira in 2019 . In that case, the Supreme Court found that just because a truck driver is an independent contractor, he or she still is covered by the FAA in determining whether a dispute needs to go to arbitration or can be litigated in court. Arbitration in that case could not be forced under the terms of the FAA because the driver was engaged in interstate commerce. The independent contractor status did not negate the driver’s standing under the FAA.\n\nThe attorney who filed the brief for Amazon is Michael Kenneally. He had been a law clerk for Neil Gorsuch on the 10th Circuit (the same circuit as the Flowers Foods decision) and a Supreme Court clerk for Samuel Alito as well as the late Antonin Scalia.\nBoth Alito and Gorsuch will be hearing the Flowers Foods case though Kenneally will not be arguing it, having only filed an amicus brief.\nMore articles by John Kingston\nLove’s factoring business gets bigger, buying trio of companies\nNew York City bill that targeted Amazon won’t get taken up in 2025\nBenesch panelists: Why 2026 could be a strong year for logistics M&A\nThe post Amazon backs Flowers Foods at SCOTUS on delivery driver legal status appeared first on FreightWaves .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Jeff Bezos Moved To Florida And That Impacted Washington State Budget, Says Ron DeSantis: 'States With No Income Tax Have A Major Advantage...'\n\nVishaal Sanjay\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said that Washington state’s fiscal outlook took a significant hit after Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) founder Jeff Bezos relocated from the state to Florida in late 2023.\n\nTaxpayers ‘Flee’ Due To Bad Policies On Sunday, in a post on X, DeSantis said that the state of Washington had “lost its biggest taxpayer,” referring to Bezos’ recent move to Florida.\nAccording to DeSantis, this single relocation of a billionaire entrepreneur has resulted in “a major impact” on Washington’s state budget.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\nFrom Moxy Hotels to $12B in Real Estate — The Firm Behind NYC's Trendiest Properties Is Letting Individual Investors In.\n\nWhile he didn’t mention any specific figures, Bezos’ move to his infamous “billionaire bunker” in the exclusive Indian Creek Village community outside of Miami in 2024 reportedly helped him save $1 billion in taxes . This is a considerable figure given Washington state’s annual revenue of $66.39 billion from 2023 through 2025.\nThis comes amid Washington’s plans for a new state income tax on its millionaire residents, which DeSantis said would be “counterproductive,” since it hands states that don’t have an income tax, such as Florida, “a major advantage over states that do.”\n“Washington has already driven taxpayers out due to bad policies,” he said, adding that the inevitable result of such bad policies is that “taxpayers will flee.”\n\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses— This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\nHe warned that states will continue spending, and eventually, what began as a tax on millionaires will expand to the rest of the tax base. “This will further erode the economic base — and the cycle will keep repeating,” he said in conclusion.\n\nStory Continues\nNeither Bezos nor the State of Washington immediately responded to Benzinga’s request for a comment on this matter. The story will be updated as soon as we receive a response.\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nBillionaires Plan Exit From California Amid New Wealth Tax Other states, such as California, are headed in a similar direction, with a new proposal for a wealth tax on the state’s billionaires, called the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act.\nAccording to the proposal, a one-time levy of 5% would be imposed on all state residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion, with stiff penalties for understating wealth, and additional measures to prevent evasion among the state’s 200 billionaire residents.\n\nBillionaire investor Peter Thiel and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) co-founder Larry Page are reportedly planning to cut down their ties to the state, with Page already planning his move to Florida.\nRead Next: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nPhoto Courtesy: lev radin on Shutterstock.com\nThis article Jeff Bezos Moved To Florida And That Impacted Washington State Budget, Says Ron DeSantis: 'States With No Income Tax Have A Major Advantage...' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMETA\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 30, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft MSFT.\nBuy the \"Mag 7\" Hyperscalers Or Are They Spending Too Much?\nAlthough they are among the world&rsquo;s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\n\nThis includes Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms and Microsoft , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\nThere is no doubt that &ldquo;hyperscaling&rdquo; is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns\nNotably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billio\nROIC Comparison\nWith Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market&rsquo;s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\n\nAmazon&rsquo;s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance\nMagnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon&rsquo;s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon&rsquo;s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below\n\nStory Continues\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts\nAmazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500&rsquo;s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Buy Stock in the Mag 7 Hyperscalers or Are They Spending Too Much?\n\nShaun Pruitt\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAlthough they are among the world’s most profitable companies and have strong balance sheets, the immense spending on various AI investments from the hyperscalers in the Mag 7 has been scrutinized.\nThis includes Amazon AMZN , Alphabet GOOGL , Meta Platforms META , and Microsoft MSFT , which are building and operating massive global-scale cloud infrastructures that are needed to run AI models and huge data workloads.\n\nThere is no doubt that “hyperscaling” is the only way to run AI, cloud, and data-intensive services at the ultimate speed and accuracy that is now expected, but investors have started to ponder whether these companies are overspending on questionable and value-destroying projects.\nOutside of valuation, this has brought about the need to analyze the capital efficiency of the Mag 7 hyperscalers, particularly return on invested capital (ROIC). To that point, ROIC illustrates the ability to return invested capital into profits and is one of the clearest indicators of long-term shareholder value.\n\nMicrosoft Headlines CapEx Concerns Notably, the Mag 7 hyperscalers are all expected to exceed $100 billion in annual capital expenditures for AI-related infrastructure by 2026.\nAt the moment, the highest single-year CapEx figure currently goes to Microsoft. The software giant is now projected to spend $80 billion on data centers this year and has seen its trailing twelve-month CapEx balloon to over $69 billion.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nROIC Comparison With Microsoft being the prime example of extremely elevated CapEx levels, its ROIC has actually stabilized and remained flat over the last few quarters after noticeably declining in recent years to 23% although this is still above the admirable level of 20% or higher.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSurprisingly, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon have seen an increase in ROIC, suggesting the market’s worries about their increased CapEx may be overdone, at least for now.\nAmazon’s sharp uptick has certainly been reassuring as its ROIC has edged closer to 20% with Meta at 29% and Alphabet having the high at 31%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEPS Revisions & Price Performance Magnifying the promising rise in ROIC, Amazon’s increased profitability is standing out the most. Benefiting from a pleasant trend of positive earnings estimate revisions, it's noteworthy that over the last 60 days, Amazon’s FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are still up over 4% and 2% respectively, as shown below.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile Alphabet has experienced an even sharper uptrend in EPS revisions, this appears to have already been priced into its stock, with GOOGL spiking over 20% in the last three months.\n\nStory Continues\nAs for Microsoft, CapEx concerns are taking away from a slight rise in FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates. That said, Meta stock has been the laggard in recent months, which correlates with what has been an 18% drop in FY25 EPS estimates over the last 60 days, even though FY26 EPS revisions are up more than half a percentage point.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion & Final Thoughts Amazon stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the other Mag 7 hyperscalers landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Optimistically, these big tech stocks aren't trading at a stretch to the benchmark S&P 500’s 26X forward earnings multiple, and their EPS growth has remained commendable and justifiable of a slight premium to the broader market.\n\nStill, Amazon stock could be the best bet in regard to more short-term upside when reflecting on the trend of positive EPS revisions and the increasing ROIC to offset CapEx concerns. Amazon may also benefit the most from AI investments, not only in terms of boosting its market-leading AWS cloud services but also in streamlining its core e-commerce business.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "2026 Big Tech Quantum Bets: IBM and Amazon's Edge Over Pure-Plays?\n\nUrmimala Biswas\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 12:00 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: RGTI\n\nAMZN\n\nQBTS\n\nIBM\n\nIn the first several months of 2025, pure-play quantum computing stocks such as Rigetti Computing RGTI and D-Wave Quantum QBTS delivered spectacular returns as investors chased early-stage breakthroughs and future potential. From January to September, while QBTS stock rallied 157%, RGTI gained 49%. These rallies were driven by rapid valuation expansion, growing venture investment in the sector and positive sentiment around promising revenue streams, despite overall revenues remaining modest.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, the momentum has cooled significantly lately. Pure-play names have shifted from parabolic gains toward more muted year-to-date performance and heightened volatility amid stretched valuations. From October 2025 to date, shares of QBTS gained just 2.3% while RGTI lost 24.9% during this period. As pure-plays struggled to sustain stock-price momentum, large technology companies such as Amazon AMZN and IBM IBM attracted stronger investor sentiment, supported by progress in their quantum initiatives embedded within diversified and profitable business models.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWho Stands to Benefit More From Quantum Computing in 2026?\nAs 2026 approaches, several Wall Street analysts have flagged the possibility of further downside for pure-play quantum stocks, noting that while engineering milestones and strategic partnerships are meaningful, revenue scale, margin visibility and sustainable profitability remain years away. This lack of near-term commercial clarity makes it difficult to confidently project outsized gains in 2026, even as the long-term promise of quantum computing remains intact.\n\nIn contrast, diversified technology leaders such as IBM and Amazon offer a structurally different risk profile. Their quantum initiatives are embedded within large, cash-generating businesses, allowing continued investment without dependence on near-term quantum monetization. IBM’s enterprise relationships and hybrid quantum-classical roadmap, alongside Amazon’s cloud-based quantum services through AWS, position both companies to benefit incrementally as adoption evolves. As a result, 2026 may favor steady, fundamentals-driven returns from Big Tech, rather than another speculative surge in pure-play quantum stocks.\n2 Best Picks\nAmazon : Amazon Web Services (AWS) is advancing quantum computing primarily through Amazon Braket, a cloud-based quantum research and development platform that gives users access to a wide array of quantum devices, including superconducting, trapped-ion and neutral-atom systems via a unified interface for building and running algorithms. In 2025, AWS announced Ocelot, its first proprietary quantum computing chip, designed with cat qubits to make error correction up to 90% more resource-efficient.\n\nStory Continues\nContinued enhancements like “program sets” to accelerate quantum task execution further strengthen Braket’s utility for researchers. In 2026, these developments may translate into deeper enterprise engagement with hybrid quantum-classical workflows and early commercial experimentation within AWS’s broader cloud ecosystem.\nAmazon, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has gained 5.9% from October 2025 to date. The stock is projected to report 2026 earnings growth of 9.5% on revenue growth of 11.3%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIBM : The company’s quantum computing strategy follows a public roadmap focused on achieving scientific quantum advantage by the end of 2026. In late 2025, IBM unveiled Quantum Nighthawk, a 120-qubit processor with enhanced connectivity and error-mitigation capabilities and plans to scale to higher gate counts through 2026, enabling more complex circuits.\n\nComplemented by its open Qiskit software stack and partnerships for a community-wide quantum advantage tracker, IBM’s ecosystem is structured to drive adoption across research and enterprise use cases. For 2026, IBM’s combination of hardware, software and cloud access positions it to deliver measurable quantum progress integrated with its broader technology offerings.\nIBM, another Zacks Rank #2 stock, has gained 8.1% from October 2025 to date. The stock is projected to report 2026 earnings growth of 7.5% on revenue growth of 4.9%.

      "Content": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft in the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Although nine publicly traded American companies have achieved a valuation of $1 trillion or more, only four have graduated into the $3 trillion club.\nAmazon is an incredibly diverse technology company, with a dominant market position in industries like e-commerce, cloud computing, and more.\nThe tech titan could join the $3 trillion club in 2026 thanks to a combination of its attractive valuation and its strong earnings growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nNine publicly traded American companies are worth $1 trillion or more, but only four have graduated into the exclusive $3 trillion club so far: Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , and Microsoft .\nI think Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) could join them by the end of 2026 thanks to the accelerating revenue growth in its cloud computing division, and the surging profits in its legacy e-commerce business. The company has a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion as I write this, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a 21% return over the next year if it does cross the $3 trillion milestone.\nRead on, and let's consider Amazon's growth prospects in the year ahead.\nAll eyes on Amazon Web Services Amazon's potential pathway to the $3 trillion club next year starts with its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It used to be a place where businesses would simply store data and host their critical digital applications, but it has evolved to become the center of Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAWS operates state-of-the-art data centers and it rents the computing capacity to AI developers who don't have the financial resources to build their own infrastructure. These data centers are filled with advanced AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia , but Amazon also designed its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium. Top developers like Anthropic are using hundreds of thousands of the latest Trainium2 chips, which offer up to 40% better price performance than competing hardware when training AI models.\nThen there is the AWS Bedrock platform, where businesses can access hundreds of completed AI models from third-parties including Anthropic and Meta Platforms . Developing models from scratch is time consuming and expensive, so using a ready-made solution can help businesses achieve their AI goals much faster.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), which was up 20% year over year. That was the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, which highlights the platform's incredible AI-driven momentum. But it gets better, because AWS has a whopping $200 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online, so the strong top-line results are likely to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's earnings continue to crush Wall Street's estimates The $33 billion in third-quarter revenue that AWS brought in accounted for just 18% of Amazon's total revenue of $180 billion. However, the cloud business is the company's most profitable by far, contributing 65% of its total operating income. E-commerce is actually Amazon's largest source of revenue, but its profit margins are very thin because its Amazon.com site focuses on selling a high volume of products at low prices.\n\nHowever, Amazon is pushing to improve profitability in its e-commerce business by boosting efficiency and implementing new technologies. In 2023, it broke its U.S. logistics network into eight distinct regions, so now the products in each fulfillment center are specific to their geographic region. As a result, orders travel shorter distances to reach customers, which brings down packing and shipping costs.\nAmazon also uses AI-powered software like Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers, which uses computer vision to identify defective products before they ship. This reduces returns and refunds, creating further cost savings.\nThe accelerating growth at AWS combined with improved efficiency in the e-commerce business is driving a huge increase in Amazon's overall profit. The company generated earnings of $5.22 per share during the first three quarters of 2025, which was a whopping 42% jump from the same period in 2024. Plus, Amazon's earnings have beaten Wall Street's consensus estimates in every single quarter of 2025, by an average of 22%.\n\nHow Amazon can cross the $3 trillion milestone in 2026 Amazon stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.8 as I write this. That's roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so Amazon stock is basically sitting at fair value relative to its peers in the tech sector.\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate earnings of $7.86 per share in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6.\nAssuming Wall Street is right, Amazon stock would have to climb by 11% next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 32.8, lifting its market cap to $2.75 trillion. But remember, the company has a habit of beating Wall Street's expectations.\nIf its 2026 earnings beat the consensus estimate by 22% like they have so far in 2025, then its stock could be poised for a 35% gain next year instead. That would catapult its market value to a whopping $3.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, even an earnings beat of just 9% next year would be enough to see Amazon join the $3 trillion club. Given the incredible momentum across its e-commerce business and AWS, I think that's an achievable target.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

You need every tool you can get in the media war. \"\nWhile O'Leary says movie theaters aren't going anywhere, shifting consumer behavior shows that streaming at home is winning the volume game.

      "Content": "Amazon Data Centers Aren’t Raising Your Electric Bills—They May Be Lowering Them\n\nAaron Larson\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:23 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nPCG\n\nETR\n\nD\n\nAs electricity demand from data centers continues to surge, a persistent question has dogged the industry: Are residential ratepayers footing the bill for massive tech infrastructure? According to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and an independent study it commissioned, the answer is a definitive no. As a guest on The POWER Podcast , Mandy Ulrich, senior manager of energy and water for Americas East at AWS, outlined the company’s energy strategy and discussed findings from a study by Energy and Environmental Economics Inc. (E3) that examined how Amazon data centers impact local power systems .\n\nStudy Finds Data Centers Generate Surplus Revenue The E3 study evaluated Amazon data centers across a diverse set of utility territories, including large investor-owned utilities such as Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and Dominion Energy, mid-size utilities like Entergy, and cooperatives such as Umatilla Electric Cooperative in the Pacific Northwest. “The simple answer is that Amazon data centers are not being subsidized by other utility customers,” Ulrich said. The study projects that Amazon’s data centers will generate $33,500/MW of surplus value in 2025, increasing to $60,650/MW by 2030. For a typical 100-MW Amazon data center, that translates to $3.4 million in surplus revenues in 2025 and approximately $6.1 million by 2030. These surplus funds—revenues above the utility’s regulated rate of return—can be used by utilities to modernize grid infrastructure, improving reliability for all customers.\n\nGrid Investment Benefits All Customers The study found that Amazon data centers are driving investments in grid infrastructure that support not just their own operations but also local residential and commercial growth. Ulrich pointed to Entergy Mississippi as a prime example, where the utility is using investments from Amazon and other large customers to fund a $300 million “Superpower Mississippi” grid reliability campaign —at no cost to residential customers—targeting a 50% reduction in outages within five years.\n\nInnovative Rate Structures Prevent Cost-Shifting While the E3 study validates that existing rate policies have been effective in preventing cross-subsidization, Ulrich emphasized that AWS continues to work with utilities on innovative approaches to ensure large industrial customers pay their fair share. She highlighted a Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO) project as a “groundbreaking model.” Under this first-of-its-kind agreement, Amazon is investing in 3 GW of electrical capacity, with 2.4 GW dedicated to data center operations and 600 MW reserved specifically to support grid reliability for all NIPSCO customers. The structure creates a separate generation company (GenCo) that operates under a “commercial contract term,” Ulrich explained. By operating as a separate entity, GenCo isolates the cost of new growth to data centers. “The data center companies that drive new demand for electricity will fund the generation and transmission infrastructure they require, ensuring that regular customers don’t shoulder those costs, even if the customer leaves before contract completion,” NIPSCO said in a Nov. 24 press release . “NIPSCO’s existing customers will have no financial responsibility for powering Amazon data centers,” Ulrich said. NIPSCO said, “This structure is expected to provide value to customers by generating approximately $1 billion in cost savings that will be returned to current NIPSCO customers as credits on monthly electric bills over the project’s 15-year duration.”\n\nStory Continues\nPartnering with Communities In the Pacific Northwest, AWS announced a self-supply agreement with Umatilla Electric Cooperative (UEC) in 2023 that allows Amazon to take responsibility for sourcing its own energy supply, enabling the company to include additional renewable resources in its portfolio. Meanwhile, UEC has lauded AWS as a strong supporter of the entire community . It said the companies have collaborated “to provide energy assistance, support local aid organizations, and bolster student connectivity and virtual learning.” “AWS continues to be an outstanding community partner for the Umatilla Schools and this community,” Heidi Sipe, Umatilla School District Superintendent, said in a spotlight post on UEC’s website.\n\nEfficiency as Part of the Strategy AWS is also focusing on fundamental efficiency improvements. Ulrich noted that the company designs its own purpose-built chips, with Graviton-based instances using up to 60% less energy for equivalent performance. More than 70,000 customers have adopted these chips. The company’s Inferentia2–based instances offer up to 50% better performance per watt for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. On the facilities side, AWS has achieved innovative designs that provide 12% more compute power per data center, more efficient cooling systems that reduce mechanical energy consumption by up to 46%, and the use of lower-carbon concrete and steel that has cut embodied carbon by 35%, Ulrich reported. The results show in AWS’s global power usage effectiveness (PUE) score of 1.15 in 2024—significantly better than the 1.25 public cloud industry average and far below the 1.63 average for on-premises corporate data centers.\n\nCarbon-Free Energy at Scale AWS has positioned itself as the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for five consecutive years, enabling more than 600 renewable energy projects globally—enough to power 8.3 million U.S. homes, according to Ulrich. She said the company achieved its goal of matching 100% of electricity consumption with renewable energy seven years ahead of schedule. Beyond renewables, AWS has invested billions in nuclear energy, including projects in Pennsylvania and Washington state. The company has also invested in 11 solar-plus-battery storage projects to deliver stored solar energy during peak demand periods.\n\nLooking Ahead As data center demand continues to grow—driven by AI adoption, streaming services, and increasing digital dependence—the question of who pays for infrastructure will remain a key policy debate. The E3 study and AWS’s innovative agreements with utilities offer one model for how large electricity consumers and utilities can work together without burdening residential customers. “We want to ensure that we’ve got the right reliable power to support [our customers], and we want to do that in a way that is collaborative with our local utility partners,” Ulrich said. “We intend to be there for the long haul.” To hear the full interview with Ulrich, which contains more about data centers and the work AWS is doing to keep them sustainable, listen to The POWER Podcast .

      "Content": "Can Strong Platform Revenues Support Further Upside in Roku Stock?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ROKU\n\nDIS\n\nAMZN\n\nRoku 's ROKU platform revenues are driven by advertising activities and streaming services distribution. Advertising includes video ads delivered across the Roku platform and The Roku Channel, while streaming services distribution covers revenues from Premium Subscriptions, transaction fees on content purchases and Roku-billed subscriptions. This dual revenue structure provides diversification and gives Roku multiple levers to drive platform growth.\n\nAdvertising remains the key driver of platform momentum. Roku has expanded integrations with major demand-side platforms such as Amazon DSP, Trade Desk and FreeWheel, allowing advertisers to access inventory through preferred buying channels. Programmatic transactions account for a rising share of video ad impressions, improving demand access and monetisation efficiency. Roku Ads Manager is broadening the advertiser base by attracting small and medium-sized businesses and performance marketers. Nearly 90% of advertisers using Ads Manager are new to Roku, pointing to incremental demand rather than dependence on traditional brand budgets. Video advertising growth continues to outpace the broader U.S. OTT and digital advertising markets, supporting visibility into platform revenue trends.\n\nStreaming services distribution adds a second growth driver. Subscriptions are benefiting from improved content discovery and AI-powered recommendations that support higher conversions. Roku’s 2026 content slate is expected to strengthen The Roku Channel with originals such as Broad Trip, The Laguna Beach Reunion and The Great American Baking Show Season 2 , alongside third-party titles including The Spiderwick Chronicles and Die Hart Season 3 . Engagement is expected to be further supported by The Roku Sports Channel, which features MLB Sunday Leadoff, NBA G League and Formula E content. Howdy, Roku’s $2.99 ad-free subscription service with nearly 10,000 hours of content targets a value-focused audience and expands monetisation opportunities.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 platform revenues is pegged at $1.12 billion, indicating 14.5% year-over-year growth. With advertising execution and subscription expansion progressing together, Roku’s platform revenues appear well-positioned to support further upside.\n\nROKU Faces Intensifying Competition Roku’s platform competes with Netflix NFLX and Disney DIS as both expand ad-supported streaming and subscription monetization. Netflix is scaling its ad tier alongside subscriptions, while Netflix continues to monetise viewing inside its own app. Disney follows a similar path across Disney+ and Hulu, with Disney using premium content to support ads and subscriptions. Unlike Netflix and Disney, Roku monetises viewing across apps at the platform level rather than single-service control models.\n\nStory Continues\nROKU’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates ROKU shares have risen 27.5% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s decline of 15.5% and the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s plunge of 6.7%.\nROKU’s Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Roku stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio of 3.11X compared with the industry’s 4.3X. ROKU carries a Value Score of D.\nROKU’s Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ROKU’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at 28 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days.

Do they waste a whole day trying to find the next big play in AI or do they just say, you know what? Nvidia's going to win this whole damn thing? I'm just going to bet on them again next year.\n00:15 Adam\nYeah, I definitely wouldn't uh just bet on Nvidia. I I think you do need to do your homework if you want to buy specific names. I think probably the general investor is probably better finding some sort of basket to kind of play the overall space. Uh but we're very early innings in this and\n00:41 Adam\nobviously Nvidia is the winner right now, but uh to say, you know, in five years that we look back that they're going to be the dominant player still, very, very unlikely. Like I said, this is really an evolving space. So I I would be careful with something that's so specific as Nvidia. Uh we kind of like to barbell this with, you know, something like the the big hyperscaler like a like an Alphabet Google, uh because that's really the type of name that uh you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because they just\n01:14 Adam\noverall, the AI story is just benefiting an already existing business model that was doing well. So, I think you would just want to be careful with what we're calling kind of the one trick ponies, like a Nvidia, uh a Core Weve or a Patier right now.\n01:31 Speaker A\nUh, Brooke, let me get over to you because I think what you're seeing in industrial metals and some of the things that Adam's talking about fits nicely with what we heard from Ed Yardini this morning that he might see it is likely to see we are likely to see a broadening out in this rally. Investors doing their homework, trying to get outside of the tried and true Mag 7.\n01:53 Brooke\nYeah, Brian, what we did hear from Ed Danny over the weekend was really ongoing momentum in this market in 2026. He maintained that year end target for the S&P 500 of 7,700 and he said largely it won't be really led by uh the Mag 7, but also what he called the impressive 493 of the S&P 500 as really this broadening out, this boost in productivity growth really leads to overall returns for the\n02:26 Brooke\nS&P 500 in 2026. Specifically, you know, he went on to say that that is really where exactly investors should be thinking about this mindset. You know, not really overweight technology, but more so thinking about the other users of AI as opposed to just the producers of AI. And so certainly he's not alone in this uh momentum that he thinks will exist within 2026 ongoing from what we've seen so far in the returns in 2025.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The recent surge in both metals has taken prices to overbought levels, sparking technical selling. Also, the CME today raised margin levels for precious metals trading, which has sparked some long liquidation pressure.\nCrude oil prices are up by more than +2% today, lifting energy producers and limiting losses in the broader market, as advanced peace talks over the weekend to end the Ukraine-Russian war failed to yield a breakthrough. Geopolitical tensions from Venezuela to Nigeria are also supporting crude prices. In addition, crude prices rose after China's Ministry of Finance on Sunday pledged to broaden its fiscal spending base next year, signaling government support to drive economic growth.\n\nSeasonal factors are bullish for stocks.

      "Content": "Quantum computing works — now investors will see if the stocks do too\n\nCharlie Garcia\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: IBM\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nIONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nEditor’s note: Columnist Charlie Garcia shares select emails and online comments from his virtual mailbag each week.\nDear Charlie, I see three investment lanes for quantum computing : pure plays like IonQ IONQ and Rigetti RGTI; the “Magnificent Seven” giants with quantum divisions; and infrastructure picks-and-shovels.\nMost Read from MarketWatch I make more than my wife. Can she claim Social Security at 62 and later switch to spousal benefits?\n‘Is it a case of them or us?’ We’re in our 40s. Do we retire early in our 50s — or save for our kids’ education?\nLogan Paul’s $5.3 million Pokémon bet raises a bigger question: Do collectibles belong in your portfolio?\nThe hot AI trade faces a 1980s style trap and these risks, says this market bull\n\nWhich lane has the best risk-reward?\nMason\nDear Mason, All three lanes lead somewhere. The question is which one fits your risk tolerance.\nPure plays like IonQ, Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum QBTS are lottery tickets with better odds. They’re not competing with the Magnificent Seven; they’re auditioning to be acquired by them. If one of these companies cracks a genuine commercial advantage, it becomes a buyout target overnight. High risk; asymmetric upside.\n\nThe Mag Seven are already in: Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon.com AMZN have billion-dollar quantum programs. So does IBM IBM. You’re not betting on whether they’ll participate. You’re betting on whether quantum becomes material to their earnings this decade. Safer, but the quantum upside is diluted by everything else in the stock.\nInfrastructure is where the near-term money lives. Post-quantum cryptography is already a compliance issue. NIST standardized new algorithms in 2024, and every government contractor, bank and defense company needs to upgrade. That’s not speculative. That’s a budget line-item.\nThe picks-and-shovels play isn’t qubits. It’s the classical-quantum interface: cryogenic systems, control electronics, error-correction software. Less sexy than “we built a quantum computer” — and more likely to generate revenue this decade.\n\nMy bias? I own positions across all three lanes, but I’m most interested in security infrastructure. That’s the toll road everyone has to drive on.\nDiversified but opinionated,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best investors in the mobile revolution didn’t bet on which phone would win. They bet on Qualcomm’s QCOM chips inside all of them.\nDear Charlie, Quantum computing is just another fantasy — like AI was for decades. Error correction is still unsolved.\nThis is vaporware.\nNancy\nDear Nancy, Error correction was unsolved. Past tense.\n\nStory Continues\nIn December 2024, Google’s Willow chip became the first quantum processor to demonstrate “below threshold” error correction. That’s the holy grail physicists have chased for 30 years. The chip showed that scaling up qubit arrays, from 3×3 to 5×5 to 7×7, reduced error rates instead of compounding them. That’s never happened before.\n\nThree weeks later, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in topological qubits. Amazon’s Ocelot chip cut error-correction costs by 90%. IBM confirmed it’s on track for a 100,000-qubit system by 2029. A University of Chicago professor called it “escape velocity.”\nYou’re right that quantum computing was vaporware for decades. So was AI. In 2020, experts said artificial general intelligence was 50 years away. In 2024, AI writes code, passes the bar exam and diagnoses cancer better than radiologists.\nThe difference between “decades away” and “here” is usually about 18 months of denial.\nStill skeptical after all these years,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best time to invest in a technology is when smart people still think it’s a fantasy.\nDear Charlie, North Korea stole $2 billion in crypto in 2024. When quantum computing matures, all encryption is at risk. What makes you think bitcoin BTCUSD survives?\nAlex\nDear Alex, You’re conflating two different problems: hackers and hardware.\nNorth Korea didn’t crack bitcoin’s cryptography. It compromised employees. The Bybit heist, around $1.5 billion, came from social engineering and insider access, not supercomputers. That’s not a quantum threat. That’s a human one.\nNow, the real question: What happens when quantum computers can break elliptic curve cryptography?\n\nAnswer: Everything breaks. Not just bitcoin. Google, Microsoft, the U.S. Federal Reserve, every bank, every military system, every government database on earth. If quantum computing cracks bitcoin, it’s already cracked the entire digital infrastructure of modern civilization. Bitcoin isn’t the first domino. It’s somewhere around the 40th.\nBut here’s what the doomsayers miss: bitcoin upgrades. The U.S. government’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) — the same agency that sets the standards for everything from weights and measures to cybersecurity — standardized quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms in 2024.\nThe bitcoin network can migrate to post-quantum signatures. Active coins move to new addresses with new encryption.\n\nLost bitcoins, including founder Satoshi’s, stay frozen in old addresses. That’s roughly 4 million coins in vulnerable P2PK addresses that become unspendable. Security goes up. Circulating supply goes down. That’s not a death sentence for bitcoin. That’s a supply shock.\nTimeline? Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang says 15 to 30 years before quantum computers can break current encryption. Bitcoin security expert Jameson Lopp estimates bitcoin needs five to 10 years to complete a migration. The math works.\nQuantum computing is a threat to everything. That’s exactly why it isn’t a special threat to bitcoin.\nWatching the sausage get made,\nCharlie\nP.S. North Korea’s hackers don’t need quantum physics. They just need your password.\nDear Charlie, Horizon scanning is no longer optional. First movers will be those who translate technical complexity into business strategy.\nDon’t you agree?\nSarah\nDear Sarah, Exactly right. The companies that win won’t be the ones with the most qubits. They’ll be the ones who figure out what to do with them first.\nQubits are a vanity metric. Error-corrected, commercially viable quantum systems are the real race. The winners will be the ones that turn physics experiments into recurring revenue.\n\nYou’re right that horizon scanning is no longer optional. The companies that spot quantum’s commercial applications first will own the decade. The ones still waiting for proof of concept will be writing case studies about what they missed.\nEyes on the horizon,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best business strategies are written by people who understand what the technology can’t do yet.\nDear Charlie, You’re right that “wafer-scale cryogenic integration” makes investment decisions difficult. But when the railroad was hard to explain, the travelers were few.\nWhen it worked, they were 100 times more numerous. I’m buying the complexity.\nPierre\nDear Pierre, You understand something most investors don’t: The more revolutionary the technology, the harder it is to evaluate. “Wafer-scale cryogenic integration” doesn’t fit in a spreadsheet.\nNeither did “horseless carriage” in 1905.\nThe best investors in transformational technologies aren’t the ones who understand physics. They’re the ones who understand the implications.\n\nYou’re buying the complexity. I’m right there with you.\nFellow traveler,\nCharlie\nP.S. Nobody who bought Standard Oil stock could explain fractional distillation either.\nHe has no position in any of the companies or investments mentioned in this article.\n\nMore from Charlie Garcia:\nQuantum computing is the stock market’s next big tech play — and these stocks are still cheap\nChina is quietly destroying the dollar — and that’ll cost you. Fight back with these money moves.\nThe real money in AI chips is in these stocks — and you’ve probably never heard of them\nThe dollar is losing the world’s respect — but you’re losing much more\nMost Read from MarketWatch Here are the ideas that could really help solve America’s affordability crisis in 2026\n‘I completely trust her’: Should I name my daughter as beneficiary on all my accounts — or add her name instead?\nHow the New Year’s tax deadline poses a risk for gold, silver and the Dow\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Amazon stock could have nearly 50% upside in 2026\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 5:14 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nAmazon's ( AMZN ) stock has hardly had a prime performance in 2025.\nShares of the e-commerce and cloud giant are only up 6% year to date, badly lagging the 18% advance for the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ). Experts cite slowing sales growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) business and mixed sentiment on the company's ability to monetize artificial intelligence as the drivers of the \"mixed\" sentiment.\nAmazon didn't do much to bolster sentiment in October when it announced its largest-ever round of layoffs in its history, eliminating 14,000 corporate roles.\nThe stock is likely to close out the year with the unenviable award for worst-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" member.\n\nFor perspective, the top performer of the Magnificent Seven, Alphabet ( GOOG ), has surged 66% this year on the back of optimism for its new Gemini 3 model .\nBut Wall Street has stuck with Amazon, with some even putting it on their \"top picks\" lists for 2026.\nEvercore ISI tech analyst Mark Mahaney wrote that he thinks Amazon has about 50% upside potential. He was one of the Street analysts slapping a top pick stamp on the stock.\n\nMahaney cited several catalysts coming into focus soon, including reaccelerating growth at AWS, demand for new Trainium AI chips, further strong growth in advertising revenue, and a ramp in the new Alexa+.\n\"At the end of the day, Amazon remains a high quality compounder (25% EPS compound annual growth rate), with solid double-digit revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and free cash flow likely to inflect up materially in a 24-month timeframe,\" Mahaney said.\nYahoo Finance data shows of the 67 sell-side analysts that cover Amazon, 96% rate the stock a Strong Buy or Buy. The average $295 price target for the Street assumes 27% upside from current levels.\nInput from Polymarket, a Yahoo Finance partner for prediction market data, reveals Main Street has a more skeptical take on the stock, however. About 96% of users think the stock will be little changed by the end of January 2026 compared to today.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth is in Mahaney's bull camp on Amazon, with a more subdued projection on the stock that estimates 30% upside potential.\nAnmuth's thesis on Amazon is similar to Mahaney's, though he noted that Amazon's new $38 billion, seven-year cloud services deal with OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) could \"add upside\" to the company's top line.\n\"Amazon is the most diversified mega-cap across revenues and profit and has various large growth opportunities — mixed sentiment and attractive valuation,\" Anmuth added.\n\nStory Continues\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

While the company pointed to constructive engagement with Italian aerospace regulators, it said the broader business and regulatory framework in Italy does not currently support its longer-term objectives for the drone delivery program.\n\nWarning!

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe decision follows positive discussions earlier this year between Amazon and Italy's aviation regulator, Ente Nazionale per l'Aviazione Civile, including a June meeting focused on the progress of the drone delivery project in the San Salvo area. Those talks had centered on regulatory progress and operational development, but Amazon said the wider structural environment ultimately led it to halt commercial plans for now.\nAmazon added that its drone delivery initiatives in other regions continue to move forward. The company said projects in the U.S. and the UK are progressing positively, with ongoing test flights and commercial deliveries described as successful and well received by customers, suggesting that drone delivery could remain a selective, market-specific opportunity rather than a uniform global rollout.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nMeta Platforms' AI Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\nMeta Platforms is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META&rsquo;s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META&rsquo;s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms&rsquo; initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company&rsquo;s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet and Amazon , are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space\n\nMeta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\nAlphabet&rsquo;s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans. This is driving GOOGL's advertising revenue growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Amazon&rsquo;s advertising revenues increased 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company announced partnerships allowing advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify and SiriusXM Media through Amazon Ads, expanding its advertising reach beyond its own properties. The strong performance in advertising reflected successful AI-powered optimization of the platform and growing market share in digital advertising, providing a high-margin revenue stream that supports investments in other parts of the business.\n\nMETA&rsquo;s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates\nMeta Platforms shares have climbed 11.3% in the trailing 12 months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 24.6%.\nMeta Platforms stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.22X compared with the broader sector&rsquo;s 6.62X. META has a Value Score of C.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.16 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days, suggesting 1.75% year-over-year growth.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc.

GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\n3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. , Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\nGlobal e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN&rsquo;s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon&rsquo;s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is &ldquo;Growing at a pace we haven&rsquo;t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we&rsquo;ve been focused on accelerating capacity &mdash; adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.&rdquo;\nExtensive AI Applications\n\nAmazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called &ldquo;Project Rainier.&rdquo; This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers&rsquo; queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\nAMZN&rsquo;s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance\nAmazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\nMicrosoft Corp.\nMicrosoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT&rsquo;s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company&rsquo;s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT&rsquo;s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength\nMicrosoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN&rsquo;s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT&rsquo;s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nAlphabet Inc.\nThe undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company&rsquo;s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\n\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business\nGoogle Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon&rsquo;s AWS and Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\n\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions\nZacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Online Shoppers, Say Goodbye to Free Returns\n\nMallika Mitra\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:01 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNothing in life is free. Not even online returns.\nFor years, consumers got used to treating their bedrooms like fitting rooms as e-commerce grew in popularity and eventually boomed during the pandemic. Sure, there was the convenience of ordering a new pair of shoes and having them delivered to your doorstep. But one of the other major bonuses of online shopping was that you could send back your purchases with no questions asked and no money asked for.\n\nThat benefit — once an industry norm — is going by the wayside. In the US, 72% of merchants charge for at least some return options, up from 66% last year, according to a report published by the National Retail Federation (NRF) and UPS-owned logistics company Happy Returns in October. That’s in part due to the same reason that shopping is more expensive across the board nowadays: tariffs.\nSUBSCRIBE: Receive more of our free The Daily Upside newsletter.

As companies’ overall cost of doing business increases, so has the cost of managing returns — think everything from shipping prices to labor at distribution centers.\nAs a result, retailers have had to pivot. Free returns are now a perk, not a guarantee:\n\nMore retailers are offering free online returns as a reward for signing up for their membership or loyalty programs, says David Morin, vice president of customer strategy at returns technology company Narvar. At Macy’s, for instance, return shipping is free for Star Rewards members, but $9.99 plus tax for non-members.\nFirst-party data is critical to retailers, and having customers sign up for those programs gives them access to it, Morin says. Customers don’t seem to mind: 73% of the roughly 3,500 consumers Narvar surveyed for its 2025 State of Post-Purchase Report said they would share more personal data with trusted retailers if it gave them better loyalty perks and experiences.\nGo Old School: You can also almost always just head to a physical store to avoid the return fee (and get a faster refund). Amazon, which has upended the way we think about online shopping, lets customers return items at Whole Foods, Kohl’s, Staples and UPS in addition to its own physical stores.\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside .

      "Content": "Buy the Dip on This Logistics Leader Before Its Next Leg of Compounding Growth Kicks In\n\nMatt DiLallo, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 2:35 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: UPS\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Several headwinds have weighed on shares of UPS over the past few years.\nThe company is working to turn things around.\nIts plan is already starting to deliver improvements.\n10 stocks we like better than United Parcel Service ›\nUPS (NYSE: UPS) has experienced quite a dip in recent years. Shares of the global logistics giant are currently down more than 50% from their peak a few years ago. As a result, its dividend yield has skyrocketed to 6.5%. It has battled a barrage of headwinds, including high labor costs, tariffs, weaker market conditions, and a strategic decision to reduce its reliance on its top customer, Amazon .\nHowever, while shares of UPS are down, the logistics leader appears to be right on the cusp of turning things around. That makes now a great time to buy the dip before a reacceleration begins.\nSlowly changing course UPS has realized that not all volumes are worth the cost. As a result, the company made the strategic decision earlier this year to cut the volumes it ships for Amazon by over 50% by the end of next year. While Amazon contributes around 20% to 25% of its volume, it only supplied about 11% of its revenue last year. Most of the volumes it ships for the top e-commerce company have low profit margins.\n\nAs part of the transformational shift away from Amazon, UPS is undergoing a major restructuring. It aims to cut $3.5 billion in costs by the end of this year by reducing its headcount and closing locations.\nThe company is also investing to grow its more profitable business lines, including healthcare logistics. It closed its $1.6 billion acquisition of Andlauer Healthcare Group in November to enhance its complex healthcare logistics operations.\nThe green shoots of a recovery The slow shift away from Amazon will continue to negatively impact the company's results. Its revenue declined by 3.7% in the third quarter while its adjusted earnings per share fell 1.1%. However, the company is starting to see some underlying progress. Its U.S. revenue per piece grew by 9.8% during the quarter, while its domestic operating margin rose slightly.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the company's other headwinds appear to be slowly fading. Rival FedEx reported better-than-expected results for its fiscal second quarter, despite ongoing trade uncertainty and weak shipping markets. The company also increased its guidance for the fiscal year. It now expects sales to grow 5% to 6% (up from 4% to 6%) and adjusted earnings between $17.80 and $19 per share (increasing the low-end from $17.20 per share). UPS also provided investors with a better-than-expected outlook for the fourth quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nAdditionally, UPS' free cash flow is improving. It generated $2 billion during the third quarter alone, after producing only $742 million during the first half of the year. Free cash flow should continue heading higher as the company executes its cost-reduction strategy (it achieved $2.2 billion of its $3.5 billion target by the end of the third quarter). That's putting the company's high-yielding dividend on a more sustainable foundation.\n\nDelivering high total return potential UPS appears to be turning the corner. Its strategy to reduce its reliance on Amazon is improving its profitability, while some market headwinds seem to be abating. If these trends continue, UPS could deliver robust total returns to investors in the future as its stock price rebounds, and it continues to pay its lucrative dividend.\n\nShould you buy stock in United Parcel Service right now?

Maybe it's the wrong size, perhaps it's something truly awful, or maybe you just own one already, but no matter the reason, you will need to return the item.\n“The eCommerce boom, fueled by unprecedented convenience and ‘no questions asked’ returns policies, has created an expensive problem for retailers,” said Pollen Returns founder Spencer Kieboom. “Consequently, returns cost retailers about $218 billion annually as 20% of their inventory is now tied up in the returns process. Retailers are now re-evaluating their approach to returns from policies to resale strategies.”\n\nOn the positive side, most retailers still offer free in-store returns. That can be a challenge, however, if you don't have a receipt, according to the Better Business Bureau (BBB).\n\"Always include a gift receipt with items you give, and hold on to any gift receipts you receive,\" the non-profit agency shared.\nMore Retail:\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\nNot having a receipt may impact your ability to make the return.\n\" Returning gifts without a receipt can be tricky. Without a receipt, most retailers offer store credit or an exchange rather than a full refund to your original method of payment, especially if the item is marked down or on clearance,\" the BBB added.\nTop Retailers: Holiday return policies and fees Macy’s: Purchases made Oct. 6-Dec. 31, 2025 can be returned until Jan. 31, 2026 .\nStore returns are free, but mail‑in returns incur a $9.99 shipping/return fee for non‑Star Rewards members, deducted from the refund. Star Rewards members get free shipping, according to Macy's Customer Service.\nTarget: Extended holiday return window for many purchases (electronics and entertainment bought Nov. 1-Dec. 24 must be returned by Jan. 24, 2026 ; some exceptions like Apple products have earlier deadlines). In‑store and standard mail returns are generally free with prepaid labels , \" Target shared .\nWalmart: Purchases made Oct. 1–Dec. 31, 2025 have an extended return deadline of Jan. 31, 2026 for most items.\nWalmart free returns apply for most Walmart.com items; Marketplace sellers may set their own return fees, according to Walmart's website.\nAmazon: Most holiday purchases made Nov. 1–Dec. 31 can be returned until Jan. 31, 2026 , with free returns for many items (especially for Prime members). Some heavy/bulky or special categories may deduct return fees if certain options aren’t used , Amazon shared on its website .\nBest Buy: Extended return window for purchases made Oct. 31–Dec. 31, 2025 with returns accepted until Jan. 15, 2026 ;\nRestocking fees up to 15% of the item price for opened electronics, and a $45 restocking fee on activatable devices like phones and tablets, according to the Best Buy website.\nTJX Stores (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods):\nPurchases made Oct. 5–Dec. 24, 2025 can be returned in‑store until Jan. 25, 2026 and online (mail) until Feb. 4, 2026. Mail returns cost $11.99 per package, avoidable by returning in person. Sources: T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods\nJ.Crew: Holiday mailed returns typically have a $7.50 shipping/return fee deducted from the refund (fee schedules may vary by item/season) , J. Crew posted on its website .\nREI: Returns mailed back incur about a $7.99 shipping deduction from the refund for standard packages (policy variable by weight and location) , according to the REI website .\nDillard’s: For mailed holiday returns, a $9.95 label/return fee may be deducted; additional restocking charges can also apply, Dillard's shared on its website .\nJCPenney: Has a roughly $8 mail return fee (plus possible fees for large pickup/restocking on big items), deducted from refunds , JCPenney posted on its website .\nAmerican Eagle: Many online returns carried a $5 return fee for mailed items during the 2025 holiday policy, avoidable if returned in-store or under certain membership perks , the retail chain shared on its website .\nSephora: Offers an extended holiday return period (through Jan. 31, 2026 for eligible purchases), but returns may only issue store credit in some cases rather than full refunds online, Sephora posted on its website .\n\nRetail returns are a growing problem \"Retailers estimate that 15.8% of their annual sales will be returned this year, totaling $849.9 billion, according to the 2025 Retail Returns Landscape report released today by the National Retail Federation (NRF) and Happy Returns, a UPS company. The returns rate is in line with 16.9% last year, when returns totaled $890 billion.\"\n\nThe report shared some other key data points when it comes to returns:\nWhile overall return rates may remain steady, some areas are facing more pressure than others. According to the report, an estimated 19.3% of online sales will be returned in 2025.\nAdditionally, as Gen Z’s influence grows, so does their impact on returns. Those between the ages of 18 and 30 made 7.7 returns of online purchases in the last 12 months, on average, more than any other generation.\nConsumer expectations are increasing around returns.\nFree returns are a major draw for shoppers, with 82% citing them as a major consideration when making a purchase, up from 76% last year. Consumers also value immediacy, with 76% saying they are more likely to choose a return option that provides an instant refund or exchange.\nRelated: Kohl’s defends Kohl’s Cash, a program that boosts repeat shopping\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 28, 2025, where it first appeared in the Retail section.

      "Content": "3 Supercharged Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Into the 2030s\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:33 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nVRTX\n\nTJX\n\nKey Points Amazon's profitability underscores the success of established and emerging growth sources.\nVertex Pharmaceuticals is launching several new products, and more approvals could be around the corner.\nTJX Companies has proven to be a rare, resilient winner in the retail space.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nGrowth stocks abound in a wide range of sectors, although they tend to fall in and out of favor with investors, depending on the macro and/or market environment. Quality growth stocks can augment your portfolio returns with time and offset the more value-oriented businesses in your basket of buys.\nIf you are looking for top growth stocks to buy and hold well into the 2030s, here are three no-brainer names to consider right now.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) continues to underscore the strength of its business and deliver fantastic growth for long-term shareholders. Over the three-year trailing period alone, the stock has delivered a total return of close to 173% for investors. Pull that time frame back 10 years, and you're looking at a total return of more than 600%.\n\nEven though past performance isn't a promise of future returns, Amazon has proven its ability to thrive in a wide range of macroenvironments and capitalize on new growth waves. Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains Amazon's primary profit engine and currently accounts for approximately 30% of the global cloud infrastructure market.\nThat said, advertising is Amazon's fastest-growing segment, with annualized revenue for the segment set to exceed $60 billion in 2025. By leveraging its unique first-party data and expanding into upper-funnel ads via Prime Video and streaming partnerships, Amazon's ad business could easily approach $100 billion annually within a few years.\nAmazon is investing heavily in AI across its entire ecosystem, and its planned capital expenditures are projected at $125 billion in 2025. Amazon's growing AI ecosystem includes its custom silicon chips, Trainium for AI model training, and Inferentia for running models. These chips aim to provide high performance at a lower cost compared to competitors like Nvidia and are used to power internal services such as the Rufus shopping assistant.\n\nTo sustain its e-commerce moat, Amazon has deployed over 1 million robots in its warehouses, and management projects this will save up to $4 billion annually in fulfillment costs. These efficiencies, alongside a shift to regionalized warehouse models, are expected to significantly lift operating margins for the retail segment by 2030.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's third-quarter revenue totaled $180.2 billion, up 13% year over year. AWS segment sales were up 20% from one year ago. The company's operating income came to $17.4 billion, which was flat year over year but included $2.5 billion for a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settlement and $1.8 billion in severance, without which it would have been $21.7 billion. Net income rose 38% compared to Q3 2024, to $21.2 billion. Amazon continues to look like a compelling buy.\n\n2. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) boasts a trailing-10-year return in the ballpark of 90%, thanks to its robust cystic fibrosis (CF) drug franchise and growing foothold on the lucrative rare disease drug market. Vertex holds a near-monopoly in the market for drugs that treat the underlying cause of CF, and its key product patents extend into the late 2030s, so it can rely on a stable and highly profitable financial foundation.\n\nThe company is actively diversifying its portfolio with several high-potential programs in late-stage clinical development that target large, underserved markets, including kidney disease, pain management, and type 1 diabetes. Vertex has a solid balance sheet with low debt, habitually high profit margins (over 30%), and substantial free cash flow, which gives it the flexibility to fund research and development (R&D) and pursue strategic acquisitions. The company ended Q3 2025 with about $12 billion in cash and investments on hand.\nVertex continues to actively launch Casgevy, the first-ever gene-editing therapy (which it developed with CRISPR Therapeutics ) and a functional cure for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics are expanding access to Casgevy through authorized treatment centers and securing reimbursement agreements in multiple countries. The therapy is approved in the U.S., the E.U., and the U.K. for eligible patients 12 years and older.\n\nAnother ongoing major launch is for Journavx, a non-opioid medicine for moderate-to-severe acute pain. Over 300,000 prescriptions have been written for the drug as of mid-October 2025, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just approved the drug for use in the U.S. in January.\nThe company is also advancing its candidates inaxaplin (for APOL1-mediated kidney disease) and povetacicept (for IgA nephropathy). Both treatments are in late-stage clinical development for their respective conditions. Vertex completed enrollment in the interim analysis cohort of the AMPLITUDE global phase 2/3 trial for inaxaplin in September 2025. The pre-planned interim analysis is expected once this cohort has been treated for 48 weeks. If the results are positive, this analysis could serve as the basis for seeking accelerated approval in the U.S.\n\nThe FDA already granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for povetacicept in IgA nephropathy. Vertex is on track to file for accelerated approval in the U.S. in the first half of 2026 if the 36-week interim analysis data is positive. Another key candidate to watch in late-stage trials is zimislecel, a potential one-time functional cure for type 1 diabetes using stem cell-derived islet cells. The phase 3 trial continues to enroll and dose patients, and the goal is to file for approval after one year of insulin-free follow-up.\nSo, there could be several new regulatory filings and approvals on the horizon for Vertex in 2026 and 2027. Vertex reported revenue that surpassed $3 billion in Q3 2025, up 11% from the year-ago quarter. It also generated net income of $1.1 billion in the quarter. If you want to invest in a growth-oriented healthcare stock with a tremendous runway still ahead, this looks like a business well worth buying. Its strategy of serial innovation and diversification beyond CF looks poised to drive significant revenue and earnings growth into the 2030s and beyond.\n\n3. TJX Companies TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX) has experienced a run-up of almost 150% over the last five years and has outpaced the growth of many of its fellow retailers thanks to its innovative, effective business model. TJX's off-price model, which involves opportunistically sourcing brand-name merchandise at a significant discount and creating a treasure hunt experience for shoppers, has proven resilient across various economic cycles and competitive threats, including the rise of e-commerce.\n\nManagement is targeting a long-term footprint of 7,000 stores globally, up from over 5,191 at the end of fiscal Q3 2026. So, there's a significant runway for physical growth in existing markets as well as new target markets. Unlike traditional retailers with seasonal stock, TJX stores receive new shipments several times a week to create an ever-changing inventory. This encourages frequent repeat visits from shoppers who enjoy finding hidden gems.\nThe unpredictability of the assortment creates a sense of adventure and reward, and because items are often unique and sell quickly, shoppers are incentivized to complete their purchases. Many TJX brands have a limited presence or no online presence at all, which also drives consumers to shop in person at their various brick-and-mortar establishments. TJX attracts a wide range of consumers across all income levels. In the current economic climate of 2025, TJX is thriving as cost-conscious consumers shift away from full-price department stores toward off-price options.\n\nIts stores tend to lack fixed walls between departments, which allows managers to quickly expand or contract categories based on current trends or local consumer demand. With over 21,000 global vendors, TJX's massive buying power ensures it is a preferred partner for brands looking to clear inventory discreetly and keep shelves stocked with desirable labels.\nTJX Companies performed well in the third quarter of its fiscal year 2026, beating Wall Street's expectations for both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue. The company reported EPS of $1.28 on $15.1 billion in revenue, 12% and 7% increases year over year, respectively. The company also returned $1.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends.\n\nTJX Companies pays a dividend that yields around 1% based on current share prices and has raised its dividend every year for almost three decades and counting. This looks like a top retail growth stock to buy and hold for the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "The Only Battle-Tested Retail Stock I Flat-Out Refuse to Sell\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 10:13 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: WMT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Consumers gravitate towards Walmart when they're looking to save money.\nShares of the retailing behemoth tend to overperform the market during recessions.\nAmazon is the e-commerce king, but it can't compete with Walmart's physical presence.\n10 stocks we like better than Walmart ›\nI don't generally buy stocks with the intention of selling them within a short period. However, there are situations -- whether business-specific, industry-related, or economy-related -- that cause me to finally cut ties with a stock.\nOn the other hand, there are a few stocks in my portfolio that I refuse to cut ties with, regardless of the environment. One of those is retail giant Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) . Walmart is a staple in the business and investing world and is a stock that has been battle-tested and stood the test of time.\nWalmart provides what people always seek There is no truly recession-proof stock in the sense of being completely immune to the negative effects of a recession. However, if we're referring to a company that historically overperforms during a market downturn, Walmart checks the box. And it all comes back to the company's core DNA: Selling everyday items at low prices.\n\nThe retail giant has done a great job of expanding its business with its annual membership, growing advertising business, and e-commerce presence, but when it's all said and done, Walmart's bread and butter will likely always be its brick-and-mortar presence throughout the country.\nWalmart sells products that consumers buy regardless of economic conditions, and during periods of higher inflation, it's generally the go-to for consumers seeking discounts they likely won't find at retailers focused on more premium brands and experiences. It's true that Amazon also offers lower prices than most retailers, but Walmart stands out because of physical convenience -- especially in more rural areas.\nThriving through some rough economic times Below is how Walmart's stock has performed since January 1990, with the grey vertical bars representing U.S. recessions (as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research):\nFor perspective, here's a quick rundown of Walmart's performance compared to the S&P 500 during some notable recessions:\nFrom the beginning of March 2001 to the end of November 2001 (the dot-com bubble bust), Walmart's stock rose about 14%, while the S&P 500 declined about 8%.\nFrom the beginning of October 2007 to the end of March 2009 (the Great Recession), Walmart rose about 8%, while the S&P 500 declined about 36%.\nFrom the beginning of February 2020 to the end of March 2020 (the COVID-19 crash), Walmart declined by less than 1%, while the S&P 500 declined about 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nPast results don't guarantee future performance, but Walmart has consistently proven it can thrive through tough economic and stock market conditions. It will experience volatility like any other stock, but it remains a reliable long-term anchor.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?

      "Content": "3 Must-Know Facts About Costco Before You Buy the Stock\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: COST\n\nWMT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Costco doesn’t try to maximize revenue from merchandise sales, instead leaning on its membership model.\nThe company’s massive sales base, coupled with a limited SKU count, gives it a tremendous cost advantage.\nThe stock still trades at an expensive valuation, but the market might never offer Costco at a bargain.\n10 stocks we like better than Costco Wholesale ›\n\nCostco (NASDAQ: COST) is a massive business. In fiscal 2025 (ended Aug. 31), it registered $270 billion in net sales. This huge sum makes it the world's third-biggest retailer, behind only Walmart and Amazon .\nCostco shares have historically performed very well. Over the past decade, for example, they're up 429% (as of Dec. 23), providing a nice boost to investor portfolios. The retail stock is down 7% in 2025, though.\nBefore you hit the buy button, here are three must-know facts about Costco.\n1. Costco's memberships are its money maker Through its 921 warehouse clubs, Costco sells merchandise ranging from groceries and apparel to electronics and home goods. But making lots of money on merchandise sales isn't Costco's key focus. The gross margin was just 11.3% in Q1 2026 (ended Nov. 23), which reveals that management implements low mark-ups on its inventory. Retail peers typically have much higher mark-ups on their goods.\n\nInstead, Costco runs a thriving membership model. Consumers must pay an annual fee to enter a warehouse and shop for items. Costco's membership count grew 5.2% year over year to 81.4 million in the last quarter, helping increase membership income to $1.3 billion. The worldwide renewal rate usually hovers around 90%, showcasing strong loyalty.\nMemberships introduce a high-margin and recurring revenue stream. And they have proven pricing power. They also drive customers to visit stores more frequently, so they feel that the annual fee is worth it. This might explain why Costco has a stellar track record of posting same-store sales growth.\n2. Having a massive scale helps tremendously Great businesses are those that have economic moats, a term popularized by Warren Buffett. Costco excels in this area. Its moat is supported by a powerful cost advantage . Credit directly goes to the company's incredible scale, as demonstrated by the previously mentioned fiscal 2025 net sales of $270 billion.\n\nThe average Costco club has about 4,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs). This is a significantly smaller number than the 30,000 SKUs a normal supermarket might carry. As a result of a narrow product focus, Costco buys large quantities of a limited number of goods. This gives it immense buying powerful and negotiating leverage over its supplier base, leading to low costs and everyday savings for shoppers. This cost advantage only improves over time, as greater sales support more supplier leverage that leads to ongoing savings. It's a positive feedback loop .\n\nStory Continues\n3. Even after a stock dip, the shares are expensive Since hitting a peak in February 2025, shares have fallen 21%. That drop has occurred despite Costco putting up solid financial results that don't indicate at all that it's losing its competitive edge. Investors might be interested in buying the dip.\nThe valuation still doesn't look like a bargain, though. Investors can purchase the stock if they are willing to pay a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45.7. This is an 81% premium to the S&P 500 index. Value investors might not be comfortable with this setup, as it evidently provides no margin of safety .\n\nThere's an optimistic view that investors can adopt as well. Perhaps the market will always give Costco a higher valuation because it's a durable, predictable, and stable business. This seems to have always been the case, as the financials are robust. Net income soared 241% between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2025. Costco continues to open about 25 new stores each year, too.\nIt's impossible to accurately assess market sentiment to figure out what the right valuation should be. But I believe there is some merit to the argument that Costco shares will never trade at an optically cheap P/E multiple.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?

      "Content": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy and Hold for at Least a Decade\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:35 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNFLX\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Amazon's AI solutions are getting a lot of attention, but its advertising business is another key tailwind in addition to e-commerce.\nNetflix is getting a lot of coverage for a potential acquisition, but its flagship businesses are sticky on their own.\nNvidia is arguably one of the most popular AI stocks, and for good reason.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCompanies usually perform a stock split when their stock price has risen due to strong performance and management is optimistic about continued growth. The announcement of a split can be interpreted as a bullish signal by company insiders, which may attract more investor interest. Plenty of stocks have initiated splits over the last few years, but not all of these companies are created equal.\nOn that note, here are three stock-split stocks to buy and hold for at least a decade if you have investment capital to put to work right now.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has split its stock four times, with the most recent being a 20-for-1 split in June 2022 following earlier splits in June 1998, January 1999, and September 1999. The 2022 split was a significant event, as it was the first in over two decades. Since that recent split, shares have soared by around 170%.\n\nAmazon Web Services ( AWS ) is the world's leading global cloud infrastructure provider and the key catalyst behind Amazon's exceptional operating profits. The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) presents a significant tailwind for AWS, as companies require massive computing power and infrastructure to support AI applications. Amazon's heavy investment in custom AI chips (like Trainium and Inferentia) positions it to offer cost-effective solutions and maintain its market leadership in the AI era.\nAmazon's advertising business has emerged as a major profit driver, growing faster than its e-commerce business and operating at high margins. By owning the point of sale and leveraging vast amounts of first-party customer data, Amazon provides highly effective, intent-driven advertising opportunities that are a major draw for sellers and brands.\n\nWhile the e-commerce segment's growth rate is maturing, it still has an unrivaled scale and a strong competitive moat built on its vast logistics network, wide selection, and low prices. The company's investments in automation and robotics are expected to further boost efficiency and expand profit margins in the coming years.\nThe Prime membership program, with over 240 million members worldwide, creates strong customer loyalty and a powerful network effect. Its integrated benefits, including fast shipping, streaming business (Prime), and healthcare (Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical), encourage members to spend more within Amazon's ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nIn Q3, net sales grew 13% year over year to $180.2 billion. Amazon reported operating income of $17.4 billion, and AWS delivered accelerated growth to 20% (totaling $33 billion), thanks to its dominance in supporting AI workloads. The advertising segment's revenue rose 22% to $17.7 billion. Amazon still looks like a compelling buy to hold on to for many years to come.\n\n2. Netflix Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has split its stock multiple times, with three significant stock splits in its history: a 2-for-1 split in 2004, a 7-for-1 split in 2015, and most recently, a 10-for-1 split in November 2025. That most recent split took effect Nov. 17.\nWhile subscriptions remain core to its revenue and profitability model, Netflix is successfully expanding into new, high-growth areas. The ad-supported tier is growing rapidly and is on track to double its revenue in 2025. The company is also venturing into gaming, live sports events, and merchandising, all of which could create multiple avenues for future growth.\n\nNetflix has shifted its focus from pure subscriber growth to profitable expansion, which has effectively to expanded its operating margins and achieved significant free cash flow generation. In Q3 2025, Netflix's revenue was $11.5 billion (up 17% year over year), but its operating margin was 28%, while its free cash flow surged to $2.7 billion. Netflix also expects to report free cash flow of approximately $9 billion in 2025 on the whole.\nNetflix has established itself as the preeminent global streaming service. While the U.S. and Canadian markets are nearing saturation, there remains significant room for subscriber growth in international markets, such as Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The company's strategy of producing high-quality, localized original content that resonates globally (e.g., Squid Game , Stranger Things ) helps drive retention and attract new subscribers.\n\nNetflix has also demonstrated robust pricing power, increasing subscription costs without experiencing significant subscriber losses. The brand name is synonymous with streaming, and its vast library of content, combined with data on viewer habits, creates a strong competitive advantage that is difficult for rivals to match.\nProposed acquisitions, such as the potential purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery studios (though it certainly faces regulatory hurdles), could further solidify its content library and market dominance. Now looks like a great time to scoop up some shares of Netflix.\n3. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has split its stock six times, with the most recent split being a 10-for-1 split enacted on June 10, 2024. Before that, Nvidia executed a 4-for-1 split in 2021. Since the 2024 split, Nvidia shares have increased by about 55%.\nNvidia's strong position as the foundational technology provider for the AI revolution, combined with its robust financial performance and competitive moat, has driven the company to new heights of financial growth. Its most recent results for its 2026 third quarter (ending October 2025), included record revenue of $57 billion (up 62% from a year ago) and EPS of $1.30, thanks to booming data center and Blackwell GPU sales. Its data center division delivered $51.2 billion in revenue, up 66% from one year ago.\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 80% to 90% market share in the data center AI chip market, and its GPUs are considered the gold standard for AI training and inference. The company's key competitive advantage lies in its proprietary CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software platform, which has become the de facto standard for GPU-accelerated computing.\nMajor AI frameworks are optimized for CUDA, and the platform boasts an ecosystem of millions of developers globally who rely on CUDA to build and accelerate their applications. This large community creates a powerful network effect, offering extensive support, shared code, and third-party tools that competitors struggle to match.\nThe deep integration of CUDA into existing workflows and institutional knowledge creates prohibitively high switching costs for developers and organizations. Nvidia continuously optimizes the CUDA software stack for its latest GPU architectures, which ensures top-tier performance that often outpaces hardware-only competitors.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's next-generation chips (Blackwell and Rubin architectures) remains exceptionally high, with an order backlog of $500 billion through the end of 2026. Beyond data centers, Nvidia is expanding into robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial digital twins, which positions the business to tap into new, multitrillion-dollar market opportunities. That's a value proposition many long-term investors won't want to miss out on.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "2 Unstoppable AI Stocks That Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway Own\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Amazon is set for a comeback in 2026, helped by its cloud computing segment.\nAlphabet answered a ton of questions about the future of its business in 2025.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAlthough Warren Buffett is on his way out as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , studying his stock picks is a smart move for investors. He's known to be a value investor and only picks stocks that he understands, so when artificial intelligence (AI) companies show up in Berkshire Hathaway'w portfolio, investors would be wise to pay attention.\nTwo AI stocks Berkshire owns that I'm excited about are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Both of these stocks look primed to soar higher in 2026, and I think they make for excellent investments right now.\nBuffett may not have bought these stocks Although Buffett has been the primary money manager at Berkshire Hathaway, there are others who also have management over some funds. Todd Combs (who now works for JPMorgan ) and Ted Weschler ran a portion of the Berkshire portfolio and were known to invest in more tech-centric stocks than Buffett did. So, it's possible that the Amazon and Alphabet purchases were made under their direction.\n\nAlphabet is Berkshire's most recent purchase, and accounts for about 1.7% of its total portfolio. Amazon is a far older holding, and Berkshire has owned shares since 2019, although it only makes up 0.7% of its portfolio. With the size of the positions in Berkshire's investment portfolio, Buffett likely gave them the thumbs up to purchase these shares. So even if they weren't originally his purchase, he has still hung on to them.\nBoth Amazon and Alphabet look like great investments right now, so I'd be surprised if Berkshire were looking to pivot away from them.\nAlphabet and Amazon look primed to soar in 2026 Alphabet has had a great 2025, while Amazon's has been lackluster. Alphabet's stock is up around 60%, while Amazon's is nearly flat, rising only 3%.\nAlphabet's stellar performance comes after many doubted it could be successful in the artificial intelligence realm at the start of the year. There were concerns about Alphabet being broken up for a monopoly, falling behind in generative AI technology, and its cash cow, Google Search, being replaced by generative AI. However, none of those investment theses panned out in 2025, which is why the stock soared.\nThese same points that allowed it to soar in 2025 shoould continue in 2026, allowing Alphabet to continue down its path of dominance next year. With Alphabet leading the way in generative AI after trailing for so long, it opens up new revenue streams that could trickle in.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, it's potentially selling its custom AI chip, the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), as an alternative to graphics processing units (GPUs) on the open market for the first time. So 2026 could be a monster year for Alphabet, and owning shares like Berkshire is a smart move.\nAmazon's lackluster 2025 isn't on account of its business. Amazon has grown quickly for its size, with revenue rising 13% in the third quarter. The highlight of its sprawling business is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing unit. AWS is a critical part of Amazon, as it accounts for 66% of operating income despite making up just 18% of revenue.\n\nFurthermore, AWS just posted its fastest growth quarter in multiple years, which should have gotten the market excited about its prospects. However, the market mostly ignored Amazon in 2025, setting it up for success in 2026.\nI think Amazon could easily be the comeback stock of the year in 2026, and its dominance in the cloud computing realm, as well as its content strength in the commerce business, support that prospect. Buffett may be on his way out at Berkshire Hathaway, but his investment picks remain. With Alphabet and Amazon still being fairly large holdings, it's another vote of confidence for these two stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Most Wall Street analysts believe the stocks are undervalued.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $190.\nAmong 63 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 29% upside from its current share price of $488.\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft.\n1. Nvidia Morningstar analyst Brian Colello writes:\nTo summarize, Nvidia has an important competitive advantage in its full-stack strategy. The company is best known for its GPUs, chips that accelerate demanding data center workloads like AI training and AI inference. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it pairs best-in-class GPUs with CPUs, high-speed interconnects, and networking platforms, such that the company essentially builds entire data centers.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has spent the better part of two decades creating its CUDA software platform, which comprises an unparalleled number of code libraries, pretrained models, and application frameworks that assist developers. While custom AI chips developed by Broadcom may be cheaper, the total cost of ownership is often higher because they lack pre-built software tools.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia has over 90% market share in data center GPUs, a market where sales are projected to grow at 36% annually through 2033, and the company is likely to maintain its dominant position due to its full-stack strategy. Wall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 48% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2028. That makes the current valuation of 47 times earnings look cheap.\n\n2. Microsoft Microsoft is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for Microsoft 365 (a suite that includes office applications like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word), the company also has a strong position in other software verticals, including business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning.\n\nMicrosoft has added generative AI copilots to several software products and monthly active users surpassed 150 million in the September quarter, up from 100 million in the June quarter. And CEO Satya Nadella told analysts, \"Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot faster than any other Microsoft 365 suite. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.\"\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services sales. \"Azure has several distinct advantages, including that it offers customers a painless way to experiment and move select workloads to the cloud,\" according to Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff. \"Based on its investment in OpenAI, the company has also emerged as a leader in AI.\"\n\nMicrosoft owns a 27% equity stake in OpenAI and it has exclusive rights to the AI start-up's most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 and GPT-5). Also, The Information reports that OpenAI shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft under the agreement. Those payments will top $1 billion this year, up from about $500 million last year, according to TechCrunch.\nWall Street estimates Microsoft's adjusted earnings will increase at 16% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look somewhat expensive. But Microsoft topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 8% during the last four quarters, which makes the current valuation look more reasonable. Nvidia is still the more attractive option, but I think patient investors should consider buying a small position in both stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Watch: DebitMyData Human Energy Grid .\nThe Crisis: Billions Spent, Projects Stalled\nSince 2022, the world’s largest AI companies have pledged more than $200 billion to build data centers powering generative intelligence. Yet projects remain paralyzed across multiple jurisdictions — halted by community opposition, regulatory confusion, and growing fears that “AI progress” benefits only corporations, not citizens.\n\nDebitMyData’s solution reframes the equation.\nBy valuing human participation in data exchange, energy contribution, and consent verification, the Human Energy Grid introduces an economic model where infrastructure growth yields tangible local and individual benefits — aligning corporate expansion with community trust.\n“Before the Genesis Order, we already understood the next frontier,” said Preska Thomas,, Founder and CEO of DebitMyData, Inc. “The challenge isn’t building more compute — it’s building more trust. Without societal consent and economic inclusion, the AI revolution can’t scale sustainably.”\nPhase One: Building the Workforce Trust Layer\nDebitMyData.com serves as the activation point. Through it, the company is organizing and credentialing a next-generation digital workforce — those displaced or at risk from AI automation — into the coming grid economy.\n\nParticipants gain:\nVerified Digital Identities (DID): Anchored in secure, LLM-backed protocols enabling individuals to control, monetize, and consent to their data usage. Watch: DebitMyData Custom Logo and Facial Recognition .\nCreator Economy Readiness:Training and compensation models that align with the future AI-driven labor ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nCollective Grid Participation: Future integration into the Human Energy Grid, where digital identity links directly to energy, compute, and compensation systems.\nThis workforce mobilization positions DebitMyData as not just a technology platform, but a human readiness layer—the connective tissue between displaced labor and infrastructure modernization.\n\nPhase Two: Partnering for Ethical Infrastructure\nAs DebitMyData expands the DID and labor participation network, the company is laying the groundwork for the Human Energy Grid, a compliance-ready trust layer for data centers and AI infrastructure providers.\nFor technology giants and developers facing mounting public resistance, Human Energy Grid provides the missing compliance bridge:\nCommunity Consent Intelligence: Blockchain-backed verification that satisfies local governance and environmental mandates.\nPublic Benefit Integration: Energy, water, and data transparency mechanisms that turn traditional opposition into shared prosperity.\nRapid Onboarding:\nDebitMyData’s API and DID infrastructure retrofit easily with existing energy, cloud, and AI systems—no rip-and-replace required.\n\nWe’re creating the social infrastructure that lets hyperscalers build compliantly, governments verify trust transparently, and citizens profit directly from the AI age,” said Founder Preska Thomas. This isn’t just technology—it’s economic realignment.”\nThe Path Forward\nDebitMyData is not waiting for AI to displace millions before responding. It is architecting the response mechanism itself: a data economy that rewards human contribution as much as computational horsepower.\nFor workers,it’s a new revenue channel and pathway back into participation.\nFor governments,it’s a verifiable consent framework.\nFor investors, it’s the foundation of the world’s most scalable ethical infrastructure.\nFor hyperscalers, it’s the bridge from resistance to readiness.\n\nAbout DebitMyData, Inc.\nDebitMyData, Inc. is a U.S.-based technology company building the intersection of AI, energy, and human participation. Its ecosystem—anchored by DebitMyData.com and the forthcoming Human Energy Grid —creates a blueprint for ethical AI expansion, enabling communities, companies, and governments to scale intelligence with trust.\nRegistered with the U.S. government’s SAM system and assigned an official CAGE number, DebitMyData is eligible for federal infrastructure, cybersecurity, and AI trust contracts under the Genesis initiative.\nPress & Partnerships :\nMedia Direct Line: +1-754-315-2420\nEmail press@debitmydata.com\nWebsite: www.debitmydata.com\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/14664b9f-4b0e-40e2-9430-7ff648c8e588\nVideos accompanying this announcement are available at:\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5445850e-9a29-4229-a358-bf2f77778292\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/30effb7b-3512-4ef7-844e-caa2cf59b075\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in Right Now\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 10:50 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: WMT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nLLY\n\nABBV\n\nKey Points Amazon and Alphabet are key leaders in the AI race on top of their flagship businesses.\nWalmart benefits from consistent non-discretionary spending like groceries.\nEli Lilly and AbbVie are major pharmaceutical players that have impressive portfolios.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAttempting to time the market by identifying the exact bottom of a dip is very difficult, even for experienced investors. What appears to be a dip can turn into a prolonged decline or a falling knife, and you could just as easily miss out on the best market days to invest as you could the worst.\n\nInstead, by focusing your attention on making quality investments and additions to your portfolio in all market environments, you can withstand the highs and lows of market whims while enriching your portfolio over time.\nIf you have $50,000 to invest right now, you could choose to diversify that capital across a handful of different businesses. Here are five names that you might want to include on that list.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is known for its leading cloud infrastructure business and flagship e-commerce platform, but also boasts an ever-expanding presence across various sectors, including digital entertainment, groceries, advertising, and autonomous vehicles. Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) isn't just the most profitable segment for the company -- it's also the dominant player in the competitive cloud computing market and controls about 30% of this lucrative space.\n\nThe company remains the leading online retailer in the United States, with a market share of around 40%. Amazon is heavily investing in AI across its operations, from logistics optimization to developing custom AI chips like Trainium and Inferentia to offer clients a less expensive alternative to Nvidia GPUs . These innovations are designed to improve efficiency and attract new customers to AWS.\nOpenAI has signed a landmark, multi-year deal to use AWS's infrastructure for running its AI workloads, including the training of future models. Until recently, Microsoft was OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider. The deal is a significant win for Amazon, as it reassures investors that AWS can compete effectively with other dominant players in providing AI infrastructure.\n\nThe deal involves a massive commitment of computing resources, and Amazon plans to build dedicated data center capacity for OpenAI. It's also reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion or more in OpenAI. The investment would likely involve OpenAI using Amazon's custom-designed AI chips for some workloads to compete with Nvidia's dominant chips.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon remains extremely financially sound thanks to its strong balance sheet, consistent profitability, and expanding margins. Despite its status as a growth stock, the stock looks reasonably valued at approximately 27 times forward earnings.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has integrated AI seamlessly into its core products and created new tailwinds of growth for the business that long-term investors can capitalize on. The Gemini app alone has over 650 million monthly active users. There have been rumors that the company plans to monetize this user base through various forms of advertising, an area where Alphabet has long remained an indomitable leader.\n\nHowever, Google's Vice President of Global Ads, Daniel Taylor, and the official Google Ad Liaison account have publicly stated otherwise, so that remains unlikely, at least for now. The company is still actively monetizing AI in other areas, including AI Overviews in Google Search, and testing ads in AI Mode within Search. Meanwhile, the core Google Search business, along with YouTube, continues to drive profitable growth for the Alphabet ecosystem.\nGoogle Search & Other revenue reached $56.57 billion in Q3, a 15% year-over-year increase. YouTube advertising revenue surpassed the $10 billion mark for the first time in the third quarter (a 15% increase year over year). The Google Services segment, which includes Search and YouTube, also reported operating income of $33.53 billion (up about 9% from a year ago), despite absorbing a $3.5 billion European Commission fine during the quarter. And, consolidated revenue for Alphabet rose 16% to $102.35 billion.\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3 2025, and this segment's operating income increased by an eye-popping 85% in the same quarter. Alphabet's backlog of future cloud deals increased 79% in Q3. Alphabet also has potential future growth engines beyond its core businesses, including Waymo and advancements in quantum computing.\nDespite the stock's strong performance in 2025 (up over 60%), it trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 30. Alphabet also retains approximately $98.5 billion in cash against $22 billion in long-term debt. This stock continues to look like a no-brainer buy.\n3. Walmart Walmart (NASDAQ: WMT) is the world's largest retailer by sales. Its massive scale allows it to offer lower prices and negotiate better terms with suppliers, a significant advantage that helps it attract cost-conscious shoppers, including in inflationary periods.\nWalmart has effectively integrated its vast network of thousands of stores into its e-commerce operations and uses them as fulfillment hubs to offer fast delivery and easy in-store pickup options. This strategy has driven robust e-commerce growth (e-commerce sales were up 27% globally in Q3 FY26).\n\nThe company continues to expand into higher-margin areas like advertising and its membership program, which are contributing a meaningful share of operating income and bolstering overall profitability. Walmart also continues to invest in technology, automation, and AI-driven systems to improve its supply chain efficiency, inventory management, and customer experience, which could position it for long-term success against major retail competitors.\nIn Walmart's Q3, the company generated total revenue of $179.5 billion, up about 6% year over year. Its global advertising business clocked growth of 53%, bolstered by the integration of VIZIO and strong performance from Walmart Connect, while membership income increased 16.7% thanks to double-digit growth in Walmart+ and Sam's Club China memberships.\n\nHouseholds earning more than $100,000 accounted for 75% of Walmart's market share gains during the quarter. Approximately 35% of store-fulfilled orders in the U.S. were delivered in under three hours, with expedited delivery sales growing nearly 70%.\nWalmart is also a Dividend King, having raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years. This history of reliable payouts could appeal to income-focused, long-term investors and underscores its cash flow durability. Its current yield is in the ballpark of 0.8%, a bit below the average S&P 500 stock. While Walmart's trading higher than historical averages (about 38 times forward earnings), this stalwart consumer staples stock could be a smart addition to a long-term investor's portfolio.\n\n4. Eli Lilly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) leads the market for GLP-1 medications and has officially surpassed its rival Novo Nordisk . The market for these drugs is projected to reach over $100 billion by 2030, so there's a considerable long-term growth opportunity for the company to continue to capitalize on.\nIts dual-acting drugs, Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss), have shown superior efficacy compared to competitors in clinical trials, which has fueled a significant increase in Eli Lilly's market share.\n\nThe company has promising late-stage candidates, including the once-daily oral weight-loss pill orforglipron and the triple-agonist injectable retatrutide, which could further expand its market reach and offer more treatment options to patients. Eli Lilly has filed for FDA approval for orforglipron. It's a small molecule, easier to manufacture than peptides, and shows promise for diabetes as well as cardiovascular risk factors.\nRetatrutide replicates the effects of three different natural hormones: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon. By combining the effects of all three hormones, retatrutide is designed to be a highly effective treatment for conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and could serve as a future pillar of Eli Lilly's portfolio.\n\nEli Lilly has consistently beaten analyst expectations, with its third-quarter 2025 revenue soaring 54% year over year to $17.6 billion. The company has invested billions in expanding its manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and internationally to meet the explosive demand for its drugs.\nDespite the stock's high P/E ratio of around 34 on a forward basis, the company's strong growth prospects and dominant position in a revolutionary therapeutic area could warrant a long-term investment in this powerhouse healthcare stock. The company has also paid a dividend in some form since the 1800s, and regularly increases its payout. It's increased its dividend by a notable 15% for seven years in a row and counting.\n5. AbbVie AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) is benefiting from the burgeoning sales of its flagship immunology drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which delivered combined revenues of about $7 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone. These drugs are more than making up for the decline in sales of Humira, which was once the top-selling drug in the world, and have patent protection into the 2030s.\n\nThe drugmaker's overall net revenue for the three-month period totaled just shy of $16 billion, up 9% year over year. AbbVie has around 90 programs in its R&D pipeline across various therapeutic areas. Recent acquisitions have added promising new candidates to the mix.\nThese include candidates like Bretisilocin (from Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals) and ISB 2001 (from Ichnos Glenmark Innovation), and signal AbbVie's push into novel neuroscience and oncology, including psychedelic-inspired therapies and advnced antibody-based cancer drugs. Bretisilocin is a serotonin receptor agonist designed for major depressive disorder (MDD), while ISB 2001 is a T-cell engager for multiple myeloma.\nThe company has increased its dividend for 54 consecutive years (including its time as part of Abbott Laboratories ), which makes it another Dividend King on today's list. The current forward dividend yield is an attractive 3.05%.\n\nAbbVie stock trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 16. If you're looking for a quality healthcare stock to buy and hold for the long run, definitely don't overlook AbbVie the next time you go stock shopping.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Analysis-Waymo's San Francisco outage raises doubts over robotaxi readiness during crises\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPCG\n\nTSLA\n\nAMZN\n\nBy Abhirup Roy\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - A widespread power outage in San Francisco that led to Waymo robotaxis stalling and snarling traffic earlier this month has raised concerns about the readiness of autonomous vehicle operators to tackle major emergencies like earthquakes and floods.\nDriverless taxis from Alphabet unit ​Waymo, a ubiquitous feature on the city's streets, were stuck at intersections with their hazard lights turned on as traffic lights stopped working following a fire ‌at a PG&E substation that knocked out power to roughly one-third of the city on December 20, videos posted on social media showed. Waymo halted operations, resuming a day later.\n\nThe incident has renewed calls for ‌stricter regulation of the nascent but fast-growing industry as other companies including Tesla and Amazon's Zoox race to expand robotaxi services in several cities.\n\"If you get a response to a blackout wrong, regulators are derelict if they do not respond to that by requiring some sort of proof that the earthquake scenario will be handled properly,\" said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Waymo said that while its robotaxis are designed to handle non-operational traffic signals as four-way stops, they occasionally request a ⁠confirmation check. Though the vehicles successfully traversed more than 7,000 ‌darkened signals on Saturday, \"the outage created a concentrated spike\" in confirmation requests that \"led to response delays contributing to congestion on already-overwhelmed streets,\" Waymo said.\n\nRobotaxi operators around the globe use remote access by humans - known in the industry as \"teleoperation\" - in varying degrees to monitor and control ‍vehicles. Waymo, for example, has a team of human \"fleet response\" agents who respond to questions from the Waymo Driver, its bot, when it encounters a particular situation.\nBut such remote assistance has its limitations, and the Waymo outage highlights the need to regulate how robotaxi operators use the technology, said Missy Cummings, director of the George Mason University Autonomy and Robotics Center and former adviser to ​the U.S. road safety regulator.\n\"The whole point of having remote operations is for humans to be there when the system is not responsive in the way it should ‌be,\" she said. \"The federal government needs to regulate remote operations,\" Cummings said. \"They need to make sure that there's backup remote operations when there's some kind of catastrophic failure.\"\n\nStory Continues\nCalifornia's Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulate and issue permits for the testing and commercial deployment of robotaxis, have said they are looking into the incident.\nThe DMV said it was talking to Waymo and other autonomous vehicle makers about actions related to emergency response. It also said it was formulating regulations to ensure remote drivers \"meet high standards for safety, accountability and responsiveness.\"\n\n'A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW'\nDeploying and commercializing fully autonomous vehicles have been harder than expected with high investments to ensure the technology is ⁠safe and public outcry after collisions forcing many to shut shop.\nFollowing a high-profile accident in 2023 ​when a robotaxi from General Motors' Cruise dragged a pedestrian, regulators revoked its permit, eventually leading the ​company to cease operations.\nBut robotaxis have returned to the spotlight with Tesla rolling out its service in Austin, Texas earlier this year and CEO Elon Musk promising rapid expansion. Waymo, which has grown slowly and steadily over the years since its launch as Google's self-driving project in ‍2009, has also accelerated expansion.\nWith a fleet of ⁠more than 2,500 vehicles, Waymo operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Metro Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.\n\nThe company said the confirmation processes its vehicles follow were established during early deployment and that it was now refining them to match its current scale. Waymo is implementing fleet-wide updates that provide vehicles with \"specific ⁠power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively.\"\nBoth Cummings and Koopman said robotaxi operators should face additional permitting requirements once their fleets grow beyond a certain size to ensure that they have adequate ‌capabilities to deal with large-scale failures.\n\"If this had been an earthquake, it would have been a problem,\" Koopman said. \"This is just a shot across ‌the bow.\"\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Alistair Bell)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 Unbelievable Growth Stocks to Buy Before They Soar in 2026\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 5:06 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI) represent tremendous opportunities for consumers and investors alike.\nIonQ is in its early growth stages, but has recently made some stunning breakthroughs.\nAmazon continues to derive growth from its flagship businesses, and its investments in AI are ushering in a new era of gains.\n10 stocks we like better than IonQ ›\n\nAs investors near the end of 2026 and look ahead to 2026, some use this time to make resolutions about their finances and portfolios. If you have cash to invest in the stock market, money that you don't need for near-term obligations like bills, there are plenty of quality stocks vying for your attention that offer the opportunity to invest.\nWhen investing for the long term, you should be focused on quality businesses that you would feel comfortable buying and holding stock in for at least three to five years, if not longer. If you're looking for top growth stocks to buy that could easily see a run-up in 2026 and well beyond, here are two names to consider.\n1. IonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is a pure-play quantum computing company. If you're not familiar with this one, the company builds quantum computers using a unique trapped-ion technology, which uses individual ions (charged atoms) manipulated by lasers to perform computations. This method offers high accuracy and can operate at room temperature, which distinguishes IonQ from its quantum computing competitors, who often use expensive, cryogenically cooled superconducting systems.\n\nIonQ makes its quantum computers available through third-party cloud platforms, including Amazon 's (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS Amazon Braket, Microsoft 's Azure Quantum, and Alphabet 's Google Cloud. A significant portion of IonQ's resources are dedicated to R&D to improve the performance, accuracy, and scalability of its quantum systems. Through strategic acquisitions, IonQ is expanding into quantum networking, security, and sensing applications as it works to achieve its goal of building a full-stack quantum platform.\nIonQ's revenue streams are centered on making its quantum power accessible and applicable to real-world problems. Its primary revenue source is selling access to its quantum computing power on a per-use or subscription basis through cloud partnerships and its own cloud service. IonQ also earns revenue from selling specialized quantum computing hardware systems to select customers like government labs and research institutions, along with associated maintenance and support services.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company has also secured contracts with various entities (e.g., the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and AstraZeneca ) for research collaborations, technology development partnerships, and consulting services to co-develop algorithms for specific applications like materials science or drug discovery.\n\nIonQ exceeded its revenue guidance in Q3 2025, driven partly by recent strategic acquisitions like Oxford Ionics and Capella Space, and delivered $39.9 million on the top line. That was a 222% increase year over year. Despite operating at a loss, IonQ ended the quarter with a robust cash and investment position of $1.5 billion.\nPerhaps the most standout development from the quarter was the fact that IonQ achieved an Algorithmic Qubit score of #AQ 64 on its fifth-generation IonQ Tempo system, three months ahead of its original year-end schedule. #AQ is a benchmark that measures a quantum computer's ability to run practical algorithms. Reaching #AQ 64 means the system can simultaneously evaluate over 18 quintillion possibilities.\nBut what does this mean for practical, real-world applications? Well, for one thing, achieving #AQ 64 means IonQ's quantum computers can tackle problems classical supercomputers can't. This includes real-world improvements in areas like drug development and discovery, financial modeling, logistics/supply chain optimization, and so much more.\n\nQuantum computing is a disruptive technology that could unlock trillions in economic value. This is a market expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 30% or more through 2035. IonQ's recent breakthrough in quantum networking could also expand its long-term addressable market. For risk-tolerant investors, this growth stock could be a compelling buy for the next decade and beyond.\n2. Amazon Amazon remains a powerhouse in e-commerce, cloud computing, and other core growth areas that continue to make this business a compelling business to buy and hold. The company's total revenue for 2024 was over $638 billion, and its net income nearly doubled from $30.4 billion in 2023 to $59.2 billion in 2024. The company is aggressively investing in infrastructure, especially for artificial intelligence applications, and Amazon plans to double its data center power capacity by 2027.\n\nAWS is the company's most profitable business and a primary driver of overall growth. AWS revenue in Q3 2025 grew 20% year over year to $33 billion, and delivered an annualized run rate of $132 billion. Strong demand for AI-related services is a key growth catalyst that's leading to a substantial infrastructure backlog.\nAdvertising services is emerging as a high-margin, fast-growing segment for Amazon, as advertising generated almost $18 billion in revenue in the third quarter alone, a 22% increase from the prior year. The introduction of ads on Prime Video and expansion into connected TV present significant future opportunities for Amazon to grow its foothold in the lucrative advertising space.\nOf course, there's still the core online retail business that continues to demonstrate solid revenue growth. In Q3 2025, revenue from online stores totaled about $67.4 billion, and third-party seller services brought in $42.5 billion. Those two segments realized growth of 8% and 11%, respectively, from the year-ago period.\n\nThe Prime subscription service bundles fast shipping and digital content, and creates a powerful customer loyalty network that reinforces Amazon's entire retail ecosystem, as well as its entertainment segment.\nAdditionally, Amazon is integrating AI across virtually every facet of its business, from physical warehouse robots to the digital shopping experience, as management aims to capitalize on operational efficiency and high-margin service growth.\nFor example, Amazon's generative AI-powered shopping assistant Rufus is fully integrated into the mobile e-commerce app and allows customers to discover products through natural language conversations. Amazon is using AI to customize search results, product descriptions, and even web store sessions for individual shoppers based on their intent and behavior. Increasingly effective agentic capabilities allow its fulfillment center robots like Proteus and Vulcan to understand natural language commands and act autonomously to handle complex tasks.\n\nAmazon is developing its own AI chips, Trainium3 and Inferentia, to lower costs for training and deploying AI models compared to traditional GPUs. And AWS's Amazon Bedrock service allows businesses to build their own AI applications using a choice of foundational models, including Amazon's new Nova family.\nBear in mind that we're still in the relatively early stages of the growth potential that AI is expected to unleash, and Amazon stands to be a direct beneficiary of that trajectory. Long-term investors would do well to start or add to a position in this dynamic growth stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?

      "Content": "MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\n\nMarketBeat Staff\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: EVTL\n\nEVTWF\n\nMU\n\nPLTR\n\nCART\n\nA better-than-expected read for fourth-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) is adding fuel to hopes for a Santa Claus rally. But with thin trading volume, investors won&rsquo;t really know if that rally will take shape until next week.\nEither way, investors continue to climb the wall of worry that includes tariffs, inflation, jobs, and the potential bubble in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Much of this is due to the relative strength of the consumer, which will continue to be something to watch in 2026.\n\nNext week will be another shortened trading week. Markets will be closed on Jan. 1. This is a time for many investors to step away, but the MarketBeat analysts will continue to stay on top of the stocks and stories moving the market. Here are some of our most popular stories from this week.\n&rarr; Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nArticles by Thomas Hughes\nEarnings season is the time when many companies announce share buyback activity. This week, Thomas Hughes highlighted five companies that have some of the most aggressive share buyback programs and why those buybacks may drive stock price growth in 2026.\n&rarr; These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nHow do you know when a dividend stock is a keeper? This week, Hughes highlighted three companies that are raising their dividends within an environment where analyst sentiment continues to be bullish, suggesting capital growth to go along with that dividend growth.\n\nDarden Restaurants Inc. (NYSE: DRI) had a strong earnings report, but DRI stock has pulled back since the report. Hughes explained why investors should view this as a strong buying signal based on strong technical signals as well as bullish sentiment from analysts and institutions.\n&rarr; MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nArticles by Sam Quirke\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been a volatile stock in 2025, but Sam Quirke explained why the stock continues to have a bullish upside. In his latest article, Quirke explained why a recent failed pullback is likely to be the catalyst for the TSLA share price to move above $500.\nQuirke was also examining the recent price action in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). The reminder to investors is that, in periods of consolidation, watch what analysts are signaling, which in this case suggests bullish upside for AMZN stock.\n\nArticles by Chris Markoch\nThe S&P 500 has continued to make new highs. However, investors may want to watch the Russell 2000, which has been outpacing the market and could signal a surge in small-cap stocks. This week, Chris Markoch made a case for five small-cap stocks that could benefit as investors rotate out of big tech.\n\nStory continues\nPalantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) has rallied from a recent sell-off. Markoch gave investors three reasons Palantir will continue to be an essential stock in the AI infrastructure trade.\nIt&rsquo;s been a brutal year for beer stocks. However, a recent report from Goldman Sachs suggests that 2026 may be a time for beer to make a comeback. If that&rsquo;s true, Markoch analyzed two brewers that could give investors a buzz in 2026.\n\nArticles by Ryan Hasson\nRyan Hasson also looked at small-cap stocks this week by pointing investors to MarketBeat&rsquo;s list of the highest-rated small-cap stocks. Hasson highlighted the top five names on the list and explained the case for future growth.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been one of the best-performing technology stocks of 2025. So, is the recent pullback a healthy pause or the first sign of a correction? Hasson argued for the buy-the-dip story based on technical signals and institutional conviction.\nArticles by Leo Miller\nMarkets are expected to remain volatile in 2026. That's why buying stocks of dividend growers could be a smart strategy. This week, Leo Miller highlighted three companies that have aggressively raised their dividends and why each offers investors a reason to believe in capital growth that drives a higher total return.\n\nOn Dec. 22, three companies began trading as part of the S&P 500 Index. This stamp of approval generally gives stocks a short-term pop, but Miller explained why each company may give investors reasons for a solid growth story in 2026.\nSpace stocks have been strong performers in 2025, but three of these names have had strong insider selling in the last 30 days. Miller reminded investors that not all insider selling is equal, and that only one company may be sending a concerning signal.\nArticles by Nathan Reiff\nQuantum computing stocks have given off a &ldquo;hurry up and wait&rdquo; vibe in 2025. That can frustrate traders, but it may give risk-tolerant investors an opportunity to accumulate shares on every pullback. This week, Nathan Reiff provided investors with several reasons to believe that D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) could be setting up investors for a strong 2026.\n\nPrecious metals have been one of the strongest trades in 2025, and that strength is spreading to mining stocks. This may be a case where bigger is better, and Reiff highlighted three large miners with attractive setups for 2026.\nThe oil sector has been on the opposite side of the commodities trade. However, Reiff noted that the weakness in oil may create an opportunity for contrarian, risk-tolerant investors. Read his article to understand why three energy stocks may be worth holding until oil reverses.\nArticles by Dan Schmidt\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are ending the year on a bearish note. That may have some investors thinking about buying the dip in some Bitcoin stocks. Dan Schmidt explained why that may be a mistake for two notable crypto-linked stocks that carry risks because of their cryptocurrency exposure.\n\nFor many investors, the end of the year is a time to set goals for the following year. For investors who are resolving to take more profits in 2026, Schmidt offers up three stocks that look ripe for profit-taking as 2025 comes to an end.\nArticles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson\nThe &ldquo;AI bubble&rdquo; doom loop has been getting debunked this earnings season. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) was the latest company to deliver results that showed high-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand extending well into the future. Jeffrey Neal Johnson wrote this week that Micron&rsquo;s results also point to a more balanced revenue mix and pricing power that will boost earnings.\nJohnson also pointed investors to a value disconnection with Vertical Aerospace (NYSE: EVTL). The company doesn&rsquo;t get as many headlines as competitors in the emerging eVTOL sector, but Johnson pointed out that the company achieved a significant milestone that could vault it into the lead in 2026.\n\nMany investors are hearing about sector rotation, which raises the question of what smart moves investors should make in 2026. Johnson put a spotlight on two ETFs that provide exposure to sectors likely to be part of a catch-up trade in 2026.\nArticles by Jordan Chussler\nIn many cases, investors are better off ignoring headline noise. Jordan Chussler explained why that appeared to be the case for Maplebear Inc. (NASDAQ: CART), better known as Instacart. The company is the target of investigations into its pricing practices and transparency. However, investors have shrugged off the news and are instead focused on the company&rsquo;s strong financials.\nOil stocks are down, but energy stocks tied to rising electricity prices had a strong year. This week, Chussler highlighted one exchange-traded fund (ETF) that allows investors to capitalize on the historic and multi-year trend of higher electricity prices.\nThe article \" MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Where Will Alibaba Stock Be in 5 Years?\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 2:04 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: BABA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Alibaba's tailwinds include strong generative AI demand and expansion beyond China.\nIts key challenges include increasing competition and regulatory uncertainty in China.\nAlibaba should be able to deliver robust growth over the next five years despite its challenges.\n10 stocks we like better than Alibaba Group ›\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) is often referred to as the \" Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of China.\" The two companies' businesses are similar enough for the nickname to stick.\nOver the last five years, however, Alibaba's stock performance has diverged significantly from that of its American counterpart. While Amazon's share price recovered from the bear market sell-off of 2022 and is now up more than 40% since late 2020, Alibaba's shares have declined by roughly 40%.\nThat's water under the bridge now, though. Where will Alibaba stock be in five years?\nAlibaba's tailwinds You don't have to look hard to spot Alibaba's greatest tailwind. It's artificial intelligence, especially generative AI .\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Alibaba reported that AI-related product revenue soared by a triple-digit percentage year-over-year for the ninth consecutive quarter. Sales for the company's Cloud Intelligence Group unit jumped 34% year-over-year, with CEO Eddie Wu attributing the growth to \"robust AI demand.\"\n\nAlibaba Cloud ranks as the leader in China's AI cloud market with a market share of 35.8%. The company's full-stack approach to AI, providing infrastructure, large language models (LLMs ), and internally developed chips, gives it a solid competitive advantage.\nE-commerce remains a cash cow for Alibaba. The company's Alibaba.com, Tabao, and Tmall platforms are popular in China. Its Quick Commerce business, which provides super-fast delivery of groceries and essential daily products, is gaining momentum.\nAlibaba is also expanding beyond China. Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group (AIDC) operates globally and has achieved particular success in Europe and the Middle East.\nLike Amazon, Alibaba continually looks for new growth opportunities. A key focus for the company is the robotaxi market. Alibaba recently made a strategic investment in Hello's robotaxi business.\nKey challenges Don't think that Alibaba has a cakewalk ahead of it, though. The company faces several significant challenges.\nIncreasing competition perhaps deserves a spot at the top of the list. PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD) , which operates the Pinduoduo and Temu e-commerce platforms, has escalated the price war in China. ByteDance's Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) has disrupted how younger people shop online.\n\nStory Continues\nAlibaba can't buy the most powerful GPUs made by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . This challenge has forced the company to invest more heavily in developing its own chips. It also increases the risk that Alibaba will be left behind in terms of technology.\nBeing based in China comes with a web of issues. Regulatory uncertainty is probably the most worrisome problem. Although the Chinese government is currently supportive of tech companies, the threat of a policy change always hovers over Alibaba like a dark cloud.\n\nAnother factor that Alibaba must manage is the steep cost of building AI data center infrastructure. The company's capital expenditures could squeeze earnings over the next few years.\nA prediction for where Alibaba stock will be in 2030 Will Alibaba's tailwinds be sufficient to overcome its challenges through the end of the decade? I think so.\nDespite intense competition, the company's e-commerce revenue continues to grow robustly. The restrictions on purchasing Nvidia's GPUs could prove to be a net positive for Alibaba over the long term. The Chinese government knows that for China to remain competitive in the AI race, companies like Alibaba must remain strong.\n\nMost importantly, I expect that Alibaba's investments in AI infrastructure spending will yield significant returns. In particular, my hunch is that the adoption of agentic AI will generate tremendous growth for Alibaba Cloud.\nWhere does this leave Alibaba's stock in 2030? I predict that the Chinese internet giant's share price will soar by around 90% over the next five years to roughly $285. Alibaba's future should be brighter than its past.\nShould you buy stock in Alibaba Group right now?

Meanwhile, it's also using AI to help speed up delivery and save costs by predicting the best warehouses to store items, optimizing delivery routes, and helping drivers find difficult-to-locate drop-off locations in places like large apartment complexes. AI is also driving its high gross margin ad business, which has been one of its fastest-growing businesses. This is all leading to strong operating leverage in its e-commerce operations.\n\nMeanwhile, AWS, its cloud computing unit, is seeing strong growth. This should only start to accelerate in the coming years as the company has increased its capital expenditures (capex) budget to capture the demand it is seeing for AI services, and it has several large deals in place with Anthropic and OpenAI.\nDutch Bros Coffee shop operator Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) is one of the best growth stories in the consumer space, as the company has both same-store sales drivers and a long runway of expansion in front of it. The company has already been seeing strong comparable shop sales, driven by mobile order-ahead, menu innovation, and increased marketing. However, that is just the start.\n\nThe introduction of hot food items is set to be the next big same-store sales catalyst, as it rolls out these items to the three-quarters of its shops that can support them. In tests, shops with hot food items have seen a 4% sales lift, but that is likely to increase even more as it becomes more widely available and it throws more marketing toward the initiative.\nAt the same time, Dutch Bros has a big expansion opportunity ahead. At the end of Q3, it had under 1,100 locations, with plans to have more than 2,000 by 2029 and supporting around 7,000 in the U.S. over the longer term.\n\nStory Continues\ne.l.f. Beauty If my daughter's Christmas present haul is any indication, e.l.f Beauty (NYSE: ELF) is going to have a strong quarter led by Rhode. But in all seriousness, the Rhode acquisition looks set to be a big growth driver for the company over the next few years. Before being acquired, the skincare brand saw huge sales growth from just a small product assortment, little marketing spend, and no distribution outside its website. Once put inside the e.l.f. structure, this should change.\n\nRhode recently started being sold at Sephora, and after its exclusivity period ends, e.l.f. will likely begin to increase its distribution to other outlets, like Ulta Beauty . Meanwhile, the company has only offered around a dozen products, so e.l.f. also has a nice runway to expand its assortment, as well. And of course, the company can always put Rhode into its marketing engine.\nMeanwhile, e.l.f. still has solid opportunities with its namesake and Naturium brands, as well. The company should continue to take shelf space in the U.S., while it is still in the early days of international expansion. A price hike following the introduction of tariffs should also help boost revenue growth.\nThe beaten-up stock is not expensive, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of around 22.5 times a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio below 0.4 times (with below 1 times considered undervalued), making it a strong rebound candidate in 2026.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Amazon vs. Microsoft: Which Stock Is a Better Buy for 2026 and Beyond?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:26 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Amazon and Microsoft have both seen their cloud revenue growth accelerate recently.\nBoth companies are spending massive sums of money to capture soaring demand for AI computing.\nOne stock's valuation arguably looks more attractive.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) enter 2026 with the same headline tailwind: enterprises are rebuilding their tech stacks around cloud computing and generative AI (artificial intelligence) . Even more, they have similar headwinds: the capital-intensive nature of building out AI infrastructure -- and more AI demand than they can handle (or is that a tailwind?).\nRegardless, these are two great companies with stocks likely to perform well over the long haul, but one looks slightly more attractive than the other.\nAmazon: More than an e-commerce business If you think Amazon is primarily an e-commerce business, think again.\nThe company's third-quarter net sales rose 13% year over year to $180.2 billion, while operating income came in at $17.4 billion -- and AWS (Amazon's cloud business, called Amazon Web Services) alone produced $11.4 billion of that operating income.\n\nEven more, this lucrative cloud business is seeing accelerating growth. AWS revenue increased 20% year over year to $33.0 billion in the third quarter. That is a clear step up from the 17.5% AWS growth Amazon posted in the second quarter.\nAnd it gets better. Amazon has another fast-growing profit lever beyond e-commerce: advertising. The company's third-quarter advertising services revenue rose 24% year over year in Q3.\nBut free cash flow is moving in the wrong direction. Amazon's trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased to $130.7 billion in Q3, yet free cash flow fell from $47.7 billion to $14.8 billion as capital spending rose.\nMicrosoft: a fast-growing software giant In a win for Microsoft over Amazon, its overall business is growing faster. The software giant's revenue grew 18% year over year to $77.7 billion, and operating income rose 24% to $38.0 billion.\nLike Amazon, Microsoft's cloud business is the primary driver behind the tech company's growth. Microsoft cloud revenue, for instance, grew 26% year over year to $49.1 billion. With that said, Microsoft's cloud business includes more than cloud computing. It's made up of Microsoft 365, Commercial Cloud, Azure, Dynamics 365, commercial revenue from LinkedIn, and more. Still, Azure (Microsoft's could computing business) is a key driver for Microsoft's overall cloud revenue. The company's \"Azure and other cloud services\" revenue increased 40% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's not surprising that, like Amazon, Microsoft is investing heavily in AI-capable cloud computing. The company is not only seeing growing demand from Azure customers looking for AI computing, but it is also integrating AI across its products and services.\n\"Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high-value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings release. \"It's why we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.\"\n\nThe tiebreaker So, Microsoft may be growing faster than Amazon. However, Amazon's AWS is the leading cloud infrastructure platform -- a position that may make its recent aggressive investments less of a gamble for its shareholders. Whatever the case, both companies notably have diversified businesses and have enough excess capital to invest heavily in the AI boom to capture any opportunities.\n\nThe tiebreaker probably ultimately boils down to valuation. Amazon's forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 28 is slightly below Microsoft's of about 31, giving it the edge (albeit a small one) in a head-to-head comparison.\nSo, if I had to choose a winner here, I'd choose Amazon. That's arguably the better of the two stocks for 2026 and beyond.\nOf course, there are risks for both stocks. The main one is that both companies' huge spending on AI computing doesn't pay off in the revenue and profits that management anticipates. Investors should keep a close eye on these evolving risks; if the AI boom fizzles out, investors may have to reassess whether these stocks deserve the premium valuations they currently have. But, ultimately, these are two stocks I believe will do well over the long haul.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that these stocks will almost certainly trade with meaningful volatility, given the constantly changing nature of their industries and their stocks' premium valuations. Investors who think Amazon or Microsoft look attractive today, therefore, should consider keeping any position in these stocks small, given the risks. They could always add more to their positions if the stocks take a hit.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal Is a Warning Shot to AI Rivals\n\nJeffrey Neal Johnson, MarketBeat\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 12:12 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points NVIDIA has solidified its leadership position by securing the industry's fastest inference technology to power real-time artificial intelligence applications.\nThe company used its substantial free cash flow to fund this strategic expansion while also returning capital to investors through a cash dividend.\nThis strategic move effectively neutralizes potential competition by integrating top engineering talent and proprietary technology into the NVIDIA ecosystem.\nInterested in NVIDIA Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nWhile the markets were quiet for the post-Christmas trading session, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) made a noise that will echo for years. The company announced a definitive agreement to pay approximately $20 billion in cash to license the technology and hire the core engineering team of AI chip startup Groq.\nThe timing of this announcement is poetic. On the very day NVIDIA is distributing its quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share to loyal shareholders, it is aggressively reinvesting its massive cash pile to secure its future dominance. The market reaction has been swift and bullish. NVIDIA shares climbed roughly 1.5% following the news, trading in the $188 to $191 range. This move pushes the company’s market capitalization firmly past the $4.6 trillion milestone.\n\n→ Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nWall Street’s reaction reflects a clear consensus: this is not just a purchase; it is a fortification. By securing the fastest chip technology in the market, NVIDIA is widening its competitive moat against rivals like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD). This deal helps ensure that NVIDIA remains the only game in town for the next phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\nHow Groq Solves NVIDIA’s Speed Limit To understand why NVIDIA would spend $20 billion on a startup, investors must first understand how the AI market changed in 2025. For the last three years, the industry focused on Training. This is the process of teaching an AI model, which requires massive amounts of raw computing power to crunch data. NVIDIA’s Blackwell and Hopper GPUs were perfect for this heavy lifting.\n\n→ These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nHowever, late in 2025, the market reached a tipping point known as the Inference Flip. Global revenue from using AI models (Inference) officially surpassed the revenue from building them (Training). While training is a one-time event, inference is a continuous, 24/7 utility, much like electricity. Every time a user asks a chatbot a question or a robot moves, that is an inference event.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Speed Problem As AI moves into real-time applications like voice assistants and humanoid robotics, speed becomes the critical metric. This created a vulnerability for NVIDIA because its chips were designed for size rather than speed.\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nThe Freight Train: NVIDIA’s GPUs are like massive freight trains. They have an incredible capacity to haul data, but they take time to get up to speed. They are optimized for throughput (volume), not instant speed.\nThe Formula 1 Car: Groq’s technology, known as the Language Processing Unit (LPU), is built differently. It is like a Formula 1 car, lightweight and capable of instant acceleration.\n\nThe Benchmark Gap Data shows that Groq’s LPUs can process between 300 and 500 tokens per second on standard models like Llama 2. In comparison, a standard GPU setup typically manages around 100 tokens per second. By absorbing this technology, NVIDIA ensures it owns the fastest solution for the fastest-growing segment of the market. This also addresses a total cost of ownership risk; because Groq chips are faster, they use less energy per task, which appeals to cost-conscious data centers.\n\nThe Smartest Deal in Tech: How NVIDIA Avoided the FTC In today's strict regulatory environment, a standard merger between a $4.6 trillion giant and a rising competitor would likely be blocked by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Regulators are wary of monopolies buying up their rivals. NVIDIA’s management navigated this risk by structuring the deal as a reverse acqui-hire and a non-exclusive licensing agreement rather than a traditional corporate acquisition.\n\nHow the Deal Works: Licensing: NVIDIA pays for the right to use Groq’s intellectual property in perpetuity, but Groq retains theoretical ownership.\nHiring: NVIDIA hires the majority of Groq’s engineering staff and leadership.\nIndependence: The Groq corporate entity technically remains independent, avoiding the mandatory antitrust waiting periods required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act.\n\nThis structure mirrors successful strategies recently employed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It allows NVIDIA to integrate the technology immediately without getting bogged down in 18 to 24 months of litigation. This speed of execution is a major bullish signal for the stock, as it prevents competitors from catching up while the deal is stuck in court.\nA Blow to Rivals Perhaps the most valuable asset in this deal is the human capital. NVIDIA has hired Jonathan Ross, the founder of Groq. Before starting Groq, Ross invented the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) at Google. By bringing Ross into the fold, NVIDIA has effectively neutralized a key competitor and deprived Google, its biggest rival in custom silicon, of the talent that built its foundation.\n\nThe Buy vs. Build Calculation: Why This Deal Was Cheap A $20 billion price tag is massive for most companies, but for NVIDIA, it represents a highly efficient use of capital. Investors should view this through the lens of buy vs. build. Could NVIDIA have built this technology itself? Likely yes. But it would have taken three to four years of research and development. In the fast-moving world of AI, three years is an eternity. By spending cash now, NVIDIA buys time.\n\nBy the Numbers: Free Cash Flow: In the third quarter alone, NVIDIA generated $22.1 billion in free cash flow. Effectively, the company paid for this entire strategic expansion with just three months of cash generation.\nShareholder Rewards: As a testament to this financial strength, NVIDIA is paying out its quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share today , Dec. 26. This proves that the company can fund massive growth while rewarding shareholders simultaneously.\n\nValuation Perspective Despite the stock trading near all-time highs, analysts argue that the valuation is reasonable given the growth potential. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 23x. This is significantly lower than its trailing P/E of around 52x, suggesting that earnings are growing fast enough to justify NVIDIA’s current stock price. By securing the Groq technology, NVIDIA protects these future earnings from competitive erosion.\n\nNVIDIA’s Evolution Into the OS of AI This transaction serves as a powerful reminder that NVIDIA is evolving. It is no longer just a hardware vendor; it is becoming the inevitable operating system for the entire AI economy.\nLooking ahead, investors can expect NVIDIA to integrate Groq’s low-latency technology into its upcoming Rubin architecture and its robotics initiative, Project GR00T . With fourth-quarter r evenue guidance projected at $65 billion , the company’s fundamentals remain flawless. This deal silences the bear case that competitors would eventually catch up in speed. For investors, the thesis remains intact: NVIDIA is building the foundation for the future of artificial intelligence.\nThe article \" NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal Is a Warning Shot to AI Rivals \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

ADBE’s Firefly, Express and Creative Cloud applications currently integrate models from partners, including Google, OpenAI, Black Forest Labs, Luma, Runway, Topaz Labs and Eleven Labs.\n\nAdobe’s launch of Premiere Mobile in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 strengthened its footprint as a leading provider of next-generation AI video editing. The company announced a partnership with Google and YouTube, which is helping creators receive Adobe Premiere’s video editing tools in a new content creation space called Create for YouTube Shorts at the Premiere mobile app. Expansion of ad network partnerships with Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Snap and TikTok is a key catalyst for Adobe.\n\nThe company has recently entered into a strategic partnership with Runaway, where ADBE will utilize Runaway’s video technology, along with its own creative tools, to develop the next generation of video workflows. Adobe will be Runaway’s preferred API creativity partner, which will help ADBE’s customers get access to Runaway’s latest models. Its latest models, including Runaway’s new GEN-4.5, which are available only in Adobe Firefly, will be available to all ADBE’s clients.\n\nApart from an expanding partner base, Adobe’s strategy of infusing AI into its portfolio is driving growth, as reflected by the fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results. Adobe exited the year with annual recurring revenues (ARR) of $25.2 billion, indicating 11.5% year-over-year growth, and management expects it to continue to rise to $25.6 at the end of fiscal 2026. The Semrush acquisition is expected to further boost Adobe’s ARR growth.\n\nAdobe Faces Tough Competition in the AI Domain ADBE’s AI business is minuscule compared with Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenues are benefiting from growth in Azure AI services and a rise in the AI Copilot business. Microsoft now has 900 million monthly active users of AI features across its products, with over 150 million monthly active users of first-party Copilots. More than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, with major customers deploying tens of thousands of seats.\n\nAlphabet’s focus on leveraging AI to drive growth is a key catalyst. AI is infused heavily across its offerings, including Search and Google Cloud. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries. AI Mode is now available in more than 40 languages globally and has more than 75 million daily active users.

      "Content": "Meta Platforms' AI-Push to Drive Top-Line Growth: More Upside Ahead?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:38 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMeta Platforms META is infusing AI to improve content recommendations and ad ranking. This is helping the company keep users across its platform engaged. AI recommendations that deliver higher quality and more relevant content are expected to drive engagement. Vibes, META’s next-generation AI creation tools and content experience, is gaining traction. The company is using Meta AI (currently used by more than one billion people) to boost user experience. Business AI is also gaining traction with more than one billion active threads between people and businesses across its messaging platforms.\n\nThe ad business is benefiting from an improved AI ranking system. Annual run rate for META’s complete end-to-end AI-powered ad tools has passed $60 billion. In the third quarter of 2025, the average price per ad increased 10% year over year, benefiting from increased advertiser demand, largely driven by improved ad performance. Meta Platforms’ initiatives to unify different models into simpler, more general models, which drive both better performance and efficiency, bode well for the company’s top-line growth.\n\nMeta Platforms and its advertising peers, Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN, are expected to absorb more than 50% of the projected global ad spending this year and 56.2% in 2026. The company is also spending heavily on AI research, models, and infrastructure. META now expects 2025 capital spending between $70 billion and $72 billion compared with the previous guidance of $66-$72 billion range. For 2026, META expects significant growth in capital expenditure in dollar terms compared with 2025.\n\nMeta Platforms expects fourth-quarter 2025 total revenues to be in the range of $56-59 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $58.4 billion, indicating 20.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nMETA Faces Tough Competition in Ad Space Meta Platforms is facing tough competition from Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nAlphabet’s Search business is benefiting from AI infusion. The company has been actively embedding AI, especially within Search, to enhance user experience, provide better AI-focused features and consequently improve ad performance. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries, thereby driving monetization opportunities. The addition of shopping capabilities in AI Mode is now helping people shop conversationally in Search. Alphabet has added new AI features in Search that help users build travel plans. This is driving GOOGL's advertising revenue growth.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, Amazon’s advertising revenues increased 24% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company announced partnerships allowing advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify and SiriusXM Media through Amazon Ads, expanding its advertising reach beyond its own properties. The strong performance in advertising reflected successful AI-powered optimization of the platform and growing market share in digital advertising, providing a high-margin revenue stream that supports investments in other parts of the business.\n\nStory Continues\nMETA’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Meta Platforms shares have climbed 11.3% in the trailing 12 months, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 24.6%.\nMETA’s Stock Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta Platforms stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 7.22X compared with the broader sector’s 6.62X.

The reason is that AI is pushing the company to innovate, making its products better.\nI'd argue that OpenAI is actually one of the best things to happen to the stock. Before OpenAI came along, Alphabet was largely viewed as a great company, but one that was bloated and stagnant. However, competition not only brought out the best in Alphabet, but it also highlighted some of the tech innovations it had been working on behind the scenes.\n\nThe biggest of these behind-the-scenes innovations was its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Alphabet had been using and advancing these custom chips for more than a decade, but it wasn't until recently that investors began to see their importance. These chips give Alphabet a huge structural cost advantage, both within its cloud computing unit and also with training its Gemini large language model (LLM) and running AI inference. Now, even other companies are set to begin deploying Alphabet's chips at scale to run some of their AI workloads within Google Cloud.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has incorporated its Gemini model throughout its portfolio of products, making them better, which is driving revenue growth. Meanwhile, by incorporating AI into Google Search, Maps, and Gmail, as well as becoming an AI assistant with Android and soon Apple devices, the company is meeting people where they are active every day. That's just a huge advantage that will grow with time.\n\nRight now, Alphabet is in the midst of riding a virtuous cycle, given its vertical integration edge. That's why it's a stock to hold through any market crash.\n2. Amazon Like Alphabet, I really like what Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been doing behind the scenes. The company does not get nearly the credit it deserves in robotics, because it is using them in its own fulfillment centers to drive efficiency rather than selling them to generate revenue. But make no mistake: Amazon is one of the world's foremost companies in robotics.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company has more than 1 million robots in its distribution centers, all of which are coordinated by its DeepFleet AI model. These robots keep becoming more advanced and able to handle more complex tasks. Meanwhile, Amazon is also using AI to help reduce delivery times through optimizing routes, locating hard-to-find drop-off locations for drivers, and determining which warehouses are best to store certain items. This has been leading to strong operating leverage, with the company seeing its segment-adjusted operating income soar 28% last quarter on an 11% increase in revenue.\n\nAnd while its custom AI chips are not as battle-tested as Alphabet's, Amazon is also making strong inroads in this area, which should help power its cloud computing results moving forward. It built out a world-class data center for Anthropic using Amazon's Trainium chips, which is still ramping up. Meanwhile, Amazon has been in talks with OpenAI about taking a stake in the company, which would also see the LLM company start to deploy some of its chips for its workloads. The two companies agreed earlier on a seven-year, $38 billion AWS (Amazon Web Services) computing deal, but that would be powered by Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\nGiven its robotics and e-commerce leadership, combined with its position in cloud computing, Amazon looks like a long-term winner, whether the market crashes next year or not.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Those shares are now worth almost $700M.\nAST SpaceMobile successfully deployed BlueBird 6 on Wednesday. It is the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit.\nPlanet Labs ( PL ) reported record revenue of $81.3M in fiscal Q3. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672M.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAlphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) dominates the search engine market with over 90% share and powers billions of daily queries through Google Search. Its Google Cloud division has gained market share from leaders Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ).\nA lesser-known aspect is Alphabet also directly invests in public companies through its venture arms GV and CapitalG. This portfolio held 38 stocks at the end of the third quarter with assets under management of about $2.5 billion and spanning sectors like healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI), and technology.\nYet there is one sector where Alphabet has placed its biggest bets: space. According to McKinsey, the space sector is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, so it's not surprising Alphabet is attempting to cash in on the explosive growth expected. What's notable about Alphabet's space investments is that it has concentrated its focus on just two stocks, which comprise 45% of the portfolio's AUM at current valuations.\n\nAST SpaceMobile ( NASDAQ:ASTS ) and Planet Labs ( NYSE:PL ) stand out as the largest positions in the portfolio, so let's see whether they warrant an investment from you, too.\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) AST SpaceMobile builds a space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by standard smartphones. Alphabet participated in a $155 million strategic investment round in early 2024 alongside AT&T ( NYSE:T ) and Vodafone ( NASDAQ:VOD ), supporting the company's satellite constellation development.\n\nGoogle collaborates on product development, testing, and implementation for network connectivity on Android devices. In the first quarter of 2025, Alphabet added 8.9 million shares valued at approximately $203 million. Today, those shares are worth almost $700 million and represent the portfolio's largest holding, or 23.3% of the total.\nAST achieved a key milestone on Wednesday with the successful launch and orbital deployment of BlueBird 6, the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit. This validates its technology for direct-to-device connectivity.\n\nStory Continues\nThe satellite stock's shares have surged 270% year-to-date as it advances its launch schedule and partnerships with over 50 mobile network operators serving billions of subscribers. The stock has been volatile, but has gained significant ground as it attained new milestones.\nAST SpaceMobile's focus on eliminating connectivity gaps aligns with the growth in satellite broadband, but analysts still give it mixed reviews. Some rate it a Buy for its long-term potential, while others are concerned about execution risks, limited revenue, and ongoing losses. Weiss Ratings , for example, just reiterated its Sell rating on the stock while Barclays downgraded it in October from Overweight to Underweight.\n\nAST SpaceMobile is probably best suited for risk-tolerant investors who may see an opportunity in it capturing even a slice of the projected $100 billion satellite broadband market.\nPlanet Labs (PL) Planet Labs operates a fleet of over 200 satellites providing daily global imagery and geospatial data for sectors including agriculture, defense, finance, and climate monitoring. Alphabet holds a roughly 10% stake, with data integrations supporting Google Earth and AI models for environmental analytics.\n\nAlphabet's position in Planet Labs is currently valued at approximately $650 million after the stock jumped following its fiscal year 2026 Q3 earnings report, making it the portfolio's second-largest holding. The valuation is 56% above where it stood on the date of Alphabet's 13F-HR filing.\nPlanet Labs reported record quarterly revenue of $81.3 million, up 33% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672 million, driven by defense and intelligence contracts.\nThe space stock's shares have rocketed over 400% in 2025 following hefty earnings beats and analyst upgrades. Morgan Stanley hiked its price target from $4.50 to $20 per share, which suggests Planet Labs is fairly priced, but the consensus has a sub-$15 target, which is why the stock has a Hold rating overall.\n\nIn the expanding $1.8 trillion space economy by 2035, Planet Labs benefits from geospatial AI applications that should contribute to revenue growth outpacing the sector. Aggressive investors may view it as a thematic play, but most investors should probably wait for a more attractive entry point following its huge run-up.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog includeAnalog Devices, Inc. ADI, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Fortive Corp. FTV.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog: Buy 3 Tech Stocks as Santa Claus Rally Gets Underway The Santa Claus rally appears to have finally taken off, with tech stocks rebounding after a roller-coaster ride over the past month. Tech stocks had been taking a beating lately, but are back on rally mode, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time closing high on Tuesday.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Analog Devices, Inc. , Amazon.com, Inc. and Fortive Corp. , which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nS&P 500 Hits All-Time High The S&P 500 rose 0.5% on Tuesday to finish at 6,909.79 points, to hit an all-time closing high. The jump came as the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a pace of 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.2%, and a lot higher than the 3.8% recorded in the second quarter.\n\nThe report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could revise its monetary policy outlook for 2026 and go for more interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve had earlier hinted at just one rate cut in 2026.\nHowever, markets are now pricing in at least two rate cuts next year, given that the Fed is confident that inflation, despite being high, will ease substantially in 2026, and economic growth, too, will accelerate. Also, the Fed had earlier ruled out the chances of a rate hike in the near term.\nThe positive outlook supported by the latest economic data saw tech stocks rebound from their earlier lows. Investors have lately been worried about the profitability of the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Major AI deals reached over the past two months have raised doubts among investors about their sky-high valuations and fear that AI is yet another bubble that would eventually burst.\n\nHowever, those fears appear to have alleviated, with some major tech giants issuing better-than-expected profit guidance for the present and upcoming quarters.\n3 S&P 500 Stocks with Growth Potential Analog Devices, Inc. Analog Devices, Inc. is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.

      "Content": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\n\nNalak Das\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:38 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\n\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of the three above-mentioned stocks year to date.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon.com Inc. Global e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN’s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon’s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is “Growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”\n\nExtensive AI Applications Amazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called “Project Rainier.” This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\n\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers’ queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\n\nStory Continues\nAMZN’s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance Amazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft Corp. Microsoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT’s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company’s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT’s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength Microsoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN’s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT’s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook For the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\n\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc. The undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\n\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company’s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\n\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions Zacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has described these as “rumors.”\nAWS Outage On Christmas Outage-tracking service Downdetector posted that user reports had been flagging problems with Amazon Web Services since 8:41 p.m. EST, asking followers how the disruption was affecting them and tagging the issue with the hashtag #AmazonWebServicesDown. The service also directed users to its dedicated AWS status page, where live charts showed a surge in complaints tied to the cloud giant.\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nDowndetector data indicated 3,659 reports of AWS outages as of 10:52 p.m. (EST). An Amazon spokesperson told Benzinga over email that claims of AWS outage were without “factual basis.”\nOn the question of Downdetector reports, the company said, “Downdetector is not a reliable source.

      "Content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year\n\nJoel South\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nORCL\n\nKey Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms.\nMicrosoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) gained 1.96% over the past five trading sessions after losing 0.03% the five prior. That brings MSFT's year-to-date gain to 16.59%, including a nearly 38% gain since its year-to-date low on April 8.\nWhen the Magnificent Seven member reported FY 2026 Q1 earnings on Oct. 29, 2025, shares fell despite beating on EPS and revenue. The company announced earnings of $3.72 per share versus analysts' expectations of $3.67, and quarterly revenue of $77.67 billion versus analysts' expectations of $75.33 billion.\nOn Oct. 1, 2025, the company announced that it was increasing its Xbox Game Pass subscription by 50%. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft saw more than 8% of revenue derived from its gaming segment, which now boasts 50 million monthly active subscribers and nearly $5 billion in YoY revenue.\n\nMicrosoft's decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth.\nWhy Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) AWS.\nIn June, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 39% in FY25 Q4, driven by AI services.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect the company's capex to remain elevated to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth.\n\nTariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year.\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft's AI and cloud momentum.\n\nMicrosoft As a Stock Broadly, 34 Wall Street analysts' remain bullish, with 32 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a \"Buy\" rating, two assigning it a \"Hold\" rating and none assigning it a \"Sell\" rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating. Wall Street's price targets cover a significant range, spanning $500 per share on the low end to $700 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $631.36, which represents 29.37% potential upside from today's share price.\nInstitutional ownership currently stands at 73.74%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\n%Change From Current Price\nLow\n$500\n2.45%\nMedian\n$631.36\n29.37%\nHigh\n$700\n43.43%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s strong Azure revenue growth positions it for cloud and AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger.\n\n24/7 Wall St. ’s year-end price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying upside potential of 15.49% from the stock's current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and FY26 Q1 revenue guidance, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Is Amazon Stock a Buy Ahead of 2026?\n\nNauman Khan\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 3:29 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nCMCSA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nValuation momentum sits at the center of the buy case for Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) as investors eye 2026. Analysts expect FY2026 EPS of $7.85, and a conservative P/E midpoint of 45 puts a fair value near $353 per share. roughly a 52% upside from current levels.\nAmazon keeps growing its core businesses. E-commerce and Amazon Web Services still show double-digit revenue gains, and the company's digital advertising arm has been the fastest-growing segment for several quarters, outpacing growth rates at some larger rivals. That trend gives Amazon more levers to monetize traffic across shopping, cloud, and ads.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe company also moves into newer markets. It launched a cloud-gaming push with Luna in partnership with Comcast (CMCSA), and Zoox advances toward robotaxi commercialization in selected U.S. cities. Those projects could create bundles with Prime and drive AWS demand, but they also carry execution risk and require heavy investment.\nCompetition in cloud and AI remains a clear risk. Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) ramp up AI infrastructure and services; Google's recent model releases may influence some enterprise choices. That rivalry could pressure AWS pricing or slow market share gains.\nAmazon, however, displays some margin lift despite R&D increasing, implying that it is getting some operating leverage. Labor and automation remain some of the most important cost-saving actions, yet the figures for the headcount are. They are all about and should be in a dandy of a look.\n\nWhen the price-to-sales multiples are high, the market is essentially suggesting that it believes revenues are going to continue to skyrocket. When such growth stops, the stock would experience a sell-off despite continuously rising margins.\nTo investors, the question of whether to enter before 2026 is whether to take into account Amazon as a combination of opportunity surfaces, flexibility, combating huge growth and competition, and high expectations.\nIs AMZN Stock a BUY? Based on the one year price targets offered by 72 analysts, the average target price for Amazon.com Inc is $291.27 with a high estimate of $360.00 and a low estimate of $227.10. The average target implies a upside of +25.34% from the current price of $232.38.\nBased on the consensus recommendation from 71 brokerage firms, Amazon.com Inc's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) average brokerage recommendation is currently 1.8, indicating a \"Outperform\" status. The rating scale ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 signifies Strong Buy, and 5 denotes Sell.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Sells Amazon Stock and Buys an AI Stock Up 1,030% Since 2024 (Hint: Not Nvidia)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nAMZN\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points In the third quarter, billionaire Ken Griffin sold Amazon stock and bought shares of Palantir, a stock up 1,030% since January 2024.\nAmazon's investments in artificial intelligence are bearing fruit, as evidenced by its strong sales growth and expanding operating margin.\nPalantir is growing like wildfire amid demand for its artificial intelligence platform, but the stock trades at an absurd (and unsustainable) valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nKen Griffin runs Citadel Advisors, the most successful hedge fund in history as measured by net gains since inception. Additionally, Citadel outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 8 percentage points over the last three years. That makes Griffin an excellent source of inspiration for retail investors.\nIn the third quarter, Citadel sold 1.6 million shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and purchased 388,000 shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) , a stock that has advanced 1,030% since January 2024. Comparatively, Nvidia stock is up 281% over the same period.\nHere's what investors should know about Amazon and Palantir Technologies.\nAmazon: The stock Ken Griffin sold Amazon has a strong presence in three growing industries: e-commerce , digital advertising, and cloud computing . The company is leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) to increase sales and improve profitability across each operating segment, as detailed below:\nE-commerce: Amazon runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. It has developed generative AI tools for customer service, inventory placement, and last-mile delivery, as well as models that make its industrial robot fleet more efficient. Amazon has also developed an AI shopping assistant called Rufus that is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales this year.\nAdvertising: Amazon is the third-largest ad tech company and the largest retail advertiser, which is one of the fastest-growing categories in the broader digital advertising market. The company has built generative AI tools that let brands create images, video, and audio; Amazon has also developed an agentic AI tool that can research products and create campaigns.\nCloud computing: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud. It has added new platform services, like Bedrock for generative AI application development. AWS has also designed custom AI chips for training and inference workloads that provide clients with a less expensive alternative to Nvidia GPUs. More recently, AWS introduced AI agents that automate software development, security operations, and performance monitoring.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestments in AI are bearing fruit. In the third quarter, Amazon's revenue increased 13% to $180 billion, driven by accelerating sales growth across its advertising and cloud computing segments. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded 60 basis points (excluding two one-time charges) and operating income increased 23% to $21.7 billion.\n\nWall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look reasonable. So, why did Ken Griffin sell Amazon? Perhaps he was simply taking some profits. Whatever the reason, it would be wrong to assume he lost confidence in the company. Amazon is still one of Citadel Advisors' top 10 positions.\nPalantir Technologies: The stock Ken Griffin bought Palantir develops data analytics and artificial intelligence platforms for customers in the public and private sectors. Its key differentiator is ontology-based software, meaning its products are designed around a decisioning framework made more effective over time by machine learning (ML) models. Use cases span supply chain management, retail inventory optimization, financial fraud detection, and battlefield analytics.\n\nLast year, Forrester Research recognized Palantir as the most capable AI/ML platform on the market, ranking it above Alphabet 's Google, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure. The analysts wrote, \"Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market.\" Earlier this year, Forrester ranked Palantir as a leader in AI decisioning platforms.\nThat recognition from industry analysts has come alongside strong financial results. In the third quarter, Palantir's revenue rose 63% to $1.1 billion, the ninth straight acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings more than doubled to $0.21 per diluted share. Management said strong demand for its artificial intelligence platform was key to its strong performance.\nThe problem with Palantir is valuation. Shares currently trade at 119 times sales, which makes it the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 by a wide margin. AppLovin is the next-closest stock at 45 times sales. That means Palantir could lose more than 60% of its value and still be the most expensive stock in the index.\n\nConsider this: Palantir's stock price has increased 11x since January 2024, but its revenue has increased less than 2x. That means the primary reason the stock price has increased is that investors are happily paying higher price-to-sales multiples. Indeed, the stock traded at 18 times sales in January 2024.\nThat figure cannot keep expanding indefinitely. Valuation will matter at some point. When that day comes, Palantir is likely to crash. I'm not sure why Griffin bought shares of Palantir in the third quarter, but investors should not assume he has a great deal of conviction in the company: Palantir does not rank among his top 300 holdings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?

      "Content": "After 23 years working for Jeff Bezos, the CEO of a $1.3 billion skills platform shares lessons he learned from Andy Jassy and the Amazon founder\n\nEleanor Pringle\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 12:02 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nCOUR\n\nIn 1997, the day before Greg Hart joined Amazon , he was summoned to a meeting—on a Sunday—with its founder, Jeff Bezos.\n\nAt the time, Bezos had interviewed virtually every one of Amazon&#8217;s circa 200 employees; Hart was one of the few the tech entrepreneur hadn&#8217;t personally appointed. Over the next 23 years at the online giant, Hart reported directly to Bezos as technical advisor to the CEO, and to Amazon&#8217;s current CEO, Andy Jassy.\n\nThe lessons Hart learned at one of the world&#8217;s most famous businesses have stayed with him to this day, where he leads $1.35 billion online learning giant, Coursera . Hart tasked himself with shepherding the company through a transformation—conveniently, in time for demand to explode, as job seekers and employees alike rushed to add an all-important AI qualification to their CVs.\n\nMany of the changes Hart brought to Coursera—and its more than 1,000 employees—will be familiar to Amazon alumni. Hart said that Bezos&#8217; practice of interviewing every employee in the early days set the tone as Amazon grew, explaining, &#8220;He wanted to make sure that the passion, customer focus, the high standards, and the move fast traits that the early set of employees had stayed true as the company grew in scale.&#8221;\nSo it made &#8220;perfect sense&#8221; when Bezos penned his now-famous letter to shareholders outlining the leadership principles and priorities of the business, because they &#8220;reflected&#8221; the day-to-day conversations in the office.\nHart wanted to embed a similar mindset at Coursera, he said: &#8220;I wanted to really transform the company and make it move at a faster rate and do a better job of serving our learners. I felt that one of the most critical things in doing that was ensuring there was really good cultural alignment, and so we introduced a set of leadership mindsets. We looked at some of the most successful companies in the world, we looked at either their values or their principles &#8230; and we created our own that we felt were very specific to both our business and our history as a company.&#8221;\n\nThat speed became critical as the AI boom transformed the skillset businesses wanted, with employees and job seekers racing to keep up. The platform is now home to more than 12,000 courses, 1,100 of which are based on generative AI—a 44% increase year-over-year. GenAI is significantly the most popular topic on the platform, both from individual learners and from employees with a subscription paid for by their employer.\nThe CEO was also keen to do away with unfocused company all-hands, and instead dusted off the Amazon playbook of focusing each of the meetings on a single leadership principle: &#8220;One of the things that I&#8217;ve just recognized over my time leading different businesses in different industries is no matter how clear something is in your mind, or your leadership team&#8217;s mind, you cannot repeat it frequently enough to the rest of the organization. They might not be paying attention, they may not understand it, they might have been in a customer meeting at that time, whatever, they might have missed it.\n\nStory Continues\n&#8220;Every month, one of my direct reports sends out an email with a video that talks about just one of our leadership mindsets. Every all-hands, we do the same thing. We&#8217;ll pick one, and have examples that speak to it, because it helps make it real for people and helps people have better context around it.&#8221;\n\nHow Hart uses AI at work A key focus for every CEO at present is how they can leverage AI at work, either within their business or in their own personal use. KPMG&#8217;s 2025 U.S. CEO Outlook found 74% of leaders said investing in AI was a top priority despite economic uncertainty, with 79% saying they were confident they were ahead of the curve on adoption and utilization.\n\nPreviously, CEOs have told Fortune they&#8217;re using AI for everything from recruitment to management, to meeting prep and document summaries .\nHart, an English major, is well-versed in the efficiencies AI can offer but said one thing he never uses the technology for is writing. &#8220;For me, writing is the way I think, and so trying to outsource that would be effectively giving up thinking,&#8221; Hart said. &#8220;So that would not be appealing or effective for me personally.&#8221;\nStaff across Coursera are encouraged to experiment with AI as they see fit, currently without any goalposts in place for what they should be trying to achieve. The most useful outcome of this approach, Hart adds, is that colleagues are sharing their use-cases and best practices in an internal forum called &#8216;AI Sparks.&#8217;\n\n&#8220;AI Sparks is a monthly meeting where people from across the company, at any level, are coming to share how they&#8217;re using AI in their job. Those are by far the most well-attended and popular meetings that we do at the company,&#8221; Hart said.\nA final lesson from Amazon prepared Hart for the era of AI: If you get too caught up on outcomes in the early stages of a new technology, you miss the bigger picture.\n&#8220;My perspective is we just want to get a workforce that is using it as much as possible, in as many ways as possible. Over time, we&#8217;ll start to be much more focused on quantifying the impact on all of that,&#8221; Hart said. &#8220;If we focus myopically on that right now, I think we would miss the opportunity to have a far greater impact down the line.&#8221;\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Expedia and Amazon\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 11:45 PM PST 14 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nEXPE\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL – December 26, 2025 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Expedia Group, Inc. EXPE and Amazon, Inc. AMZN.\nIndustry: e-Commerce Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2808394/weak-macro-cant-stop-e-commerce-stocks-expedia-and-amazon\nWhile macroeconomic challenges mount, the e-commerce market is growing through innovation, technology and insight, as it continues to take away slices of the total retail pie. Commerce Department numbers are proof of this trend: ecommerce sales in the third quarter of 2025 grew 5.1% over 3Q24 (1.9% sequentially), with total retail sales increasing 4.1% (1.5% sequentially).\n\nEcommerce accounted for around 16.4% of total U.S. retail sales. A point to note here is that consumers are increasingly blending their online and offline shopping experiences, so this distinction may soon become irrelevant. As a corollary, it is those retailers that have the capacity to sell through both channels that will be able to compete tomorrow.\n\nAmazon for instance started building its physical presence several years ago because nothing beats proximity to the consumer when it comes to retail. Our other pick Expedia is an online travel booking company. As consumers mostly book travel online these days, this business is growing strongly.\n\nThe convenience of online shopping remains the top reason for ecommerce volumes and this is particularly true of Gen-Z, which is, increasingly, the more relevant component of sales. Many of these buyers have grown up on the Internet and are accustomed to a high level of digitization.\n\nThey are also likely to hang out on popular social media platforms, allowing themselves to be influenced by the latest trends there. This is driving an entirely different perspective on the ecommerce space, one that revolves around digital influencers and appears to be expanding with more advanced technology such as AR/VR, social commerce and generative AI.\n\nConsumers appear to be more reticent about spending this holiday season. Adobe Analytics data based on 1 trillion+ visits to U.S. retail sites, covering 100 million products and 18 product categories, shows that ecommerce sales increased 6.1% in the first 6 weeks of the holiday shopping season ending Dec 12, reports Forbes. Significantly, customer returns were down 2.5%, indicating that customers have turned incrementally cautious because of the macroeconomic environment, and are using AI tools for more considered purchasing.\n\nIndustry Description Internet - Commerce continues to evolve as the technologies driving it advance.\n\nStory Continues\nOn one side are increasingly powerful and capable user devices. On the other are increasingly sophisticated platforms often combining chatbots, AI and social media. AI continues to deliver increased user satisfaction and is growing into a primary enabler.\nDifferentiation comes from better technology for improved showcasing, variety, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty, etc. as well as good customer service and more shipping options, which generally tip the scales in favor of larger players. Particularly so, because there is fierce price competition necessitating deep discounting in many cases.\n\nCurrent Trends Driving the Internet-Commerce Industry · AI is shaping up to be one of the major enablers of ecommerce , as customers get increasingly comfortable with the superior recommendations and personalization it offers. AI-enabled product search is very common today and all the major retailers offer shoppers some form of AI assistance. The latest development here is agentic commerce where LLM models like ChapGPT recommend products, compare features and complete the sale. Even if you’re unsure about what to buy, the statement of your general intention may be enough to complete a sale. Adobe estimates that AI-driven traffic to retail websites will be up 515-520% from the 2024 holiday season with November being the heaviest (up 758%). AI referrals on desktops will be up 74.5% and on mobile up 25.5%.\nThe total retail experience between physical and digital continues to blur as most consumers blend their online and offline activities. This usually takes the forms of research online and buy in-store or buy online and pick up in-store. Physical stores are increasingly experience centers allowing the traditional touch and feel that many customers can’t do without. It’s also evident that some customers prefer to walk out with their purchase. Therefore, a solid physical presence is undoubtedly a positive. Convenience is also an important factor, any experience that increases the speed of delivery/pickup is preferred. This may entail increased reliance on robots, self-driven delivery vehicles and drones that could ease bottlenecks and make deliveries smoother and cheaper. Therefore, it isn’t just the online-first retailers that are building a physical presence but also those that have traditionally been physical retailers that are digitizing to various degrees, or operating through their digital store-fronts.\nA trend that Gen-Z is popularizing is social commerce . Social commerce means the ability to discover, research and complete the purchase of products and experiences on a social media platform, often and increasingly more so, through influencers. With the influencer culture, user-generated content is reaching a new level of importance for brands on social media platforms. Brands usually have store fronts on these platforms where influencers also discuss their products, thus driving traffic to them. The social element of shopping that ecommerce had taken out is thus returning through this route. Since social commerce first became popular in China, it isn’t surprising that the Chinese social media platform TikTok that’s also very popular with Gen Z, is the number one place for social commerce. According to eMarketer via akeneo, 46% of Gen Z consumers are already using TikTok to initiate their product searches, rather than the traditional Google and Amazon. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and a host of others are also very popular. Instagram and YouTube are finetuning their checkout systems, so customers can place their orders in-app, without leaving their feeds (akeneo).\nAnother notable trend is a subscription format for repeat-use items. This makes it easier for the consumer to order and for the retailer to plan and identify loyalty. Retailers usually offer some kind of discount to consumers choosing this option, which makes it all the more attractive. Subscriptions have become more or less ubiquitous with repeat use items and this trend is expected to expand going forward as both tangible and intangible commodities and low-value and high-value items are increasingly sold ‘as-a-service’.\nThe macroeconomic situation continues to evolve , although we can probably say that a deep recession is unlikely. Earlier this month, the Fed took a cautious tone, with Powell saying that although official forecasts for growth and inflation have improved, there are risks to both. He warned that the jobs data could be overestimating hiring. Right now, the jobs market appears to be softening with new job openings declining in November and the unemployment rate rising. Consumer confidence dipped nearly 7 points in November with consumers expressing reluctance to buy big-ticket items. Although disposable income has increased in each month since May, consumers do not expect much improvement in future business conditions or the jobs market. The S&P Global said in its inaugural holiday sales survey report that the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop would result in a tempered outlook. The geopolitical situation is also volatile, and tariffs remain a bone of contention with major trading partners, so the negative impact could continue.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Strength The Zacks Internet - Commerce Industry is a rather large group within the broader Zacks Retail And Wholesale Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #79, which places it in the top 33% of 243 Zacks industries.\nOur research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. So the group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates positive near-term prospects.\n\nEcommerce being in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is the result of its relative performance versus others. What we’re seeing in the aggregate estimate revisions are some ups and downs in estimates over the past year. The aggregate earnings estimate for 2025 is down 5.5%, while that for 2026 is down 7.1%. The macroeconomic uncertainty, the cautious tone around rate cuts and fears of a possible recession are likely contributing to softer spending and thus estimate cuts.\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nIndustry Returns Have Been Sluggish Until August, the Zacks Electronic - Commerce Industry has traded relatively close to the broader Retail and Wholesale sector as well as the S&P 500, although it started treading water thereafter, continuing mostly at a premium to the broader retail sector.\nThe stocks in this industry have collectively gained 4.2% over the past year, compared to the 3.4% gain for the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector and the 15.8% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nIndustry Fairly Valued Historically, the industry has traded at a premium to the sector as well as the S&P 500. However, being more volatile, the difference has varied considerably. Its current price-to-forward 12 months’ earnings (P/E) of 24.03X represents a premium of 3.1% to the S&P 500 and discount of 2.2% to the broader retail sector. It’s worth noting, however, that the industry is currently trading at a slight discount to its own median level of 24.48X.\n\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio There are a number of stocks currently worth picking, especially because of the significant variety that exists in this industry in terms of lines of business, business model, location and so forth. This is also the reason that choosing can be tricky. We have used our proprietary ranking system to pick 2 stocks that appear attractive today.\n\nExpedia Group, Inc. : Seattle-based Expedia is one of the largest online travel booking companies in the world, operating through B2C, B2B and trivago segments. It serves leisure and corporate travelers. Expedia takes bookings for hotel and alternative accommodation, cruise ships, rental cars, air tickets and such other services. Through Expedia Partner Solutions, a B2B brand and Egencia, it provides corporate travel management services. It also provides advertising and media services.\nExpedia is seeing growth in both B2C and B2B but the latter segment is growing faster by far, raising the corporate average. In the last quarter for instance, total gross bookings grew 12%, driven by a 26% increase in B2B. Similarly, the 9% revenue growth was driven by 18% growth in the B2B segment.\n\nThis strength is attributable to the way businesses are viewing travel. There is a greater focus on live events like seminars and conferences, for which attendance is going up. Business development has always been the biggest driver of corporate travel and this year is no different. But upskilling employees is close, possibly because companies are preparing their employees for the massive change that AI is bringing. In-person engagement with clients and partners, followed by conference attendance are the other factors responsible for the strength in business travel (Deloitte: Corporate Travel Forecast, Sept 2025).\nExpedia had discontinued its quarterly dividend since the outbreak of the pandemic, but resumed this year. This is an added positive for all investors, especially income-seeking ones.\n\nAnalysts appear highly optimistic about this company. In the last 60 days, estimates for 2025 have increased 96 cents (6.8%) while those for 2026 increased $1.54 (9.2%). At current levels these estimates represent 6.7% revenue growth and 24.6% earnings growth in 2025. The following year, revenue and earnings are expected to grow a respective 6.3% and 20.8%.\nThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is up 51.9% year to date.\nAmazon, Inc. : Seattle, Washington-based Amazon is one of the leading online marketplaces in the world. It has developed its business around the Prime loyalty program that drives sales across merchandise and media categories. The online business is supplemented with broad physical presence, augmented by the acquisition of the premium grocery company Whole Foods Market back in 2017. Amazon also enjoys a dominant position in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, courtesy Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe company’s sheer size and scale allow it to offer products at some of the cheapest prices. Amazon is known for its huge discounts and deals, and the number of services it piles into Prime has ensured a subscription revenue channel. Amazon has steadily increased prices over the years, but the user base remains sticky. Its profitability depends on the AWS business, where it still enjoys first-mover advantage. With access to humongous amounts of data, Amazon has developed some AI-powered products to make the most of generative AI and other developments in the space. It also uses AI and automation across the business.\nOne development of concern is the recent settlement with the FTC where it was proved that Amazon used unfair practices to trick people into taking Prime memberships and then made it very difficult for them to cancel or refuse it. Amazon was directed to simplify the process, remove ambiguities for buyers and also ordered to pay $2.5 billion ($1 billion in penalty and $1.5 billion in compensation). It is also required to abide by certain fair-practice directives.\n\nAmazon also announced a huge layoff of 14,000 staff that investors need not worry about. Amazon’s sales aren’t shrinking. On the other hand, AI is allowing greater efficiencies, such that certain management layers and HR staff are no longer necessary. Amazon expects the leaner structure to facilitate more nimble operation akin to a very large startup.\nDespite its huge business volumes, analysts are optimistic about double-digit revenue and earnings growth this year although the earnings growth rate is expected to come down a bit next year. Of course this is early days yet, and actual growth rates may be much higher. Amazon certainly has a great track record of beating estimates: at double-digit rates in each of the last four quarters, averaging 22.5%. For 2025, analysts expect 11.9% revenue growth and 29.7% earnings growth. For 2026, revenue and earnings growth are expected to be a respective 11.3% and 9.3%. In the last 60 days, analyst estimates for 2025 and 2026 have increased 31 cents (4.5%) and 18 cents (2.3%).\n\nThe shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares are up 1.3% over the past year.\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

      "Content": "Europe Could Wipe Out Hundreds of Unlicensed Crypto Firms Next Week\n\nLockridge Okoth\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:56 PM PST 4 min read\n\nA small EU nation is set to enforce one of Europe’s strictest crypto crackdowns, warning that hundreds of unlicensed digital asset firms could face fines, website blocks, and even prison time starting next week.\nThe central bank has made it clear that any platform continuing to onboard users or handle crypto without proper MiCA authorization after December 31 will be considered illegal.\n\nLithuania Draws a Hard Line on Crypto Starting January 1 The Bank of Lithuania, which oversees the country’s crypto sector, has urged all service providers to secure licenses immediately. While over 370 firms are officially registered in the nation, only around 120 are actively operating and reporting revenues.\nAlarmingly, fewer than 10%, or roughly 30 companies, have applied for MiCA licenses so far. This leaves dozens of active firms and hundreds of registered entities exposed to enforcement.\n\nA transitional period, during which crypto exchanges, wallet operators, and other service providers can obtain authorization, expires at the end of 2025.\nAfter the deadline, Lietuvos Bankas has stated it will take stringent action against non-compliant firms, including fines, blocking websites, and pursuing criminal liability under national law. Violations could carry prison terms of up to four years.\nDalia Juškevičienė, head of the Central Bank’s Investment Services and Undertakings Supervision Division, emphasized the importance of orderly shutdowns for firms that do not plan to continue operations.\nCustomers must be provided with clear guidance on transferring fiat and digital assets to other custodians or self-hosted wallets before services are discontinued.\nThe crackdown positions the Baltic state as a strict gateway for MiCA-compliant operations rather than a permissive crypto hub.\nAuthorities have warned that enforcement will go beyond targeting active platforms. Instead, it will target registered entities that maintain websites, accounts, or custody services.\n\nThis approach ensures the regulator can protect investors and maintain transparency and integrity in the market.\nEurope Tightens the Reins as MiCA Enforcement Moves from Theory to Action The looming enforcement follows a broader trend of regulatory tightening across Europe. MiCA rules, which establish licensing requirements and investor safeguards, are now moving from theory to practice.\n\nStory Continues\nThe region is signaling that unlicensed operations will no longer be tolerated, creating a high-stakes environment for crypto firms in jurisdictions seeking compliance.\nBesides Lithuania, another European country has similar aspirations. Bordering Lithuania to the north, Latvia is also working toward turning the country into another Baltic gateway to MiCA.\nMārtiņš Kazāks, governor of Latvijas Banka, the Latvian central bank, highlighted that the country has talent, entrepreneurs, and a sound financial infrastructure. Based on this, it looks to strengthen its economy by leveraging the crypto industry.\nAgainst these backdrops, global crypto platforms are moving quickly to achieve MiCA compliance before enforcement deadlines.\nKuCoin, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, has recently become MiCAR compliant following approval by the Austrian Financial Market Authority.\nThe exchange highlighted the value of regulated crypto access and its commitment to operating within the new legal framework in its announcement.\n\nCoinbase also followed suit four months ago, raising the bar for EU compliance with MiCA-compliant whitepapers.\nOutside Europe, Lithuania’s move mirrors developments in other regions, such as the United Arab Emirates, where sweeping Central Bank reforms have criminalized unlicensed crypto services, including self-custody wallets and market-data tools.\n\nThese parallel measures highlight a rising global emphasis on regulation, compliance, and investor protection.\nWith the December 31 deadline looming, crypto firms in this Baltic EU state have just days to secure licenses or begin orderly wind-downs.\nAs regulators prepare to act, the coming week could significantly reshape the European crypto arena, eliminating non-compliant operators and marking the beginning of a new era of strict MiCA enforcement.\nRead original story Europe Could Wipe Out Hundreds of Unlicensed Crypto Firms Next Week by Lockridge Okoth at beincrypto.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nHearten AI to Release the World's First AI Relationship Coach with Built-In Somatic Tools\n\nHearten AI\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:25 PM PST 4 min read\n\nHearten AI integrates nervous system regulation videos directly into chat to transform how people process and heal relationship dynamics.\nHELSINKI, FI / ACCESS Newswire / December 26, 2025 / The new version of Hearten AI , now available on iOS and Android, offers a groundbreaking way to break free from toxic relationship cycles. Designed for anyone feeling trapped in recurring patterns with partners, friends, family, or colleagues, the app uses AI-assisted coaching and embedded somatic tools to help users create real emotional change. Unlike traditional therapy apps, Hearten AI isn't built for diagnosis - it's a supportive structure designed to meet people in the exact relationship difficulty they're facing, offering science-backed psychoeducation, reflective dialogue, and practical body-based exercises. The result is accessible, empathy-driven coaching without the bias or superficial advice found in generic self-help tools.\n\n\"As someone who's worked at the intersection of wellness, design thinking, and AI, my philosophy for Hearten is simple: accessible healing, personalized safety, and actionable tools,\" says founder Shanshan Gong. \"From breakup recovery to rebuilding after infidelity and shifting long-standing patterns, our roadmap is about giving people clear, guided pathways for the specific relationship challenges they are facing - not just generic advice.\"\nWho Hearten AI is for\nMany of these midlife users are not just looking for quick tips; they want to understand and actively rewire the relationship patterns that have followed them for years. They may be recovering from divorce or infidelity, juggling teenagers and aging parents, or questioning long-standing dynamics in their closest relationships. For people in this stage, a tool that only targets thoughts is not enough - they need support that reaches the nervous system, where so many of their automatic reactions and attachment patterns are stored.\n\nHearten AI's approach is grounded in growing research on the brain-body connection, which shows that emotional responses and relational habits are deeply tied to the state of the nervous system, not just to conscious thinking. Instead of asking users to simply \"think differently,\" the app is built to help them feel safer, calmer, and more regulated in the moments that matter most. This is where its embedded somatic exercises come in: short, guided practices that can be launched directly from the chat to help users downshift from fight-or-flight, reconnect with their body, and create enough internal space to choose a new response.\n\nStory Continues\nAround these tools, Hearten AI uses a framework called \"regulate, resonate, regenerate.\" First, the app helps users regulate their nervous system so they are not overwhelmed by emotion. Then it guides them to resonate more accurately with what they feel and need in a given relationship moment. Finally, it supports them in regenerating new patterns - turning insights into healthier boundaries, more honest communication, and different choices over time. By making this process available 24/7, one conversation and one somatic exercise at a time, the app aims to make meaningful change feel less like a breakthrough event and more like a series of accessible, repeatable steps.\n\nHow Hearten AI Supports Toxic Relationship Healing\nHearten AI is built for the harder side of relationship healing: breaking toxic patterns, recovering from breakups, and working through infidelity or long-standing dynamics, not just getting quick tips. It invites users to describe what happened in a difficult interaction and then guides them with structured prompts, psychoeducation, and suggestions for next steps in love, family, and work relationships.\nSomatic videos are embedded directly into the coaching chat, so users can launch short nervous-system regulation exercises at the exact moment they feel overwhelmed, shut down, or triggered. This combination of reflective conversation, science-backed guidance, and in-the-moment body-based tools turns each session into a focused mini-coaching experience that can fit into a busy day.\nThe Science Behind Somatic Relationship Coaching\nMany people stuck in toxic relationships carry unhealed attachment wounds or complex trauma from earlier in life, which show up as patterns like choosing unavailable partners, people-pleasing, or staying in one-sided relationships. These patterns live not only in thoughts but in the nervous system, which can react to conflict or intimacy as if it is still under threat.\n\nSomatic and trauma research suggests that real change comes from repeated experiences of safety and regulation, not mindset shifts alone. Hearten AI uses brief somatic exercises and just-in-time support to help users calm their system while processing painful relationship events, making it easier to practice new boundaries, communication, and choices in real time.\nWhere to Find Hearten AI\nHearten AI is available on iOS and Android .\nAbout Somabrain, the Company Behind Hearten AI\nHearten AI is developed by Somabrain, a Helsinki-based startup founded in April 2023 by relationship coach & wellness entrepreneur Shanshan Gong. Somabrain's work sits at the intersection of behavioral science, somatic practices, and AI, with a mission to make nervous-system-aware relationship support widely accessible.\n\nBefore founding Somabrain, Gong launched a web-based, gamified app in 2022 that combined somatic exercises with situational AI relationship advice, which laid the groundwork for Hearten AI's current approach. Since Somabrain's official launch, the team has focused on bringing this vision to mobile, rolling out Hearten AI on both iOS and Android so users can access somatic relationship coaching anytime, anywhere.\nMedia Contact:\nCompany: Somabrain Oy (Ltd)\nContact: Gong Shanshan\nEmail: shanshan@heartenapp.ai\nWebsite: www.heartenapp.ai\nSOURCE: Somabrain Oy (Ltd)\n\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What Is the Smartest Quantum Computing Stock to Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nQBTS\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Pure-play developers like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum are the hottest quantum computing stocks right now.\nBig tech giants are also exploring quantum computing in addition to their established generative artificial intelligence (AI) products.\nNvidia is quietly building a quantum AI ecosystem that stands to benefit, no matter which systems succeed in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOne of the hottest pockets of the artificial intelligence (AI) realm in 2025 was quantum computing. Shares of pure-play quantum developers such as IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum each handily trounced the S&P 500 this year.\nWhat many investors might not fully realize is that several members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are also exploring quantum computing technology alongside their existing generative AI efforts. While Alphabet , Amazon , and Microsoft have received some notoriety around their custom quantum processors, I think there's a more lucrative opportunity hiding in plain sight.\nI'll detail how Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is quietly building a full-spectrum quantum computing suite, and explain why this could be a major catalyst for the company as the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure era begins.\nNvidia is laying the foundation between quantum and accelerated computing At the moment, quantum computing is an exploratory pursuit. While some businesses are assessing how the technology may be integrated within their existing AI framework, quantum technology has little use at the enterprise level today.\nAgainst this backdrop, pure-play developers are primarily focused on research and development right now. IonQ and Rigetti specialize in gate-based approaches leveraging trapped ions and superconducting techniques. D-Wave, for its part, is more niche -- focusing on quantum annealing processes for optimization tasks.\n\nThe main takeaway is that quantum pure plays are currently engaged with the actual physics behind the creation and configuration of quantum bits -- known as qubits -- within new computing architectures.\nAs mentioned, the big three cloud providers have each designed their own quantum processors -- dubbed Willow (Alphabet), Ocelot (Amazon), and Majorana (Microsoft). While quantum computing is not a meaningful contributor to their respective businesses at this time, it's clear that big tech is fascinated by how this emerging technology may eventually impact the broader AI opportunity.\nNvidia's approach is entirely different from that of its megacap counterparts, as well as the pure plays. Instead of building its own quantum computers, Nvidia is seeking to become a bridge between the software and hardware investments necessary to build these systems.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia offers a software platform called CUDA-Q, within which developers can write applications that work across a network of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (quantum processing units). On the hardware side, Nvidia has built a high-speed interconnect called NVQLink. NVQLink represents a pathway for QPUs and GPUs to seamlessly communicate without straining latency and bandwidth.\n\nEssentially, Nvidia's decision to provide a software and hardware ecosystem allows programmers to easily test their AI workloads across a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment. This is a particularly smart move because it positions Nvidia to be a beneficiary regardless of which quantum processor designs or qubit architecture emerges as the market standard down the road.\nWill 2026 be a big year for Nvidia? Nvidia's growth trajectory is directly tied to the budgets of big tech. As the slope of the lines in the chart illustrate, AI hyperscalers are accelerating their capital expenditures (capex) -- suggesting that data center buildouts, networking equipment, and chip procurement remain high priorities.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs suggests that the hyperscalers alone will contribute nearly half a trillion dollars to AI infrastructure in 2026. While this is great news for Nvidia in the short term, AI infrastructure is expected to become a nearly $7 trillion opportunity by the end of the decade, according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a couple of key ideas. First, Nvidia appears well-positioned to benefit from rising data center spend going into next year. More importantly, however, AI infrastructure is shaping up to be a longer-term secular opportunity.\nGiven these dynamics, Nvidia could continue receiving outsized demand for its products as quantum computing becomes a more meaningful contributor to the broader AI narrative over the next several years. So while CUDA-Q and NVQLink may not yet be major contributors to Nvidia's business today relative to its core compute and networking services, I'm encouraged by the company's pursuit of quantum computing and see these products eventually becoming an important storyline in its evolution throughout the AI infrastructure chapter.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a good buy? As of this writing (Dec. 22), Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 24. Considering Nvidia's current growth in combination with Wall Street's outlook, the stock is valued quite reasonably.\nIn my eyes, quantum computing represents just another pillar supporting Nvidia's growth arc as AI continues to dominate the market. For these reasons, I think Nvidia is headed for further valuation expansion heading into 2026 and well beyond -- making it a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "'No winner': Kosovo snap poll unlikely to end damaging deadlock\n\nIsmet HAJDARI\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:19 PM PST 4 min read\n\nBefore the first vote is even cast in Kosovo's snap election on Sunday, experts predict it is unlikely to end the political crisis that has been gripping Europe's youngest country for almost a year.\nThe Balkan nation has been politically deadlocked since the inconclusive vote in February, which outgoing premier Albin Kurti's Vetevendosje (VV) party won but without enough seats to form a government.\n\nAfter months of wrangling in a stalled parliament, the caretaker prime minister is going back to the electorate in a vote that analysts say will change very little.\n\"I think that the December 28 elections will not bring any clarity,\" economist Mehmet Gjata told AFP as he predicted Kurti's party would come out on top again.\nPolitical analyst Fatime Hajdari agreed that \"chances were high\" that VV would secure the most votes, but said little else was clear.\n- Charismatic Kurti -\nIf anyone can secure a majority, Kurti, once dubbed Kosovo's Che Guevara for his radical past, has a rare record.\nHis party swept to power in 2021 in the largest electoral victory since the country's independence from Serbia in 2008, taking over 50 percent of the vote.\n\nFrom a student radical to a political prisoner, Kurti's long path to the prime ministership has made him one of the most recognisable and influential politicians in Kosovo.\nHis blend of nationalism and a reform agenda has proven popular in a country whose sovereignty is still contested by Serbia, more than two decades after its war for independence ended.\nBut Gjata says things may have changed since Kurti's last term.\n\"I'm afraid that the current political crisis will repeat itself, because VV will not get more than 50 percent of the votes,\" the economist said.\n\"We will have no winner again.\"\nThe largest opposition parties have refused to join a Kurti coalition, all but assuring a fragmented parliament.\nThe only realistic challenge to VV would be \"cooperation\" between the three major opposition parties, former foreign minister and opposition candidate Enver Hoxhaj said.\n\n\"I think that only they can offer stability,\" Hoxhaj said.\n- Popular Serb policy blamed for 'instability' -\nFor Kurti and his party, countering Serbian influence in Kosovo has long been a focus, drawing support at home but criticism abroad.\nWhen Serbian forces withdrew under NATO bombardment in 1999, it left many of its state structures in place for ethnic Serbs who live mainly in the north.\nKurti has labelled these services \"instruments of intimidation, threat and control\" and spent nearly his entire second term uprooting the system -- and angering Belgrade in the process.\n\nStory Continues\nThe resulting tensions in the north, which last flared into violence in 2023, have drawn sanctions from the European Union and caused Washington to accuse Kurti's government of increasing \"instability\".\nBut among his voters, the removal of Serbian influence remains popular, Hajdari said.\n\n\"The extension of sovereignty there is perceived by the citizens as a major success,\" Hajdari said.\nMost opposition parties avoid the issue, but the Serb List -- which contests and retains most of the ten reserved Serb seats in parliament -- regularly clashes with Kurti's agenda in the north.\nThe minor party, with close ties to Belgrade, has previously called the government's moves in the north \"ethnic cleansing\" and has said they are willing to work with other parties to keep Kurti out of power.\n- A year of 'colossal damage' -\nWithout a parliament, key international agreements have not been ratified, putting hundreds of millions of euros in assistance funds at risk.\nTwo national polls and a local election have cost one of Europe's poorest nations at least 30 million euros ($35 million) this year.\n\nOver a dozen government institutions and agencies have also been left leaderless, as the mandates of their managers expired without new ones being appointed.\nGjata said \"colossal damage\" had been done to the economy by divided lawmakers over the past months.\n\"They have put Kosovo in a state of anarchy,\" he said.\nWhile lawmakers bickered, the cost of the crisis would be felt by the Balkan nation's citizens, Hajdari warned.\n\"That is precisely why Kosovo needs a stable and functional government that would focus on development and welfare.\"\nih/al/fg\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Only junkies gathering there benefit from it now,\" nextdoor neighbour butcher Arsim Futko, 62, told AFP.\n\nFor seven years, it waited for a European Union-funded revamp, only for the money to be suddenly withdrawn with little explanation.\nNow it awaits similar repairs promised by the national government that has since been paralysed by inconclusive elections in February.\nAnd it is anyone's guess whether the new government that will come out of Sunday's snap election will keep the promise.\n\n- 'Collateral damage' -\nCinema director Ares Shporta said the cinema has become \"collateral damage\" in a broader geopolitical game after the EU hit his country with sanctions in 2023.\nThe delayed repairs \"affected our morale, it affected our lives, it affected the trust of the community in us,\" Shporta said.\n\nBrussels slapped Kosovo with sanctions over heightened tensions between the government and the ethnic Serb minority that live in parts of the country as Pristina pushed to exert more control over areas still tightly linked to Belgrade.\nCultural institutions have been among the hardest-hit sectors, as international funding dried up and local decisions were stalled by the parliamentary crisis.\nAccording to an analysis by the Kosovo think tank, the GAP Institute for Advanced Studies, sanctions have resulted in around 613 million euros ($719 million) being suspended or paused, with the cultural sector taking a hit of 15-million-euro hit.\n- 'Ground zero' -\nWith political stalemate threatening to drag on into another year, there are warnings that further funding from abroad could also be in jeopardy.\n\nSince February's election when outgoing premier Albin Kurti topped the polls but failed to win a majority, his caretaker government has been deadlocked with opposition lawmakers.\nMonths of delays, spent mostly without a parliament, meant little legislative work could be done.\nAhead of the snap election on Sunday, the government said that more than 200 million euros ($235 million) will be lost forever due to a failure to ratify international agreements.\nOnce the top beneficiary of the EU Growth Plan in the Balkans, Europe's youngest country now trails most of its neighbours, the NGO Group for Legal and Political Studies' executive director Njomza Arifi told AFP.\n\nStory Continues\n\"While some of the countries in the region have already received the second tranches, Kosovo still remains at ground zero.\"\nAlthough there have been some enthusiastic signs of easing a half of EU sanctions by January, Kurti's continued push against Serbian institutions and influence in the country's north continues to draw criticism from both Washington and Brussels.\n\n- 'On the edge' -\nAcross the river from the Lumbardhi, the funding cuts have also been felt at Dokufest, a documentary and short film festival that draws people to the region.\n\"The festival has had to make staff cuts. Unfortunately, there is a risk of further cuts if things don't change,\" Dokufest artistic director Veton Nurkollari said.\n\"Fortunately, we don't depend on just one source because we could end up in a situation where, when the tap is turned off, everything is turned off.\"\nHe said that many in the cultural sector were desperate for the upcoming government to get the sanctions lifted by ratification of the agreements that would allow EU funds to flow again.\n\"Kosovo is the only one left on the edge and without these funds.\"\nih/al/fg\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "8 million minimum wage workers are up for a raise in January. Some will hit a historic $15 milestone.\n\nJuliana Kaplan,Madison Hoff\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:16 PM PST 3 min read\n\nNineteen states will raise their minimum wages in January, affecting over 8 million workers.\nSix states will reach at least a $15 minimum wage for the first time, over double the federal $7.25 minimum.\nFor the first time, more workers will live in states with at least a $15 minimum wage than the federal minimum.\n\nFor workers in 19 states, New Year's won't just mean festivities and futile resolutions — they'll also be getting paid more as minimum wage increases kick in. For some, those raises will be historic: In six states, the minimum wage will reach at least $15 an hour for the first time.\nThe 19 states hiking wages will impact over 8 million workers, an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, found. Women, Black, and Hispanic workers are set to be disproportionately affected by the new increases, per EPI's analysis, and workers in states like Missouri and Nebraska will see their annual wages increase by nearly $1,000 on average.\nThe map below shows which states are set for a raise in January, and what those increases will be. Most January increases are due to inflation adjustments , although some are tied to legislation or ballot measures, such as in Rhode Island , where legislation set a gradual increase from $15 in 2025 to $17 by 2027. The minimum wage there will reach $16 on January 1, 2026. A few states will hike their minimum wage later this year; Florida will increase its minimum by a dollar to $15 at the end of September.\n\nThe new round of raises will hit an \"important milestone for the minimum wage movement,\" according to EPI's Sebastian Martinez Hickey.\n\"What's really distinctive is that for the first time this January, there are going to be more workers that live in a state with at least a $15 minimum wage compared to those that live in a state with the federal minimum wage, which is still $7.25,\" Hickey said.\n\nHowever, the fresh round of statewide increases means an even greater discrepancy in some local wages and the federal minimum wage . The majority of states have stepped in to increase their pay beyond the federal minimum, although 20 states still either mandate $7.25 or default to the federal line.\nYannet Lathrop, a senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, said that while the new spate of $15 minimum wages will likely be a boon for many — and reflects a long history of organizing — workers will still contend with affordability concerns.\n\"Even these wages, as good as they are, as positive as they are for workers, none of them are going to fully cover the cost of living for even single workers without families in any state or locality,\" Lathrop said. \"These workers are still going to be facing a crisis of affordability. It's just that in some places where minimum wages are going up much more, the pain of that gap between what the cost of living is and what the minimum wage is going to be a little bit better for workers.\"\n\nStory Continues\nAs states opt to hike pay on their own, a federal minimum increase still looks unlikely. Democrats failed to garner any Republican support for an effort to raise the minimum wage to $15 during President Joe Biden's term. President Donald Trump had previously opened the door to raising the wage beyond $7.25, but there has been no legislative movement toward making that a reality.\nAre you set to be affected by a minimum wage increase, or currently make the minimum wage?

As capital shifts from model development to deployment, people are demanding more cloud capacity, superior compute power, and AI-ready data centers, making the demand hot.\n\nOne quietly notable name that has been catching Wall Street's eye is Nebius (NBIS). Wedbush analyst Dan Ives just listed NBIS as his top AI infrastructure pick for 2026, arguing the company’s positioning and tech make it a likely acquisition target for a hyperscaler such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), or Amazon (AMZN).\nMore News from Barchart Super Micro Computer Stock Tumbles, But Investors are Piling into Its Call Options - Time to Buy SMCI?\nA $61 Billion Reason to Buy Amazon Stock for 2026\nRKLB Stock Bullish Diagonal Trade Targets a Price of $85 by January 16th\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nFor investors looking beyond the obvious AI leaders, here’s a closer look at why NBIS is drawing bullish attention heading into 2026.\nAbout NBIS Stock Based in Amsterdam, Nebius provides full-stack cloud and GPU-accelerated AI infrastructure across Europe and North America. It builds sustainable data centers and rents AI‑optimized compute clusters with liquid cooling and high‑power GPUs to hyperscalers and enterprises. The company emerged from a restructuring of the former Yandex infrastructure business and now combines its core AI cloud service with subsidiaries in autonomous vehicles and education technology.\n\nValued at around $23 billion by market cap, NBIS stock has been stellar this year. After languishing post-restructuring, the shares rallied over the summer, in part when Nvidia (NVDA) disclosed a stake in the company, peaking above $140 by October. A surge in new contracts with tech giants, such as Microsoft and Meta (META), further fueled investor enthusiasm. Until now, Nebius has gained roughly 225% year-to-date (YTD), despite a pullback from the recent high.\nThat performance comes with clear trade-offs. Nebius now trades at valuation levels that leave little room for error. Its trailing price-to-sales multiple sits in the mid-50s, far above the sector median, which trades closer to 4x, and its own 5-year historical average, which sits at 24x.\nIn short, the market is pricing Nebius as a future cornerstone of AI infrastructure. That may prove correct, but it also means any slowdown in contract growth, pricing pressure, or capital-spending misstep could weigh heavily on the stock. At today’s levels, execution matters as much as vision.\n\nStory Continues\nImpact of Ives’ Acquisition Thesis Dan Ives’s endorsement, calling Nebius “ripe” for a 2026 acquisition by a hyperscaler, gave the stock a short-term boost. The day his comments were publicized, NBIS spiked about 14% following the news. Investors interpreted it as validation of Nebius’s strategic value. Ives specifically noted that among AI “neocloud” firms, Nebius is the most likely buyout candidate, which fueled positive sentiment.\n\nFor the company, this means fresh investor interest and higher trading volume, though it’s too early to say if any deal is imminent. In the near term, the news underscores Nebius’s industry stature; if true, a 2026 deal could be transformative. But even absent an actual acquisition, the hype helps spotlight Nebius’s core business and contracts, potentially improving access to capital.\nNebius Delivered Solid Revenue Yet Widened Losses Nebius delivered a strong quarter in Q3 2025, posting revenue of $146.1 million, up 355% year-over-year (YoY), as demand for AI infrastructure surged and large new contracts came online. This growth was largely driven by strong uptake across its core AI infrastructure business, which now accounts for the vast majority of results.\n\nProfitability, however, remains a work in progress. Nebius reported a GAAP net loss of $119.6 million, wider than a year earlier, reflecting aggressive expansion and rising depreciation tied to new data center capacity. But there was a bright spot below the surface. Adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed sharply to $5.2 million, a significant improvement from nearly $46 million last year, as higher revenue began to offset operating expenses.\nOn the other side, spending ramped up sharply as the company accelerated its buildout. Operating cash burn rose to $80.6 million, while capital expenditures jumped to nearly $1.0 billion in the quarter, underscoring how capital-intensive AI infrastructure has become. Even so, Nebius ended the period with a formidable $4.8 billion cash balance, supported by recent equity and debt raises, giving it ample firepower to execute its growth plans.\n\nLooking ahead, management remains aggressive. Nebius is targeting an annualized revenue run rate of $750 million to $1 billion by the end of 2025 and plans to scale connected power capacity to 800 to 1,000 megawatts by 2026, with even more capacity already under contract.\nCEO Arkady Volozh has said the company has effectively sold out its existing capacity, with future capacity already pre-committed. While losses are expected to persist in the near term, the strategy is clear: scale first, optimize later.\nRecent Developments Since the quarter's close, Nebius has continued to make headlines. On Dec. 17, it launched Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 featuring Nvidia’s new Blackwell ultra-power GPUs. The company said it is now “ the first cloud in Europe to operate ” these cutting-edge Nvidia GB300 and HGX B300 systems in production, a technical milestone for customers.\n\nNebius also highlighted its $3 billion AI infrastructure agreement with Meta (announced in September) as a revenue backlog boost. These announcements were viewed positively as further proof of Nebius’s scale and partnerships.\nAnalyst's Perspective on NBIS Stock Wall Street remains broadly positive on NBIS stock, though analysts are clear about the risks. Goldman Sachs reiterated a “Buy” rating in November 2025 and raised its 12-month price target to $155, citing accelerating demand for AI infrastructure and improving visibility on large-scale contracts.\nSimilarly, D.A. Davidson also maintained a “Buy” with a $150 target, while CICC initiated coverage at $143, pointing to Nebius’ growing role in global AI compute buildouts.\n\nTaken together, on average, the rating given by analysts is “Moderate Buy,” and the broader consensus sits at about $150, which implies roughly 70% upside potential, which shows analysts' confidence in Nebius’ growth trajectory rather than near-term profitability.\nHowever, that optimism comes with caveats. Analysts consistently highlight Nebius’ rapid revenue growth and ability to secure large enterprise deals, but many also flag valuation as demanding. The investment case assumes smooth execution, disciplined capital spending, and sustained customer demand. Any stumble could weigh heavily on NBIS stock.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump, giving Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin, Reuters\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:03 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 a.m. Pacific Time on Aug. 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia, AMD, OpenAI, Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\n\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThe transition to Tan comes as Intel is in the middle of an announced $28 billion project to construct microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany . While the factories were originally slated to begin operations this year, that has been delayed to 2030 at the earliest as Intel seeks buyers for the chips those factories are to produce .\n\nStory Continues\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 minutes in the Oval Office Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms - Walden International and Walden Catalyst - did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies, including coming to Intel's formal groundbreaking ceremony in Licking County in 2022 .\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nIntel's venture capitalist CEO Born in Malaysia to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger , and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA 'lifeline' for Intel So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Let's start there, explain that. I mean, is that is that valuation, Joseph, is it is it earnings growth, positioning, explain it.\n00:27 Joseph\nI think that there have been a number of businesses in the magnificent 493 that are perceived as being uh hurt or uh compromised by the growth of AI. Valuations have gone significantly lower for a number of those companies and businesses that are just not participants in in uh the opportunity of AI have also not performed particularly well uh in that bucket of the magnificent 493. And I think in 2026, what we're going to find is that many of these companies are harnessing AI to get better, to lower their costs, to improve the velocity of introducing new products, um, and those businesses will begin to get the benefits of that uh as people recognize it. It hasn't happened uh in the last couple of years, but I think we're going to notice that in the next couple of years.\n01:29 Speaker A\nWell, what does that suggest Joseph about what do you think I do with the Mag 7 though in 2026? You know, am I avoiding those names? Am I trimming exposure? You know, do I have to be more discerning? Maybe next year, Joseph, it's more like, you know, the mag three or four.\n01:46 Joseph\nI think so. I think the Mag 7 it's tough to paint them with a broad brush because each one of them has a specific story associated with them. But I think just from a valuation perspective and the fact that they've performed so well for such a long period of time, I think that some of them will take a break, some of them will perform well, but really the opportunities for outsized returns next year are going to be outside of those seven businesses.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Weak Macro Can't Stop E-commerce Stocks Expedia and Amazon\n\nSejuti Banerjea\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:39 AM PST 12 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nEXPE\n\nWhile macroeconomic challenges mount, the e-commerce market is growing through innovation, technology and insight, as it continues to take away slices of the total retail pie. Commerce Department numbers are proof of this trend: ecommerce sales in the third quarter of 2025 grew 5.1% over 3Q24 (1.9% sequentially), with total retail sales increasing 4.1% (1.5% sequentially).\n\nEcommerce accounted for around 16.4% of total U.S. retail sales. A point to note here is that consumers are increasingly blending their online and offline shopping experiences, so this distinction may soon become irrelevant. As a corollary, it is those retailers that have the capacity to sell through both channels that will be able to compete tomorrow.\n\nAmazon AMZN for instance started building its physical presence several years ago because nothing beats proximity to the consumer when it comes to retail. Our other pick Expedia EXPE is an online travel booking company. As consumers mostly book travel online these days, this business is growing strongly.\n\nThe convenience of online shopping remains the top reason for ecommerce volumes and this is particularly true of Gen-Z, which is, increasingly, the more relevant component of sales. Many of these buyers have grown up on the Internet and are accustomed to a high level of digitization.\n\nThey are also likely to hang out on popular social media platforms, allowing themselves to be influenced by the latest trends there. This is driving an entirely different perspective on the ecommerce space, one that revolves around digital influencers and appears to be expanding with more advanced technology such as AR/VR, social commerce and generative AI.\n\nConsumers appear to be more reticent about spending this holiday season. Adobe Analytics data based on 1 trillion+ visits to U.S. retail sites, covering 100 million products and 18 product categories, shows that ecommerce sales increased 6.1% in the first 6 weeks of the holiday shopping season ending Dec 12, reports Forbes. Significantly, customer returns were down 2.5%, indicating that customers have turned incrementally cautious because of the macroeconomic environment, and are using AI tools for more considered purchasing.\n\nIndustry Description\nInternet - Commerce continues to evolve as the technologies driving it advance.\nOn one side are increasingly powerful and capable user devices. On the other are increasingly sophisticated platforms often combining chatbots, AI and social media. AI continues to deliver increased user satisfaction and is growing into a primary enabler.\n\nStory Continues\nDifferentiation comes from better technology for improved showcasing, variety, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty, etc. as well as good customer service and more shipping options, which generally tip the scales in favor of larger players. Particularly so, because there is fierce price competition necessitating deep discounting in many cases.\n\nCurrent Trends Driving the Internet-Commerce Industry\n· AI is shaping up to be one of the major enablers of ecommerce , as customers get increasingly comfortable with the superior recommendations and personalization it offers. AI-enabled product search is very common today and all the major retailers offer shoppers some form of AI assistance. The latest development here is agentic commerce where LLM models like ChapGPT recommend products, compare features and complete the sale. Even if you’re unsure about what to buy, the statement of your general intention may be enough to complete a sale. Adobe estimates that AI-driven traffic to retail websites will be up 515-520% from the 2024 holiday season with November being the heaviest (up 758%). AI referrals on desktops will be up 74.5% and on mobile up 25.5%.\n\nThe total retail experience between physical and digital continues to blur as most consumers blend their online and offline activities. This usually takes the forms of research online and buy in-store or buy online and pick up in-store. Physical stores are increasingly experience centers allowing the traditional touch and feel that many customers can’t do without. It’s also evident that some customers prefer to walk out with their purchase. Therefore, a solid physical presence is undoubtedly a positive. Convenience is also an important factor, any experience that increases the speed of delivery/pickup is preferred. This may entail increased reliance on robots, self-driven delivery vehicles and drones that could ease bottlenecks and make deliveries smoother and cheaper. Therefore, it isn’t just the online-first retailers that are building a physical presence but also those that have traditionally been physical retailers that are digitizing to various degrees, or operating through their digital store-fronts.\n\nA trend that Gen-Z is popularizing is social commerce . Social commerce means the ability to discover, research and complete the purchase of products and experiences on a social media platform, often and increasingly more so, through influencers. With the influencer culture, user-generated content is reaching a new level of importance for brands on social media platforms. Brands usually have store fronts on these platforms where influencers also discuss their products, thus driving traffic to them. The social element of shopping that ecommerce had taken out is thus returning through this route. Since social commerce first became popular in China, it isn’t surprising that the Chinese social media platform TikTok that’s also very popular with Gen Z, is the number one place for social commerce. According to eMarketer via akeneo, 46% of Gen Z consumers are already using TikTok to initiate their product searches, rather than the traditional Google and Amazon. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and a host of others are also very popular. Instagram and YouTube are finetuning their checkout systems, so customers can place their orders in-app, without leaving their feeds (akeneo).\n\nAnother notable trend is a subscription format for repeat-use items. This makes it easier for the consumer to order and for the retailer to plan and identify loyalty. Retailers usually offer some kind of discount to consumers choosing this option, which makes it all the more attractive. Subscriptions have become more or less ubiquitous with repeat use items and this trend is expected to expand going forward as both tangible and intangible commodities and low-value and high-value items are increasingly sold ‘as-a-service’.\n\nThe macroeconomic situation continues to evolve , although we can probably say that a deep recession is unlikely. Earlier this month, the Fed took a cautious tone, with Powell saying that although official forecasts for growth and inflation have improved, there are risks to both. He warned that the jobs data could be overestimating hiring. Right now, the jobs market appears to be softening with new job openings declining in November and the unemployment rate rising. Consumer confidence dipped nearly 7 points in November with consumers expressing reluctance to buy big-ticket items. Although disposable income has increased in each month since May, consumers do not expect much improvement in future business conditions or the jobs market. The S&P Global said in its inaugural holiday sales survey report that the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop would result in a tempered outlook. The geopolitical situation is also volatile, and tariffs remain a bone of contention with major trading partners, so the negative impact could continu\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Strength\nThe Zacks Internet - Commerce Industry is a rather large group within the broader Zacks Retail And Wholesale Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #79, which places it in the top 33% of 243 Zacks industries.\nOur research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. So the group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates positive near-term prospects.\nEcommerce being in the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries is the result of its relative performance versus others. What we’re seeing in the aggregate estimate revisions are some ups and downs in estimates over the past year. The aggregate earnings estimate for 2025 is down 5.5%, while that for 2026 is down 7.1%. The macroeconomic uncertainty, the cautious tone around rate cuts and fears of a possible recession are likely contributing to softer spending and thus estimate cuts.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nIndustry Returns Have Been Sluggish\nUntil August, the Zacks Electronic - Commerce Industry has traded relatively close to the broader Retail and Wholesale sector as well as the S&P 500, although it started treading water thereafter, continuing mostly at a premium to the broader retail sector.\nThe stocks in this industry have collectively gained 4.2% over the past year, compared to the 3.4% gain for the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector and the 15.8% gain for the S&P 500.\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIndustry Fairly Valued\nHistorically, the industry has traded at a premium to the sector as well as the S&P 500. However, being more volatile, the difference has varied considerably. Its current price-to-forward 12 months’ earnings (P/E) of 24.03X represents a premium of 3.1% to the S&P 500 and discount of 2.2% to the broader retail sector. It’s worth noting, however, that the industry is currently trading at a slight discount to its own median level of 24.48X.\nForward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n2 Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio\nThere are a number of stocks currently worth picking, especially because of the significant variety that exists in this industry in terms of lines of business, business model, location and so forth. This is also the reason that choosing can be tricky. We have used our proprietary ranking system to pick 2 stocks that appear attractive today.\n\nExpedia Group, Inc. (EXPE) : Seattle-based Expedia is one of the largest online travel booking company is in the world, operating through B2C, B2B and trivago segments. It serves leisure and corporate travelers. Expedia takes bookings for hotel and alternative accommodation, cruise ships, rental cars, air tickets and such other services. Through Expedia Partner Solutions, a B2B brand and Egencia, it provides corporate travel management services. It also provides advertising and media services.\nExpedia is seeing growth in both B2C and B2B but the latter segment is growing faster by far, raising the corporate average. In the last quarter for instance, total gross bookings grew 12%, driven by a 26% increase in B2B. Similarly, the 9% revenue growth was driven by 18% growth in the B2B segment.\n\nThis strength is attributable to the way businesses are viewing travel. There is a greater focus on live events like seminars and conferences, for which attendance is going up. Business development has always been the biggest driver of corporate travel and this year is no different. But upskilling employees is close, possibly because companies are preparing their employees for the massive change that AI is bringing. In-person engagement with clients and partners, followed by conference attendance are the other factors responsible for the strength in business travel (Deloitte: Corporate Travel Forecast, Sept 2025).\nExpedia had discontinued its quarterly dividend since the outbreak of the pandemic, but resumed this year. This is an added positive for all investors, especially income-seeking ones.\n\nAnalysts appear highly optimistic about this company. In the last 60 days, estimates for 2025 have increased 96 cents (6.8%) while those for 2026 increased $1.54 (9.2%). At current levels these estimates represent 6.7% revenue growth and 24.6% earnings growth in 2025. The following year, revenue and earnings are expected to grow a respective 6.3% and 20.8%.\nThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock is up 51.9% year to date.\nPrice & Consensus: EXPE\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon, Inc. (AMZN) : Seattle, Washington-based Amazon is one of the leading online marketplaces in the world. It has developed its business around the Prime loyalty program that drives sales across merchandise and media categories. The online business is supplemented with broad physical presence, augmented by the acquisition of the premium grocery company Whole Foods Market back in 2017. Amazon also enjoys a dominant position in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) space, courtesy Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe company’s sheer size and scale allow it to offer products at some of the cheapest prices. Amazon is known for its huge discounts and deals, and the number of services it piles into Prime has ensured a subscription revenue channel. Amazon has steadily increased prices over the years, but the user base remains sticky. Its profitability depends on the AWS business, where it still enjoys first-mover advantage. With access to humongous amounts of data, Amazon has developed some AI-powered products to make the most of generative AI and other developments in the space. It also uses AI and automation across the business.\nOne development of concern is the recent settlement with the FTC where it was proved that Amazon used unfair practices to trick people into taking Prime memberships and then made it very difficult for them to cancel or refuse it. Amazon was directed to simplify the process, remove ambiguities for buyers and also ordered to pay $2.5 billion ($1 billion in penalty and $1.5 billion in compensation). It is also required to abide by certain fair-practice directives.\n\nAmazon also announced a huge layoff of 14,000 staff that investors need not worry about. Amazon’s sales aren’t shrinking. On the other hand, AI is allowing greater efficiencies, such that certain management layers and HR staff are no longer necessary. Amazon expects the leaner structure to facilitate more nimble operation akin to a very large startup.\nDespite its huge business volumes, analysts are optimistic about double-digit revenue and earnings growth this year although the earnings growth rate is expected to come down a bit next year. Of course this is early days yet, and actual growth rates may be much higher. Amazon certainly has a great track record of beating estimates: at double-digit rates in each of the last four quarters, averaging 22.5%. For 2025, analysts expect 11.9% revenue growth and 29.7% earnings growth. For 2026, revenue and earnings growth are expected to be a respective 11.3% and 9.3%. In the last 60 days, analyst estimates for 2025 and 2026 have increased 31 cents (4.5%) and 18 cents (2.3%).\nThe shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares are up 1.3% over the past year.\nPrice & Consensus: AMZN\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The decision gives a boost to the administration’s campaign to restrict immigration and push demand for US workers. The US Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the proposal, can appeal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nHowell rejected the Chamber’s argument that Trump doesn’t have the power to impose the fee, finding that his proclamation was issued under “an express statutory grant of authority to the President.”\nCongress has given the president broad authority that he used to address “in the manner he sees fit, a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security,” she wrote.\nDaryl Joseffer, the Chamber’s executive vice president, said in a statement the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive.\n“We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations,” Joseffer said.\n\nThe Chamber, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, argued in its October lawsuit that raising the fee is unlawful because it overrides federal immigration law and exceeds the fee-setting authority afforded by Congress.\nA group of 19 state attorneys general also is challenging Trump’s proclamation. Their lawsuit focuses on the projected impact to the public sector, particularly in the fields of health care and education, that also rely on the H-1B visa program. A separate suit was filed by a global nurse-staffing agency.\nThe ruling Tuesday, a so-called summary judgment that doesn’t require a trial, doesn’t have an impact on the other lawsuits, meaning another judge could still block the new visa fee in the months to come. The other cases include a suit filed in Massachusetts earlier this month by more than a dozen mostly Democratic-led states, as well as a suit filed in October in California by a global nurse-staffing agency and several unions.\nBoth of the other cases are also being handled by Obama appointees, and neither judge has yet ruled on any requests for injunctions against the rule. A hearing in the California case is set for Feb. 12 in Oakland. The dispute is likely to ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court.\n\nStory Continues\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of employment-based immigration, allowing companies in the US to hire college-educated foreign workers for specialized occupations. In September, Trump signed a proclamation to increase the application fee to discourage companies from abusing a program that he claimed displaces US workers.\n\nIt’s a stark shift from America’s historical stance toward immigration. Since its founding, the US has welcomed people from diverse countries and economic backgrounds who come to the US in search of a better life and more freedom.\nYet while Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have mused about the prospects of a windfall for the US Treasury that could total $100 billion or more, immigration attorneys have cautioned that an increase in cost of this magnitude would cause major disruptions that would be likely very expensive to the US economy.\n“This puts a chilling effect on America’s employers,” said Michael Wildes, a managing partner at the New York-based immigration law firm Wildes and Weinberg PC. “How can you make America great by taking away the talent pool?” Wildes noted that “it’s a limiting law in that America will skip a beat. There will be a generation of talent out there in the world that will go to other countries. We will be missing an opportunity and that is foolhardy.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said it will replace the lottery for choosing H-1B visa applicants with a weighted selection to overcome wage arbitrage and incentivize American employers “to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers.” There are also proposals being considered to impose a wage floor.\nH-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but are used primarily in the tech industry. Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. are among the companies with the greatest number of H-1B visas, according to the US government.\nThe visa fees will shape hiring efforts, but affect some jobs and companies more than others, said Alexis DuFresne, founder of recruiting firm Archer Search Partners, which specializes in recruitment for alternative financial asset managers.\n\nFor “superstars” in highly-paid, specialized roles, or for jobs that generate a lot of revenue, organizations will be willing to pay the $100,000 fee, she said.\nBut the high cost will change how people making hiring decisions approach looking for employees in more run-of-the-mill jobs, DuFresne said. “If you’re going to search, you’re going to tell the search people ‘Don’t look globally for me. Look domestically for me,’” she said of such common jobs.\nLikewise, organizations with offices around the world will be able to respond to the recruitment costs by shifting where they hire, according to DuFresne. “The firms that it’s going to affect the most are the smaller firms,” she said.\nThe tech industry has been adapting to changes in US immigration rules for a while now as political currents shift.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google is taking steps to help move employees off of H-1B visas and onto more permanent status. The company recently told staff it will be “ramping up” PERM applications next year for eligible employees, Business Insider reported, taking a crucial step to securing a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\nBeyond the US tech companies, the action also hits India hard, as Indians have been the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In addition to the extra costs that Indian IT companies will bear for thousands of employees on such visas, the ongoing unpredictability has unnerved many Indian professionals working in US tech, finance, health care and other industries, especially after the recent mass postponement of work-visa appointments.\n\nThe case is Chamber of Commerce vs. US Department of Homeland Security, 25-cv-03675, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).\n--With assistance from Jake Bleiberg, Erik Larson and Patrick Howell O'Neill.\n(Updates with expert comments in 14th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI & Security Push Aids Google Cloud: What's Ahead for GOOGL Stock?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:49 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nAlphabet GOOGL is riding on a strong Google Cloud prospect, which accounts for more than 14% of GOOGL’s revenues. In the trailing nine-month period ended Sept. 30, Google Cloud revenues jumped 31.2% over the same year-ago time frame to $41.04 billion. The top line benefited from growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core products, AI Infrastructure and generative AI (Gen AI) Solutions. Cloud backlog jumped 46% sequentially to $155 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2025. The AI and security push is expected to boost Google Cloud’s prospects in the near term.\n\nAlphabet’s expanding AI infrastructure is helping Alphabet win enterprise clients. GCP’s prospects remain robust, driven by strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs (led by seventh-generation Ironwood) and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for the latest Gemini and other AI models, and other services, including cybersecurity and data analytics. Google Cloud is also benefiting from strong Gen AI adoption due to leading models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues from products developed on Google’s Gen AI models surged more than 200% year over year.\n\nSecurity push is expected to drive Google Cloud’s top-line growth further. The addition of Wiz (acquisition pending, expected to complete in 2026) to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT in the cloud computing space. The latest collaboration between Google Cloud and Palo Alto Networks combines Google Cloud’s AI and infrastructure capabilities with Prisma AIRS, the latter’s comprehensive AI security platform. Accelerating investments bodes well for GOOGL’s prospects. Alphabet expects capital expenditure between $91 billion and $93 billion for 2025, which is anticipated to increase further in 2026.\n\nGOOGL Faces Tough Competition in Cloud Domain Per Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 29% in the third quarter of 2025, ahead of Microsoft’s Azure platform at 20% and Google Cloud at 13%.\n\nAmazon is spending heavily on fortifying its Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure that supports AI workloads and expanded data center capacity. Amazon committed $125 billion in capital expenditure for 2025, with the vast majority directed toward AWS infrastructure. The third quarter alone saw $34.2 billion in cash capex, while the company added 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity over 12 months, the largest expansion in cloud history.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft Azure and other cloud services revenues accelerated 40% in constant currency (cc), with management attributing significant contributions to AI-related demand. Microsoft Cloud revenues reached $49.1 billion, increasing 25% in cc and reflecting strong enterprise adoption of cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities. Spending is expected to accelerate throughout fiscal 2026, with roughly half to be spent on GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand and AI workload expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nGOOGL’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Alphabet shares have appreciated 60.5% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nGOOGL Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe GOOGL stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 9.67X compared with the broader sector’s 6.55X.

      "Content": "How Mill closed the deal with Amazon and Whole Foods\n\nTim De Chant\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMill may have started with households, but co-founder and CEO Matt Rogers says the food waste startup has long aspired to expand to commercial customers.\n“This has been part of our plan since our Series A deck,” Rogers told TechCrunch.\nNow, with an official deal locked in with Amazon and Whole Foods the company’s plan to profit from handling other people’s food waste is a bit more public.\n\nWhole Foods will deploy a commercial-scale version of Mill ’s food waste bin in each of its grocery stores beginning in 2027. The bins will grind and dehydrate waste from the produce department, reducing costly landfill fees while also providing feed for the company’s egg producers. Both trim the company’s overhead.\nAt the same time, Mill’s bins will collect data to help Whole Foods understand what gets wasted and why, helping the grocer further control costs. “Ultimately, our goal is not just to make their waste operations more efficient, but also to move upstream so they actually waste less food,” Rogers said.\nThe company started selling food waste bins to households a few years ago . As can be expected from a team that made the Nest thermostat, the devices are well designed and — to lean on a Silicon Valley cliche — they can be a delight to use. My kids got a kick out of the bins while testing the first and second generations .\n\n“Starting in consumer was very intentional because you build the proof points, you build the data, the brand, loyalty,” Rogers said. Many members of the Whole Foods team were already using Mill in their homes when the two companies started talking.\n“It’s actually kind of our enterprise sales strategy,” Rogers continued. “We have conversations with senior leadership at our various ideal customers, and if they haven’t had Mill at home yet, we say, ‘Hey, try Mill at home, see what your family thinks.’ It is a surefire way of getting folks excited.”\nThe startup began having conversations with Whole Foods about a year ago, Rogers said. In the ensuing months, Whole Foods trialed the consumer version in some of its stores. Mill used feedback from Whole Foods to refine its commercial model.\n\nBut what helped sealed the deal was Mill’s ability to pinpoint food waste before it was wasted. Mill has developed an AI that uses a range of sensors to determine whether food that enters the bin should still be on the shelf. Minimizing “shrink” — the industry’s term for sales lost through waste or theft — can give grocers an edge in a cutthroat market.\nAdvances in large language models have been key, Rogers said. When he and Mill co-founder Harry Tannenbaum were at Nest, it took dozens of engineers and a “Google budget” more than a year to train Nest Cameras to recognize people and packages. With new LLMs, Mill only needed a handful of engineers and far less time to deliver superior results, according to Rogers, who said “AI is a huge enabler.”\n\nStory Continues\nThe use of AI allowed Mill to deliver a commercial version faster, diversifying its customer base and source of revenue.\n“If you are a single channel, single customer business, you’re fragile,” Rogers said. “I grew up at Apple during the iPod era,” he said. “Apple at the time was a single leg business. iPod was like 70% of company revenue. This was why we did the iPhone. Steve [Jobs] pushed us really hard on the iPhone because he was worried that folks like Motorola — who were working on smartphones at the time — would start to eat our lunch on the iPod business and that that would crush us. We needed to build another leg of the stool.”\nAnd it seems that Mill isn’t finished adding legs to its figurative stool. Rogers said its working on building out a municipal business as well.\n“We’re continuing to add more legs to the stool and adding more diversity to the business,” he said.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "A $61 Billion Reason to Buy Amazon Stock for 2026\n\nEbube Jones\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nData center infrastructure is turning into one of the biggest spending races in the market. Deal activity in the sector hit a record $61 billion in 2025, showing the rapid pace of companies locking in enough data center space and computing power for artificial intelligence work. And this is further fueled by generative AI workloads that are pushing today’s power and server capacity to the limit.\n\nDemand for AI-ready data centers is soaring so quickly that supply could fall behind. This is the reason behind the largest cloud providers that are rushing to add more capacity, along with specialized chips and better cooling systems. One of the clearest winners from this shift is Amazon (AMZN), since AWS is spending heavily to stay ahead as AI infrastructure spending keeps rising.\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nBroadcom (AVGO) Stock Options Are Signaling Pensiveness. Here’s Why the Fear Might Be Unwarranted.\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nAmazon has already doubled AWS power capacity since 2022 and added 3.8 gigawatts in the last year alone, more than any other cloud provider, with plans to double that again by 2027 to keep up with AI demand. At the same time, Amazon’s Trainium-based AI infrastructure has grown into a multibillion-dollar business, posting triple-digit growth as AWS invests in custom silicon and large-scale data center expansion to support AI-focused workloads.\nWith global data center revenue projected to reach roughly $739.05 billion by 2030, can Amazon’s hyperscale build-out turn this data center supercycle into meaningful upside for its stock in 2026? Let’s find out.\nAmazon’s Financial Engine As the world’s largest online retailer and cloud provider, Amazon runs a broad business that brings together e-commerce, subscription services, digital advertising, and its main cloud arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is still the company’s biggest profit driver.\nOver the past year, Amazon’s stock has moved up in a slow but steady way, gaining 3.15% over the past 52 weeks and 5.81% year-to-date (YTD).\nAlso, the valuation shows investors are willing to pay up for that outlook, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 31.7x, well above the sector average of 17.87x, which signals the market expects stronger earnings from Amazon than the typical peer group.\nThat view is supported by the latest financial results. For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2025, Amazon reported net sales of $180.2 billion, up 13% from a year earlier. Operating income came in at $17.4 billion. But without special charges of $2.5 billion tied to a legal settlement and $1.8 billion in planned role eliminations severance costs, operating income would have been $21.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nNet income climbed to $21.2 billion, or $1.95 per diluted share, up from $15.3 billion last year. Free cash flow fell to $14.8 billion, primarily due to a $50.9 billion increase in property and equipment investments, which underscores Amazon's substantial investment in scaling its infrastructure, particularly cloud and data center capacity, to support its next stage of growth.\n\nAmazon’s Growth Foundations Amazon expanded its Nova portfolio this year, and it directly strengthens its AI infrastructure push tied to the data center demand shaping the 2026 growth story. The company introduced four new Frontier Nova models along with Nova Forge, a service that lets organizations build their own custom model versions using an “open training” approach that brings proprietary data into the process early. Amazon also rolled out Nova Act, which reached a 90% reliability rate for browser-based automation workflows, giving enterprises a more dependable way to automate online tasks as they scale digital operations.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon upgraded Bedrock AgentCore with real-time, policy-based controls that block unauthorized agent actions, plus AgentCore Evaluations for ongoing quality checks. It also added AgentCore Memory, which helps AI agents learn from past experiences so decision-making improves over time. Organizations such as Cohere Health, Thomson Reuters, and S&P Global Market Intelligence are already using AgentCore in production deployments.\nMeanwhile, Amazon expanded its work with SolarWinds, allowing the IT management company to build in generative AI through Amazon Bedrock. The partnership supports AI-driven automation and observability for SolarWinds, highlighting how AWS is becoming the underlying AI infrastructure that many large enterprises rely on.\n\nAnalysts See More Room to Run For the fourth quarter of 2025, management is guiding net sales to a range of $206.0 billion to $213.0 billion, which would mean 10% to 13% year-over-year (YOY)growth. Operating income is expected to land between $21.0 billion and $26.0 billion, compared with $21.2 billion in the same quarter last year. The next earnings release is set for Feb. 5, 2026, and analysts are looking for earnings of $1.97 per share for the current quarter and $7.17 for full-year 2025. That works out to an estimated YOY growth of 5.91% for the quarter and 29.66% for the full year.\n\nThat outlook helps explain why Oppenheimer recently raised its Amazon price target to 305 from 290. The firm pointed to Amazon’s plan to double AWS capacity by 2027. It also suggested each added gigawatt could bring in about $3 billion in revenue, which could have a “meaningful” impact on cash flow as new data centers come online in this AI-heavy environment. Barclays analyst Ross Sandler made a similar point, saying “AWS has secured significant AI capacity over the next several years,” and his team expects growth to accelerate from here, as more AI work moves onto that expanded capacity.\nOverall, all 56 analysts surveyed rated Amazon a consensus “Strong Buy,” with 49 “Strong Buy,” five “Moderate,” and two “Hold.” The average price target of $295.80 suggests about 27.4% upside from the current level.\nConclusion Amazon looks like one of the cleanest ways to play the $61 billion data center supercycle heading into 2026, with AWS-led infrastructure spending, surging AI demand, and a packed product roadmap all pointing in the same direction. The company is leaning hard into power capacity, custom silicon, and AI-native services at the exact moment enterprises are scrambling for compute. Also, Wall Street clearly likes what it sees, with strong earnings growth estimates and a roughly 30% implied upside from here. Nothing is guaranteed, but if data center and AI investment stay on their current trajectory, Amazon’s shares look more likely to grind higher than to stall.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Tech stocks had been taking a beating lately, but are back on rally mode, with the S&P 500 hitting a new all-time closing high on Tuesday.\nGiven the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks, such as Analog Devices, Inc. ADI, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Fortive Corporation FTV, which have strong potential in 2025. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nS&P 500 Hits All-Time High The S&P 500 rose 0.5% on Tuesday to finish at 6,909.79 points, to hit an all-time closing high. The jump came as the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a pace of 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing the consensus estimate of a rise of 3.2%, and a lot higher than the 3.8% recorded in the second quarter.\n\nThe report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve could revise its monetary policy outlook for 2026 and go for more interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve had earlier hinted at just one rate cut in 2026.\nHowever, markets are now pricing in at least two rate cuts next year, given that the Fed is confident that inflation, despite being high, will ease substantially in 2026, and economic growth, too, will accelerate. Also, the Fed had earlier ruled out the chances of a rate hike in the near term.\nThe positive outlook supported by the latest economic data saw tech stocks rebound from their earlier lows. Investors have lately been worried about the profitability of the ongoing surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investments. Major AI deals reached over the past two months have raised doubts among investors about their sky-high valuations and fear that AI is yet another bubble that would eventually burst.\n\nHowever, those fears appear to have alleviated, with some major tech giants issuing better-than-expected profit guidance for the present and upcoming quarters.\n3 S&P 500 Stocks With Growth Potential Analog Devices, Inc. Analog Devices, Inc. is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.

      "Content": "The 20-Year Signal: Preparing for the Predicted Reversal of AI-Fueled Stock Market Gains\n\nDavid Beren\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:45 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nThere is no question that artificial intelligence has transformed the stock market as we know it over the past three years, all but single-handedly driving the S&P 500 to record after record. Companies that are sitting at the forefront of this technology, like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), have delivered returns that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The Shiller CAPE ratio sits above 35, a level seen only twice before: the Great Depression and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\nThe S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022. The Mag 7 tech stocks now represent 30% of total S&P 500 market value.\nAfter the 2000 peak at similar CAPE levels, the S&P 500 fell 49% over 2.5 years and took 7 years to recover.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMost importantly, the AI technology is real, and so far, the enthusiasm for this technology has been mostly justified, all while the long-term potential (and dangers) seems incredible. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolios have grown in a massive way over the last 36 months. But, and there is always a but, beneath this celebratory growth, there is a warning signal that has emerged.\nThis indicator, which looks at the close relationships between stock prices and underlying economics, hasn't flashed at current levels in over 20 years, not since the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. The last time this signal appeared, it was followed by a multi-year bear market that erased roughly half of the market's overall value. While history doesn't always repeat itself, it does at least suggest that we need to look at these readings and consider, as investors, what the next smart move really is.\n\nAI Mania Drives Stocks to Historic, Record Highs The artificial intelligence revolution has, without question, captivated investors in a way that almost no other technology has. The belief that AI is going to and has already started to automate work, revolutionize manufacturing, and create entirely new industries is just scratching the surface of what investors are thinking about.\n\nFor companies that are in the AI world, all of this speculation and promise has led to explosive revenue growth. For example, NVIDIA's data center business has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in corporate America, and Microsoft's AI integration across basically its entire product lineup is driving enterprise adoption. In other words, this technology is actually driving real revenue.\n\nStory Continues\nThis technological transformation has driven stock prices to levels that would have seemed absurd three years ago. The S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022, and NVIDIA has seen its market cap grow by trillions. The Mag 7's technology stocks represent a whopping 30% of the entire S&P 500 market value, a level not seen since the 1990s. Valuations have also exploded as the forward P/E of the S&P 500 now hovers around 21 to 22, 40% above historical averages.\n\nThe optimism that is driving these valuation numbers is assuming that AI will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for years to come. More importantly, it also assumes that AI adoption won't have any obstacles to adoption in the coming years and that companies building AI infrastructure will continue generating returns to justify their current high stock prices and valuations.\nThis pattern of pricing in future success isn't new, as the late 1990s boom also seemed a trajectory where investors were basically paying today for profits they expected companies to deliver in the next five years. However, as the world knows, the technology of the internet boom from the 1990s succeeded, it's how you're reading this today, but many of the stocks crashed because valuations got too far ahead of any financial reality.\n\nA Rare Signal Not Seen in Two Decades: What the Indicator Means The warning signal that is flashing today is the Shiller CAPE ratio, a number that is an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio that measures stock prices relative to average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This metric attempts to smooth out short-term earnings volatility and give a longer-lens look at valuation extremes. As of December 2025, the Shiller CAPE sits above 35, a level that has only been seen twice in modern history: the Great Depression market crash and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\n\nThe last time the US saw the CAPE ratio reach these current levels was in early 2000, right before the stock-market crash. At that peak, investors were paying extreme premiums for stocks based on the expectation (think hope) that internet companies would continue to just deliver on their unprecedented growth. History reminds us that the reality of what took place was that these companies did not enjoy unstoppable growth and that the market declined 49% over a 2.5-year period, the NASDAQ fell 78%, and it took 7 years to recover.\nThe CAPE ratio's predictive power comes from understanding long-term perspectives, and unlike traditional P/E ratios that can be distorted by temporary earnings spikes or collapses, the CAPE ratio looks with a wide lens at a full decade of earnings. When this ratio does hit 30, it can be a historical signal that stocks are priced for perfection and have almost no room for disappointment.\n\nWhat makes the current signal particularly troubling is that it isn't just existing in a silo. Instead, it's appearing alongside three other late-cycle indicators like three consecutive years of double-digit S&P 500 gains, forward P/E ratios at 40-year highs, extreme concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks, and retail investor enthusiasm that feels eerily like the dot-com bubble. While no single indicator is going to be definitive, the combination of all three suggests that a major reversal could be on the horizon, and an entire generation of investors has never experienced what happens when valuations are this stretched.\nHistory's Verdict: A Reversal is Coming - How Smart Investors Respond History is pretty unambiguous about what can happen when an extreme CAPE reading is taking place. For one, you might be in a position that creates a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. At the 1929 stock peak, stocks fell 89% over three years, and again in 2000, you had the 49% S&P 500 drop over 2.5 years. What a drop might look like in the near future is unknown, but the pattern that occurred during these two previous instances of extreme valuations resolving through major corrections seems to be all too familiar to what we're going through now with AI.\n\nFor investors, this could be the strategic opportunity they have been waiting for rather than a situation full of panic. The mistake during previous bubbles wasn't recognizing that stocks were not expensive, but it was remaining fully invested at those prices and then panic-selling at the bottom. The smart approach today is about recognizing that current valuations create a situation where the downside potential far exceeds any upside of staying fully invested.\nBuilding a cash reserve now so investors can \"buy the dip,\" as the saying goes, is arguably the best move, to the tune of upward of 30% of a portfolio being liquidated for cash or put into short-term bonds. If the market does decline by 40-50% from current levels, this cash can be invested into companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA at valuations these companies haven't experienced in years. This could give investors a chance to double their position size.\n\nThe key here is going to be the right amount of discipline, as history shows that bear market pain isn't the actual decline itself, it's the psychology of trying to understand how to buy at the bottom. If the market falls 30%, there might be a voice going on that says it's going to 50% and if it falls 50%, total economic collapse might be the voice on the news. In other words, investors should have capital reserved for buying during these panics so they can ignore the noise and acquire quality companies at steep discounts and prepare for the next decade's best returns.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\n\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\n\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory Continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE\nBefore heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms -- Walden International and Walden Catalyst -- did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO\nBorn in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\n\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\n\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\n\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\n\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL\nSo far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\n\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

In addition, the U.S. Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell to 89.1 in December, weaker than expectations of 91.7.\n“The strongest pace of economic growth in two years is bolstering confidence that corporate earnings will continue to expand robustly in 2026,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers. At the same time, U.S. money markets continue to price in at least two Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026.\nMeanwhile, the much-anticipated Santa Claus Rally period officially kicks off today.

Energy stocks advanced on Wednesday, as oil prices climbed for a sixth straight session. Luxury stocks also gained ground. Meanwhile, the regional Stoxx 600 index hit a new record high on Tuesday and is on track for its best annual performance since 2021, underpinned by lower interest rates, Germany’s fiscal spending push, and investor rotation away from expensive U.S. technology stocks.

Japanese equities were pressured by a stronger yen. A stronger yen reduces the value of overseas sales for the country’s heavyweight exporters, with automakers among the notable underperformers on the day. The Japanese currency rose for a third day as traders stayed alert for signs of intervention following Tokyo’s warning against excessive moves. Financial stocks also slumped, paring some of the sharp gains that followed the Bank of Japan’s interest-rate hike last Friday. Limiting losses, some chip stocks climbed, tracking overnight gains in their U.S. peers. Data from the Cabinet Office released on Wednesday showed that Japan’s October leading economic indicators index, which gauges the economic outlook for a few months ahead based on data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, was revised slightly lower. Meanwhile, minutes from the Bank of Japan’s October meeting released on Wednesday showed that policymakers debated the need to keep raising interest rates toward levels seen as neutral for the economy. A few members of the nine-member board also said recent yen declines could risk an inflation overshoot by driving up import costs. In other news, a draft seen by Reuters showed that Japan plans to issue new government bonds worth about $189 billion to finance a record-sized budget for the next fiscal year. Investor focus is now squarely on a raft of Japan’s economic data, scheduled for release on Friday, including Tokyo core CPI, industrial production, retail sales, and employment figures. Investors also await BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda’s speech on Thursday, as they seek guidance on the central bank’s policy path.

      "Content": "A US Postal Service plan to raise cash could cost the agency its biggest customer\n\nChris Isidore, CNN\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 2:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nFor years, a huge Amazon contract has been one of the few bright spots in the US Postal Service’s finances. But now the USPS plans to offer those last-mile services to additional customers to stem billions in ongoing losses – a move that risks losing its biggest customer.\nThe USPS faces a tight squeeze. With fewer people using the mail, it’s lost more and more money: $9 billion in the 12 months ending in September alone.\n\n“We certainly have a precarious cash position. You know, within probably 12 to 24 months, we are out of cash,” USPS Commissioner David Steiner said in a recent interview with Reuters . Simply making additional cost cutting measures won’t solve the problem, he said.\nThe Amazon contract reportedly brings in about $6 billion a year to the agency, money it can’t afford to lose.\nBut the post office now plans to accept bids from other shippers for access to the service’s distribution centers – even though Amazon says that might prompt it to pull back from the using the USPS so much.\n“We’ve been working for nearly a year to extend our partnership that started more than 30 years ago,” said Amazon spokesman Steve Kelly.\n“We were surprised to hear they want to run an auction after nearly a year of negotiations, and, given the change of direction and the uncertainty it adds to our delivery network, we’re evaluating all of our options that would ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers.”\n\nUniversal service The very thing that makes the postal service so attractive to Amazon is also the reason why the agency so badly needs more money: universal service.\nThe postal service is legally required to deliver mail all across the United States all at the same price, what’s called universal delivery. That includes rural, far-flung or hard-to-reach destinations, expensive places for mail carriers to get to.\nFor Amazon, that means it’s sometimes cheaper to use USPS for that last stretch of delivery to a customer’s door.\nBut while that contract is important to USPS, it’s not nearly enough.\n“We may not have sufficient liquidity to meet all of our existing legal obligations when due while also repaying our maturing debt and making the critical infrastructure investments… without putting our ability to fulfill that primary mission at undue risk,” it said in its most recent annual report.\n\nTrying to get more customers to deliver pre-sorted packages in bulk directly into the USPS system makes operational sense, said Elena Patel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institute and an expert in Postal Service finances. But she said there is a risk if those negotiations with smaller shippers pushes Amazon to no longer use the USPS as much as it has in the past.\n\nStory Continues\n“I don’t know what the state of negotiations is, but it certainly would not be good for the financial situation at the Postal Service for the negotiations with Amazon to fall apart,” she said.\nUSPS has already started to see package volumes start to slip after years of growth fueled by online consumer purchases. Total parcel and package volume slipped nearly 6% in the most recent fiscal year. But packages are still up nearly 500% from where they were 20 years ago, while first-class letter volume has plunged in the same period.\n\nPatel said that it’s in the national interest for the government to continue to provide universal service, even if it means between $6 billion to $10 billion in annual congressional appropriations to USPS.\n“The premise of (the USPS) is that it would deliver everywhere at an affordable rate, and we will let you keep the letter monopoly to pay for that,” she said. “Well, the second half of that is broken. It doesn’t make any sense in this era of digital communications.”\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Amazon Stock Still a Buy After Hitting All-Time Highs?\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:57 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nKey Points AWS is enjoying robust multiyear revenue visibility.\nAdvertising is also becoming a key profit engine.\nAmazon’s shares can continue to soar even above their all-time high levels.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nShares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are hovering close to an all-time high of $254.\nBut several growth catalysts can propel Amazon stock above its current price and potentially surpass its all-time high in the coming months.\nImproving demand visibility Amazon's cloud computing platform, AWS, saw revenues grow 20.2% year over year to $33 billion in the third quarter. The rapid increase in enterprise spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure has pushed AWS' backlog to $200 billion, giving it exceptional multiyear revenue visibility.\n\nAmazon's custom silicon chips, such as Graviton and Trainium, have strengthened AWS' price-performance advantage relative to hyperscalers, depending heavily on third-party chips. The company also plans to double data center capacity by 2027, which can further reduce costs and attract even larger workloads.\nAmazon expects capital investment of $125 billion in 2025, and plans to invest even higher amounts in 2026, primarily to expand its AI infrastructure.\nAdvertising and retail business Advertising has become the second most prominent growth engine. Advertising revenues increased 22% year over year to $17.7 billion in the third quarter, driven by the strong performance of its full-funnel advertising portfolio encompassing every stage of the customer purchase journey.\nAdvertising through Prime Video and live sports capabilities helps build brand awareness at scale, while advertising through sponsored products at the point of sale improves conversion rates. The company's partnerships with premium content providers, such as Netflix, Spotify , and Sirius XM , enable advertisers to access high-quality ad inventory through Amazon's demand-side platform (DSP).\n\nTD Cowen analyst John Blackledge expects advertising to bring $68 billion in revenues and account for 35% of the company's total operating income in 2025. So although it's a smaller part of the total revenues, advertising is more profitable than AWS or the retail business.\nAmazon's stock has reached an all-time high, yet it appears to be entering a new phase of accelerated growth. The stock can still be a good choice for long-term investors who can overlook share-price pullbacks due to profit-taking in the short term.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?
