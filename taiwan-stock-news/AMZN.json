      "Content": "Riding the AI wave? You need a 'strong stomach': Dan Ives' strategy\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: PLTR\n\nCRWV\n\nAMD\n\nIVES\n\nMETA\n\nIn the AI trade, you \"can't just bet on one company,\" Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research, Dan Ives, tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting the importance of diversification for AI investors.\nWatch the video above to hear more about Ives' AI thesis and the 30 stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF ( IVES ).\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThere's another stock I want to ask you about, and that is CoreWeave, which as you know, has sold off pretty sharply. Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Business\nA $1 trillion IPO looms, and Amazon may have just locked in early\n\nFaizan Farooque\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 10:47 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAmazon is increasingly aggressive and smart in its battle to acquire a greater role in AI .\nAmazon will reportedly make a huge $10 billion investment in OpenAI, which shocked Wall Street and rattled Silicon Valley. If the Reuters report is confirmed in the not-so-distant future, the deal won't simply be about getting in on the hottest name in AI.\n\nIt would mean that Amazon is willing to put real money behind its chips, cloud, and reputation, even if it has long been seen as behind in the AI arms race.\nIt's also an uncommon move for Amazon that will have ramifications for chip stocks, cloud computing, and the planned OpenAI IPO .\nAmazon's AI problem and how $10 billion could fix it Amazon is a cloud powerhouse thanks to AWS, but when it comes to high-profile AI projects, it has fallen behind Microsoft and Google.\nYears ago, Microsoft put $13 billion into OpenAI. Google is sponsoring both its own DeepMind subsidiary and its competitor Anthropic.\nAs for Amazon, people have spoken a lot about its Trainium and Inferentia chips and released services like Bedrock, but investors weren't very impressed — until now.\n\nRelated: Nvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nIf Amazon invests in OpenAI, it will get one of the world's most valuable AI workloads.\nOpenAI previously inked a $38 billion cloud agreement with AWS , but this arrangement might go much further and require OpenAI to employ Amazon's proprietary processors. That goes directly against Nvidia 's supremacy and strongly supports Trainium's claim of low cost and high performance.\nIt also has a number of strategic uses:\nGets AWS a big-name AI customer.\nShows Wall Street that Amazon's story about bespoke silicon is true.\nTells clients that Amazon is decreasing the cost of AI computing.\nPortrays Amazon as a legitimate \"AI arms dealer\" with tangible infrastructure.\nAnd the market saw it. The revelation made Amazon's stock rise, and some experts say this is when investors started to see Amazon as a real \"AI play.\"\n\nA high-stakes deal, just as the cloud gets crowded The timing couldn't be better. AWS is still the leader in cloud market share , but it is seeing more competition from Microsoft, Google, and fast-growing \"neo-cloud\" firms such as CoreWeave and Crusoe.\nBig companies, including Capital One, have voiced concerns about the escalating prices of AWS. Some people are even thinking about switching suppliers or creating their own AI infrastructure.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nBank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nBank of America sets AI stocks to buy list for 2026\n\nStory Continues\nA collaboration with OpenAI helps Amazon respond to that criticism. It sends a message: AWS isn't simply selling computing power; it's constructing the infrastructure for AI on a large scale and at a lower cost.\nWhat if OpenAI trains GPT-5 on Trainium chips instead of Nvidia processors? That's a big gain for believability.\n\nIt's also a way to protect investments. Anthropic has already gotten money from Amazon. It might now be supporting both of the top independent AI laboratories, which would guarantee its victory.\nRelated: Intel CEO deals spark controversy, debate\nMore broadly, the deal:\nStrengthens Amazon’s grip on multi-billion dollar AI workloads.\nUndermines \"single-cloud\" dependence criticism.\nAdds pressure on neo-cloud startups and rivals like Oracle.\nCould slow defections from AWS by enterprise clients concerned about cost.\nA trillion-dollar AI IPO? Amazon wants in The other side? OpenAI's plan to go public.\nOpenAI may now accept money from people who don't work for Microsoft after a big restructuring in 2025.\nAmazon entering the cap table gives it more weight, which probably raises OpenAI's value toward the projected $1 trillion IPO goal in 2026 or 2027.\nAmazon isn't only about using the cloud. It's a gamble that OpenAI will be a key player in the next tech era. And if OpenAI leverages Amazon's infrastructure to get there, that's even better.\n\nRelated: US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding\nThe acquisition does, however, pose certain dangers. Some experts are concerned about how \"circular\" these investments are: Big Tech gives money to startups, which then spend that money on Big Tech's platforms. That kind of thing has happened before in tech bubbles.\nBut Amazon's effort is plainly different in one way. It's not simply buying enthusiasm; it wants to sell the infrastructure that makes it work.\nHere’s why the deal could reshape the landscape:\nAmazon would join Microsoft as a top-tier OpenAI partner.\nOpenAI gains multi-cloud flexibility (Azure, AWS, Oracle).\nTrainium adoption could reduce Nvidia dependence.\nOpenAI gets a financial runway to delay IPO if needed.\nAmazon may lock in rights to exclusive OpenAI features.\nRelated: Box office is booming in 2025 but Netflix’s $82.7 billion surprise raises alarms\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Starbucks makes a bold move beyond coffee\n\nFernanda Tronco\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 9:33 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SBUX\n\nAMZN\n\nStarbucks has faced mounting challenges after decades as a seemingly untouchable coffee giant, in part due to its heavy focus on transactional growth at the expense of loyal customers who helped make it an iconic brand.\n\"In trying to scale faster, Starbucks has drifted away from the emotional core that built its global following,\" Amazon Business Analyst Saswat Sidhant Prusty told Coffee Intelligence .\n\nExternal pressures, including economic uncertainty, rising operational costs, a slowdown in consumer spending due to inflation , and ever-evolving industry trends, have also impacted the company's overall financial performance, mirroring the struggles faced by the broader foodservice sector.\nAfter learning from its missteps, Starbucks has begun implementing significant changes across its business through the \"Back to Starbucks\" turnaround plan, aiming to rectify its mistakes.\nThis time, however, the company is making a surprising move by expanding into an unexpected category that has nothing to do with coffee.\nStarbucks enters the fashion and beauty business Starbucks ( SBUX ) has hired Neiv Toledano as its new Head of Fashion and Beauty for the Brand Activation team. While the company has collaborated with fashion and beauty partners in the past, this newly created role is the first of its kind, since it's dedicated solely to the development of strategy and execution in the space.\n\nToledano brings her experience working with major consumer brands across social media and marketing. She previously served as a senior manager for brand marketing at E.l.f. Beauty and as a social media manager for Chipotle, according to her LinkedIn profile.\nAlthough Starbucks has launched several collaborations with fashion and beauty-related brands over the years, most have been released in its international markets. The addition of this dedicated position could signal that the company plans to further invest in these types of limited-time releases, particularly for its U.S. customers.\nStarbucks' previous partnerships with fashion and beauty Starbucks x alice + olivia: Released designer merchandise multiple times in Asia with the fashion brand.\nSource: Starbucks\nStarbucks x Vera Wang: Collaborated with the fashion designer on a limited-edition merchandise line in Asia.\nSource: MEGA Magazine\nStarbucks x FARM Rio: Launched a tropical-print merchandise collection with the Brazilian fashion brand in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America.\nSource: WWD\nStarbucks x Diane Von Furstenberg: Worked with the fashion designer on a drinkwear collection in Asia.\nSource: Starbucks\nStarbucks x Stonebrick: Partnered with the cosmetics brand to release a limited-time makeup line in Korea.\nSource: Zula\n\nStory Continues\nStarbucks' new strategy to stay relevant Starbucks' push into fashion and beauty extends beyond marketing; it is a cultural strategy aimed at strengthening its relevance by staying current with trends and fostering a deeper connection with consumers. These collaborations could help attract new audiences, increase brand visibility, and boost sales.\n\nThe move is also part of Starbucks' \"Back to Starbucks\" turnaround plan, designed to reverse declining sales by returning to its roots and creating a more personalized coffeehouse experience rather than remaining transactional.\nLimited-time merchandise releases have already proven effective for Starbucks. On November 6, the day of the Bearista launch, Starbucks' visits increased by 37.8% above the daily average for the last 12 months, outpacing even the brand's successful August Pumpkin Spice Latte debut , which drove a 23.1% spike in visits, according to Placer.ai .\nMore Starbucks News:\nStarbucks makes changes to win customers back\nStarbucks sells its second-largest business\nStarbucks unveils holiday collaboration fans have been waiting for\nEven after the initial rush, traffic remained elevated for several days as customers hunted for remaining inventory, which ultimately sold out. The sustained demand shows that the launch was more than a one-day phenomenon, prompting Starbucks to roll out a second drop.\n\n\"People lining up to pay $30 for a bear-shaped glass – albeit a super-cute one – wasn't on anyone’s bingo card this year,\" said Placer.ai Industry Expert Lila Margalit in the study. \"Even in an era of trading down, consumers are still willing to splurge on items that feel special – especially those that offer a sense of belonging to a cultural moment. Value matters, but it isn't everything.\"\nStarbucks continued to face broader challenges Despite the momentum behind these merchandise initiatives, financial recovery and regaining lost customers will take time to show results. In the meantime, Starbucks continues to face challenges as it manages high restructuring costs and ongoing sales declines .\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 , Global comparable store sales increased by 1% year over year. However, comparable store sales in North America and the U.S. remained flat, offset by a 1% decline in comparable transactions.\n\nOperating margin contracted by 1,150 basis points to nearly 3%, largely due to restructuring costs associated with Starbucks' turnaround efforts.\n\"Q4 was a milestone quarter in getting 'Back to Starbucks,' having delivered global comp growth for the first time in seven quarters,\" said Starbucks CFO Cathy Smith in the earnings report. \"We know this continues to be a multi-year turnaround. We remain focused on driving our topline while managing the costs that are within our control to deliver durable, sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value.\"\nNonetheless, traffic has shown improvement. Starbucks visits rose 0.7% year over year in the third quarter, marking the first visit growth in 2025, according to Placer.ai .\nRival chains dive into retail merchandise Other quick-service restaurant chains have also launched their own merchandise lines with exclusive collaborations and limited-time seasonal drops to diversify revenue streams, keep customers engaged, and turn fans into walking advertisements.\nRival food chains launch merchandise collections Chick-fil-A: Operates an online merchandise shop featuring apparel, accessories, home goods, and gifts.\nSource: Chick-fil-A\nMcDonald's: Runs an online merchandise shop offering apparel, accessories, and seasonal drops.\nSource: Golden Arches Unlimited\nParis Baguette: Sells branded apparel, accessories, and home goods through its online shop.\nSource: Paris Baguette\nRelated: Starbucks closes more stores in a key market\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Restaurants section.

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds in 2025 . Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) on December 18 and set a $303 price target. The analyst based the rating on the company’s solid position in cloud computing and AI, citing Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported discussions for the investment of over $10 billion in OpenAI. This strategic move is aimed at expanding AI workloads on AWS, deepening AI collaboration, and reflecting the capabilities of the company’s Trainium chips.\nPost also highlighted the recent AI-focused leadership changes that took place in the company, and considers the appointment of Peter DeSantis to oversee AGI Labs as a significant step to boost internal model innovation and customer silicon development, as DeSantis’s track record in launching and scaling AWS infrastructure should allow accelerated progress in AI offerings, according to the analyst.\n\nPost further stated that while he acknowledges the unlikeliness of OpenAI’s latest frontier models to be hosted on AWS due to its Microsoft agreement, he believes potential advertising, eCommerce, and enterprise AI partnerships with OpenAI to be incremental positives with the potential to reinforce Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) ecosystem while safeguarding its high-margin ad business.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a multinational technology company that provides online retail shopping services. It operates through the North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) segments.

I can barely stand for my live show Opening Bid each day.\n\nOn Wednesday, I almost passed out on a rowing machine. My trainer told me, while I was on the ground, \"No one is coming to save you. Get your ass up.\"\nIt was much-appreciated motivation for the self-motivated me.\nAnd I want to give you a similar shot of inspiration as we get ready to enter 2026: No one is coming to save your portfolio from complacency on AI stocks.\nHow's that Oracle ( ORCL ) you bought in September working out? Still riding the once-buzzy CoreWeave ( CRWV )? I imagine in both cases, things are not looking too rosy. Why? Because you did no homework on these companies — and simply bought them because they were AI-related and in the news.\nDo better!!\n\nThe reality is you have to think beyond the obvious AI stocks in 2026 to drive gains. Beyond the richly valued \"Magnificent 7.\" Beyond a company like Oracle, whose billionaire CEO, Larry Ellison, is also trying to help his son buy a struggling Warner Bros. ( WBD ). You have to think deeply about where else the AI trade will appear and create value.\n\nMap this stuff out on a whiteboard if you have to!\nAI is having a profound impact inside companies. As a result, it will drive a good bit of positive earnings surprises in many of the other 493 companies housed in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nHere are two examples of the work you need to be doing on AI investing.\nThe appetite to own AI plays is broadening to more under-the-radar names, including companies that are using the technology aggressively in the industrial sector. One of those companies is logistics giant C.H. Robinson ( CHRW ), led by one of the best CEOs you probably never heard of: David Bozeman .\nBozeman has led the 120-year-old logistics player for more than two years, after stints in transportation operations at Amazon ( AMZN ), Harley-Davidson ( HOG ), and Caterpillar ( CAT ).\n\nSince Bozeman's arrival, C.H. Robinson has leaned hard into AI to improve operating profits. Its stock price is up 55% in 2025. FYI, Meta's ( META ) stock is only up 11% this year! That's despite Bozeman telling me in a new episode of my Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast (video above) that the economy isn't growing too quickly and the freight recession continues.\n\nStory Continues",

      "Content": "The Secret to Finding the Next Broadcom Is Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Broadcom's custom AI chips are growing in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's.\nNow, Amazon has created its own custom AI chip, Trainium3, to carve out its own niche.\nAmazon needs to sustain its strong AWS growth in 2026 to be a successful stock pick.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nSemiconductor company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has enjoyed an incredible year, rising some 50% so far, even after a large pullback due to poorly received fourth-quarter results. This has investors searching for the next Broadcom, as who wouldn't want those incredible one-year returns?\n\nThe secret to Broadcom's rise is tied to the custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips it's developing. These compete directly against Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are incredibly costly due to their impressive performance and flexibility. Broadcom's custom AI chips can outperform Nvidia's GPUs at a lower price point when the workload is set up properly, giving them a huge advantage at the cost of flexibility.\nDesigning custom AI computing units is going to become more popular, as Nvidia's chips are far too expensive not to explore this avenue. While many companies are choosing to partner with Broadcom, others are opting to do it themselves. One of these companies is hiding in plain sight, and its recent release is incredibly promising.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has dived into designing its own AI chip, and the results have been phenomenal. This innovation could provide Amazon with the growth it needs to be a monster stock pick over the next few years, making it an excellent investment today.\nAmazon's new device provides incredible performance Amazon's new computing chip is known as Trainium3. It is built on cutting-edge 3nm (nanometer) chip architecture and delivers impressive performance at a lower price point. Compared to previous generation Trainum2 servers, they offer 4 times the computing performance while improving energy efficiency by 4 times as well. That helps reduce operating costs and run time, which allowed several generative AI clients to reduce training and inference costs by up to 50%, including Anthropic.\n\nThose are huge boosts for Amazon, and it could attract new clients to its servers. One of those is OpenAI, which is reportedly considering using Amazon's Trainium3 chips in exchange for a $10 billion investment. This could be the first of many companies flocking to Amazon's training servers, as cost is starting to become a large bottleneck in the artificial intelligence investing realm.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors want to see real innovation in exchange for their dollars, and companies may need to stretch their funding to achieve better results. Switching from GPUs to alternative computing units like Amazon's is one way to do that, and it could grow in popularity in 2026.\nDepending on how popular this product is, Amazon could become the next Broadcom. We'll see success tied to Amazon's cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), if it has any boost in 2026. Fortunately for Amazon and its investors, it's already looking up.\n\nAWS is critical to Amazon's success Despite AWS accounting for only 18% of Amazon's total revenue, it represents 66% of its operating profits. That's because AWS' margins are far better than the base e-commerce business, so as AWS goes, so will Amazon.\nIn Q3, AWS posted its best growth rate in multiple years, rising at a 20% pace. This indicates that more workloads are coming online at AWS, which is an excellent sign for 2026. If Amazon can continue this momentum in 2026, combined with the rise of Trainium3 workloads, Amazon's stock could dramatically rise in 2026.\n\nWhile I doubt it can duplicate Broadcom's 50% rise this year, I think Amazon is prepped to be a market-beating stock, especially after its underperformance this year. Amazon is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing AI workload, and with the rest of its business also producing strong results (advertising in particular), I think Amazon has what it takes to be a top stock pick in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Amazon Stock in 2026: Key Catalysts and What Investors Should Watch\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:57 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nKey Points Amazon is sparing no expense when investing in AI-related infrastructure, especially when AWS demand is strong.\nDigital advertising should continue to be a major growth driver next year.\nThe stock’s EV-to-EBIT ratio is near a decade low, which can provide near-term upside.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIt's not like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) to trail the overall market. However, with shares up 2% this year (as of Dec. 17), investors should ask what's going on. Amazon is dealing with competitive forces, regulatory issues, and macro headwinds. But it's easy to be optimistic.\nHere are some of the most important catalysts and factors that investors need to watch as attention turns to 2026.\nAmazon's AI-related spending is sizable Amazon is known as a hyperscaler because it's spending significant sums of money on artificial intelligence (AI) efforts. Management forecasts $125 billion in capital expenditures (capex) this year for things like building data centers and developing chips. That figure will likely increase next year.\n\nPeers like Microsoft and Alphabet are spending ridiculous amounts on expanding their AI infrastructure as well. Amazon must keep up, or risk getting left behind in what could be a revolutionary technology shift.\nMacro and industry forces can't be overlooked. AI bubble fears are swirling. If pessimism becomes prevalent, all this spending will be ill-timed, and investors will lose confidence in companies like Amazon that will likely be most affected.\nAWS' success is critical to the overall business A lot of that capex relates to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's industry-leading cloud computing platform. It's a major financial contributor, with third-quarter revenue of $33 billion and operating income of $11.4 billion. In 2026, AWS should remain top of investors' minds.\nAWS has received a boost from strong customer interest in leveraging AI tools in their own operations. OpenAI is a notable customer, and Nvidia is a longtime partner. AWS' ongoing success should lift Amazon's financial results in 2026.\n\nDigital advertising revenue is soaring During the last quarter, Amazon's digital advertising revenue jumped 22% year over year to $17.7 billion. The company is deserving of a seat at the table with industry heavyweights Alphabet and Meta Platforms . Amazon's online marketplace provides a valuable marketing channel for merchants. Its popular streaming platform, Prime Video, is another avenue to monetize viewer attention.\nUnless there's a severe recession, expect digital ad revenue to keep rising meaningfully next year.\n\nStory Continues\nThere might be valuation upside For a business that has a huge market cap of $2.4 trillion, it can be surprising to see a cheap valuation. Amazon shares currently trade at an enterprise value (EV) that's 30.5 times its earnings before interest and taxes . This level is near its lowest ratio in the past decade.\nIn 2026, valuation expansion might be a key driver of investor returns. Market sentiment can improve with strong financial results. This tailwind could be a catalyst in the near term.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nStory Continues\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has 18% of His Portfolio Invested in 3 Trillion-Dollar AI Stocks. Wall Street Says They Can Soar in 2026.\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:16 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve user engagement and advertising outcomes across its social media networks.\nMicrosoft has added generative artificial intelligence features (Copilots) to many of its software products, and its data center footprint is expanding rapidly.\nAmazon is leaning on artificial intelligence to makes its e-commerce business more profitable and to increase cloud computing sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, a hedge fund that outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points over the last three years. That makes him an excellent source of inspiration.\nLaffont had nearly 18% of his portfolio invested in three artificial intelligence stocks (each worth well over $1 trillion) as of the third quarter: 7.3% in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , 5.9% in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and 4.7% in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . He clearly has a great deal of confidence in those companies, and Wall Street anticipates substantial upside in all three stocks in the next year.\nHere are the important details.\nMeta Platforms: 28% upside implied by the median target price Meta has a strong presence in two industries: digital advertising and smart glasses. It owns three of the four most popular social media networks , which lets it collect user data and target media content. That advantage has made Meta the second-largest adtech company in the world. But the company also dominates the nascent smart glasses market.\n\nMeta is using artificial intelligence (AI) -- from custom chips to proprietary large language models -- to improve user engagement and advertising conversions across its portfolio of industry-leading social media. It is also developing a superintelligence system to integrate with its smart glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says glasses will be our \"primary computing devices\" in the future.\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look quite reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842 per share. That implies 28% upside from its current share price of $658.\nMicrosoft: 30% upside implied by the median target price Microsoft has a strong competitive position in two markets: enterprise software and cloud computing. It is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for its office productivity suite Microsoft 365, its portfolio also includes popular applications for business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning. Meanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud services provider.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft is monetizing AI across its software and cloud businesses. CEO Satya Nadella says customers are adopting Microsoft 365 Copilot (a generative AI assistant) faster than any new product. Additionally, its entire family of Copilot applications topped 150 million monthly active users in the quarter ended in September, up from 100 million in the quarter ended in June.\n\nMicrosoft Azure has gained about 3 percentage points of market share since the AI boom started, despite compute capacity constraints. However, the company is building out its data center capacity faster than any other cloud provider, according to Satya Nadella. Azure plans to double its data center footprint in the next two years.\nWall Street expects Microsoft's earnings to increase at 14% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 35 times earnings look somewhat expensive, though investors eager to own the stock could still buy a small position today. Among 62 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 30% upside from its current share price of $485.\nAmazon: 32% upside implied by the median target price Amazon has a strong competitive position in three industries: e-commerce, advertising, and cloud computing. It runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. The company dominates retail media, one of the fastest-growing verticals in the broader digital advertising market. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services.\n\nIn retail, Amazon has built an artificial intelligence shopping assistant called Rufus that is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales in 2025. Shoppers who engage the conversational chatbot are 60% more likely to make a purchase. Amazon has also developed generative AI tools that improve inventory placement, robot productivity, and last-mile delivery.\nMeanwhile, AWS is introducing artificial intelligence features at a rapid clip. In the last few months, the company added tools to Bedrock AgentCore that help developers build and deploy generative AI agents. AWS also added agents for software development, security fixes, and performance monitoring. And it expanded its portfolio of pre-trained models.\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 32 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 73 analysts, Amazon has a median target price of $300 per share. That implies 32% upside from its current share price of $228.\n\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:25 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple’s artificial intelligence (AI) innovations have been lackluster, but its ecosystem is as powerful as ever.\nAmazon is driving tremendous growth in its AWS cloud division thanks to strong AI demand.\nValuation should always play a part in proper investment analysis.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple ›\n\nWhen looking at stocks to buy, investor attention might go to the most dominant and well-known businesses out there. This will naturally lead to technology companies that have strong market positions, popular products and services, and perhaps a presence in the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) come to mind. Over the long term, they have both been fantastic stocks to own, doing a great job compounding shareholder capital. And today, they command multitrillion-dollar market caps .\nBoth businesses have their own investment merits. But which is the best stock to buy right now?\nApple is moving slowly with AI, but the moat couldn't be wider The biggest knock on Apple in recent years has been its unhurried approach to AI. Major tech enterprises across the board are moving incredibly fast at building out the necessary infrastructure and software capabilities to position themselves to become leaders in the AI market.\nApple, in typical fashion, started out being cautious, as its usual strategy isn't to be first, but to be the best. However, the Apple Intelligence features on its smartphones aren't turning any heads. And an upgraded Siri launch has been delayed until next year.\n\nThat still doesn't take away from Apple's wide economic moat. The company's competitive position is supported by its strong brand, with Apple arguably being the most recognizable business on Earth. The brand resonates with consumers across the globe, thanks to the company's beautifully designed hardware and software offerings, superior user experience, and premium positioning. The elevated retail experience also has an impact.\nThe moat is also helped by Apple's powerful ecosystem . This combination of products and services is what makes the business truly one-of-a-kind. Customers are essentially locked in, with Apple being able to generate profits on its hardware devices, while also raking in high-margin revenue on its fast-growing services segment.\nThere are very few companies as financially sound as Apple. Its net profit margin has averaged 25.5% in the past five years. It collects massive amounts of free cash flow . And the balance sheet is clean, with $34 billion of net cash on the books (as of Sept. 27). This reduces risk for investors.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon has multiple growth drivers that will push it forward Amazon, on the other hand, is already atop the AI race. It's planning to spend a whopping $125 billion on capital expenditures this year to bolster its technical infrastructure. That's an easy capital allocation decision for the leadership team to make, as they are seeing robust demand from customers for AI-related products and services.\n\nThis shows up in Amazon Web Services (AWS), whose revenue shot up 20% year over year in Q3. This booming segment is also very profitable, bringing in trailing-12-month operating income of $43.8 billion.\nBesides cloud computing, which itself is poised to be a $2.4 trillion market worldwide in 2030, Amazon dominates online shopping. Nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce activity happens on its marketplace, giving it an advantageous position as buyer behavior keeps moving to digital channels.\nInvestors might not realize that Amazon reported $17.7 billion in digital ad sales in the third quarter, a major growth engine that is likely also producing high margins. Amazon also has a presence in streaming entertainment, autonomous driving, and healthcare.\n\nI believe Amazon is in a better position to increase its revenue and earnings power at a faster rate than Apple, thanks to those secular trends working in its favor. Valuation matters as well. Amazon stock's price-to-earnings ratio of 32.1 is below Apple's multiple of 36.6, given the former the upper hand.\nWith a time horizon looking out over the next five or 10 years, I view Amazon as the best stock to buy right now.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "‘It felt so wrong’: Colin Angle on iRobot, the FTC, and the Amazon deal that never was\n\nConnie Loizos\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 1:31 PM PST 12 min read\n\nIn this article: IRBT\n\nAMZN\n\nWhen iRobot filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last Sunday , it marked the end of an era for one of America’s most beloved robotics companies. The Roomba maker, which had sold over 50 million robots since its 2002 launch, had survived 35 years of near-death experiences and technical challenges only to be undone by what founder Colin Angle calls “avoidable” regulatory opposition.\n\nThe collapse followed Amazon’s January 2024 decision to scuttle its $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot after 18 months of investigation by the FTC and European regulators. In this candid conversation, Angle reflects on what he describes as a profoundly frustrating process, the chilling message it sends to entrepreneurs, and his determination to move forward with a new venture in consumer robotics.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nTC: You called the bankruptcy “avoidable” and a “tragedy for consumers.” Walk me through what you think regulators got wrong in blocking the Amazon acquisition.\nCA: I think there’s a real lesson around the role of the FTC and the European Commission. The goal, of course, is to avoid the abuses that can happen in monopolies and with the goal of protecting consumer choice and protecting innovation.\n\nWhat happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot’s trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier. In the EU, we had a 12% market share [but it was] declining where the number one competitor was only three years old in the market, which is nearly the definition of a vibrant and dynamic marketplace. And in the United States, iRobot’s market share was higher, but it was declining and there were multiple growing competitors bringing outside innovation into the marketplace.\nThis should have been a no-brainer. This should have been three, four weeks of investigation. What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked.\n\nWhat was that 18-month process actually like? What were you being asked to do?\nThe amount of money and time spent was indescribable. I would not be surprised if over 100,000 documents were created and delivered. iRobot invested a significant part of our discretionary earnings against fulfilling the requirements that went along with doing the transaction. Amazon was forced to invest many, many, many times that. There was a whole team, both internal and external employees and lawyers and economists working to try to, in as many different ways as possible — because it seemed like our message was falling on deaf ears — demonstrate that this acquisition was not going to create a monopolistic situation.\n\nStory Continues\nThere was daily activity for 18 months associated with this. Perhaps most telling, when I was testifying as part of being deposed, I had a chance to walk the halls of the FTC. The examiners on their office doors had printouts of deals blocked, like trophies.\nTrophies?\nTo me, it felt so wrong as an entrepreneur who started this thing literally in my living room and lived six and a half years never having enough money in the bank to make payroll, finally making it through succeeding. Here’s an agency whose stated mission is protecting consumer interests and helping the United States economy, celebrating as victories every time they shut down M&A, which in a very real way is the primary driver of value creation for the innovation economy.\n\nI went into this deposition looking for a friend. It’s like, “Here we are, we’re obviously not in a stronger place, and here’s a great opportunity for us. Are you excited for us?” Maybe this is just my naïve take coming out, but that’s not the reception I got. It was, “Why should we ever let them do this?” It’s like: because it’s good for the consumer — because it’s going to catalyze innovation.\nHow do you think what happened here changes the calculus for startup founders who see acquisition as their exit strategy? Do you think we’re in a world where American tech companies can’t scale through M&A?\nRisk has a chilling effect. If you’re an entrepreneur, your only option is to hope that it doesn’t happen again. The reason you and I are talking is I hope by my words I can make it less likely that it will happen again.\n\nI founded a new company and my outlook on exit strategy and even commercialization strategy is impacted by the experiences I had at iRobot. How can it not be? That precedent creates risk of it happening again, and only through positive experiences do we start to dial down the anxiety that the exits I’m depending on — or as a venture capitalist, the exits I’m investing in assuming will happen — will actually come through. That risk is factored into the willingness to invest, the valuation of deals, and the rate of new company formation.\nIt’s hard to say there’s X percent fewer entrepreneurial starts or exits as a result of the chilling message, but it certainly didn’t help. Entrepreneurs can use every leg up that we as a nation can provide. It is a rugged journey. When it actually works out, it should be a celebration. The FTC is there as a safeguard against very real examples of things gone too far. I’m a big believer in checks and balances. But when things get out of whack, the country suffers.\n\nLet’s talk about iRobot’s journey. The Roomba didn’t come out for 12 years after the company was founded. Tell me about those early days.\niRobot was a bunch of people in an academic lab saying, “We were promised robots. Where are the robots?” If I could be pissed off that I don’t have the robots we were promised, I should do something about it. If not us, who? If not now, when?\nOne of the co-founders, my professor Rod Brooks, had pioneered an AI technology which allowed the embedding of machine intelligence in low-cost robotics. The mission of the company was to build cool stuff, deliver a great product, have fun, make money, and change the world.\nThe first business plan was “private mission to the moon, sell the movie rights.” We were maybe the first company to fail to do exactly that. But the technology we developed led to additions to the Mars Pathfinder mission — my name’s up on Mars. We built robots that went into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. We built the PackBot, which was the first robot ever deployed in a combat mission for the US Army, went into caves in Afghanistan, and became the primary methodology for diffusing improvised explosive devices. We would get postcards: “You saved my life today.”\n\nWhen the Fukushima disaster happened, we donated half a million dollars worth of robots to Japan. We sent six people over to train Tokyo Electric Power Company employees. Those robots were the first inside the reactor doors, mapped out radiation levels, and found a path where an employee could run in, get to the control room, work for a minute and a half, run back out, and only receive a lifetime dose of radiation. We were credited with enabling the shutdown of the reactor.\nAnd then year 12, the Roomba?\nI had a team that was working on toys, and one of the guys said, “Colin, I think it’s time we can do this. We can finally make the vacuum.” I’m like, “Okay, here’s $15,000. Two weeks. See what you can do.” Two weeks later they came back and said, “Hey, that’s not bad. Maybe there’s something here.” We scraped and found a little bit of money [to build these]. A year and a half later, I convinced my board that we could build 10,000 of these robots and we launched them.\n\nIt’s really the media that picked up the story. We had no money for marketing. Reporters were fascinated because we tended to do interesting things that were real, and they couldn’t believe that robot vacuuming could possibly be real. [The reaction was:] “My God, it actually worked.” We ended up selling 70,000 robots in the first three months. Then we nearly went out of business the next year.\nBecause you couldn’t accommodate demand?\nBecause we screwed up. The press drove this huge initial demand — 70,000 robots. So next year we’re going to do four times that. We made 300,000 robots. We even made a television commercial, but we were a bunch of geek engineers, so it totally failed. After Cyber Monday we were sitting with 250,000 robots in our warehouse like, “Oh my God, the world’s going to end.”\n\nThen something good happened. The guy running our website said, “Why did sales quadruple yesterday?” We hadn’t done anything. What had happened was Pepsi had started running a TV ad with Dave Chappelle. He walks into this beautiful home, picks up a potato chip, and a Roomba comes out. He’s like, “A vacuum cleaner!” He throws down the potato chip, the vacuum eats it, then chases him. His pants are ripped off. He stands up in boxers. A beautiful woman appears, and he says, “Your vacuum cleaner ate my pants.” We sold 250,000 robots in two weeks and realized we knew nothing about marketing.\nWow! You had no idea Pepsi was incorporating your product into its commercial?\nNo idea. It was wild. You try to do good for so long and you get smacked in the face so many times, and then sometimes something good happens. You could say because of that crazy moment in time, we have robots. When we think about just how fragile a journey it is — cats riding Roombas was a big part of why we succeeded. Does that make any sense? No, not at all. But we certainly didn’t expect tens of billions of views of cats riding Roombas.\n\nAt some point you started seeing Chinese competitors like Roborock and Ecovacs adopting lidar navigation years before iRobot. Why did you stick with vision-based navigation for so long?\nWe explicitly did not put lasers on the robot. We had the technology decades ago because it’s a dead-end technology. Under my strategic direction, we were going to invest every penny of cost against a vision-based nav and situational understanding system. Your Tesla does not have a laser on it. It is all vision-based. At least Elon agrees with me.\nOur strategic plan was for Roomba to be much more than just a vacuum cleaner in the home. To do that, it needs to understand more. Lasers are not advanced technology — they’ve been around for decades. They’re an expedient solution to a subset of the problems that a robot at home needs to take on. A laser will never tell you whether you actually cleaned the floor or not.\n\nIt is absolutely true that Chinese competition was coming in at lower price points. We were late in building a two-in-one robot — we believed that by separating mopping and vacuuming you could give a better customer experience. The customer voted that we were wrong, and that’s okay. We certainly were first in auto-evac, first in navigation. We were also importantly excluded from the Chinese marketplace, which is the largest market for consumer robotics in the world. That didn’t help.\nWhat learnings from your iRobot experience would you share with other robotics entrepreneurs?\nThe first thing I tell all robotics entrepreneurs is: make sure you understand your market so that you are building something that delivers more value than it costs to create. Robots are so exciting, so sexy that it’s really easy to convince yourself that you’re doing something that is going to change the world, if only consumers were smart enough to realize it. That’s a pretty tough equation.\n\nTechnology is oftentimes in the robot space well ahead of the business plans that can take advantage of the technology. One of the traps is thinking of robotics as a thing as opposed to a toolkit. As soon as you say, “I’m going to build a robot,” and head off building your humanoid — are you really doing it because you understand a problem you’re trying to solve, or are you enamored with building your thing?\nWhen I started iRobot, it was just assumed that robots were going to vacuum floors by building humanoids to push upright vacuum cleaners. When we first built Roomba, we would ask people, “Is that a robot?” People would say, “No, that’s not a robot. A robot has arms and legs and a head.” Yet Roomba at the time cost 10,000 times less than a humanoid pushing an upright vacuum.\n\nThe challenge of entrepreneurship is breaking through the romance and opportunity and falling in love with your technology and getting to the application that you’re trying to solve. Understand your consumer, understand the problem you’re trying to solve — because it’s complicated, robotics is expensive, and it takes a lot of energy to get right.\nYou mentioned you’ve founded a new company . What can you tell me about it?\nWe’re in stealth mode, but I’ll give you a broad hint. It’s consumer-facing. We’re really looking at the fact that most of the things robots can do to meet outstanding needs require us to interact with other people. So how do we build a robot that actually has sufficient emotional sophistication — not human-level, but enough — to build an enduring co-character that can make sense over time and use that for health and wellness related applications?\n\nIt’s going to be awesome. I’m so excited about it. It’s given me enthusiasm and energy to have a chance to use this new toolkit and continue on my journey to build the robots we were promised. I really haven’t changed that much from a grad student in college saying, “Oh my God, we’ve been promised robots and we don’t have the ones that I want yet.” I spent 30 years focused on building the world’s greatest floor care robot, and now I have a chance to do something else.\nFor more from this interview with Angle, including his take on whether humanoid robots will ever work, check out TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC Download podcast — new episodes drop every Tuesday, and the full conversation will be available soon .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Should You Buy Amazon Stock in 2026?\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 12:23 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Amazon's cloud computing division is accelerating its growth, while e-commerce keeps rising steadily.\nThe stock looks cheap if you believe in the company's margin improvement.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nDid you know that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has actually underperformed the stock market indexes over the last five years? In that time frame, the S&P 500 index is up 98%, while Amazon's share price has risen by only 40%.\n\nWhile that's not a terrible outcome, this is an unexpected development for one of the investing world's beloved technology stocks, which led the pack in both cloud computing and e-commerce in North America.\nHowever, Amazon's underlying business still appears to be performing well. Does that make the stock undervalued and a buy for your portfolio in 2026?\nAccelerating cloud growth Amazon has been deemed a loser in the artificial intelligence ( AI ) race, as revenues for its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), have grown more slowly than those of rivals Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.\nHowever, last quarter, AWS' growth did accelerate to 20% year over year as its revenue hit $33 billion. It has an extensive relationship with the start-up Anthropic, which is growing its own revenue at a blistering clip and spending tens of billions of dollars on computing power to train and run its AI. A lot of that spending is going to AWS.\n\nIt may not be a monopoly, but AWS is highly profitable and should be a durable grower for Amazon, with or without the exposure to AI. With $44 billion in trailing-12-month operating income, this is a highly valuable part of the Amazon business, and one that is apparently being underrated by investors today.\nDon't forget e-commerce It seems like all the investing world can discuss right now is AI, cloud computing, and computer chips. But there is a much bigger part of the Amazon business that many investors are ignoring: online shopping. Its e-commerce and shipping business keeps chugging along as the entire e-commerce sector continues to take more market share in the retail space.\n\nAmazon's North American retail sales grew 11% year over year last quarter to over $100 billion. Over the trailing 12 months, that division has now done over $64 billion in advertising revenue, $166.8 billion in third-party seller services revenue, and $48 billion in subscription revenue. Combined, that was almost $300 billion in annualized sales from business lines with higher margins than Amazon's original first-party e-commerce model, and should lead to expanding profit margins in the years to come.\n\nStory Continues\nEven in 2025, the North American retail division only has an operating margin of 6.6% as Amazon keeps investing in its growth efforts. In 2026, I expect these figures to slowly keep expanding.\nWhy the stock is a buy in 2026 Amazon's stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31, which is fairly low when compared to its big tech peers. With its potential to keep compounding its revenue growth as well as margin expansion opportunities in 2026, I think the stock is a good deal for any investor looking to buy today.\n\nFor example, let's do some math with Amazon's revenue and earnings growth. Its trailing revenue figure is $691 billion. If that grows at 10% annually for the next three years, it will hit $919 billion in annual revenue.\nToday, its margin, calculated on the basis of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), is 11.5% on a consolidated basis. With fast growth from AWS and steady margin expansions in the retail business, it is reasonable to expect Amazon's operating margin to grow to 15% three years from now.\nThat would bring the company's operating earnings at that point to $138 billion compared to $80 billion today. The combination of that expected steady rise in earnings and Amazon's currently reasonable P/E makes the stock a buy in 2026 and a hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Should You Buy Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks In 2026?\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft have struggled in the last few months, bringing their valuations down with them.\nOther AI stocks like Amazon still look cheaper at today's prices.\nCyclicality risks should keep investors away from Nvidia stock in 2026. Amazon looks like a better buy.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence ( AI ) trade began to sputter in late 2025. Stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are flat since August of this year after seemingly going up at an insatiable rate for three straight years. Similar results have occurred for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shareholders, with its stock actually down over the last six months.\nInvestors have begun to lose faith in the growth-at-any-cost mindset among these AI start-ups even though underlying revenue growth is still strong for the sector.\nDoes that make now a perfect time to buy AI stocks for 2026? Let's take a look at the numbers and find out.\nHigh multiples and fast-growing businesses Stagnant share prices have helped some of the fundamentals for these AI stocks catch up to their share prices. Last quarter, Nvidia's revenue grew 62% year over year to $57 billion, with net income up 65% to $31.9 billion. Microsoft's revenue was up 18%, with 24% growth in operating income.\nAI companies are still paying big paychecks to buy Nvidia's advanced computer chips or to utilize them in AI data centers run by cloud providers such as Microsoft. OpenAI is the leader in AI spending, with commitments in the hundreds of billions of dollars across various sources. A lot of this spending will go to Nvidia computer chips.\n\nStill, even with soaring earnings, both Microsoft and Nvidia (two of the largest companies in the world by market cap) do not have dirt cheap earnings ratios. Nvidia has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 44, while Microsoft's is 34. If earnings keep growing quickly, these ratios will come down in a hurry, but it puts high expectations on future growth.\nMore exposure to AI and cyclicality than others Booming spending in any industry can lead to supply gluts. This has happened in the computer chip space many times throughout history, as well as in other infrastructure build-outs like telecommunications and railroads.\nDon't ignore this risk with the AI winners like Nvidia. There is a major downside risk to Nvidia's earnings power if the company's revenue growth declines along with its profit margin, a double whammy to net income.\n\nSome stocks are more exposed to the AI trade than others, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, or Oracle . Others have been less aggressive on spending or winning contracts, such as Amazon , and are therefore less at risk to an AI or computer chip spending downcycle. With a P/E ratio of 31, Amazon's valuation is lower based on its trailing earnings as well.\n\n繼續閱讀\nDon't ask whether you should buy AI stocks Investors shouldn't ask whether they should buy AI stocks, as there are dozens, if not hundreds, of stocks exposed to the AI trade, all with different stories and valuations. You have direct beneficiaries such as Nvidia that may be a risky bet right now, or even wilder companies like CoreWeave , laden with debt.\n\nDon't ask if you should buy AI stocks. Ask which AI stocks you should buy today. Amazon looks like a good candidate at today's prices because of its lower P/E ratio, dual growth engines from cloud computing and e-commerce, as well as its growing relationship with start-up Anthropic. Amazon has not gotten as much enthusiasm from Wall Street in 2025, which just might make it a good pick for 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Instacart Is Under Investigation. Should You Buy the Dip in CART Stock?\n\nAnushka Mukherji\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 8:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CART\n\nAMZN\n\nMaplebear’s Instacart (CART) has been on shaky ground this year as competition in grocery delivery intensifies. Well-funded rivals like Amazon (AMZN), Walmart (WMT), and other delivery platforms are leveraging their scale, logistics networks, and partnerships to squeeze Instacart’s market share. At the same time, mounting business and regulatory challenges have dented investor confidence.\n\nThat pressure intensified on Dec. 18, when CART shares slipped about 1.5% following reports that Instacart agreed to pay $60 million in consumer refunds as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC alleged that the company used deceptive tactics tied to subscription sign-ups and its “100% satisfaction guarantee” advertisement, resulting in higher fees and making refunds difficult to obtain.\nMore News from Barchart 5 \"Best of the Best\" Dividend Stocks to Own in 2026\nThis 1 Lesser-Known Stock Is Set to Dominate with Nvidia and Broadcom in 2026\nNike, Tilray, and Palantir: Their Unusually Active Put Options Will Boost Your Wallet After Christmas\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nCompounding those concerns, Instacart is reportedly facing a separate FTC probe into its pricing practices, after a recent study suggested its algorithmic pricing tools led shoppers to pay different prices for identical items at the same store. With regulatory headwinds intensifying, does this pullback present a buying opportunity, or are the risks still too high?\nAbout Instacart Stock Founded in 2012, Instacart has become a central player in North America’s grocery ecosystem, operating at the intersection of retailers, consumers, and on-demand fulfillment. The company works with more than 1,800 national, regional, and local retail banners, enabling online shopping, delivery, and pickup from nearly 100,000 stores through the Instacart Marketplace.\n\nThis network allows millions of consumers to shop from familiar retailers while supporting roughly 600,000 shoppers who earn income by picking, packing, and delivering orders on flexible schedules. At the same time, the California-based company has expanded beyond delivery into a broader technology platform for retailers. Its enterprise-grade tools help power e-commerce experiences, fulfill orders, digitize brick-and-mortar stores, deliver advertising solutions, and generate actionable insights.\nPublic since 2023, Instacart currently has a $12 billion market capitalization, but the stock hasn’t lived up to broader market strength. Shares peaked at $53.50 in August this year and have since fallen nearly 17%. So far in 2025, CART is up about 10.9%, a respectable gain, but one that still lags the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which has advanced 16.2% over the same stretch.\n\nStory Continues\nInside Instacart’s Q3 Earnings Report On Nov. 10, Instacart dropped its fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings report, which blew past both Wall Street’s top and bottom line expectations. Total revenue for the quarter jumped 10% year-over-year (YOY) to $939 million and also came in ahead of Wall Street’s expected figure of $934.1 million. Gross transaction value (GTV), which tracks the value of goods sold, also climbed 10% YOY to $9.17 billion, while total orders surged 14% to 83.4 million, driven by higher demand for essentials and optimized logistics.\n\nRevenue growth was broad-based. Transaction revenue reached $670 million, up 10% year over year and representing 7.3% of GTV. At the same time, advertising and other revenue increased to $269 million, also up 10%, accounting for 2.9% of GTV. The company’s profitability story also strengthened meaningfully. Adjusted EBITDA jumped 22% to $278 million, reflecting operating leverage and the impact of deeper retailer partnerships.\nA key highlight was the expansion of Instacart’s relationship with Kroger (KR), which reaffirmed Instacart as its primary delivery fulfillment partner across all Kroger digital properties, supporting fast and reliable delivery from nearly 2,700 stores nationwide. On the bottom line, EPS came in at $0.51, up 21.2% YOY and just ahead of the $0.50 consensus forecast.\n\nMeanwhile, Artificial intelligence (AI) remains a growing driver across the business. During the quarter, Instacart upgraded its ad-relevance systems using large language models, boosting engagement and increasing the number of items added to carts via Sponsored Product units. The company also expanded its one-click, AI-powered recommendation tools to around 3,000 brands, helping them better optimize bids, budgets, and creative execution.\nIn addition, AI-generated landing pages are now available to all brands, allowing faster creation of dynamic, high-performing content for both on- and off-platform campaigns. To reinforce confidence in its long-term value creation, Instacart authorized a $1.5 billion increase to its share repurchase program and plans to initiate a $250 million accelerated share repurchase, while continuing to buy back shares opportunistically.\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects fiscal 2025 Q4 GTV to land between $9.45 billion and $9.60 billion, alongside adjusted EBITDA of $285 million to $295 million. That outlook implies 9%-11% YOY GTV growth, with order volumes projected to grow even faster. Management cited strong October trends and continued momentum from new and expanded enterprise partnerships, while acknowledging that potential EBT SNAP funding impacts could partially offset those gains.\nWhat Do Analysts Have to Say About Instacart Stock? Even as regulatory concerns hang over the stock, Wall Street’s outlook on Instacart remains more constructive than bearish. CART currently carries a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 32 analysts covering the company, 13 call it a “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” 17 advise “Hold,” and only one has a “Strong Sell” view.\n\nThat cautious confidence is also evident in price targets. The average target of $50.48 implies roughly 10% upside from current levels. At the same time, the most bullish call on the Street sees shares climbing to $66, indicating a 43.7% rally if Instacart can successfully navigate its regulatory challenges.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

DJT6 is now the fifth Amazon facility in Southern California to join the Teamsters, along with the KSBD Air Hub in San Bernadino, DFX4 in Victorville, DAX5 in City of Industry, and DAX8 in Palmdale.\nWorkers at the facility began their unionization efforts with the Teamsters earlier this week by staging a midnight walkout during the holiday peak season, when Amazon workers experience increased workloads and more dangerous working conditions. The newest members of Local 1932 are fighting to win better pay and respect from management for making Amazon one of the richest companies on the planet.\n\n\"Workers at DJT6, one of Amazon's most important facilities, have been on the front end of Amazon's abuse for years,\" said Randy Korgan, Director of the Teamsters Amazon Division and Secretary-Treasurer of Local 1932. \"It is a crime that Amazon makes billions off their backs while they can't even afford to buy a home near the warehouse. DJT6 workers showed tremendous courage in walking off the job to join the fight and demand their fair share.\"\nDJT6 warehouse workers are specifically demanding that Amazon provide an industry-standard minimum salary, health care, and safer working conditions. Workers at the facility report Amazon ignoring workplace injuries and threatening injured workers' jobs if they take time off.\n\n\"For too long, Amazon has profited off our labor yet denied our rights as workers,\" said Samuel Padilla, an Amazon DJT6 warehouse worker. \"Now, we are coming to take what we have rightfully earned. Amazon may not listen to any one individual worker, but we will force them to listen to us together as Teamsters.\"\nDJT6 is the latest Amazon facility to organize with the Teamsters, joining over 200 drivers in Queens, New York and Amazon CDL drivers in Shepherdsville, Kentucky. To date, nearly 10,000 Amazon workers nationwide are demanding Amazon end its illegal union-busting and recognize the Teamsters Union.\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents over 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

On December 17, Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski maintained an Overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $295. This is a reaffirmation of the firm’s earlier update on December 2.\nThis follows BMO Capital’s adjustment a day earlier when it lifted the price target on the stock to $304 from $300, while keeping an Outperform rating on the shares. The firm said it had conversations with two former AWS employees, with the discussions providing insights into increased cloud commitments, which became the basis for the revision.\n\nAs of the close of business on December 17, Wall Street analysts have a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock, with a one-year average share price target of $296.12, representing an upside of 33%.\nIn other news, press reports on Wednesday said that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in negotiations with OpenAI over a potential $10 billion investment that could see an agreement to use its AI chips. However, sources familiar with the matter described the talks as ‘fluid’ at this point.\nThe reports come at a time when the ChatGPT maker is preparing for an IPO as early as the second half of next year. If the deal goes through, the company could be valued at over $500 billion, reported Reuters.\nAmazon.com, Inc.

      "Content": "Amazon’s Retail Engine May Matter More Than AWS Right Now\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:23 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nQuick Read Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is positioned for a strong holiday quarter driven primarily by its core e-commerce business.\nThe stock’s underperformance this year has reset expectations and improved near-term risk-reward.\nAmazon’s scale, third-party marketplace leverage, and logistics dominance provide earnings durability even if AWS growth cools.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video Why Amazon stands out this quarter I started the conversation by saying that one of my favorite retail stocks right now is Amazon. This is not an AI call and it is not an AWS hype trade. It is about the holiday quarter. Amazon’s e-commerce platform is built to capture peak consumer demand, with massive scale, pricing leverage, and millions of third-party sellers operating inside its ecosystem.\n\nLower expectations help Lee pointed out that Amazon has underperformed the broader market this year, which matters more than most investors realize. Expectations are no longer stretched. Even a solid, not spectacular, quarter can move the stock if retail margins and volumes come through. Berkshire Hathaway still owns Amazon, making it one of the few major tech names it holds alongside Apple and Alphabet.\n\nAWS is not the swing factor right now We both agreed that AWS remains a long-term asset, but near-term cloud and AI spending has become more competitive and more capital intensive. That creates the risk of disappointment if investors expect too much too fast. The key point is that Amazon does not need AWS to be a home run this quarter to deliver strong results.\n\nThe e-commerce moat still wins I emphasized that controlling the leading e-commerce platform in the United States and many global markets is an enormous advantage. Amazon benefits regardless of which sellers win during the holidays because it controls fulfillment, advertising, and transaction flow. With expectations reset and retail momentum building, Amazon looks well positioned into year-end.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: So the other company that I love in retail right now is I love Amazon.\n[00:00:09] Lee Jackson: Really? Okay. That's interesting. I, I can see why.\n[00:00:13] Doug McIntyre: so I really love Amazon for this quarter, and it's not just because AWS is gonna do well or they're gonna say that they're doing well or doing badly with ai, they will have a very, very good quarter with just the Amazon e-commerce business, similar to Walmart, you know?\n\n繼續閱讀\n[00:00:32] Yep. Lots and lots of leverage. Lot of third parties. Um. You know, b basically host themselves on Amazon. Right. I, I lo I love Amazon for this holiday period.\n[00:00:42] Lee Jackson: Well, I do too. And it's underperformed this year, so Yeah. So, and, and, and Buffet owns some Amazon, so it's the only other tech stock really that's in there other than Apple and Google.\n\n[00:00:54] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. And I like the stock particularly because even if AWS isn't a home run for this, this quarter, uh, e-commerce could be.\n[00:01:03] Lee Jackson: Yeah. And, it's AWS is a home run for the long haul, that's for sure.\n[00:01:08] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. Well, it has been the short haul too, but there it's one of those, uh, potential disappointments.\n[00:01:14] Yeah. In the AI growth they've put a lot of money in. So I would look at Amazon as a maybe AWS is now, uh, not as quite as attractive because AI is getting more competitive and it's expensive. But when you hold the lead in e-commerce in the United States and a bunch of other countries, that's a good poll position to have.\n[00:01:37] Lee Jackson: Yeah, it really is. It really is.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

(NASDAQ: ROKU ) ranks among the best high growth stocks to buy now . Guggenheim maintained a Buy rating on Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU), but increased its price target to $115 from $110 on December 4. According to the firm, Roku’s “core CTV building blocks and incremental revenue drivers into 2026” are expected to contribute to growth that exceeds expectations and boosts investor confidence.\nGuggenheim has increased Roku’s revenue, gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA projections for the fourth quarter of 2025 and 2026. The updated guidance takes into account new revenue streams, including data fees for off-platform inventory and contributions from a growing variety of DSP partners, such as Amazon, as well as heightened confidence in the market for connected TV advertising.\n\nIn addition, Guggenheim believes Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) will gain from Winter Olympics-related publicity in Q1, estimating 14% core growth versus consensus projections of 12%. Political marketing and World Cup-related spending are also expected to provide further tailwinds this year.\nOn the other hand, the firm addressed concerns about Netflix possibly acquiring Warner Bros.

      "Content": "Billionaires Sell Amazon Stock and Buy a Quantum Computing Stock Up 3,050% Since 2023\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: RGTI\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Israel Englander, Ken Griffin, and Steven Schonfeld -- hedge fund managers who beat the S&P 500 over the past three years -- sold Amazon and bought Rigetti in the third quarter.\nAmazon is effectively using artificial intelligence to boost sales and improve efficiency across its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses, and the stock price is attractive.\nRigetti benefits from vertical integration and multi-chip processors that may give it an edge in building large-scale quantum computers, but the stock price is beyond absurd.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIn the third quarter, a few wealthy hedge fund managers sold shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and bought shares of Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) , a quantum computing stock that has advanced 3,050% since January 2023.\nIsrael Englander at Millennium Management sold 787,900 shares of Amazon, reducing his position by 17%. He also added 522,100 shares of Rigetti.\nKen Griffin at Citadel Advisors sold 1.6 million shares of Amazon, reducing his position by 35%. He also added 51,700 shares of Rigetti.\nSteven Schonfeld at Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 253,700 shares of Amazon, reducing his position by 72%. He also added 8,900 shares of Rigetti.\nImportantly, all three hedge fund managers beat the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) during the past three years, which makes them good sources of inspiration. Here's what investors should know about Amazon and Rigetti.\nAmazon: The artificial intelligence stock the billionaires sold Amazon has a strong position in three industries. It runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe by gross merchandise volume, it is the largest retail advertiser in the world by sales, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud by cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue.\n\nThe company is leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) to improve sales and efficiency. Its AI shopping assistant, Rufus, is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales this year; shoppers are 60% more likely to make a purchase when they engage Rufus. Amazon has also developed more than 1,000 generative AI tools to optimize tasks like inventory placement, demand forecasting, and last-mile delivery.\nMeanwhile, AWS has been introducing AI features at a rapid clip. In the past few months, it added tools to Bedrock AgentCore that help customers build and deploy generative AI agents. The company also added autonomous agents for software development, security fixes, and performance monitoring. And it expanded its portfolio of pretrained models.\n\nStory Continues\nStrong third-quarter financial results suggest those innovations are paying off. Revenue increased 13% to $180 billion, driven by particularly strong sales growth in the advertising services and cloud computing segments. Meanwhile, excluding two one-time charges, operating income increased 25% to $21.7 billion, meaning the company is becoming increasingly profitable (i.e., operating income outpaced revenue).\n\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 32 times earnings look reasonable, especially when the company beat the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 23% during the past six quarters.\nSo why did Israel Englander, Ken Griffin, and Steven Schonfeld sell shares of Amazon in the third quarter? Concerns about tariffs may have factored into the decision, or maybe they saw compelling buying opportunities elsewhere. Regardless, do not assume they have lost confidence. All three still own Amazon, and excluding options, the stock is still a top-10 holding for Englander and Griffin.\nRigetti Computing: The quantum computing stock the billionaires bought Rigetti specializes in superconducting quantum computing, a modality by which microscopic superconducting circuits are cooled to near absolute zero to create qubits, the basic unit of information in quantum computers. The company has two important competitive moats:\nRigetti benefits from vertical integration, meaning it realizes cost efficiencies by controlling much of its supply chain. The company owns a chip fabrication facility where it manufactures quantum processors; it also develops the infrastructure (hardware and software) required to deliver cloud-based quantum services.\nRigetti developed the first multi-chip quantum processor, a large chip comprising several smaller chiplets. Scaling quantum computers -- building systems with enough qubits to solve useful problems -- is difficult because of high error rates. But Rigetti believes its multi-chip architecture will help overcome that problem.\n\nHowever, widely useful quantum computers -- meaning systems that fix errors in real time and have enough qubits to solve complex problems -- are probably a decade or two away. Experts think quantum systems will need 10,000 to 1 million physical qubits to be widely useful, and Rigetti's product roadmap doesn't even contemplate 1,000-quibit systems until 2027.\nBasil Alsikafi, portfolio manager at White Brook Capital, in his third-quarter investor letter highlighted Rigetti's mismatched fundamentals. Year to date, Rigetti reported revenue of $5 million but a net loss of $198 million, meaning losses have exceeded sales 40 times over. Even more alarming is the valuation.\nRigetti trades at 860 times sales. For context, Palantir is the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 at 115 times sales, which itself is absurd. Rigetti is seven times more expensive. Also, the company has rapidly diluted shareholders by issuing stock to compensate for its losses. The number of outstanding shares rose 71% in the past year.\n\nSo why did Englander, Griffin, and Schonfeld buy shares of Rigetti? I think the decision is about momentum. They may hope to turn a quick profit and then sell the shares. It would be wrong to assume they have lasting conviction in Rigetti. None of the three hedge fund managers have a consequential amount of money invested in the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "3 of the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nDavid Jagielski, CPA, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:58 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSM\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points The stocks listed here all have market caps of more than $1 trillion.\nThey are among the leading companies in tech, but their valuations still aren't terribly high with respect to earnings.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAre you worried that you've missed out on the opportunity to generate a great return from artificial intelligence (AI) stocks? There are still plenty of good and reasonably priced AI stocks you can add to your portfolio today. And many of them are already large, safe, and established players in tech.\nHeading into 2026, three AI stocks that I think possess the most upside are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) . Here's why it's not too late to invest in these three tech giants.\nAlphabet It may come as a surprise to some that Alphabet is on this list. It is, after all, already one of the most valuable companies in the world. Its market cap of $3.7 trillion puts it not all that far behind the world's most valuable company, Nvidia , which is worth $4.3 trillion. Once a company gets that valuable, it becomes harder to keep the growth going.\n\nThe reason Alphabet still looks like a fantastic buy going into 2026 is that it can still go higher. For a while, investors were skeptical about its ability to continue to dominate in search, its core business, amid concerns that AI chatbots would steer users away from Google. And there may still be many skeptics out there, which is why Alphabet isn't the most valuable company in the world right now, which I believe is where it should rank given how massive its business is.\nAI has enabled Alphabet to enhance Google Search and add value for creators on YouTube. But don't forget that it also has a rapidly expanding robotaxi business in Waymo. Its cloud business is expanding, and the company is also making its own chips.\nIts operations are far more diverse than many other AI stocks out there, including Nvidia's. And yet, Alphabet's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28. That's modest in comparison to the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF where the average forward earnings multiple is just under 30. Alphabet should command a far higher premium than where it's at today, which is why, even at its current valuation, it can be a no-brainer buy heading into next year.\n\nAmazon Another obvious pick looks to be Amazon, whose valuation is $2.4 trillion, which remains firmly behind both Nvidia and Alphabet. Over the past 12 months, Amazon's stock price has actually declined by 4%. This is another example of an AI stock that may be worthy of a higher valuation.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company is known primarily for its online marketplace and its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a terrific growth driver. But in addition to that, Amazon also has a robotaxi business of its own, Zoox. It's not as big or popular as Waymo, but its toaster-designed vehicles look sleeker and more modern and could be more ideal for operating as robotaxis.\n\nAmazon has also been expanding its same-day delivery of fresh groceries to more markets recently, which can steal some market share from rival Walmart . Amazon has done a great job of predicting and anticipating purchases on its online marketplace, and replicating that success with groceries could make that an underrated opportunity where its AI capabilities can shine and give it an advantage.\nGiven the diversification of Amazon's business and plentiful growth opportunities, this is a stock that should also be worth more; it trades at a forward P/E of 27.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing In contrast to the other tech giants listed above, there's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC as it is also known. Its business is not as diversified, and that works to its advantage. TSMC makes chips for tech companies, including Nvidia. Its low-cost operations make it difficult for Intel and other rivals to compete. The Taiwan-based company plays an important role in the AI world due to the industry's dependence on its foundry.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30, TSMC's revenue rose by 30%, and its diluted per-share profit jumped by 39%. Not only has its growth been impressive, but it has incredibly strong operating margins of around 50%.\nThe stock has rallied more than 40% this year and has a $1.5 trillion market cap. But with a forward P/E of just under 24, it's the cheapest stock on this list.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

We're digging into all of this in today's options pit, sponsored by Tasty trade.\n00:15 Speaker A\nAnd Henry Schwartz, CBOE Vice President of Market Intelligence is here to discuss. Uh, let's talk about this surge in options demand. We were just talking offline. You said it's up what three times since uh COVID?\n00:32 Henry Schwartz\nYeah.\n00:33 Speaker A\nThat is incredible. So, what is this trend tell you?\n00:36 Henry Schwartz\nSo, I mean, this year we're going to see 15 billion option contracts trade. Uh if you go back to to just before COVID, it was about 4 billion contracts a year. So, and in fact, I've been doing the calculations. It looks like the 15 billionth contract will trade on Christmas Eve.\n00:52 Speaker A\nMhm.\n00:52 Henry Schwartz\nI think we should have a door prize or something. Let's see if we can figure out what trade.\n00:56 Speaker A\nThere might be some binary option futures betting markets that could uh take care of that.\n01:00 Henry Schwartz\nAbsolutely. Well, I mean, that that's actually kind of one of the big themes, right? As we've seen this the evolution of risk taking, betting, you know, there's a lot of different ways to discuss it. Um, you know, the the you know, COVID really or you know, that whole kind of market environment really changed the landscape for options trading. And basically, uh we saw growth of about 50% in 2020 and it has kept up and it is retail that is really driving most of that. You know, we continue to see, you know, a healthy institutional business. Uh we see, you know, we see, you know, the the big theme really for this year is kind of everything is just stronger. Across the board, no matter what asset classes you look at, if you're talking about index options like SPX or VIX. If you're talking about ETF options, which you know, we were just talking about kind of the explosion in in number of ETFs and single stock option flow, which is really, you know, primarily retail driven. And when you have a year like, you know, like we're seeing this year with, you know, basically the broad averages up, you know, between 15 and 20%, uh that just brings in more and more activity.\n02:08 Speaker A\nSo, I've been thinking about this and tell me if I'm just way offline here. But if we take it back to early late 2020, early 2021, that's when we had the whole Reddit GameStop phenomenon going on. Arguably, a lot of it was fueled with the stimulus checks, the stimmies. and next year is going to be a blockbuster record year for fiscal stimulus. Um there's going to be a lot of tax refunds and I'm just wondering, is there any way we could have some kind of a repeat of that, maybe not to the same extent, but do you think that we just get another surge, um perhaps just because people have more money to play with?\n02:46 Henry Schwartz\nI I mean, I think you have you have a lot of dynamics going on at the same time. You know, we do have a a a rate, you know, the rates are going down in the cycle, but you also do have some concerns about the labor market, you have concerns about, you know, just fundamental valuations. So there's a little bit of push and pull. I think, you know, that the the COVID situation and you know, zero interest rates and stimulus and meme stock, uh that that was such a perfect storm of just kind of\n03:28 Speaker A\nAgreed, perfect storm.\n03:29 Henry Schwartz\nexplosive bullish activity and and and retail were able to capitalize on it. You know, in a large part because they were at home and they kind of had the freedom to trade. You also had commissions that basically gone to zero just leading into that. So, everything came together and you know, a lot of these traders found each other and learned from each other on Reddit and on, you know, social media. Uh I don't know if 2026 is going to be quite the same. I think there's a little bit more kind of back and forth. Uh but you know, at least in terms of the options activity, you know, we continue to see new brokerage firms coming uh online. We see the existing brokerage firms, you know, innovating and and rolling out new platforms and doing some really interesting things. So, you know, I see the business, at least in the options world continuing to to do very, very well. And you know, in terms of assets, uh you know, I think that you have this environment now where, you know, the US has had an amazing run and there's a lot of people that say, oh, you know, I don't know, this is getting a little bit tired. Uh but at the same time, you you you know, every time we have a dip, uh,\n04:36 Speaker A\nAnd that's arguably better for options traders. I mean, option traders like volatility. I I I want to make sure we get to a couple other things here. The other is the rise of zero-dated options. And so that just gives more opportunities. Back in the day, you only had monthlies, so you had to wait every month. Then we had weeklies, then basically we have dailies now. And that has just increased uh this volume of options. Talk to me about some of the other innovations. I know CBOE has a bunch of new products, too.\n05:08 Henry Schwartz\nYeah, so the so we pioneered the zero DTE or the daily option option cycle starting 2022 and those are now about 2/3 of the activity uh in SPX and um and some of the big ETFs. Uh and there there's no signs of that slowing down. Uh we just rolled out the Mag 10 index, which is the Mag 7 plus uh Broadcom, uh AMD and Palantir. And you know, those 10 symbols together do about a third of the single stock option. Out of almost 4,000 single stocks. So you you can see how concentrated it is. That's what the trader, that's what the investing public really, really is interested in. They're following the stories, they're getting in and getting out of these stocks. And so the Mag 10 index which launched about a month ago, I'm very proud to say I was the very first trade in in Mag 10. and that option expired today and I made a little bit of money at it. Uh we actually have daily options coming in those just uh in two weeks. So that's, you know, and that's new, right? This this is the first time that that there's been a uh an index that's not quite as broad-based with the daily options on it as well. So, um you know, there's you know, the the industry just continues to keep innovating. You know, we see a lot of work going on in complex order execution, which is you know, basically about a third of the activity is customers trading one option against another, vertical spreads, calendar spreads, exactly. Uh and that you know, CBOE and all the other exchanges continue to kind of take steps to make that uh easier to do, add functionality. You can now trade flex options versus listed options, which is a kind of a special option that lets people pick their own expiration date and um and strike price and even exercise style.\n06:56 Speaker A\nAll right, Henry, we got to leave it there, but congratulations on your Mag 10 trade. I hope it pretends a bullish 2026. Thanks for joining us in studio here.\n07:05 Henry Schwartz\nAwesome.\n07:06 Speaker A\nAll right, we'll\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Things to Know About Amazon Stock Before You Buy\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 1:00 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points AWS drives most of its profit growth.\nIts advertising business is becoming its second profit engine.\nThose higher-margin businesses subsidize the expansion of its e-commerce business.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , the world's largest e-commerce and cloud infrastructure company, has been an outstanding growth stock for long-term investors. Over the past decade, its stock has rallied nearly 590%, outperforming the S&P 500's advance of about 240%.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, Amazon's revenue grew at a CAGR of 22% -- even as the pandemic, inflation, high interest rates, and other macro headwinds rattled the global economy. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share ( EPS ) to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 20%, respectively, as its e-commerce and cloud businesses continue to expand.\nAmazon's stock looks reasonably valued at 29 times next year's earnings, even as the S&P 500 hovers near its all-time high. I believe it's still a rock-solid investment, but investors should be aware of these three key things about the company before making a decision.\n1. AWS is its core profit engine Amazon generates most of its revenue from its e-commerce business, but its profits primarily come from Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud infrastructure platform. In the first nine months of 2025, AWS generated 18% of its net sales and 60% of its operating profit. Here's how rapidly that core profit engine grew over the past few years.\nMetric\n2022\n2023\n2024\n9M 2025\nAWS Net Sales Growth (YOY)\n29%\n13%\n19%\n18%\nAWS Operating Margin\n28.5%\n27.1%\n37%\n35.6%\nAWS Operating Income Growth (YOY)\n23%\n8%\n62%\n16%\n\nData source: Amazon. YOY = Year-over-year.\nThe rapid expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market is driving that growth as more companies upgrade their cloud infrastructure to handle the latest AI applications. AWS has also been rolling out more tools for developing and deploying agentic AI applications.\n\nAWS operates at higher margins than other smaller cloud platforms -- including Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure and Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Cloud -- because it's the entrenched market leader with superior scale and pricing power. According to Canalys, AWS controlled 32% of the global cloud infrastructure market in the second quarter of 2025, while Azure and Google Cloud held 22% and 11% shares, respectively.\n2. Its advertising business is booming Amazon isn't typically considered an advertising company, but it generates significant ad revenues from its promoted listings, integrated display ads, and streaming media ads. In 2024, its advertising service revenue increased 20% to $56.2 billion, accounting for 9% of its top line.\n\nLa historia continúa\nIn the first nine months of 2025, its advertising service revenue increased by 22% year-over-year to $47.3 billion, accounting for 9% of its top line. It doesn't break out the segment's operating profits separately, but it likely operates at higher margins than its retail business.\nTherefore, Amazon's advertising business -- which could easily surpass $60 billion in revenues this year -- will likely become its second profit engine alongside AWS. It's also well-poised to challenge Google's and Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) dominance of that booming market.\n\n3. Its Prime ecosystem is expanding Amazon's rising cloud and advertising profits enable it to expand its e-commerce business with lower-margin and loss-leading strategies. The bedrock of that expansion is its Prime ecosystem, which has locked in more than 240 million paid members worldwide.\nBy offering more discounts, free shipping options, cloud storage tools, streaming media services, and other benefits to its Prime members, Amazon enhances the stickiness of its e-commerce marketplace and widens its moat against other retailers. As long as its cloud and advertising businesses continue to grow, it can afford to take some losses to gain more members.\n\nIs it the right time to buy Amazon's stock? Amazon's growth will inevitably slow down as its business matures. However, it remains one of the most balanced plays in the secular expansion of the e-commerce, cloud, AI, and digital advertising markets. Its takeover of Whole Foods Market in 2017 also expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint and strengthened its online grocery business. It continues to expand its media businesses to challenge stand-alone streaming video and music companies. All of those long-term catalysts make it an excellent stock to buy, hold, and forget for a few decades.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

The platform is partnered with 130 dealers in 48 markets.\nAmazon Autos Global Director Fan Jin says there have been growing pains.\n“I would love to see more selection,” she said at the Presidio Group Auto Technology Conference in October (3). “That’s the No. 1 customer feedback.”\nShe added that based on feedback, the company is shifting gears to give online car buyers more time for everything: choosing the vehicle they want, deciding what extras they’d like to go with that choice — and considering the total cost associated with those decisions.\n\n“We’re slowing that process down so that customers really understand of course the vehicle decision, but also the financial and product decision,” she said (5).\n“So how do we build flexibility there and give them the time to think about it before they press that Place Order?”\nThat’s important. While the process is undeniably fast and convenient — no haggling, just picking up the car — it flips the entire script on the traditional car purchasing process.\nAnd because financing happens before the test drive, it’s easy to feel locked in even when the car isn’t what you expected.\nSmall details can derail the speedy transaction. For example, any mistakes in the trim selection or disappointments during the test drive could make it difficult to walk back from the purchase, as financing is already finalized.\n\nIf you want to use the online car shopping experience and it’s available in your area, here’s what to know before jumping in.\nFinancing a click-to-buy transaction when it’s a car, not a coffee pot Amazon Auto’s click-to-buy shopping experience starts with an easy-to-use interface that allows you to search for vehicles that suit your needs and compare options.\n\nStory Continues\nOnce you pick out a car you like, you’ll jump straight into the financing process. This skips past the traditional next step of test-driving the vehicle.\nRead More: Vanguard reveals what could be coming for U.S. stocks, and it’s raising alarm bells for retirees. Here’s why and how to protect yourself\n\nShoppers will find a variety of loan options, lease terms and an option to pay with cash — with a transparent breakdown of costs and any savings or rebates you might qualify for.\nIf you have a trade-in, you’ll receive an instant estimate of value for the vehicle from an independent evaluator (6).\nThe financing process starts with a loan application, which includes a credit check. If approved and you accept the terms of the deal, the dealership will prepare your final paperwork and you’ll receive loan contracts to e-sign before you pick up the vehicle.\nFinally, you’ll go pick up your vehicle from the lot.\nIt’s a straightforward process that works, unless the vehicle you’ve picked out doesn’t meet your expectations.\nHow to protect yourself in an online auto purchase What happens if you get to the lot and don’t like the vehicle?\nYou might not like anything from the trim selection to the smells inside or even the way the car handles. Particularly if it’s a used car.\nIf you’ve already signed a retail installment sales contract, it might be too late to back out of the sale.\n\nEven if you are legally within your rights to get out of the contract, many dealerships will pressure you to stick with the original vehicle and contract, creating a hassle if you want a different car.\nKeep in mind that submitting a loan application and receiving a financing offer doesn’t mean you have a binding contract.\nWhile you’ll have to agree to a hard credit check, which can ding your credit, you aren’t required to accept the loan offer, take the car or commit to regular monthly payments at that point.\nBut when you sign a loan agreement or retail installment sales contract, that’s when the financing is final (7). If you sign this paperwork before heading to the dealership, this could lock you into the purchase.\nFederal laws have a ‘cooling off’ period built into large transactions like auto loans. In some situations, this can give you three business days to cancel the transaction, but it’s better not to rely on this option.\n\nIn order to protect yourself from getting stuck with a vehicle you don’t love, ask the dealership upfront if you can walk away after a test drive.\nAlso, consider skipping dealership financing altogether. If you shop around across several lenders, like credit unions and online banks, you may find more affordable financing you can finalize after a test drive\nAlthough this might mean spending a little time doing paperwork at the dealership and with a lender, it could save you a major headache if the vehicle isn’t up to your expectations.\nYou May Also Like Become the landlord of Whole Foods and Walmart without lifting a finger.

Art, is it Max 7 or bust for you?\n00:09 Art\nUh, it's not. and I'll tell you this. I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nCharleston-Based Law Firm Yarborough Applegate Leads Nation in Holding Amazon Accountable for Delivery Driver Wrecks\n\nBusiness Wire\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:20 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C., December 19, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--The Charleston-based personal injury law firm of Yarborough Applegate, having secured the nation’s first-ever jury verdict holding Amazon liable for delivery driver negligence , is now leading national efforts to enforce that precedent. The firm is actively pursuing multi-state litigation against the e-commerce giant for catastrophic harm caused by its massive Delivery Service Partner (DSP) fleet, a public safety risk amplified by the billions of packages delivered during the peak holiday season.\n\nIn December 2023, the firm secured a landmark $44.6 million verdict in the South Carolina case of Shannon Shaw v. Amazon.com Inc. This victory successfully dismantled Amazon's long-standing defense that its drivers are purely \"independent contractors\" and set the national legal standard that Amazon's overwhelming control over its drivers makes the company vicariously liable.\n\"When we went to trial for this case here in South Carolina, we were committed first and foremost to getting justice for the victim, Shannon Shaw. But we knew it was also an opportunity to expose Amazon’s dangerous business practices nationwide—and pressure the company to make a change,\" said David Yarborough, Partner at Yarborough Applegate. \"That verdict proved what we always knew: Amazon micromanages nearly every aspect of the delivery process. They monitor driver speed, route, and even behavior via required in-van technology. They cannot claim ignorance when that data clearly shows a driver is distracted or dangerous.\"\n\nHolding Amazon Accountable Nationwide\nStill the national leader in this unique area of complex litigation , Yarborough Applegate is leveraging the Shaw blueprint in jurisdictions across the United States. Active cases demonstrate a pattern of alleged negligence and catastrophic outcomes that the firm is working to address:\nWrongful Death in Washington : Representing the family of Delia Menera, a grandmother who was killed in a marked crosswalk in Longview, Washington, by an Amazon delivery driver who allegedly admitted to using a THC vape prior to the collision. The lawsuit is currently pending in King County, Washington. (Case No.: 25-2-13547-1 SEA)\nWrongful Death in Ohio : Representing the family of Lee Andrew \"AJ\" Watson, Jr., who was killed in a motorcycle collision involving an Amazon delivery driver in Montgomery County, Ohio, who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of operating a motor vehicle under the influence. (CASE NO.: 2024 CV 05871)\nWrongful Death in South Carolina : Representing the widow of Bobby Peake, who was killed when an Amazon Delivery Driver turned left directly into the path of the vehicle in which Peake was riding as a passenger. (C/A No. 2025-CP-44-00385)\n\nStory Continues\n\"These are not isolated incidents; they are the foreseeable consequences of a corporate culture that prioritizes delivery speed over public safety,\" said Alex Heaton, attorney at Yarborough Applegate. \"We’re here to ensure that innocent victims harmed by Amazon's delivery system have a pathway to justice.\"\n\nA Crucial Warning During Peak Delivery Season\nThe volume of Amazon deliveries surges exponentially during the holiday season, placing unprecedented pressure on DSP drivers and dramatically increasing the risk to pedestrians and motorists. Yarborough Applegate’s active litigation ensures that Amazon faces consequences for its alleged negligence, sending a clear message that the multi-billion dollar corporation must commit to more rigorous driver vetting, training, and supervision.\n\"The public relies on Amazon for their holiday deliveries, but they also have a right to safe roads,\" said Brandt Horton, attorney at Yarborough Applegate. \"We will continue to lead these cases, from South Carolina all the way across the country, until Amazon prioritizes the safety of the communities it serves.\"\n\nAbout Yarborough Applegate\nYarborough Applegate is a leading South Carolina personal injury law firm dedicated to representing victims of catastrophic injuries and wrongful death. Recognized for securing the first jury verdict in the nation to hold Amazon vicariously liable for its DSP drivers, the firm has established itself as the national standard-bearer in this unique area of litigation.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251218653683/en/\nContacts\nMedia Contact:\nEmily McGannon\nemily@yarboroughapplegate.com\n843-972-0150\nyarboroughapplegate.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI hyperscalers have room for ‘elevated debt issuance’ — even after their recent bond binge, BofA says\n\nJason Ma\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:44 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BAC\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThe tech giants fueling the AI boom generate so much cash relative to their debt that they have more than enough room to issue more, according to Bank of America .\nIn a note this week, analysts looked at the top five publicly traded AI hyperscalers: Meta , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon and Oracle .\nBofA pointed out that while the companies can fund their near-term capital expenditures with cash, they are tapping debt markets for balance-sheet flexibility and better cost of capital. Last month alone, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon raised tens of billions of dollars in the bond market.\n\nOperating cash flow for the big five hyperscalers is expected to hit $577 billion this year from $378 billion in 2023, while debt should climb from $356 billion to $433 billion.\nThat means their overall debt burden is actually getting lighter as the debt-to-cash ratio should dip from 0.94 to 0.75.\n“Given the hyperscalers’ historically conservative capital allocation and balance sheet policies, elevated debt issuance is possible, as evident by the recent bond deals from Meta, Alphabet and Amazon,” BofA said.\nAnd plenty of additional cash is on the way. By 2029, operating cash flow is seen jumping 95% to $1.1 trillion, while capex is forecast to grow at a much slower pace of 58% to $632 billion.\nBut then there’s Oracle. Unlike the other AI hyperscalers, it will have negative free cash flow until 2029, meaning its capex will exceed cash from operations, according to BofA. As a result, it doesn’t have much capacity to take on more debt.\n\nIndeed, fears about Oracle’s debt binge have rattled the overall AI stock trade as the company isn’t a cash machine like its AI peers.\nRecent earnings guidance was also weak, and the company raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 capex by another $15 billion. In addition, surging lease obligations have spooked Wall Street.\nA Financial Times report on Wednesday that said alternative investments firm Blue Owl didn’t team up with Oracle on a data center after all piled on more concerns. Shares fell on the news, though the company’s development partner, Related Digital, said Blue Owl was outbid on the project and didn’t back out of it.\nBut even though debt may not pose a limit on hyperscalers’ ambitions, they still face physical limits , namely in building enough infrastructure fast enough to meet demand.\nData-center researcher Jonathan Koomey told Fortune’s Eva Roytburg that capital can be deployed instantly, but the equipment that capital must buy cannot. Tmelines for turbines, transformers, specialized cooling systems, and high-voltage gear have stretched into years, he explained.\n\nStory Continues\n“This happens every time there’s a massive shift in investment,” Koomey added. “Eventually manufacturers catch up, but not right away. Reality intervenes.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "E-Commerce Powers Holiday Sales: 4 Stocks With Upside for 2026\n\nVasundhara Sawalka\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nFVRR\n\nFDX\n\nThe 2025 holiday shopping season has set remarkable records, with e-commerce emerging as the undisputed winner in retail's most critical quarter. Cyber Monday 2025 became the largest online shopping day in history, generating $14.25 billion in sales, up 7.1% year over year. Black Friday online sales reached $11.8 billion, marking an impressive 9.1% growth, while the five-day Cyber Week period delivered $44.2 billion in total online spending, up 7.7% from 2024. These stellar results position 2025 as the first quarter-trillion-dollar holiday season, with total online sales projected to hit $253.4 billion from November through December.\n\nDelivery Infrastructure Thrives The e-commerce boom has created unprecedented opportunities for logistics companies navigating peak season demands. FedEx FDX and Amazon AMZN each experienced 5-8% volume increases during the 2025 holiday season, handling an estimated 2.3 billion packages. Delivery performance remained exceptional, with FedEx achieving 98.3% on-time rates, UPS at 98.9%, and USPS at 97.2% during the crucial Cyber Week period. Amazon's logistics network, now handling delivery volumes comparable to traditional carriers, has fundamentally reshaped last-mile delivery expectations with same-day and next-day services becoming standard offerings.\n\nTechnology Drives 2026 Momentum Several transformative trends suggest strong continued growth heading into 2026. Mobile commerce dominated the 2025 holiday season, accounting for 57.5% of Cyber Monday purchases, while artificial intelligence influenced $9.3 billion in global online sales. A FedEx survey from November 2025 found that 97% of large U.S. retailers now employ AI tools for personalization, inventory management, and customer service.\n\nLooking ahead, 98% of global e-commerce brands forecast international order volume growth in 2026, with the worldwide e-commerce market expected to reach approximately $7 trillion. Key 2026 priorities include improving delivery speed, expanding into new markets, and reducing fulfillment costs while leveraging AI for logistics optimization. As brands invest in cross-border capabilities and automated fulfillment systems, the e-commerce ecosystem appears poised for sustained expansion throughout 2026.\n\n4 Strong E-Commerce Bets for 2026 Investors seeking exposure to the e-commerce expansion can consider several compelling opportunities.

While Fiverr International declined 31.5% during the same period, the company is likely to benefit from potential upside as the digital services marketplace positions itself for the anticipated 2026 e-commerce acceleration, driven by increased online business activity and cross-border commerce expansion.\n\nStory Continues\n6-Month Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nExpedia represents a compelling buy for 2026 following strong third-quarter 2025 results, which beat estimates with $7.57 adjusted EPS and 12% gross bookings growth.

Yet, while Google, Amazon, and Microsoft spend on AI data centers to bolster their cloud computing capabilities, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) continues to spend just as much despite not being a major player in the industry. The spending has also seen the focus of analysts, with TD Cowen commenting on December 4th that the firm’s decision to cut back its metaverse spending could counter the increased spending on AI infrastructure. TD Cowen kept a Buy rating and an $810 share price target for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s shares.\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\nThe firm’s infrastructure spending includes a major data center it is building in Louisiana. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced on December 4th, 2024, that it was building a $10 billion data center in the state, and recent media reports have suggested that costs have ballooned to $27 billion. During this episode, Cramer and his co-hosts discussed reports of CoreWeave’s Texas data center project struggling, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) factored into the discussion:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a key player in the AI industry due to several factors. These include the firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business and its in-house Trainium AI chips. The highly competitive cloud computing industry, which sees investors demand high growth rates, has also affected Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in 2025. As an example, the shares dipped in August after the firm’s second-quarter earnings saw AWS post a 17.5% revenue growth, which was slower than Microsoft and Google’s cloud growth rates of 39% and 32%, respectively.\nZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.com\nAWS has also been the focus of recent analyst coverage for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s shares. For instance, Guggenheim initiated coverage on December 10th as it set a Buy rating and a $300 share price target. The research firm cited AWS as the reason behind its coverage and shared that the business’s 3.8-year backlog had touched $200 billion in Q2. Cramer also discussed the AWS business. He insisted that the cloud business will drive the narrative, and commented on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) after BMO Capital raised the share price target to $304 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating, and raised the Q1 2026 AWS cloud growth estimate to 24% from an earlier 23%. Cramer’s optimism is met by hedge fund sentiment as well, with 332 of the 978 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database having disclosed a stake to make Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) the one with the most hedge fund holders:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "Nvidia Vs. Alphabet: Which Could Be The World's Biggest Company By End-2026?\n\nPiero Cingari\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have quietly become the two most dominant forces inside the Magnificent Seven, riding different paths to the same destination: artificial intelligence supremacy.\nNvidia's GPUs remain the backbone of the global AI buildout, powering everything from data centers to cutting-edge model training.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is pushing its own vertically integrated AI stack — from custom TPUs to Gemini — embedding intelligence directly across Search, Cloud and consumer products.\nThe market thus far has rewarded both approaches. Nvidia is up 33% year-to-date through Dec. 17, while Alphabet has surged 62%.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nZooming out further tells an even more dramatic story: since early 2023, Alphabet shares are up roughly 250%, while Nvidia has delivered a staggering 1,120% return.\nThat explosive run has made Nvidia the world's biggest company today, with a market capitalization of about $4.318 trillion — even briefly touching $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet ranks third at approximately $3.7 trillion, behind Apple's $4.05 trillion valuation.\n\nYet traders see a far closer race ahead.\nOn Polymarket, both Nvidia and Alphabet are assigned a 35% probability of being the world's most valuable company by the end of 2026.\nA $100 bet on Alphabet overtaking Nvidia to become the world's biggest company by the end of next year would pay out $265 if it happens — with nearly identical returns available for those wagering that Nvidia holds onto the crown.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) trails with a 14% chance, followed by Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT ) at 9%.\nTesla Inc . (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) sit further back, at 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nHow Could Alphabet Overtake Nvidia As World’s Biggest Company? For Alphabet to dethrone Nvidia as world’s biggest company, it needs to outperform by a meaningful margin.\nThe current valuation gap between the two companies is about $600 billion.\nIf Nvidia's market cap were to grow 10% in 2026, it would climb from roughly $4.3 trillion to about $4.75 trillion. For Alphabet to leapfrog Nvidia in that scenario, its shares would need to outperform Nvidia by roughly 19 percentage points.\n\nStory Continues\nIn practical terms, that would mean Alphabet gaining about 29% in a year where Nvidia rises 10%, lifting Google's valuation to around $4.77 trillion.\nAny performance gap of 19 percentage points in Alphabet's favor could hand it the crown — assuming today's market caps as the starting line.\n\nThe bet, then, is whether Alphabet's AI monetization, advertising leverage and cloud growth can accelerate faster than Nvidia's already-dominant chip business.\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nWall Street Still Backs Nvidia Where traders see a coin flip, Wall Street analysts remain more decisive.\nBased on median 12-month price targets, analysts expect Nvidia's reign to continue. Consensus estimates point to Nvidia shares reaching about $250 over the next year, or roughly 40% upside from the current price near $177.\nAlphabet's outlook is far more muted by comparison. Analysts see a median 12-month target of $330, implying just 6% upside from its current level around $306.\n\nThat gap underscores the tension at the core of the debate: prediction markets see a neck-and-neck race for the world's largest company, while Wall Street analysts continue to model an extended run of Nvidia's dominance.\nBy the end of 2026, the outcome may hinge on a single question: will the AI arms race ultimately reward the company supplying the picks and shovels, or the one embedding intelligence into every layer of the digital economy?\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

      "Content": "2 Top Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nHIMS\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nKey Points Amazon's cost-cutting could supercharge its profitability.\nHims & Hers has explosive long-term growth potential.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nWe're coming to the close of 2025, and it has been an excellent year for stocks. The S&P 500 is up by a healthy 14%, while the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite has jumped 18%, propelled by the growth of new industries like generative AI .\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, investors will want to have exposure to continuing AI momentum as well as diversification into other aspects of the economy. In my view, for those looking to add new stocks to their portfolios now, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) could make great options for a $500 investment.\nAmazon The generative AI boom is beginning to mature, and it might be time for investors to pivot away from pure-play hardware stocks like Nvidia and start choosing companies that can benefit from the technology, but that don't have all their eggs in one basket. Amazon is unusual because it has significant exposure to the lucrative AI infrastructure market while also having the ability to incorporate the technology into its daily operations.\n\nFor starters, Amazon is a significant partner with (and minority owner in) leading AI company Anthropic, which specializes in creating large language models (LLMs) similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Anthropic has quickly overtaken its rival in the U.S. enterprise LLM market, attracting a market share of 32% compared to OpenAI's 25%, mainly because of its reliability and security.\nAs an equity partner, Amazon will see the value of its stake in Anthropic grow as the company gets larger, providing it with a source of noncash income. Furthermore, Anthropic relies on Amazon's cloud computing platform , Amazon Web Services (AWS), to build, train, and deploy its models, so it's also providing steady income to the tech giant.\nAnd Amazon is making strides to incorporate generative AI into its own business. In June, CEO Andy Jassy released a memo saying that the new technology could allow the company to reduce its corporate workforce through efficiency gains. Then in October, Amazon slashed 14,000 jobs, potentially saving it billions of dollars.\n\nThat said, Amazon's image as the poster child of AI layoffs (even if not all of its job cuts are AI-related) could introduce reputational risks. Investors should watch the situation carefully over the coming months.\nHims & Hers Health With all the talk about AI, it may seem like there are no other growth opportunities in the market. But that isn't true. Telehealth is shaping up to be a generational megatrend.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to analysts at J.P. Morgan , the so-called \"Internet of Medical Things\" could enjoy a compound annual growth rate of 24% through 2030 as a growing proportion of routine healthcare visits for needs such as psychiatric care and regular appointments are done virtually.\nHims & Hers Health stands out in the telehealth space in part because of its edgy Gen Z and millennial-focused branding. Instead of just offering a service, it has turned healthcare into an experience, focusing on addressing personal and sensitive issues like sexual health, hair loss, and weight loss, which some patients might be less comfortable seeing a doctor about in person. It also offers long-established drugs like Viagra in easy-to-take generic forms such as chewable mints, which makes it even more discreet for consumers.\nBusiness is booming. Third-quarter revenue surged 49% year over year to $600 million. A growing number of users are turning to Hims & Hers for personalized treatment plans, relying on the platform to serve several of their healthcare needs.\nFor example, a patient might use the Hims & Hers platform for sexual health, mental health, and weight loss. As a one-stop shop, Hims can save significant time and money for its users.\n\nHims & Hers is growing at an impressive clip, but it is still struggling to generate significant profits. Its third-quarter operating income actually fell by around half to just $11.8 million, which was relatively low compared to its $600 million in revenue.\nThat said, investors shouldn't be too worried about this. Management is pouring hundreds of millions into marketing to establish its brand. This long-term focus on winning market share will probably turn out to be more beneficial than chasing short-term profits.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

It enables multiple users to share the same hardware resources by connecting to the cloud platform through a web browser or dedicated applications, thereby creating a framework for seamless omnichannel customer engagement.\n\nFor investors seeking to invest in blue-chip tech firms, cloud computing has emerged as an attractive theme. This has made cloud computing companies like Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and International Business Machines Corporation IBM indispensable for any investment portfolio. But before digging deep into these prized possessions, let us examine a little more into why organizations are increasingly adopting cloud computing.\n\nBased on a pay-per-use pricing model, enterprises only pay for the computing resources they use. This has helped business enterprises to reduce operating costs for maintaining on-site data centers and deploying IT experts to manage the infrastructure, making it a highly cost-effective solution. With easy access to a plethora of innovative technologies, cloud computing increases productivity with greater agility and flexibility, and improves scalability with higher economies of scale. Moreover, cloud computing services are delivered over a highly secure network with low latency for applications and data backup facilities for improved reliability.\n\nCloud computing services fall into four broad categories, namely infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless and software as a service (SaaS), offering different levels of control, flexibility and management options to business enterprises. Cloud computing, which relies heavily on virtualization and automation technologies, provides the requisite infrastructure for AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning (ML) workloads. It delivers powerful computing abilities to process and analyze data, creating an ideal platform for Big Data management.\n\nPer Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market size is expected to swell to $2,390.2 billion by 2030 from $752.4 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 20.4% with a variety of capabilities across multiple industries. These include diverse use cases such as improved patient monitoring and outcomes in healthcare, personalized financial management and predictive spending, immersive learning in education, superior inventory management in retail and predictive maintenance and better supply chain management in the manufacturing sector.\n\nIf you intend to capitalize on this buzzing trend, our Cloud Computing Thematic Investing Screen could make it easy to identify high-potential stocks in this domain at any given time, just like the four mentioned above. By leveraging advanced tools, our thematic screens identify companies shaping the future, making it easier to benefit from emerging trends.\n\nReady to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas?

Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing platform, allows users to build, run and scale applications in the cloud. It offers a variety of services, including storage, networking, analytics and AI.\n\nMicrosoft has doubled down on the cloud computing opportunity. Azure&rsquo;s increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally has strengthened Microsoft's competitive position in the cloud computing market. Operating through a vast network of global data centers that ensure high availability and reliability for applications, Azure offers seamless access to all the services included in the portal once customers subscribe to it. Subscribers can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as virtual machines (VMs) and databases, which can then be assembled into running environments used to host workloads and store data.\n\nAs Microsoft continues to push the boundaries of networking technology, it aims to create innovative, resilient and secure solutions that enable businesses to leverage AI and the cloud to their fullest potential. It is heavily investing in AI-powered cloud services, integrating Azure OpenAI Service, Copilot and ML into various cloud solutions, making AI a central feature of Azure to empower organizations to manage their applications with greater confidence and efficiency. Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nAlphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search engine provider to a leading provider of cloud computing technology. Google Cloud has turned out to be the key catalyst behind the company&rsquo;s growth, driven by its strengthening cloud service offerings.\n\nThe solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace and continued investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI have helped Google to expand its cloud footprint worldwide. The increasing number of cloud regions and availability zones globally has been a hallmark of Google Cloud. Currently, Google Cloud has 42 cloud regions, 127 availability zones and 200 network edge locations across more than 200 countries. Google Cloud is considered the third-largest cloud player among numerous cloud providers worldwide.\n\nAlphabet&rsquo;s growing GenAI capabilities and significant investments in cloud computing are potential catalysts for the future amid stiff competition in the cloud space and increasing regulatory headwinds. This Zacks Rank #3 company&rsquo;s dominant position in the search engine market and the cloud boosts its long-term prospects.\n\nAmazon enjoys a leading position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the IaaS space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin-generating businesses. The expanding customer base of AWS, driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid Amazon's dominance in the global cloud space.\n\nAWS is the world&rsquo;s most comprehensive and broadly adopted on-demand cloud computing platform, offering more than 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers, including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises and leading government agencies, are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile and innovate faster. It reportedly offers the widest variety of databases that are purpose-built for different types of applications to enable subscribers to choose the right tool for the job.\n\nAmazon aims to extend AWS&rsquo; AI and ML capabilities to facilitate improved decision-making. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company intends to expand its global infrastructure for faster and more reliable service with low latency and maximum availability. From cloud-native applications and AI-driven solutions to edge computing and sustainability initiatives, AWS is likely to push the limits in the realm of cloud computing technology.\n\nIBM has gradually evolved as a provider of cloud and data platforms. The Red Hat acquisition, in particular, has helped it strengthen its competitive position in the hybrid cloud market. With the buyout, the company offers a Linux operating system&mdash;Red Hat Enterprise Linux&mdash;and a hybrid cloud platform&mdash;Red Hat OpenShift&mdash;aiding enterprises with digital transformation.\n\nWith a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management, translating into a healthy demand for IBM hybrid cloud solutions. In addition, the buyout of HashiCorp has significantly augmented IBM&rsquo;s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. HashiCorp&rsquo;s tool sets complement IBM RedHat&rsquo;s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management and bolstering its hybrid multi-cloud approach.\n\nIBM is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments. This Zacks Rank #3 company&rsquo;s growth is expected to be aided primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long run.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\n\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits , suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google , OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\n\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction .\nOpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: SGBX) (“Safe & Green” or the “Company”), announced that it has successfully closed the acquisition of Giant Containers Inc. (“Giant Containers”), a leading manufacturer of custom modular shipping container solutions for residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional applications.

At the time of acquisition, Giant Containers has over $5 million in projects under contract, with an additional $22.5 million in its pipeline.\nThe combination of the two companies addresses complementary strengths. Giant Containers’ core strength in sales, marketing, and project management align with areas of strategic focus for Safe & Green, while Safe & Green’s in-house production and manufacturing capabilities directly address Giant Containers’ need for scalable domestic fabrication, an increasingly critical requirement for larger enterprise and government customers.\n\nIn addition, Giant Containers contributes deep expertise in sourcing and managing purpose-built container systems from offshore suppliers, creating cost and quality advantages for complex, multi-container projects designed to integrate seamlessly at scale.\nAs part of the transaction, Daniel Kroft, Founder and CEO of Giant Containers, elected to receive a portion of the consideration in restricted Safe & Green Holdings common stock, reinforcing long-term alignment with the Company’s growth strategy.\n“We are very excited about this strategic acquisition of Giant Containers. It was a key foundation stone in our corporate strategy to become a value-added energy provider, and we are now empowered with sales, design, and engineering capabilities for containerized power generation, crypto mining, and data center solutions. The current AI-driven trend is hungry for power, and we are well positioned to meet that demand using our own resources. Our streamlined vision is to control the supply chain from subsurface to end user, and with Giant Containers onboard, we now have a critical component to execute that strategy,” said Michael McLaren, CEO of Safe & Green.\n\nStory Continues\nDaniel Kroft, Founder and CEO of Giant Containers, added, “Giant Containers is thrilled to announce being acquired by Safe & Green Holdings, a move that positions the company to advance its growth plans with even greater confidence. This transaction provides the infrastructure necessary to support larger, more complex projects and introduces our new production facility in Texas, enhancing our capacity to serve clients nationwide and abroad.”\n\n“The acquisition capitalizes on strong synergies between both teams and the depth of human capital across the organizations, fueling optimism through a shared vision and aligned goals for Giant Containers. I’m particularly excited about entering an entirely new market by developing solutions tailored to the oil, gas, and energy industry, guided by the expertise of Mike McLaren and the team at Olenox. This new framework allows us to dedicate even more manpower to business development and the global rollout of our unique product offerings.”\nAbout Giant Containers\nFounded in 2017, Giant Containers is a leading designer and integrator of custom container-based solutions for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers.

      "Content": "M&C Saatchi boss under threat as headhunters called in\n\nJames Warrington\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SAA.L\n\nAMZN\n\nADDDF\n\nBBRYF\n\nThe boss of advertising agency M&C Saatchi’s position is under threat after the company began sounding out potential replacements amid rising pressure from an activist investor.\nHeadhunters have approached a number of industry figures to gauge their interest in taking over the role of chief executive, industry magazine Campaign reported.\n\nIt will cast doubts over the future of Zaid Al-Qassab, the former Channel 4 marketing boss who has led M&C Saatchi since May 2024. One industry source described Mr Al-Qassab as “a dead man walking”.\nIn an announcement to the stock market, M&C Saatchi said: “While the company is not commenting on any press speculation at this time, the board confirms that succession planning is something it keeps under review.”\nCompany losing ground to tech rivals M&C Saatchi, whose clients include Amazon, Adidas and Burberry , has come under growing pressure from investors as it grapples with a slowdown in sales amid wider economic uncertainty and growing competition from major tech rivals.\nLast month the company issued a profit warning, saying it expects revenues to decline by 7pc for the full year. Shares have dropped by more than a quarter so far in 2025, giving it a market value of just over £150m.\n\nHarwood Capital, an activist investor run by Christopher Mills, has built a stake of just over 4pc in M&C Saatchi, making it a top 10 shareholders.\nThe investment firm is understood to be agitating for change, including a break-up or sale of the entire ad group .\nM&C Saatchi last month rejected a £50m bid for its performance arm, which provides media planning and buying services.\nBosses rejected the unsolicited swoop by Brave Bison , a rival group backed by Rupert Murdoch, saying it “fundamentally undervalues” the division, which it said was crucial to its growth plans.\nIt is unclear whether Brave Bison, which counts Lord Ashcroft among its investors, will return with an improved offer.\nM&C Saatchi has been buffeted by scandals and hostile takeover bids in recent years.\n\nIn 2019, the advertising agency became embroiled in an accounting scandal that led to a clearout of almost its entire boardroom, including co-founder Baron Saatchi .\nThe agency, which is known for its longstanding ties to the Conservative Party, was then forced to fend off an unsolicited takeover bid from its biggest shareholder, Vin Murria. It also rejected a separate approach from rival Next 15.\nPrevious chief executive Moray MacLennan stepped down just weeks after veteran media executive Zillah Byng-Thorne joined as chairman. Ms Byng-Thorne, who was responsible for recruiting Mr Al-Qassab, then stepped down after just two years.\n\nStory Continues\nMr Al-Qassab has sought to turn around M&C Saatchi’s fortunes by selling off smaller loss-making divisions.\nThe ad firm, which has long held lucrative government contracts, was handed a boost last week when it was named as one of three agencies appointed to the Government’s creative roster.\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

      "Content": "2 Growth Stocks That Have Beaten the Market in Just 2 of the Past 5 Years\n\nJohn Ballard, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 1:45 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNFLX\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Netflix and Amazon underperformed the market over the past five years, having only outperformed in 2023 and 2024.\nHowever, these growth stocks are attractive based on recent business momentum and future opportunities.\nWall Street analysts project both companies to grow their earnings per share between 18% to 24% in the years to come.\n10 stocks we like better than Netflix ›\n\nInvestor patience has been tested over the past five years. Since the end of 2020, there has been one bear market in 2022, followed by a severe, but brief, market sell-off earlier this year due to concerns about tariffs and their impact on the economy. Despite all that turmoil, the S&P 500 has nearly doubled since December 2020, including dividends.\nUltimately, business fundamentals take over and drive stock prices higher over time. Investors in Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can certainly attest to this. These top growth stocks have been battered in recent years, yet their businesses continue to demonstrate excellent growth potential, making them solid long-term investments.\nNetflix Netflix stock has climbed 24,000% since 2005, but has underperformed the market since 2020, rising 80% compared to the S&P 500's 99% gain. It underperformed the market in 2021, 2022, and 2025, as of mid-December. Year to date, the shares are up 5% compared to the 17% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nThe stock experienced a steep decline in 2022 due to subscriber headwinds, but since then, it has been on a tear, surging 218%. The recent dip coincides with a broad sell-off in several growth companies in the technology sector. However, this could provide a great entry point for buying shares.\nThe business is performing exceptionally well. Netflix is dominating the streaming market, with more than 300 million paying households. It has paying members in more than 190 countries, yet there is still considerable potential for Netflix to continue growing.\nAnalysts expect its revenue to increase by 15% in 2025, according to Yahoo! Finance. Over the last year, Netflix generated $10 billion in net profit on $43 billion in total revenue, and these profits are potentially funding a significant expansion of its content offerings. If Netflix closes the recently announced acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery , including its film studios and HBO, it will only enhance the company's revenue potential through a deeper library of content.\n\nWith this momentum, the subscriber losses in 2022 that drove the stock down 51% seem like a distant memory. Netflix picked itself up by continuing to invest in expanding its content, cracking down on password-sharing, and launching an advertising-supported subscription tier to boost subscriber growth.\n\nStory Continues\nNetflix has a significant advantage due to its massive membership base, widening content offering, and extensive brand power. These advantages will continue to serve the company and its shareholders well for years to come. The consensus estimate among analysts predicts its earnings per share will grow at an annualized rate of approximately 24% for the foreseeable future. That should be enough earnings growth to potentially fuel market-beating returns for investors.\nAmazon Amazon is another wealth-building investment for investors who have patiently held it over the last 20 years, but the stock has only beaten the market in two of the past five years. Amazon's stock underperformed the S&P 500 in 2021 and 2022. It has also trailed the index in 2025, up about 1% vs the S&P 500's 17% gain at the time of writing.\n\nAmazon is known as the leading e-commerce business globally. Still, its expansion into cloud computing, advertising, entertainment services through Prime, and consumer devices puts Amazon in a different league than its competitors. These non-retail services account for 59% of the company's revenue and generate the majority of the company's profit.\nAll these businesses, taken together, are performing well. Amazon's total net sales growth has trended higher over the past three years. Third-quarter sales grew 13% year over year to $180 billion, driven by solid sales growth across all operating segments.\nThe acceleration in its cloud computing business, which is its most profitable segment, is good news for Amazon's bottom line. Over the past year, Amazon reported a net profit of $76 billion, and investors might be underestimating further growth.\n\nThe stock's underperformance in recent years is not justified based on the company's significant improvement in profitability. The stock is trading at a price-to-cash-flow ratio of 18, much lower than its previous 10-year average of 27 times cash flow. This seems low considering Amazon has grown its cash from operations to more than $130 billion on a trailing-12-month basis, representing a 229% increase over the past three years.\nOn a more traditional price-to-earnings basis, Amazon's forward multiple of 28 on next year's earnings estimate seems quite reasonable. As management focuses on growing the cloud business and rightsizing costs in the e-commerce operation, there is likely to be significant growth in the company's profitability, enabling it to deliver market-beating returns for investors over the next five years. Analysts predict Amazon's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 18% over the next several years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?

      "Content": "Gamestop Could Be Going to $0. Buy This Stock Instead.\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:51 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GME\n\nAMZN\n\nAMC\n\nKey Points GameStop stock has fallen 73% from its 2021 meme stock peak, and analysts expect more downside ahead.\nAmazon benefits from gaming's digital shift through Luna, Prime Gaming, Twitch, AWS infrastructure, and e-commerce.\nEvery trend hurting GameStop (digital distribution, cloud gaming, online infrastructure) seems to be a revenue stream for Amazon.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nRemember the skyrocketing meme stocks of 2021? Gosh, how time flies.\nIt has been almost five years since social media posts ignited short squeezes in GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC) shares. From the closing bell on Jan. 20, 2021, to the end of Jan. 27, 2021 (just one week later), AMC's stock spiked 570% higher while GameStop soared 788%.\nBut the joy didn't last long. AMC's stock is down 98% from that peak, and GameStop has lost 73% as of Dec. 17, 2025. The average analyst recommendation for GameStop is underperform with a price target 41% below the current level. Keep those expected price drops up for a few more years, and there won't be much left.\nI hate to say it, but GameStop is starting to look obsolete. When was the last time you bought a video game from a local store instead of just downloading it to your favorite console? GameStop's stock may very well go to zero in the long run.\nAmazon is eating GameStop's lunch On the upside, I can recommend one of GameStop's top competitors for new money in 2026. The same digital industry shift that's destroying GameStop has big winners too. In particular, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) benefits in several ways from the game-download trend.\nAmazon Luna: The e-commerce giant has its own cloud-based gaming service -- no discs, no downloads, just run the games on Amazon's servers and stream the experience to your favorite web browser or mobile device.\nPrime Gaming: Amazon Prime subscribers have free access to many Luna games and in-game items.\nDigital game sales: Amazon sells download codes for Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC games. You get the same product as GameStop's, with no retail footprint needed. It's true that each gaming platform also offers direct downloads, but Amazon helps you organize your gaming buys across many device types.\nAWS gaming infrastructure: Amazon Web Services (AWS) powers online multiplayer, game streaming, and patch/update delivery for many major publishers. This way, Amazon profits whether you play on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC.\nTwitch: Amazon owns the dominant game-streaming video platform. Twitch also integrates with Prime Gaming for cross-promotion.\nE-commerce for hardware: And Amazon is happy to serve if you're looking for consoles, controllers, or accessories (the physical stuff GameStop's brick-and-mortar stores rely on).\n\nStory continues\nGaming is just a bonus; Amazon is a great buy anyway And here's the best part. With or without its gaming industry muscle, Amazon stock is a fantastic buy right now.\nAmazon's annualized revenue growth has averaged 11.5% over the last three years, with 13% year-over-year jumps in the last two reports. The company generated $10.6 billion of free cash flow over the last year, based on a massive $691 billion in top-line revenues and $120 billion of capital expenses. Those artificial intelligence (AI) data centers won't just build themselves, you know.\n\nThis trillion-dollar tech titan is earning its market cap the honest way, with excellent financials and strong growth prospects. Sorry, GameStop, but Amazon is the first place I'd start looking for a buy related to the video game industry.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

See the full list for free.\nCrowdStrike Holdings Investment Narrative Recap To own CrowdStrike, you need to believe its Falcon platform can stay at the center of enterprise and SMB cybersecurity as AI reshapes both attacks and defenses. The strongest near term catalyst remains broader AI-driven platform adoption, while a key risk is execution on new offerings and models like Falcon Flex. The latest SailPoint and Amazon Business Prime integrations reinforce the adoption story but do not materially change those near term drivers or risks on their own.\n\nAmong the recent updates, Falcon AI Detection and Response (AIDR) is especially relevant. It extends CrowdStrike’s reach into the AI interaction layer, aligning directly with the catalyst of deeper AI integration across cloud, identity and data protection. As AI powered attacks grow more sophisticated, AIDR helps keep the Falcon platform central to how customers think about securing new workloads and could influence how investors weigh CrowdStrike’s long term platform potential against its current valuation and profitability profile.\nYet despite this progress in AI security, investors should be aware that rising competitive pressures and the cost of rapid innovation could...\nRead the full narrative on CrowdStrike Holdings (it's free!)\nCrowdStrike Holdings' narrative projects $7.9 billion revenue and $691.1 million earnings by 2028.

Companies like Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all developing robust AI businesses that are driving the charge, and companies like Nvidia and Broadcom are providing key parts of the hardware infrastructure that supports the technology.\n\nIf 2025 was a year of expansion, 2026 could be a year when those companies' investments start showing results, and when that happens, Alphabet could be a big winner.\nMore AI for more people The current types of large language models (LLMs) were first introduced to the public through OpenAI's ChatGPT three years ago, but Alphabet has actually used similar tech to power its Google search engine for years. However, the ChatGPT launch changed the AI landscape and led to a new LLM race, and Alphabet now offers its own generative AI services.\n\nAlthough it looked for a time like Google was in danger of losing its dominance in search as more people just asked questions to ChatGPT and had it do the legwork, Alphabet has responded effectively by rolling out its own competitive LLMs, and it flipped the script by offering AI Overview and AI Mode on its search pages. Recently, paid clicks have been accelerating, and Alphabet's revenue is soaring. Sales increased 16% year over year in the third quarter, with strong performances across the business.\nToday, its operation includes a broad spectrum of products and services, including YouTube, Android, Waymo autonomous vehicles, and others. Google Search remains its core business, but there's a lot more going on. Its varied revenue streams will provide it with diverse growth drivers in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHowever, of particular importance recently is the Google Cloud Platform. Alphabet's cloud services are where its clients engage with generative AI to create their own apps and agents, and cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3. The accelerating pace of growth in this area implies that the opportunity to create with AI is attracting more clients to the cloud, and Alphabet's newest LLM, Gemini 3, has been rated the top LLM to use right now according to several leaderboards. Gemini has 650 million active users, and the company is capitalizing on its strong user base to monetize these services.\n\nStory Continues\nNot just LLMs Beyond its robust LLMs, which may be winning the LLM wars at least for now, and its search feature, which still holds a market share of about 90%, Alphabet has other AI products that are driving growth. It designs its own AI accelerator chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it uses to train and power its LLMs, along with the Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that most of its rivals are using today.\n\n\"Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products, is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said.\nAlphabet has made several important deals recently for its TPUs, which are specialized chips designed for deep learning and inference workloads, in contrast with Nvidia's more general-purpose GPUs. TPUs give Alphabet an edge in AI development, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated and need more of this kind of processing power to deliver the results users want. Alphabet signed a key partnership with Anthropic, which makes the popular Claude LLM, and is rumored to be in talks with Meta to supply it with chips.\nMore in store for 2026 On the Q3 earnings call, management told investors that it expects to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from its previous forecast figure of $85 billion. It also plans a \"significant increase\" in capex in 2026.\nThe results of all this spending are already showing up in accelerated cloud growth, accelerating paid clicks, and higher overall sales, and those trends could get even better next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

(NASDAQ: AMZN ) is included among the 12 Best Long Term US Stocks to Buy Now .\nchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash\nOn December 16, BMO Capital raised its price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $304 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating on the stock. The update followed recent calls with two former AWS employees. Those conversations pointed to faster-growing cloud commitments, Claude emerging as a preferred model among developers, and expectations that enterprise AI applications could start scaling in 2027. Based on that feedback, BMO lifted its AWS growth assumption to 24%, up from 23%.\n\nSeparately, Reuters reported that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is in discussions about investing in OpenAI. The talks could value the ChatGPT maker at more than $500 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter. Amazon may invest around $10 billion, though the source said the discussions remain fluid and could still change. The talks are private, and neither side has confirmed details.\nThe potential investment underscores how intense demand for computing power has become as companies push to build increasingly advanced AI systems. Several large tech firms have already made major commitments. NVIDIA and Oracle have each signed multi-billion-dollar AI deals with OpenAI this year. In November, OpenAI also agreed to a $38 billion cloud services deal with Amazon.\n\nThese discussions come as OpenAI prepares the groundwork for a possible IPO, which could value the company at as much as $1 trillion, according to an earlier Reuters report.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Amazon (AMZN) Surpasses Market Returns: Some Facts Worth Knowing\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nAmazon (AMZN) closed the most recent trading day at $226.79, moving +2.49% from the previous trading session. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.79%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.38%.\nThe stock of online retailer has fallen by 0.64% in the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 0.48% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Amazon in its upcoming release. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $1.97, signifying a 5.91% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $211.29 billion, indicating a 12.51% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $7.17 per share and a revenue of $713.67 billion, demonstrating changes of +29.66% and +11.87%, respectively, from the preceding year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Amazon. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.39% increase. As of now, Amazon holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Amazon is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 30.85. This expresses a premium compared to the average Forward P/E of 18.75 of its industry.\n\nOne should further note that AMZN currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.52. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Internet - Commerce stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.44 based on yesterday's closing prices.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 83, placing it within the top 34% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nTo follow AMZN in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Feds pave the way for Big Tech to plug data centers right into power plants in scramble for energy\n\nMARC LEVY\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 12:23 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana .\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania .\n\nStory Continues\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n___\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Should You Buy It Here?\n\nAditya Raghunath\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nJefferies just launched coverage of the quantum computing sector with a bullish call, sending IonQ (IONQ) shares surging. The firm slapped a $100 price target on IONQ stock, implying roughly 110% upside from current levels, while initiating with a “Buy” rating.\nIonQ develops trapped-ion quantum computers designed to solve complex problems across business, society, and scientific research. Founded on 25 years of academic research, the company uses ionized atoms to perform longer, more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors than competing quantum systems.\n\nMore News from Barchart Cathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock. Should You?\nIs Cathie Wood Jumping Ship on Tesla Stock?\nBroadcom Stock Is Up 120% in the Past Year. This Analyst Thinks It Is One of the Highest-Quality Stocks to Buy for the Next Year Too.\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nIonQ is the first quantum hardware provider integrated with all major cloud platforms, offering accessible quantum computing through partnerships with Amazon's (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, and Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google Cloud for applications in chemistry, medicine, finance, and logistics optimization.\nAnalyst Kevin Garrigan expects IonQ to benefit from powerful ecosystem tailwinds driving quantum computing adoption. The company's trapped-ion architecture differentiates in coherence, fidelity, and native all-to-all connectivity, technical advantages that matter as the technology matures.\nIonQ's roadmap targets fault-tolerant quantum computing with integrated 256 qubits by 2026, scaling to 10,000 physical qubits and 800 logical qubits in 2027, and ultimately 2 million physical qubits with 80,000 logical qubits by 2030.\n\nIs IONQ Stock a Good Buy Right Now? IonQ delivered a stunning third quarter, solidifying its position as the dominant force in quantum computing. It reported revenue of almost $40 million, beating its guidance by 37% and growing 222% year-over-year (YoY).\nThe Q3 results showcased IonQ's expanding quantum platform strategy, encompassing computing, networking, sensing, and cybersecurity capabilities that no competitor can match.\n\nIonQ's fifth-generation Tempo system achieved an algorithmic qubit score of 64, creating a computational space 36 quadrillion times larger than IBM's (IBM) leading commercial system. More significantly, the company demonstrated a world-record 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity, meaning IonQ has hit every key technical milestone needed for full fault tolerance.\n\n繼續閱讀\nIonQ's acquisition spree is proving transformative. The Oxford Ionics deal closed during the quarter, bringing Electronic Qubit Control technology that leverages standard semiconductor fabrication.\nThis matters enormously because IonQ can now manufacture quantum chips using mature 128-nanometer nodes at existing foundries rather than building custom infrastructure that would cost billions. The bill of materials for a 2-million-qubit machine comes in at under $30 million, much lower than competitors.\n\nVector Atomic's addition expands IonQ's total addressable market into quantum sensing for positioning, navigation, and timing applications critical to defense customers. With quantum key distribution capabilities from the ID Quantique acquisition, IonQ can now bid on massive Golden Dome-style infrastructure projects that require integrated quantum solutions.\nThe business is rapidly globalizing, with international revenue accounting for 30% of total sales, up from nearly zero a year ago. Government and enterprise partnerships validate commercial viability, while the company expands beyond pure compute into quantum networking and sensing applications.\nWhat Is the IONQ Stock Price Target? Guidance for full-year 2025 revenue increased to $106 million to $110 million, breaking historical seasonality patterns as fourth-quarter revenue is expected to exceed the third quarter.\nThe company's 256-qubit system launches in 2026, followed by a roadmap that reaches 80,000 logical qubits by 2030, compared with IBM's stated target of just 2,000 logical qubits by 2033.\n\nAnalysts tracking the quantum computing stock forecast revenue to increase from $108.5 million in 2025 to $746 million in 2029. Despite this significant top-line growth, IONQ is expected to remain unprofitable. Over the next four years, its free cash outflow is projected to surpass $1.2 billion.\nIonQ raised $2 billion in October at $93 per share, bringing the pro forma cash balance to $3.5 billion with zero debt. This war chest positions the company to continue aggressive investment in maintaining what management describes as a five-year technical lead over competitors.\nIONQ stock has been volatile, down about 40% from October highs alongside the broader quantum computing selloff. Yet Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish, with 75% of analysts recommending IonQ.\nOut of the 13 analysts covering IONQ stock, eight recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” and four recommend “Hold.” The average IONQ stock price target is $75.50, above the current price of $47.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "The AI efficiency illusion: why cutting 1.1 million jobs will stifle, not scale, your strategy\n\nKatica Roy\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:23 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nWe are witnessing a false dawn of efficiency. Throughout 2025, corporate America has engaged in a frantic restructuring of the labor market, cutting more than 1.17 million jobs in the first 11 months of the year, a 54% increase from 2024. From the 14,000 corporate cuts at tech giants like Amazon to the nearly 300,000 federal civil service reductions , the narrative driving this contraction is uniform: we are shedding excess labor to make room for the streamlined, high-margin future of artificial intelligence.\n\nBut the data tells a different story. This is not a calculated pivot toward higher productivity. It is a hollowing-out strategy that trades immediate payroll savings for a catastrophic erosion of human capital. By viewing AI as a mechanism for replacement rather than augmentation, leaders are incurring a strategic debt that will erase future value, stifle innovation, and, crucially, institutionalize the kind of algorithmic bias that costs companies billions.\nWe are trying to build the future of work by burning down the infrastructure required to support it.\nThe Mathematics of the Hollowed-Out Workforce The prevailing logic in the C-Suite is a simple subtraction equation: lower headcount plus automated tools equals higher margins. However, this ignores the negative externalities imposed on the workforce that remains.\nWhile companies explicitly cited AI for roughly 55,000 cuts through November , there are far more job losses buried under the umbrella of restructuring, which accounted for over 128,000 job losses. Expert estimates suggest the true automation-influenced displacement is likely above 150,000 . But the real cost isn’t on the severance line item; it is in the collapse of productivity among the survivors.\n\nSeventy-four percent of employees who survive layoffs report a decline in their own productivity, while 77% witness an increase in operational errors . This phenomenon, often called the layoff survivor syndrome , is a drag on performance fueled by anxiety and the erosion of institutional trust. Volatility sends a signal to your top performers: leave before you are pushed out.\nWhen companies cut costs by eliminating human capacity, they don’t get a leaner organization; they get an anxious, risk-averse, and error-prone one. The so-called productivity equation turns negative because the marginal productivity of the retained workforce plummets faster than the payroll costs decline.\nThe Tech-First Trap and the Compliance Gap This productivity collapse is compounded by a fundamental misunderstanding of how AI generates value. While 85% of organizations are increasing their AI investment, only 6% are seeing a payback in under a year.\n\nStory Continues\nThe answer lies in the implementation. A staggering 59% of organizations are taking a technology-first approach, treating AI as a bolt-on solution rather than undertaking organizational redesign. Even more alarming is where the cuts are happening. The 2025 layoffs are disproportionately targeting mid-layer management , including HR, talent acquisition, and compliance roles.\n\nThe result is a growing governance gap. At the exact moment companies are deploying black-box algorithms that require intense oversight, they are firing the overseers. 34% of organizations already expect a shortage in specialist compliance skills. By dismantling these internal guardrails, companies are not streamlining; they are removing the ethical braking systems required to prevent reputational and financial ruin.\nAI is not a replacement for human judgment; it is an accelerator of it. But you cannot accelerate what you have already liquidated.\nThe Equity Penalty Here is where the economic argument becomes inseparable from the equity argument. The hollowing out of 2025 has not been neutral. It has systematically targeted the very demographics that drive financial outperformance.\nThe data reveal a profound asymmetry in risk exposure. Women are significantly more vulnerable to the current wave of automation, with 79% of employed women concentrated in high-risk occupations compared to 58% of men. This differential means women are 1.4 times more exposed to displacement. We see this specifically in the hollowing out of critical pipeline positions that enable women to ascend to leadership.\n\nHowever, the canary in the coal mine for the broader economy is the crisis facing Black women. By November 2025, the unemployment rate for Black women remained at a staggering 7.1%, more than double the 3.4% rate for White women. This was driven by a perfect storm: high exposure to private sector automation combined with the erasure of 300,000 federal jobs , a sector where Black women have historically found stability.\nThe reality on the ground confirms this is a systemic failure, not a skills gap. Keisha Bross, Director of Opportunity, Race and Justice at the NAACP, reports that she has “not seen interventions happening” to support this displaced workforce. The result? At recent NAACP job fairs, 80% of applicants held bachelor’s degrees yet were lining up for same-day interviews for low-wage roles. We are witnessing the hollowing out of the Black middle class in real-time.\n\nLeaders often view these statistics as a social problem. They are wrong. This is a P&L problem.\nThere is a hard, quantitative link between intersectional equity and revenue. Research across more than 4,000 companies in 29 countries shows that for every 10% increase in intersectional gender equity, there is a 1% to 2% increase in revenue. Venture capital data further reinforces this, showing that investments in female-founded startups yield a 63% better return on investment than those with male founders. By allowing layoffs to disproportionately target women and people of color, companies are forfeiting a measurable economic dividend.\nThe Algorithmic Risk Multiplier The financial danger of a homogenous workforce extends directly into the AI models themselves. If your AI team and your data sources lack diversity, your algorithms will be biased. This is no longer a theoretical risk—it is a tangible liability.\nMore than one-third of organizations have already suffered negative impacts from AI bias, with 62% reporting lost revenue and 61% reporting lost customers. The legal doctrine of disparate impact creates massive liability for companies whose algorithms discriminate in hiring or lending, regardless of intent.\n\nThis tension is starkly visible. On one side, we have the nation’s largest civil rights organization, the NAACP, flagging systemic risk. On the other, we have tech giants like Google and Meta , recently crowned Time ’s ‘Person of the Year’ , who landed on the NAACP’s Consumer Advisory List by rolling back the very protections meant to ensure that revolution is equitable. This contradiction is not ideological; it’s economic: alienating a demographic with $1.7 trillion in annual buying power. When you remove the diverse talent capable of spotting bias, and the compliance officers capable of reporting it, you guarantee that your AI products will be flawed, biased, and ultimately, litigated.\nA Framework for Human-Centric ROI To reverse this erosion of value, executives must stop viewing labor as a cost to be minimized and start viewing work design as the primary investment vehicle for AI success.\n1. Governance as a Profit Center AI governance must move from the server room to the Boardroom. Boards must include members with the technical literacy to challenge management on model stability and data quality. We must recognize that responsible AI unlocks value and accelerates development by ensuring reliability.\n2. Redesign: From Automation to Augmentation We must shift our strategy from automation (replacing heads) to augmentation (increasing value). Data shows that job numbers actually grow in AI-exposed fields when companies focus on augmentation. This requires a massive investment in skilling, specifically targeting the non-degree holders who are 3.5 times more likely to lose their jobs .\n\n3. Equity as a Growth Engine Finally, we must embed intersectional equity into the core business strategy. This means using advanced analytics to monitor the talent lifecycle and ensure that restructuring efforts do not decimate the diversity pipeline. It means recognizing that the $12 trillion global economic opportunity of gender equity is only accessible if we actively retain women in the workforce.\n\nThe Choice The 1.17 million layoffs of 2025 represent a fork in the road.\nOne path leads to a hollowed-out future: a short-term spike in cash flow followed by a long-term decline in innovation, a rise in algorithmic liability, and a workforce paralyzed by fear.\nThe other path recognizes that in the age of AI, humanity is the premium asset. It acknowledges that the only way to capture the exponential ROI of automation is to pair it with a diverse, resilient, and empowered human workforce.\nYou can cut your way to a quarterly profit, but you cannot cut your way to the future. True productivity requires us to stop subtracting humans and start solving for the convergence of equity, economics, and engineering.\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune .\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The company has held early discussions about raising tens of billions of dollars, potentially as much as $100 billion, at a valuation around $750 billion, according to a report from The Information.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs MSFT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe talks are still at an early stage, and nothing is finalized. Key details, including the final valuation and which investors participate, could still change. Even so, the numbers highlight how quickly OpenAI's perceived value is climbing. A $750 billion valuation would represent about a 50% increase from its reported $500 billion valuation in October.\nSeparate reports suggest OpenAI is also broadening its partnerships. The ChatGPT maker is said to be raising at least $10 billion from Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and exploring the use of Amazon's AI chips, signaling diversification beyond its close relationship with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ).\nThe push for fresh capital comes as AI infrastructure costs keep rising, even as OpenAI generates billions in revenue. The company is also preparing for a potential IPO as early as mid 2026, giving investors another milestone to watch.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What is Ethereum (ETH)? A Beginner's Guide to the Smart Contract Blockchain\n\nMatt Hussey,Jason Nelson\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:40 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: ETH-USD\n\nBTC-USD\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMETA\n\nEthereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, is a blockchain-powered platform for creating decentralized applications (dapps).\nEthereum is not just a cryptocurrency. It’s a global, decentralized network that enables smart contracts —self-executing programs on the blockchain—and decentralized applications, or dapps , that run without banks, governments, or big tech.\n\nWhen programmer Vitalik Buterin published a “whitepaper” in late 2013 proposing a new kind of blockchain —not just for money but for programmable code—a revolution in digital finance began. Today, the Ethereum blockchain hosts decentralized applications like smart contracts, games , digital art , and assets worth billions.\nUltimately, many believe that Ethereum could underpin a re-imagining of how the internet works, dubbed Web3, in which control of the internet is disintermediated away from big companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and X.\nThis guide will help you understand the history of Ethereum, Buterin’s big idea, and the role Ether plays in that vision.\nSmart contracts: Ethereum’s breakthrough The feature that set Ethereum apart from Bitcoin early on was the smart contract. A smart contract is a code stored and executed on the blockchain that runs automatically once its conditions are met.\nSmart contracts are transparent, tamper-proof, and execute without relying on third parties. This makes them the backbone of everything built on Ethereum, from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces.\n\nWho Invented Ethereum? Russian/Canadian computer programmer Vitalik Buterin wrote the whitepaper that Ethereum is based on. However, the building of the network and community was helped along by a number of co-founders: Anthony Di Loria, Charles Hoskinson, Miha Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin and Gavin Wood.\n\nDevelopment of the Ethereum network began in early 2014 under the Ethereum Foundation, with Gavin Wood publishing the technical “yellow paper” that defined the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\nA crowdfunded token sale followed in mid-2014, raising funds through an initial coin offering, or ICO, that exchanged Bitcoin for Ether. The ICO raised over $18 million.\n\nThe network officially went live on July 30, 2015, launching as “Frontier”—a platform for developers to test and deploy decentralized applications.\nThe switch from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake When it first launched, Ethereum used the same Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism as Bitcoin, with cryptocurrency miners securing the network by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.\nIn September 2022, Ethereum switchted to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm. Instead of mining, Ether is created through staking: validators lock up at least 32 ETH as collateral and are chosen to propose and verify new blocks. Honest participation earns them ETH rewards.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat is Proof of Stake? How it Differs From Proof of Work\nThis shift, known as “ The Merge ,” ended Proof-of-Work mining, making Ethereum more energy-efficient while allowing anyone with the required stake to help secure the network and earn rewards.\nBlocks are still added about every 12 seconds, but ETH is now distributed as staking rewards, not mining rewards.\n\nEther (ETH), Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, pays for transactions, powers apps, and secures the network. Ether’s sub-units, Gwei and Wei, are named after Wei Dai, an early pioneer of cryptocurrencies.\nWhat applications have been built on Ethereum? 👥 Social Networks: Get paid for your posts on social media dapps.\n📁 File Storage: Decentralized file storage at a fraction of the price.\n💸 Overseas Payments: Dramatically reducing the cost of sending cash overseas.\n💳 Payment Cards: Contactless debit card to pay in Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.\n👀 Online advertising: Cutting out the middlemen in online ads. Users get paid directly for watching online advertisements.\n💱 Exchanges: Decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ) such as Uniswap enable users to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer, without middlemen.\n🏦 Loans: Blockchain-backed loans with no credit checks.\n\nTimeline: Major milestones in Ethereum Late 2013: Vitalik Buterin publishes the Ethereum white paper, introducing the idea of a programmable blockchain.\nMid-2014: Ethereum crowdsale (ICO) sells Ether for Bitcoin to fund development.\nJuly 30, 2015: Ethereum launches with the “Frontier” genesis block.\nSeptember 2015: “Frontier Thawing” update increases gas limits for more stability.\nMarch 2016: Homestead upgrade improves protocol security and usability.\nApril 2016: The DAO, a decentralized venture fund, launches via crowdsale.\nJune 2016: Hackers exploit The DAO and drain roughly $50 million in Ether. Community votes to hard-fork, creating Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\nOctober 2017: Byzantium hard fork enhances performance, privacy, and sets the stage for Proof-of-Stake.\nDecember 2017: CryptoKitties and CryptoPunk NFTs go viral, stressing network capacity and highlighting scalability issues.\nJanuary 2018: ERC-721 NFT standard is introduced, enabling unique digital assets.\nDecember 2020: Beacon Chain launches, beginning Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake.\nMarch 2020: Visa begins settling USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin transactions using Ethereum.\nApril 2021: Berlin hard fork reduces gas costs.\nAugust 2021: London hard fork activates EIP-1559 ; introduces fee burning, reducing inflation.\nSeptember 15, 2022: “The Merge” transitions Ethereum from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, cutting energy use by more than 99 percent.\nApril 12, 2023: The Shanghai upgrade enables withdrawal of staked Ether from the Beacon Chain.\nMarch 13, 2024: The Dencun upgrade introduces proto-danksharding, a step toward reducing costs and increasing scalability.\nMay 7, 2025: The Pectra upgrade, combining Prague and Electra updates, aims to expand staking flexibility and improve Ethereum’s efficiency.\nDecember 3, 2025: The Fusaka upgrade introduces changes to Ethereum's data availability and block capacity.\n\nEthereum and DAOs One of Ethereum’s most radical innovations was the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. A DAO is a blockchain-based organization governed by smart contracts and community votes . Members typically hold tokens that grant them voting power on how the DAO operates and spends its funds.\nThe first major experiment was The DAO in 2016, which sought to operate as a decentralized venture capital fund. Investors pooled Ether, then voted collectively on how to allocate it. The project ended in disaster due to an infamous hack , but it demonstrated the potential of blockchains as platforms for decentralized governance.\n\nWhat Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?\nSince then, DAOs have grown into a vibrant sector. They range from DAO frameworks like Moloch and Aragon , to investment collectives like Syndicate , and governance DAOs such as MakerDAO , which manages a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, to social DAOs that organize communities online.\nSupporters argue that DAOs could redefine corporate governance by replacing traditional hierarchies with code and community control. Critics warn that legal frameworks remain murky, and smart contract vulnerabilities pose risks. Still, DAOs remain one of the clearest examples of Ethereum enabling something that could not exist without it.\nA network tested by crisis If Bitcoin is the gold of the cryptocurrency world, Ethereum is the oil that machines are powered on—but it has not been all smooth sailing.\nEthereum’s first major crisis arrived in 2016 with the DAO hack, when attackers exploited a vulnerability to steal $50 million worth of Ether.\nThe community was split: some argued the blockchain’s ledger should remain immutable, while others pushed to undo the damage. The decision to hard fork created two parallel blockchains—Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\n\nEthereum and the NFT boom Ethereum also fueled the explosion of non-fungible tokens , or NFTs, unique digital assets that prove ownership of items like art, music, or collectibles.\nThe breakthrough came in 2017 with the ERC-721 token standard, which let developers create unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs began to clog the Ethereum network as users spent millions trading CryptoKitties , CryptoPunks , and more, showing both the appeal and the limits of the technology.\n\nBeginner's Guide to NFTs: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens?\nBy 2021, NFTs had gone mainstream. Digital artist Beeple sold an NFT artwork for $69 million , and the Bored Ape Yacht Club launched. One of the most prominent NFT collections, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, is a collection of 10,000 primate-themed NFTs that became a cultural phenomenon, drawing celebrities and selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. At its height, in May 2022, all 10,000 BAYC NFTs collectively were valued over $1 billion.\nEthereum’s smart contracts made this possible by encoding ownership and authenticity directly into the blockchain. The NFT boom exposed Ethereum’s energy inefficiency, accelerating its shift away from the more energy-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm.\n\nThe race to scale Ethereum’s biggest weakness? Scalability. At about 15 transactions per second, it cannot match Visa’s tens of thousands. That bottleneck has often caused sky-high “gas fees,” or transaction costs.\nTo address this, developers began a years-long upgrade known as Ethereum 2.0 . The launch of the Beacon Chain in 2020, the Berlin and London upgrades in 2021, and the Merge in 2022 marked steps toward a more efficient, Proof-of-Stake network. Later upgrades, including Shanghai in 2023 and Dencun in 2024, tackled staking flexibility and lower transaction costs.\n\nVitalik Wants To Speed Up Ethereum By 100x, Make it as 'Simple as Bitcoin'\nEthereum and the Web3 vision Supporters see Ethereum as the foundation for “Web3”—an internet where users, not corporations, control data, money, and digital identities. Ethereum powers decentralized finance DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations, each of which experiments with alternatives to traditional financial and governance systems.\n\nBut competition looms. Rival networks such as Solana , Cardano , and Polkadot have positioned themselves as faster, cheaper alternatives. Meanwhile, Ethereum scaling solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum aim to process transactions off-chain before anchoring them to Ethereum’s main blockchain, reducing lag time and cost.\nEthereum and privacy In 2025, privacy has become a key focus of the Ethereum project. In November, Vitalik Buterin stated that \"Privacy is not a feature. Privacy is hygiene,\" building on a narrative in which he framed it as a fundamental requirement for digital systems such as blockchain platforms.\nEthereum Foundation Launches New Cluster Focused on Privacy\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation has followed suit, launching a privacy cluster in October 2025 that includes 47 researchers, coordinators and cryptographers. The Foundation also launched Kohaku, a \"privacy-first\" toolkit for Ethereum, alongside a browser wallet and SDK. Upon its launch, Buterin commented that \"Full-stack privacy and security are first-class priorities in Ethereum.\"\nA decade in, Ethereum is still defining itself As Ethereum enters its second decade, it continues to test the boundaries of what a blockchain can do. Whether it will deliver on its vision of a decentralized internet—or cede ground to faster competitors—remains an open question.\nWhat’s certain is that Ethereum has already changed how we think about the internet, money, community, and governance.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Interim Chief Executive Officer David McCreight said recent results suggest the business needs change, a message that follows the termination of former CEO William D. Nash at the beginning of December due to slumping sales. Despite the pressure on volumes, earnings came in at 43 cents a share, exceeding both the company's earlier guidance range of 18 to 36 cents and the 38 cents analysts had projected after revising estimates following preliminary disclosures.\n\nShares fell as much as 7% in premarket trading before recovering part of the decline, extending a challenging year in which the stock is down by about half since the start of the year. Investors are also weighing competitive dynamics, with CarMax continuing to lose ground to online-focused rival Carvana and facing potential new competition from Amazon.com, which plans to sell Ford used vehicles on its platform. Together, these developments suggest CarMax's turnaround efforts could remain under close investor scrutiny as management seeks to stabilize performance in an increasingly competitive used-car market.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

JPMorgan notes that boards and CFOs are pressing harder on return on investment, favoring projects with clearer financial outcomes over open-ended experimentation.

The Delivery Protection Act would rein in abusive last-mile delivery operations by requiring basic licensing, safety standards, and accountability for companies like Amazon.\n\n\"Leaders from both parties across New York City support the Delivery Protection Act, but Speaker Adams has failed the council and the people of New York,\" said Thomas Gesuladi, President of Teamsters Joint Council 16. \"Amazon Teamsters won't let Speaker Adams get in the way of delivering for our workers and our communities. The Delivery Protection Act will become law in New York City.\"\nIntroduced by Councilmember Tiffany Cabán (D-22nd District), the Delivery Protection Act would require companies such as Amazon to directly hire workers at last-mile delivery facilities, making Amazon's abusive third-party Delivery Service Provider (DSP) model illegal in New York City. The legislation would also ensure that delivery companies abide by higher safety standards and are held responsible for the accidents they cause, addressing working conditions that have led to workers in New York City having triple the injury rate compared to the national average.\n\n\"In New York, we pride ourselves on supporting labor, taking care of our families, and protecting our communities. Speaker Adams has failed every worker in this city by choosing to let the Delivery Protection Act stall out during her final term,\" said Vincent Perrone, President of Teamsters Local 804. \"We're calling on the incoming council to pass the Delivery Protection Act expeditiously next year.\"\n\"The Delivery Protection Act is the only way for New York City to hold Amazon accountable for years of union-busting and endangering our communities,\" said Matt Multari, a worker at the DBK1 facility in Woodside, Queens. \"Amazon Teamsters at DBK1 and DBK4 have successfully taken the Delivery Protection Act from obscurity to supermajority support in just a few weeks, and we're confident we'll pass it under new leadership next year.\"\n\nStory Continues\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents over 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

Find the next big opportunity with these 26 smaller AI-focused companies with strong growth potential through early-stage innovation in machine learning, automation, and data intelligence that could fund your retirement.\nWilldan Group Investment Narrative Recap To own Willdan Group, you need to believe that rising U.S. electricity demand, AI-driven data centers and grid modernization will support continued demand for its software and consulting. The recent earnings strength and raised guidance reinforce that the key near term catalyst is large multi year utility and government contracts, while the biggest risk remains policy or budget shifts that could slow funding for efficiency and infrastructure programs. So far, this news appears to support, not change, that balance.\n\nThe acquisition of Alternative Power Generation looks especially relevant here because it expands Willdan’s capabilities in data center infrastructure and AI powered software at a time when utilities are wrestling with large new loads from AI and electrification. That expansion aligns directly with the company’s recent contract wins and raised 2025 revenue guidance, strengthening the case that software and analytics tied to fast growing power demand could be a central driver of future performance.\nYet for all this momentum, investors should still watch how dependent Willdan remains on utility and government funding, because...\nRead the full narrative on Willdan Group (it's free!)\nWilldan Group's narrative projects $867.2 million revenue and $76.9 million earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "Charlie Munger Said, 'Find A Way To Get Your Hands On $100,000' Even If It Means Walking Everywhere — The Magic Number If You Want To Be Rich\n\nJeannine Mancini\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nBRK.A\n\nCharlie Munger didn't believe in shortcuts — but he did believe in thresholds. And if you ever asked how to get rich , he had a number ready: $100,000. Hit that, he said, and you'll have the momentum to keep going. Fail to hit it, and you'll spin your wheels forever.\nMunger, who died in 2023 just weeks shy of his 100th birthday, was best known as Warren Buffett's blunt, brilliant right hand — but he built a billion-dollar fortune of his own by focusing on what worked and ignoring what didn't.\n\nOne piece of wisdom that resonates with investors is his take on building wealth. In the late 1990s, during a shareholder meeting, Munger said, “The first $100,000 is a b****, but you gotta do it.”\nDon't Miss:\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nThis statement emphasizes the initial hurdle many face in accumulating savings. Munger’s bluntness highlights the challenge of reaching that critical first $100,000.\n“I don’t care what you have to do,\" he said. \"If it means walking everywhere and not eating anything that wasn’t purchased with a coupon, find a way to get your hands on $100,000.\"\n\nThe reason behind Munger’s focus on this initial amount? The power of compounding. Once you have that base, the path to greater wealth becomes smoother. With compounding returns, $100,000 can grow significantly over time, providing a strong foundation for long-term financial goals.\n“After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit,” he said.\nTrending: $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nMunger made this statement in the mid-1990s, and when adjusted for inflation, $100,000 at the time is roughly equivalent to about $200,000 in 2025 dollars, based on U.S. consumer price index data. The number itself has shifted with time, but the idea behind it has not. The first meaningful pool of capital is still the hardest to assemble, and everything that follows depends on clearing that initial hurdle.\n\nThat belief stayed with Munger until the end of his life. In 2023, during one of his final long-form interviews discussed on the \" Acquired\" podcast, he summed up the payoff of that early grind in a single line: \"You only have to get rich once .\" The remark reflected a theme he returned to repeatedly over decades — build a durable financial base one time, and the rest of your decisions become less constrained.\n\nStory Continues\nThat perspective also helps explain why Munger's career did not begin with stocks. Before becoming Buffett's longtime partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Munger was a real estate attorney. He understood early on how property, cash flow, and patience could work together over long periods. Real estate was not a side note in his thinking. It was foundational.\n\nFor people trying to apply that lesson today, real estate remains one of the most common ways to build toward that first six-figure milestone. Rental income, equity growth, and long holding periods can create momentum that wages alone often struggle to provide. While not everyone can buy an entire property outright, access to real estate no longer requires that level of capital.\nSee Also: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nPlatforms like Arrived offer one example. Arrived allows investors to buy fractional shares of rental home s, giving them exposure to rental income and property appreciation without owning or managing a full property themselves. The best part? All you need is $100 to get started.\n\nFor people working toward their first $100,000, or its inflation-adjusted equivalent, steady real estate income can complement traditional saving and investing strategies.\nMunger never argued that the process was easy. He argued that it was worth it. The discipline required to build that first base — whether through work, saving, investing, or real estate — is the same discipline that keeps wealth intact later on. Once that base exists, compounding has room to operate, and the pressure to constantly scramble begins to fade.\nA financial adviser can help translate those principles into a plan that fits real life, weighing income, risk tolerance, time horizon, and how assets like stocks and real estate should work together. The goal is not to replicate Munger's fortune. It is to apply his logic: reach a solid foundation once, and let time do the rest.\n\nSome elements of this story were previously reported by Benzinga and it has been updated.\nRead Next: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

      "Content": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:35 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nKO\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Beverage behemoth Coca-Cola is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s longest-held and biggest positions.\nYou know Amazon as an e-commerce powerhouse, but that’s not quite what makes it such a promising long-term prospect.\nGoogle’s parent Alphabet has proven it’s willing and able to successfully build or acquire businesses that expand its digital consumer-facing ecosystem.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nThe end of an era is almost upon us. After 55 years at the helm, at the end of this year, Warren Buffett will be stepping down as Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO and chief stock-picker.\nAnd when he goes, many members of the investment community could find themselves at a loss. Although Berkshire isn't just a mutual fund, plenty of investors took Buffett's lead by copying Berkshire's trades; now the conglomerate's stock picks won't necessarily be Buffett-approved holdings. So, if you want to know for sure that you're following in his footsteps, you'd better act soon.\nTo this end, here's a rundown of three names currently in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio that you not only know the Oracle of Omaha likes well enough to own them, but each of which could safely be bought and held forever.\n1. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) isn't just one of Berkshire's longest-held positions at 19 years. It's also become the conglomerate's third-biggest holding, currently worth $28 billion. That's 10% of Berkshire's entire publicly traded portfolio.\nIt's not hard to see why Buffett's been such a long-term fan of the beverage giant, either. Not only is it the biggest and best-known name in the business, but it's a dividend machine! In addition to paying a dividend like clockwork for decades, The Coca-Cola Company has raised its per-share dividend payment for 63 consecutive years (and counting). This year, Berkshire's 400 million shares of KO will provide Buffett and his lieutenants with more than $200 million in cash. Never even mind the near-200% gain this stock's price alone has produced since Buffett first bought it back in late 2006.\n\nIt's also a great \"forever\" stock for two other reasons. One of these is simply that the world will always need something to drink. With brands like Gold Peak tea, Powerade sports drinks, Minute Maid juices, Dasani water, and, of course, its namesake cola, The Coca-Cola Company has something to offer everyone.\nAnd the other reason this name's got staying power worth buying into? Its sheer size (read \"deep pockets\") -- the drinks giant can afford to outspend its competitors. For perspective, Coca-Cola spent more than $5 billion on advertising last year alone.\n\nStory Continues\nNo, it may not be fair. Investors don't want a fair fight, however. They want the companies they own to have an unfair advantage over their competition.\n2. Amazon Yes, Berkshire Hathaway holds a stake in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . It's not a big stake, mind you -- just 10 million shares currently worth about $2.2 billion. That's less than 1% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\nStill, the fact that he's willing to let Berkshire hold any Amazon at all is noteworthy just because Buffett has typically eschewed such flashy technology stocks, explaining that he doesn't always fully understand their business models. And to be sure, the pick was likely encouraged by Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler, who help oversee the conglomerate's equity holdings.\n\nThe pick also makes much more sense to Buffett now, however, than it would have several years ago.\nWhile Amazon may have been something of an unknown in its infancy (when the internet itself was still young and evolving, and when Buffett was forming his previous opinion on most technology stocks), even he would have to agree that uncertainty no longer applies. E-commerce is clearly here to stay, and Amazon clearly leads at least the U.S. e-commerce market; it isn't doing too badly overseas either. All told, despite its already-massive size, this company's product sales are up more than 8% through the first three quarters of this year. This growth rate accelerated last quarter, too, despite the lethargic economy here and abroad.\nAmazon isn't just e-commerce anymore, either. Although it only accounts for a minority of its revenue, its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, contributes roughly 60% of the company's total operating income. And the cloud computing industry is here to stay as well. Indeed, Straits Research expects the worldwide cloud computing industry to grow from less than $1 trillion this year to nearly $3.7 trillion per year by 2033.\n\nWhat makes this name such a great forever holding, however, is that -- not unlike Berkshire Hathaway itself -- Amazon has proven that it's willing and able to adapt to an ever-changing marketplace of opportunities.\n3. Alphabet Finally, add Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy and hold forever for yourself.\nThere are actually several clear parallels between Berkshire's positions in Amazon and Alphabet. Both are holdings that wouldn't have likely even been considered as potential picks a few years ago, for instance, yet both businesses have clearly solidified in the meantime. Both companies are also flexible; Amazon added cloud computing to its repertoire several years ago and is now turning its online shopping platform into an advertising medium, while Alphabet has moved well beyond its Google search engine with profit centers like YouTube and its own cloud computing service. Berkshire doesn't exactly have a huge stake in either outfit, only holding 17.8 million shares currently worth about $5.5 billion. That's less than 2% of the conglomerate's total stock holdings.\n\nIt's also a pretty safe bet that this position is the result of prodding from Todd Combs or Ted Weschler.\nWhatever the case, Buffett's pseudo-endorsement of Alphabet serves as a green light of sorts for you, plugging you into the company that still handles 90% of the world's web searches (according to Statcounter).\nThat's not the chief reason Alphabet is such a great long-term bet, though. The biggest and best bullish argument here is a more philosophical one. That's Alphabet's willingness and ability to build or buy a business, anything that allows it to expand its digital ecosystem.\nYouTube is one example; Google acquired it back in 2006. Alphabet's chat-based artificial intelligence platform Gemini is another example, as is 2004's launch of Gmail and 2005's acquisition of mobile operating system Android, which Statcounter says is installed on 72% of the world's mobile devices.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" arm is home to developing self-driving taxi service Waymo and life-science outfit Verily.\nSome of these projects pan out. Others don't. There's a reason, however, that Alphabet has only failed to produce year-over-year quarterly revenue growth once in the past 10 years. That's the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 -- and that was a short-lived headwind. Its profit growth has been almost as persistent. There's no end in sight to this growth streak, either. There's just too much worldwide dependence on Alphabet's offerings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

Should You Too?\n\nNeha Chamaria, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:24 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: VIRT\n\nSMR\n\nAMZN\n\nUNH\n\nKey Points Virtu Financial bought 579,353 shares of NuScale Power valued at nearly $21 million.\nThe new stake represents 1.16% of 13F reportable assets under management.\nThis is Virtu Financial's first SMR purchase, signaling its bullishness on the stock.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nWhat happened According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated Nov. 14, 2025, Virtu Financial LLC established a new position in NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) . The fund reported holding 579,353 shares valued at $20.86 million at the end of the third quarter, representing its first disclosed stake in the company for the period ending Sept. 30, 2025.\n\nWhat else to know This new position in SMR represents 1.16% of Virtu Financial LLC’s $1.79 billion in reportable U.S. equity assets.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNYSE: BRK-A : $224.00 million (12.5% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AMZN : $42.50 million (2.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: UNH : $38.63 million (2.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: LLYVA : $33.61 million (1.9% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: FOX : $32.42 million (1.8% of AUM)\nAs of Nov. 14, 2025, shares of NuScale Power were priced at $22.45, down 9% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 by 22.6 percentage points. Shares have fallen further by nearly 30% since.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close 11/14/25)\n$22.45\nMarket Capitalization\n$6.69 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$63.90 million\nNet Income (TTM)\n$-379.94 million\n\nCompany Snapshot NuScale Power is developing modular, light-water reactor nuclear power plants called VOYGR built on NuScale Power Modules. Each module can generate 77 megawatts of electricity, scalable up to 924 megawatt electric capacity.\nThe company generates revenue by designing, developing, and selling modular nuclear reactors and related energy solutions for electricity generation and industrial applications.\n\nNuScale Power develops and sells modular nuclear energy technology, offering scalable reactor solutions designed for electricity generation, district heating, and process heat applications.\nFoolish take It's been a wild ride for NuScale Power stock so far in 2025. Nuclear energy stocks surged after President Donald Trump signed executive orders in the middle of the year, outlining ambitious plans to boost the nuclear energy industry. Plans include support for SMRs, which is also NuScale's specialization.\n\nAlthough NuScale Power is still developing modules, it has an exclusive commercial partnership with ENTRA1 Energy. With ENTRA1 Energy recently securing some contracts, including a contract to deploy up to six gigawatts of nuclear power capacity to the Tennessee Valley Authority across seven states in the U.S., NuScale Power is already locking in some sales.\n\nStory Continues\nNuScale stock, however, has come under selling pressure in recent weeks, mainly on profit-booking across the board. NuScale's large shareholder, Fluor (NYSE:FLR) is also selling its stake in the nuclear energy company to cash in on its investment. That has also contributed to NuScale Power's stock fall. Investors like Virtu Financial, however, saw an opportunity in the dip to buy shares of a company building SMRs amid Trump's aggressive push for nuclear energy.\n\nGlossary 13F reportable assets: Assets that institutional investment managers must disclose quarterly to the SEC, showing their equity holdings.\nAUM (Assets Under Management): The total market value of investments managed by a fund or financial institution.\nPosition: The amount of a particular security or asset held by an investor or fund.\nStake: The ownership interest or share held in a company by an investor or fund.\nQuarterly average pricing: The average price of a security over a specific quarter, used for valuation purposes.\nModular light water reactor: A type of nuclear reactor designed in small, standardized units using ordinary water as coolant and moderator.\nMegawatt: A unit of power equal to one million watts, commonly used to measure electricity generation capacity.\nProcess heat: Heat energy produced for industrial or commercial processes, not just electricity generation.\nVOYGR plant configurations: NuScale's branded modular nuclear power plant setups, offering scalable electricity generation solutions.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

In this video, we break down key findings from Clootrack’s 2026 U.S. Men’s Denim Brand Switching Study, based on Voice-of-Customer (VoC) analysis of 55,287 customer reviews and discussions across major retailers and brand channels.\n\nNEW YORK, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Based on a new Voice of the Customer (VoC) analysis of 55,287 U.S. men’s denim reviews and discussions across Amazon, Target, Walmart, Macy’s and official brand stores (Q4 2022 - Q4 2025), the category appears to be settling around a familiar trio - fit, style and comfort - while loyalty is increasingly decided by something less glamorous: predictability . As brands plan 2026 assortments amid higher return sensitivity and “not as described” frustration, the strongest signal is clear: shoppers reward brands that reduce risk at the moment of purchase.\n\nThe study, conducted by Clootrack , introduces a directional switching momentum view called Net Flux (incoming minus outgoing brand switches expressed in customer language). Net Flux indicates directional movement in preference, not audited sales or market share. In the dataset, American Eagle, Gap and Old Navy showed the strongest net gains.\nFour signals that matter heading into 2026\nFigure 1: U.S. Men’s Denim VoC Theme Map (Category-Level).\nIn figure 1, the bubble chart shows the category’s key experience themes by positivity (%) and volume of opinions .\nClootrack applies a four-level unsupervised theme hierarchy to drill from broad drivers to specific, actionable fixes.\n1) Fit is the top driver - but loyalty is won by predictability.\nFit leads the category conversation (~ 21.8% share) with strong positivity (~ 80.7% ). Customers describe “good fit” in precise terms: leg silhouette control, thigh/seat room, reliable waist fit, more rise/inseam options, and stretch that flexes without losing shape.\n\n2) The loyalty breaker is sizing predictability (not comfort).\nSizing sentiment is low (~ 43.6% positive) and waist fit is similarly low (~ 42.7% ) with growing attention. Shoppers consistently cite the same risk factors: variation across washes/colors, measurement guides that don’t match delivered product, and inconsistent online sizing. In practice, this shows up as churn and returns when shoppers can’t trust what will arrive.\n3) “Trust triggers” are emerging right before checkout.\nTwo smaller themes show outsized impact because they introduce doubt at purchase:\nOdor & Chemical Safety: doubled in prevalence ( +100% ) with very low fulfillment ( 1.19/5 ).\nSustainability & Ethical Considerations: up 150% with low fulfillment ( 2.47/5 ).\nThese signals behave like multipliers when handled credibly — and like trust destroyers when they’re vague or inconsistent.\n\nStory Continues\n4) Product information accuracy is now a measurable performance lever.\nCustomers repeatedly flag mismatches and confusion in key product details (including closure type), alongside function/QC issues. “Truth-in-spec” is increasingly tied to conversion confidence and “not as described” returns.\nSwitching momentum: where preference is moving\n\nUsing Net Flux, Clootrack found American Eagle, Gap and Old Navy gained the most net switchers in the dataset. For Gap specifically, inbound switching was driven by reasons customers cite directly: Fit (41%) , Price (26%) , and Quality (~20%) .\n“What’s different here is connecting switching momentum to the fixable drivers customers explicitly cite - not just what they complain about,” said Shameel Abdulla, CEO of Clootrack.\nFigure 2: Net Flux snapshot\nInflux vs. outflux switching mentions by brand.\nWhat this means for brands\nThe data points to three priorities for 2026 planning:\nMake sizing predictability the loyalty lever.\nMove beyond “fit” as a brand promise and focus on reducing shopper risk - consistency across washes and colors, and measurement guidance that reliably matches what arrives.\nMake durability visible, not implied.\nShoppers increasingly judge denim by concrete failure points (seams, pockets, crotch reinforcement, wash durability). Strengthen those stress areas and communicate durability with a small set of clear, comparable cues.\nTreat “trust cues” as part of the product experience.\nAs odor/chemical concerns and sustainability expectations rise, credibility matters. Tighten claims, clarify product specs on PDP, and remove ambiguity that drives “not as described” frustration and returns.\n\nMethodology at a glance\nDataset: 55,287 U.S. men’s denim reviews and discussions (Q4 2022 - Q4 2025) across major retailers and official brand stores; six leading denim brands in scope.\nPositivity (%): share of positive opinions within a theme.\nFulfillment score (1 - 5): how effectively brands meet the underlying job to be done.\nNet Flux: incoming minus outgoing switches expressed in reviews/discussions; a directional indicator, not audited sales or market share.\nReport availability: Full theme hierarchy, verbatims, and drill-down cuts (persona, price tier, fit type) available on request.\nAbout Clootrack\nClootrack is an AI-powered Voice of the Customer analytics platform with AI Super Agents that help enterprises convert fragmented customer feedback into actions tied to business KPIs such as NPS, churn, returns, revenue, and operational efficiency.

      "Content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms.\nMicrosoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) lost 0.03% over the past five trading sessions after losing 0.27% the five prior. That brings MSFT's year-to-date gain to 13.75%, including a more than 3r4% gain since its year-to-date low on April 8.\nWhen the Magnificent Seven member reported FY 2026 Q1 earnings on Oct. 29, shares fell despite beating on EPS and revenue. The company announced earnings of $3.72 per share versus analysts' expectations of $3.67, and quarterly revenue of $77.67 billion versus analysts' expectations of $75.33 billion.\nOn Oct. 1, the company announced that it was increasing its Xbox Game Pass subscription by 50%. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft saw more than 8% of revenue derived from its gaming segment, which now boasts 50 million monthly active subscribers and nearly $5 billion in YoY revenue.\n\nMicrosoft's decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth.\nWhy Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) AWS.\nIn June, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 39% in FY25 Q4, driven by AI services.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect the company's capex to remain elevated to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth.\n\nTariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year.\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft's AI and cloud momentum.\n\nMicrosoft As a Stock Broadly, 34 Wall Street analysts' remain bullish, with 32 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a \"Buy\" rating, two assigning it a \"Hold\" rating and none assigning it a \"Sell\" rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating. Wall Street's price targets cover a significant range, spanning $500 per share on the low end to $700 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $632.22, which represents 32.78% potential upside from today's share price.\nInstitutional ownership currently stands at 73.74%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\n%Change From Current Price\nLow\n$500\n5.01%\nMedian\n$632.22\n32.17%\nHigh\n$700\n47.02%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s strong Azure revenue growth positions it for cloud and AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger.\n\n24/7 Wall St. ’s year-end price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying upside potential of 18.38% from the stock's current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and FY26 Q1 revenue guidance, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided.

      "Content": "2 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy No Matter What Happens in 2026\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points These two tech leaders had a challenging year but have demonstrated their resilience.\nThey also boast strong prospects and economic moats, making them excellent long-term investments.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nIn 2025, tariff threats and trade wars rocked equities and nearly triggered a full-blown bear market. Despite all that, stocks have performed pretty well this year.\n\nWhat's in store for 2026? Nobody knows. However, some companies can navigate the challenges ahead -- whatever they may be -- and perform well over the long run. These are the kind of businesses that investors want to set their eyes on.\nHere are two excellent, well-known candidates that fit the bill: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . These longtime market beaters are still worth investing in and sticking with next year and beyond.\n1. Amazon Amazon has basically moved sideways this year. The e-commerce specialist is lagging broader equities and most of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers. What's going on with the company?\nThere are several things, and here's one of the most important: Many investors are worried that the company is losing market share to its closest competitors in the cloud computing industry.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) accounts for most of Amazon's operating profits, as it boasts much juicier margins than its e-commerce operations. If it loses ground in this market, Amazon could see slower-growing earnings. That said, Amazon is showing it can perform well, despite this issue.\nDuring the third quarter, the company's sales growth within AWS accelerated, compared to recent quarters, and was stronger than anything investors have seen since 2022. Amazon maintains its lead at the top of the cloud computing industry.\nElsewhere, the company is seeking ways to enhance margins and profits within its e-commerce division. To that end, it has deployed a fleet of industrial robots in its warehouses.\nThe company's goal with this initiative is twofold. First, it will seek to cut costs while making shipping and deliveries faster, thereby improving the customer experience. Amazon's efforts here could help increase its razor-thin margin in its e-commerce division. Even a relatively small improvement may meaningfully boost the company's earnings.\n\nSecond, Amazon has several other potential growth drivers. Its advertising business is going strong, and it's making strides within its healthcare division, thanks to initiatives such as Amazon Pharmacy. And here's the best part: The industries and markets where it dominates still have significant long-term growth prospects.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's the case with e-commerce, which, despite its seeming ubiquity, still captures less than 20% of retail transactions in the U.S. It's also true of cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), which, CEO Andy Jassy has observed, are still in their early innings.\nLastly, Amazon has a wide economic moat due to its brand name, switching costs, and network effects. The company's investment thesis remains intact, despite the headwinds it has faced in 2025.\n\n2. Apple Apple is more exposed to the threat of tariffs than perhaps any of its similarly sized peers. The company still generates most of its sales from its hardware devices, particularly the iPhone, which is manufactured in countries such as China -- a country on which the Trump administration tried to impose steep tariffs.\n\nDespite all that, Apple's shares are up 12% year to date. That's below the performance of the S&P 500 but better than many expected six months ago.\nApple's strength lies in its ability to continue convincing new and existing customers to purchase more iPhones. The company's latest launch, the iPhone 17, was well received and is expected to drive a strong renewal cycle over the next three years, helping to maintain decent sales growth.\nHowever, Apple's hardware business isn't where the company's most important long-term opportunities lie. The company's services segment -- where Apple boasts more than 1 billion paid memberships -- arguably takes that crown. It accounted for a meaningful 39% of its sales, as of the last quarter.\n\nMoreover, the services segment has been growing its revenue, on average, faster than the rest of the business for years, a trend that should continue for the foreseeable future. Since services boast significantly higher margins than hardware sales, Apple's profits should increase meaningfully over the long run as the company expands this segment.\nRevenue from services will rise as Apple's large installed base of devices expands. The company routinely hits new highs in that department. And given the company's high switching costs -- Apple makes it hard to leave its ecosystem -- Apple's installed base should, at the very least, remain stable.\nApple has demonstrated that it can navigate the threat from tariffs, still maintains a solid hardware business, and boasts attractive tailwinds within services. To top it all off, it remains an excellent dividend stock . These are all good reasons to stick with Apple in 2026 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Can NBIS AI Cloud 3.1's Blackwell Ultra Launch Trigger Growth Momentum?\n\nShreya Majumder\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:14 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWV\n\nAMZN\n\nNBIS\n\nAs AI initiatives grow, enterprises face new operational challenges regarding GPU availability across regions, planning capacity for multiple teams and ensuring predictable access to resources. Nebius Group N.V. NBIS is addressing these needs with the launch of Nebius AI Cloud 3.1, the latest release of its full-stack AI cloud platform. Building on the Nebius AI Cloud “Aether\" framework, version 3.1 infuses next-generation NVIDIA NVDA Blackwell Ultra infrastructure, transparent GPU capacity management, expanded AI/ML developer tools and improved enterprise security and compliance features. These updates position Nebius AI Cloud as an ideal platform for enterprises scaling AI workloads in production.\n\nNebius is now rolling out NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra globally, including HGX B300 and GB300 NVL72 systems, becoming the first cloud provider in Europe to run both in production and the first worldwide to deploy GB300 NVL72 with 800 Gbps NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand. Paired with accelerated networking, storage and filesystem scaling, Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 removes AI infrastructure bottlenecks and reinforces its position with top MLPerf Training v5.1 results. Furthermore, version 3.1 introduces Capacity Blocks and a real-time dashboard, providing enterprises with full visibility into reserved GPU capacity across regions. Additionally, project-level quotas and new storage rules enable tighter control over resources and costs.\nBeyond infrastructure and operations, Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 expands its ecosystem to streamline AI development, offering simplified access to NVIDIA BioNeMo NIM microservices for healthcare and life sciences without requiring NGC keys or NVDA AI Enterprise licenses. The release also enhances developer experience with improved Slurm orchestration, FOCUS-compliant billing and a refined console, while strengthening enterprise security with HIPAA-ready audit logs, granular access controls, VPC security groups and Microsoft Entra ID–based IAM for regulated and government workloads.\n\nAs AI models grow larger and more complex, platforms like Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 are poised to play a key role in enabling enterprises to innovate faster, without compromising on performance, governance, or control. While capacity expansion supports NBIS’ revenue outlook, with 2025 guidance now set at $500–$550 million, up from the prior $450-$630 million, near-term risks remain. Power constraints, supply-chain uncertainty and intensifying competition from top players like Amazon AMZN and rivals such as CoreWeave, Inc . CRWV could limit capacity growth and weigh on execution in an increasingly crowded AI infrastructure market.\n\nStory Continues\nRising Rivalry to Cloud NBIS’ AI Infrastructure Growth Path CoreWeave continues to ramp up investments in data centers and server infrastructure to keep pace with the ongoing traction in customer demand. CRWV grew from a niche GPU provider into a leading AI cloud by buying large GPU inventories and carving out relationships with AI labs and companies that need lots of H100/Blackwell-class GPUs. A major force behind its momentum is its multi-billion-dollar agreements with NVDA. Third-quarter highlights include being the first to deploy NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems for large-scale frontier AI workloads and the first to offer NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances, giving CRWV an early lead in real-time AI and simulation workloads.\n\nAmazon is rapidly expanding AWS’ power capacity, doubling what it had in 2022 and on track to double again by 2027. In the fourth quarter alone, it expects to add another 1 GW. The expansion includes power, data centers and chips like AWS’ Trainium and NVIDIA GPUs. AMZN continues to deepen partnerships with NVIDIA, AMD and Intel, placing large chip orders and expanding these relationships over time. Backed by strong security, performance and enterprise focus, AWS continues to dominate major enterprise and government cloud migrations, driving AI demand. To support this, AWS added over 3.8 GW of capacity in the past year, more than any other cloud provider.\nNBIS’ Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Nebius have gained 179% in the past year compared with the Internet – Software and Services industry’s growth of 26.8%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation-wise, Nebius seems overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of F. In terms of Price/Book, NBIS shares are trading at 3.95X, higher than the Internet Software Services industry’s 3.74X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NBIS’ 2025 earnings has seen a downward revision over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNBIS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.: Why the Mag 7 needs to 'recalibrate'\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is concentrated primarily in the top ten technology stocks, according to Barclays.\nPNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati, Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré , and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss the market's concentration in tech and whether it's time for investors to start selling the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat I mentioned at the top about how much concentration risk there is in the S&P 500. What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
