      "Content": "ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025\n\nRyan Peterson\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:37 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nShares of AMD have steadied near recent highs as investors digest strong AI-related momentum alongside lingering questions about how quickly the company can meaningfully close the gap with Nvidia in data center acceleration. The story right now is less about AMD's growth prospects and more about whether enthusiasm around AI chips has largely been priced in heading into year-end.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, we ran AMD through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI's GPT. The goal wasn't to set a bold long-term target, but to produce a short, data-driven outlook that blends price action, technical signals, and the current narrative around AI demand and competition.\nWhat the AI model is actually predicting The agent was fed recent price action and a focused set of inputs to produce a short-term outlook. At the time of the run, AMD traded at $207.58. For the period from Dec. 16 through Jan. 6, the model's base-case projection came out to:\nAverage predicted price: $207.30\nImplied move: essentially flat drift into early January\nSignal snapshot: MACD remains low and flat, while RSI has begun to decline, pointing to cooling momentum rather than a breakdown\n\nIn plain language, the AI sees AMD's most likely path over the next few weeks as sideways, with little incentive for traders to push the stock meaningfully higher or lower without a new catalyst. That reflects a market that's comfortable with AMD's positioning, but not eager to expand the multiple further in the near term.\nFundamentally, AMD continues to benefit from rising demand for its MI300 AI accelerators, which management has highlighted as a key growth driver into 2025 as hyperscalers diversify beyond Nvidia. Recent earnings results showed data center revenue accelerating sharply year over year, reinforcing the idea that AMD is firmly in the AI spending cycle, even if it remains a distant second to Nvidia in market share.\nAt the same time, AMD's stock has already reflected much of that optimism. Shares rallied strongly earlier in the year on AI enthusiasm and improving PC demand, leaving less room for short-term upside unless orders or guidance surprise meaningfully. Broader coverage has also noted that while MI300 adoption is growing, the pace of revenue ramp and margins will be critical to sustaining investor confidence.\n\nPrice action in December supports that view. The stock has traded in a relatively tight range, with momentum indicators softening. The declining RSI suggests buying pressure is easing, while the flat MACD points to indecision rather than distribution. That combination often precedes consolidation rather than a sharp move, especially in large-cap semiconductor names late in the year.\n\nStory Continues\nThink of this AI outlook as a short-term temperature check. The model isn't making a judgment on AMD's long-term role in AI compute or its ability to take share over time. Instead, it's estimating how the market is likely to behave while investors wait for clearer signals on AI revenue scaling, margins, and competitive dynamics. In this run, the agent favors a muted move.\n\nFor longer-term investors bullish on AMD's AI roadmap and diversified chip portfolio, a flat few weeks is largely noise. For traders, it's a reminder that the next meaningful move in AMD will likely hinge on fresh data, either stronger-than-expected AI revenue traction or clearer signs that competition is pressuring pricing and margins.\nImage: Shutterstock\nThis article ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here .\nHappy Wednesday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Dec. 17, 2025. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nUpdate 4:01 p.m ET Closing Bell The U.S. markets are now closed, putting a cap on a rough day of trading for tech stocks. In total, 57.5% (3,197) issues were in decline today against 39.2% (2,178) advancing.\nThe Nasdaq (-1.81%) faced the brunt of the selloff as the Financial Times reported that Oracle (-5.4%) was losing a key source of funding on its $10 billion Michigan data center project. That revelation cooked up a significant selloff in semiconductor names, as well as the broader tech industry. The Nasdaq finished at 22,693.32.\nThe S&P 500 (-1.16%) sold off for a fourth straight day on the news, falling to 6,721.50. Here was the index today; notice those hot red pockets in tech and industrials.\nMeanwhile, the Russell 2000 (-1.07%) faced similar pockets of decline as the tech and industrial trouble boiled over into the small-cap index. It fell below 2,500 on the news, reversing from recent all-time highs.\nRounding out the major indexes, the Dow (-0.47%) was best-insulated, but still registered a decline. It closed out the day at 47,855.97.\n\nUpdate 1:20 p.m ET Midday Movers Now that the midday fireworks are in the rear view, all four U.S. market indexes are facing steeper declines -- near day lows.\nThe Russell 2000 (-1.26%) is down amid sluggishness in the industrial, technology, and communication services sector today.\nThe same is at least partially true for the Nasdaq (-1.23%) and S&P 500 (-0.83%), which are facing a similar downturn as the Oracle (-4.8%) drama permeates throughout the market, weighing on shares of other semiconductor names such as Broadcom (-5.3%), Advanced Micro Devices (-3.8%), and Nvidia (-3%).\n\nToday, the Dow (-0.39%) is making the best case today. Half of the index is in the red, the other half is in the red.\nIn total, 53.8% (2,992) of U.S. issues are in decline today against 42.8% (2,379) advancing, which brings us to our midday mover list for today. We'll take a look at the top and bottom 20 equities in the market among firms with at least a $2 billion market cap :\nWinners Despite it being a bad day for AI , today's top stock is an AI-fueled biotech play called Recursion Pharmaceuticals (+17.8%), who we haven't seen atop the list in quite awhile. A one-time retail favorite, the company was upgraded by JPMorgan today, which moved it from 'neutral' to 'overweight' citing the potential of its MEK inhibitor clinical trial.\n\nStory Continues\nFollowing close behind is Hut 8 (+12.5%), Anbio (+10.6%), and Via Transportation (+8.4%).\nAmong the larger firms making the list today are Elbit Systems (+4.3%), Texas Pacific Land Corporation (+5.6%), and Figma (+4.8%).\nLosers At the other end of the market, EverCommerce (-11.6%) is plummeting on some volatility . It's followed by some AI-related trades, independent power producer Bloom Energy (-10.1%) and Fermi (-9.6%).\nEven larger firms are being weighed down today by the AI jitters, including GE Vernova (-8.2%), Constellation Energy (-7.9%), and Vistra (-7.3%).\nUpdate 10:44 a.m ET More Oracle Drama Weighs on Tech Stocks Oracle is once again making itself the main character in the AI boom -- and maybe not in a good way.\nToday, the hyperscaler is declining on a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital won't go forward with funding the firm's $10 billion Michigan data center amid worries about \"tougher debt terms and the risk of delays,\" per the article.\n\nThe news comes just days after sources close to Oracle said it was pushing back key data center deliveries for partner OpenAI , who has committed billions to data center projects. Oracle was made to refute reports that it was not punting on these projects and that all milestones were coming along as planned. Obviously, Blue Owl seems to have sided with the anonymous sources cited in that Bloomberg report.\nWhy Does It Matter? Traders have remained relatively flighty about Oracle and ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Oracle counts more than half of its performance obligations from the Sam Altman-helmed company, which remains reliant on capital infusions from venture capital to stay afloat as it burns through money.\nAnd since the latter has not put up the money upfront, the hyperscaler has taken on gobs of debt to bring its data center ambitions to life. An astonishing $25 billion of the firm's $127 billion in debt is due within just three years. And with negative free cash flow -- in fact, -$13 billion -- a modest delay could seriously jeopardize the company's financial prospects.\n\nThe company's Altman Z-Score, a measure which is designed to predict likelihoods of bankruptcy within two years, is in the so-called \"grey area\" already, indicating financial stress.\nA deal with tech giant Meta seemed to help settle some concerns, but the underlying story is still the same: Oracle needs to deliver these projects or there might be trouble.\nWhat Does This Have to Do with WBD? Larry Ellison , the CEO and Co-Founder of Oracle, was seen trying to help finance the acquisition of HBO parent Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ).\nLarry's son, David, is the CEO of media company Skydance -- which recently acquired Paramount to become Paramount Skydance.\nHowever, the Ellison Family Trust was seen as a precarious sticking point in the recent negotiations between the media giants, leading WBD to go with Netflix for a proposed takeout. Partially harming matters for the Ellisons were questions about their financing, as well as Oracle's sagging stock.\n\nThat said, counting its decline today, Oracle has now fallen more than 45% from all-time highs.\nUpdate 9:34 a.m ET Opening Bell The U.S. markets are now open. The Russell 2000 (+0.57%) has already reversed yesterday's -0.45% decline from yesterday; it's now just a matter of holding onto those gains for the day.\nIn large caps, the Dow (+0.36%) is also having a solid start to the day. The S&P 500 (+0.12%) and Nasdaq (+0.09%), by contrast, are just up a few basis points at the market open. For the former, a gain today would put an end to a three day skid for the index.\n\nThe 10Y is up 0.8 bips to 4.157%.\nOne of the foreboding themes of the Tuesday trade -- aside from so-so payrolls -- was the large decline in U.S. energy stocks. The S&P Energy sector declined 3% as domestic oil prices approached a nearly four-year low. This morning, the U.S. oil benchmark known as WTI Crude , is trading at $56 -- up about 1.5%.\nToday, the sector is up about 1%, taking a bite of some of yesterday's losses. Financials and materials are also joining in the recovery, up more than half a percentage point.\nJoining in some of that excitement are Natural Gas continuous futures (+2.96% to $4.001) and the international oil benchmark, Brent Crude (+1.46% to $59.78), which is seeing a healthy bump in its continuous futures too.\nBut since it's the holiday season, there might not be a more timely trade than Silver (+3.75% and $65.675) and Gold (+0.81% to $4,367) -- they're up again today, continuing a hefty showing from precious metals in recent trading.\n\nUpdate 7:43 a.m ET A.M. Update Good morning. Futures this morning are currently pointing to modest gains in U.S. equities this morning, potentially offsetting Tuesday's tepid payrolls market reaction.\nEarnings Today: Micron, JBS, General Mills Here are all of the companies with at least a $1 billion market cap which are slated to report today, per Nasdaq:\nEconomic Data + Events Today will be a fairly relaxed day compared with yesterday, which saw the release of the overdue October payrolls alongside November's data.

Founded by former Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) executive Chen Weiliang after he left the US chipmaker five years ago, MetaX debuted at a valuation of about $5.9 billion before surging as much as 755% intraday and closing its first session up 693%. That move lifted the value of Chen's 55-million-share stake to roughly $6.5 billion, placing his rise alongside Moore Threads Technology Co. founder Zhang Jianzhong, another former US chip executive whose fortune expanded following a recent IPO. The developments reflect how Beijing's drive to build a self-sufficient chip supply chain is reshaping both capital markets and personal balance sheets, even as geopolitical tensions remain part of the backdrop.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with AMD.\nIs AMD fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nA key element behind MetaX's rapid build-out has been its approach to talent and incentives. Chen drew heavily from his former AMD network, recruiting senior engineers and executives such as Peng Li and Yang Jian into top technical roles, alongside other ex-AMD colleagues now embedded across management. To secure this talent in a highly competitive environment, the company leaned on equity as a primary tool, distributing 461 million yuan in share-based compensation in 2024. More than 80% of MetaX's roughly 870 employees hold indirect stakes through partnership structures, a model that has turned a broad swath of its workforce into high-net-worth individuals and helped shorten the typical startup learning curve.\n\nBeneath the headline gains, MetaX is still navigating the realities of heavy investment and operational risk. The company spent more than 2.2 billion yuan on research and development from 2022 through 2024 and reported a net loss of 1.41 billion yuan in 2024, underscoring the cash burn required to narrow gaps in system-level performance and production. Revenue reached 915 million yuan in the first half of 2025, surpassing the prior full year, while management projects a possible break-even point in 2026 that depends on the competitiveness of its C500 chip against domestic rivals including Huawei, Hygon and Cambricon. Reliance on a limited customer base and on third-party foundries also leaves the supply chain exposed to policy shifts and capacity constraints, suggesting the next phase of MetaX's story could hinge on execution as much as on capital-market momentum.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The shares have surged 176% in 2025, ranking as the fifth-best performer in the S&P 500 and marking Micron's strongest year since 2013, well ahead of the roughly 40% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. That momentum has softened in recent sessions, with the stock down about 12% over the past four days following a Dec. 10 high, suggesting investors may be reassessing expectations ahead of the report.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Sign with MU.\nIs MU fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe company is expected to post strong growth as sustained spending on AI data centers supports demand for its high-bandwidth memory chips, but the market appears focused on whether that momentum is still accelerating. Recent sharp declines in Oracle and Broadcom, both of which fell 11% in a single session last week, have highlighted how quickly sentiment can turn on perceived AI beneficiaries. Some investors may now be adopting a more cautious stance, waiting for clearer signals on how durable data-center growth could be before re-engaging with the sector.\nValuation remains a central part of the Micron debate. Despite this year's rally, the shares trade at roughly 11 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, the lowest multiple among the 30 stocks in the semiconductor index, which trades closer to 25 times forward earnings. That discount stands out against peers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ), and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), which command significantly higher multiples. At the same time, expectations for Micron's fundamentals have been moving higher, with consensus forecasts for fiscal 2026 net earnings up 16% over the past month and more than 50% over the past quarter, while revenue estimates have risen by more than 20% over the past three months. With enthusiasm elevated and memory demand still cyclical, the upcoming earnings report could either reinforce the view that Micron is reasonably valued or test how much optimism is already reflected in the shares.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Mining stocks are also moving higher as tensions in Venezuela escalate, boosting safe-haven demand for precious metals, with silver soaring to a new all-time high.\nDovish comments today from Fed Governor Christopher Waller were supportive of stocks and bonds, as he said the US labor market is \"pretty soft,\" with close to zero job growth, and that inflation is \"pretty well anchored\" around 2%. He added that interest rates are still 50-100 basis points above neutral, and the Fed can steadily lower them with no rush.\nUS MBA weekly mortgage applications fell -3.8% in the week ended December 12, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -2.8% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index down -3.6%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose +5 bp to 6.38% from 6.33% in the prior week.\n\nThis week's market focus will be on US economic news. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall -11,000 to 225,000. Also, Nov CPI is expected to be +3.1% y/y, and Nov core CPI is expected to be +3.0% y/y. On Friday, Nov existing home sales are expected to be up +1.2% m/m to 4.15 million. Also, the University of Michigan Dec consumer sentiment index is expected to be revised upward by +0.2 to 53.5 from the previously reported 53.3.\n\nStory continues\nThe markets are discounting a 24% chance that the FOMC will cut the fed funds target range by 25 bp at the next FOMC meeting on January 27-28.\nOverseas stock markets are mixed today. The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.24%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +1.19%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 recovered from a 2-week low and closed up +0.26%.\n\nInterest Rates\nMarch 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) today are up by +1 tick. The 10-year T-note yield is down -0.4 bp to 4.141%. T-notes recovered from early losses today and are slightly higher due to dovish comments from Fed Governor Waller, who said the Fed can keep cutting rates as interest rates are still 50-100 bp above neutral.\nT-notes initially moved lower today on negative carryover from a plunge in Japanese 10-year bonds to an 18-year low. Also, supply pressures are weighing on T-note prices ahead of the Treasury’s $13 billion auction of 20-year T-bonds later today.\nThe steepening yield curve is bearish for T-note prices. Steepening trades occur when bond investors buy short-term government debt and sell long -term debt. The yield curve has steepened since last Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, when the Fed said it would begin purchasing up to $40 billion of short-term T-bills a month to boost liquidity in the financial system. Longer-term Treasury securities are also under pressure from concerns about inflation and the Fed’s independence.\n\nEuropean government bond yields are mixed today. The 10-year German bund yield rebounded from a 1-week low of 2.826% and is up +0.6 bp to 2.851%.

      "Content": "Exclusive-Google works to erode Nvidia's software advantage with Meta's help\n\nReuters\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nDec 17 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google is working on a new initiative to make its artificial intelligence chips better at running PyTorch, the world’s most widely used AI software framework, in a move aimed at weakening Nvidia 's longstanding dominance of the AI computing market, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe effort is part of Google's aggressive plan to make its Tensor Processing ​Units a viable alternative to Nvidia's market-leading GPUs. TPU sales have become a crucial growth engine of Google's cloud revenue as it seeks to prove to investors that its AI investments are generating returns.\nBut ‌hardware alone is not enough to spur adoption. The new initiative, known internally as “TorchTPU,” aims to remove a key barrier that has slowed adoption of TPU chips by making them fully compatible and developer-friendly for customers who have already built their tech infrastructure using PyTorch software, the ‌sources said. Google is also considering open-sourcing parts of the software to speed uptake among customers, some of the people said.\n\nCompared with earlier attempts to support PyTorch on TPUs, Google has devoted more organizational focus, resources and strategic importance to TorchTPU, as demand grows from companies that want to adopt the chips but view the software stack as a bottleneck, the sources said.\nPyTorch, an open-source project heavily supported by Meta Platforms, is one of the most widely used tools for developers who make AI models. In Silicon Valley, very few developers write every line of code that chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices or Google will actually execute.\nInstead, those developers rely on tools like PyTorch, which is a ⁠collection of pre-written code libraries and frameworks that automate many common tasks in ‌developing AI software. Originally released in 2016, PyTorch’s history has been closely tied to Nvidia’s development of CUDA, the software that some Wall Street analysts regard as the company’s strongest shield against competitors.\n\nNvidia’s engineers have spent years ensuring that software developed with PyTorch runs as fast and efficiently as possible on its chips. Google, by contrast, has long ‍had its internal armies of software developers use a different code framework called Jax, and its TPU chips use a tool called XLA to make that code run efficiently. Much of Google’s own AI software stack and performance optimization has been built around Jax, widening the gap between how Google uses its chips and how customers want to use them.\nA Google Cloud spokesperson did not comment on the specifics of the project, but confirmed to Reuters that the move would provide customers with choice.\n\nStory Continues\n\"We ​are seeing massive, accelerating demand for both our TPU and GPU infrastructure,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our focus is providing the flexibility and scale developers need, regardless of the hardware they choose to build on.\"\nTPU FOR CUSTOMERS\nAlphabet had ‌long reserved the lion’s share of its own chips, or TPUs, for in-house use only. That changed in 2022, when Google’s cloud computing unit successfully lobbied to oversee the group that sells TPUs. The move drastically increased Google Cloud's allocation of TPUs and as customers' interest in AI has grown, Google has sought to capitalize by ramping up production and sales of TPUs to external customers.\n\nBut the mismatch between the PyTorch frameworks used by most of the world’s AI developers and the Jax frameworks that Google’s chips are currently most finely tuned to run means that most developers cannot easily adopt Google’s chips and get them to perform as well as Nvidia’s without undertaking significant, extra engineering work. Such work takes time and money in the fast-paced AI race.\nIf successful, Google's “TorchTPU” initiative could significantly reduce switching costs for companies that want alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia’s dominance has been reinforced ⁠not only by its hardware but by its CUDA software ecosystem, which is deeply embedded in PyTorch and has become the ​default method by which companies train and run large AI models.\n\nEnterprise customers have been telling Google that TPUs are harder to adopt ​for AI workloads because they historically required developers to switch to Jax, a machine-learning framework favored internally at Google, rather than PyTorch, which most AI developers already use, the sources said.\nJOINT EFFORTS WITH META\nTo speed development, Google is working closely with Meta, the creator and steward of PyTorch, according to the sources. The two tech giants have been discussing deals ‍for Meta to access more TPUs, a move first reported ⁠by The Information.\nEarly offerings for Meta were structured as Google-managed services, in which customers like Meta installed Google's chips designed to run Google software and models, with Google providing operational support. Meta has a strategic interest in working on software that makes it easier to run TPUs, in a bid to lower inference costs and diversify its AI infrastructure away from Nvidia’s GPUs to gain negotiating power, the people ⁠said.\n\nMeta declined to comment.\nThis year, Google has begun selling TPUs directly into customers’ data centers rather than limiting access to its own cloud. Amin Vahdat, a Google veteran, was named head of AI infrastructure this month, reporting directly to CEO Sundar Pichai.\nGoogle needs that ‌infrastructure both to run its own AI products, including the Gemini chatbot and AI-powered search, and to supply customers of Google Cloud, which sells access to TPUs to companies such as ‌Anthropic.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu, Kenrick Cai and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Exclusive-How China built its ‘Manhattan Project’ to rival the West in AI chips\n\nFanny Potkin\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:17 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nINTC\n\nSSNLF\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nBy Fanny Potkin\nSINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence , smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. ​The smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\nNevertheless, China still faces ‌major technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government ‌initiative to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.\n\nStory Continues\nChinese electronics giant Huawei plays a key role coordinating a web of companies and state research institutes across the country involving thousands of engineers, according to the two people and a third source.\nThe people described it as China's version of the Manhattan Project, the U.S. wartime effort to develop the atomic bomb.\n\n“The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,” one of the people said. \"China wants the United States 100% kicked out of its supply chains.\"\nHuawei, the State Council of China, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to requests for comment.\nUntil now, only one company has mastered EUV technology: ASML, headquartered in Veldhoven, Netherlands. Its machines, which cost around $250 million, are indispensable for manufacturing the most advanced chips designed by companies like Nvidia and AMD—and produced by chipmakers such as TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.\nASML built its first working prototype of EUV technology in 2001, and told Reuters it took nearly two decades and billions of euros in R&D spending before it produced its first commercially-available chips in 2019.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small ⁠feat,” ASML told Reuters in a statement.\nASML's EUV systems are currently available to U.S. allies including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.\nStarting in 2018, the United States began pressuring ‌the Netherlands to block ASML from selling EUV systems to China. The restrictions expanded in 2022, when the Biden administration imposed sweeping export controls designed to cut off China's access to advanced semiconductor technology.\nThe controls targeted not just EUV systems but also older deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines that produce less-advanced chips like Huawei’s, aiming to keep China at least a generation behind in chipmaking capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said the Trump Administration has strengthened enforcement of export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and is working with partners \"to close loopholes as technology advances.”\nThe Dutch Ministry of Defence said the Netherlands is developing policies requiring “knowledge institutions” to perform personnel screenings to prevent access to sensitive technology “by individuals that have ill intentions or who are at risk of being pressured.”\nExport restrictions ‍have slowed China's progress toward semiconductor self-sufficiency for years, and constrained advanced chip production at Huawei, the two people and a third person said.\nThe sources spoke on condition they not be identified due to the confidentiality of the project.\n\nCHINA'S MANHATTAN PROJECT\nOne veteran Chinese engineer from ASML recruited to the project was surprised to find that his generous signing bonus came with an identification card issued under a false name, according to one of the people, who was familiar with his recruitment.\nOnce inside, he recognized other former ASML colleagues who were also working under aliases and was instructed to use their fake names at work to maintain secrecy, the person said. Another person independently confirmed that recruits were given fake IDs to conceal their identities from other workers inside the secure facility.\nThe guidance was clear, the two people said: Classified under national security, no one outside the compound could know what they were building—or that they were there at all.\n\nThe team includes recently retired, Chinese-born former ASML engineers and scientists—prime recruitment targets because they possess sensitive technical knowledge but face fewer professional constraints after leaving the company, ​the people said.\nTwo current ASML employees of Chinese nationality in the Netherlands told Reuters they have been approached by recruiters from Huawei since at least 2020.\nHuawei did not respond to requests for comment.\nEuropean privacy laws limit ASML's ability to track former employees. Though employees sign non-disclosure agreements, enforcing them across borders has proven difficult.\nASML won an $845 million judgment in 2019 against a former Chinese engineer accused of stealing trade secrets, but the defendant filed for bankruptcy and continues to ‌operate in Beijing with Chinese government support, according to court documents.\n\nASML told Reuters that it “vigilantly guards” trade secrets and confidential information.\n\"While ASML cannot control or restrict where former employees work, all employees are bound by the confidentiality clauses in their contracts,\" the company said, and it has \"successfully pursued legal action in response to the theft of trade secrets.”\nReuters was unable to determine if any legal actions have been taken against former ASML employees involved in China’s lithography program.\nThe company said it safeguards EUV knowledge by ensuring only select employees can access the information even inside the company.\nDutch intelligence warned in an April report that China \"used extensive espionage programmes in its attempts to obtain advanced technology and knowledge from Western countries,\" including recruiting \"Western scientists and employees of high-tech companies.”\n\nThe ASML veterans made the breakthrough in Shenzhen possible, the people said. Without their intimate knowledge of the technology, reverse-engineering the machines would have been nearly impossible.\nTheir recruitment was part of an aggressive drive China launched in 2019 for semiconductor experts working abroad, offering signing bonuses that started at 3 million to 5 million yuan ($420,000 to $700,000) and home-purchase subsidies, according to a Reuters review of government policy documents.\nRecruits included Lin Nan, ASML's former head of light source technology, whose team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Shanghai Institute of Optics has filed eight patents on EUV light sources in 18 months, according to patent filings.\nThe Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics did not respond to requests for comment. Lin could not be reached for comment.\n\nTwo additional people familiar with China’s recruitment efforts said some naturalized citizens of other countries were given Chinese passports and allowed to maintain dual citizenship.\nChina officially prohibits dual citizenship and did not answer questions on issuing passports.\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nINSIDE CHINA'S EUV FAB\nASML's most advanced EUV systems are roughly the size of a school bus, and weigh 180 tons. After failed attempts to replicate its size, the prototype inside the Shenzhen lab became many times larger to improve its ⁠power, according to the two people.\nThe Chinese prototype is crude compared to ASML's machines but operational enough for testing, the people said.\nChina's prototype lags behind ASML's machines largely because researchers have struggled to obtain optical systems like those from Germany's Carl Zeiss AG, one of ASML's ​key suppliers, the two people said.\n\nZeiss declined to comment.\nThe machines fire lasers at molten tin 50,000 times per second, generating plasma at 200,000 degrees Celsius. The light is focused using mirrors that take months to produce, according to Zeiss' website.\nChina's top research institutes have played key roles in developing homegrown ​alternatives, according to the two people.\nThe Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIOMP) achieved a breakthrough in integrating extreme-ultraviolet light into the prototype's optical system, enabling it to become operational in early 2025, one of the people said, though the optics still require significant refinement.\nCIOMP did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a March online recruitment call on its website, the institute said it was offering \"uncapped\" salaries to PhD lithography researchers and research grants worth up to 4 million yuan ($560,000) plus 1 million yuan ($140,000) in personal subsidies.\n\nJeff Koch, an analyst at research firm SemiAnalysis and a former ASML engineer, said China will have achieved \"meaningful progress” if the “light source has enough power, is reliable, and doesn’t generate too much contamination.”\n\"No doubt this is technically feasible, it's ‍just a question of timeline,\" he said. \"China has the advantage that commercial EUV now exists, so they aren't starting from zero.\"\nTo ⁠get the required parts, China is salvaging components from older ASML machines and sourcing parts from ASML suppliers through secondhand markets, the two people said.\nNetworks of intermediary companies are sometimes used to mask the ultimate buyer, the people said.\nExport-restricted components from Japan’s Nikon and Canon are being used for the prototype, one of the people and an additional source said.\n\nNikon declined to comment. Canon said it was not aware of such reports.

Its intelligent solutions–Generative Intelligence (Solar LLM) and Document Intelligence for extraction on any document–are transforming workflows for some of the world's largest enterprises, optimizing repetitive tasks while preserving human oversight and complex decision making.\nUpstage raised $45 million earlier this year in a Series B bridge round, bringing total funding to $157 million, to expand its growth in the U.S. Notably, the AI company secured funding from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and AMD in August, becoming a minority investor in Upstage.\nSince the company's U.S. launch, Upstage landed on three CB Insights' industry lists, AI 100 , InsurTech 50 , and FinTech 100 , and showcased its leadership as subject matter experts at five major insurance industry events. The company has quickly established its presence in the InsurTech ecosystem with appearances at ITC Vegas, InsurTech Insights, and InsurTech NY. Additionally, Upstage's U.S. CEO, Kasey Roh, was a featured speaker at this year's AWS re:Invent Conference where she shared her insights on scaling real-world AI on a panel with AMD .\n\n\"Upstage's first year in North America has brought our transformative AI solutions to the U.S. insurance and financial services industries,\" said Kasey Roh, U.S. CEO of Upstage . \"Our technology is particularly advantageous for these legacy industries that still rely heavily on manual document processing. Upstage's superpower is that our technology hinges on human decision making, forging a symbiotic relationship between AI and people. This crucial distinction is what sets Upstage apart from other AI companies.\"\nUpstage's domain-specific models distinguish it from an industry flooded with newcomers, many of whom have yet to show tangible results. The company has spent half of the last decade building its proprietary model stack, giving them a distinct edge and headstart from companies modifying third-party or open-source foundation models.\n\nTheir technology's ability to turn any type of unstructured document into structured data is unique and essential for insurance companies handling large amounts of manual document processing. It adapts in real time while automatically flagging uncertain extractions while keeping humans in the loop. This feature is unique and critical, significantly reducing AI hallucinations that put companies at extreme risk. These human corrections are part of an automatic feedback loop for the model, learning from human validation to improve its accuracy over time. The technology provides companies with a zero-training, high-accuracy solution with no setup, templates, or retraining.\n\nStory continues\nThe proof of the company's success is in the numbers, its technology has a 95%+ accuracy across complex document types and formats. Upstage has served Fortune 500 companies in Korea, including Samsung, and now provides their solutions in the U.S. to enterprise and mid-market companies processing millions of pages every day.\n\nWhat Upstage's customers have to say about the company\nfurther highlights its success:\n\"Once Upstage's solution was in our underwriters' hands, there was no taking it away. The tool landed at exactly the right moment—as our team was working to keep up with 30% volume growth without additional headcount. Our VP of Underwriting made it clear: she wasn't giving up the invoice extraction tool 'over her dead body.' Within days, all 18 underwriters were benefiting from the solution.\"\n— Steven Beauchem , VP of Digital Strategy at Amwins, a leading global specialty insurance distributor.\n\"We've been able to achieve 95%+ accuracy on data [extraction] as well as other unstructured data in the underwriting process. Before, it took our team 30 minutes to an hour to review an application [whereas] today it could take us less than 10 minutes. This has been extremely impactful to our ability to manage a larger volume of submissions without sacrificing the depth of our analysis or the nuance that we gain from that information.\"\n— Gabriel Mayer , Founder of Tricura Insurance Group, an InsurTech MGU focused on providing liability coverage and technology to Senior Living Communities across the US.\n\n\"We built the MVP using a random GitHub parser, DocuClipper, and ChatGPT just to make it work. When I discovered Upstage, we realized we could replace the entire patchwork with a single, clean API. That decision changed everything — faster results, higher accuracy, zero maintenance.\"\n— Michael Rodriguez , Founder, Best Option Co., a software development company that brings AI solutions to help small businesses streamline operations and drive revenue.\nUpstage AI is poised to make an even bigger impact in North America in the coming year as it continues to partner with top companies in the insurance and financial services industries. The company is expected to bridge the gap between AI and human interaction to transform operations for legacy carriers and startups alike.\n\nAbout Upstage\nUpstage is building the future of enterprise AI through domain-specific language models and intelligent tools designed for high-impact business use. With deep expertise in LLM development, document AI, and agentic workflows, the company enables regulated industries and global enterprises to unlock the full potential of generative AI — securely, efficiently, and at scale.

      "Content": "Nvidia vs AMD: Which AI Chipmaker Will Lead the Next Decade of Compute?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Nvidia has been the leading AI chip designer since the start of the AI boom, but AMD has been gaining ground.\nBoth companies design the chips powering crucial AI tasks.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the \"go-to\" source for artificial intelligence (AI) chips since the start of the AI boom, and this is thanks to two things: the company's first-to-market advantage and the strong performance of its chips. All of this has generated enormous earnings growth, with revenue and profit reaching record levels, and mind-boggling share price gains -- the stock has advanced more than 900% over three years.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't alone in the exciting AI space. It faces competition from other chip designers such as Broadcom and even some of its own customers that have developed their own chips, like Amazon , for example. But one name in particular represents perhaps the biggest threat to Nvidia's dominance, and that's Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) , a company that's been quickly advancing with new high-powered chips and attractive pricing. And the coming years could represent a crucial moment for chip companies, as Nvidia predicts AI infrastructure spending may reach as much as $4 trillion.\nWhich of these two AI chip designers will lead the next decade of compute? Let's find out.\nNvidia's path to leadership First, let's consider Nvidia's path to leadership and how it's managed to stay ahead of rivals so far. As mentioned, Nvidia entered the market first with its supercharged graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips that power the most crucial of AI tasks from training to inferencing . This offered the company the opportunity to build relationships with customers, and for customers to be won over by the quality of Nvidia's products.\n\nNvidia maintained this leadership by continuing to innovate on a regular basis, and in recent years, it committed to annual updates to its top chips.\nAMD made AI a focus with the launch of its Instinct line of accelerators back in 2017, and since then has added to GPU offerings, gaining in performance and therefore becoming a stronger rival for AI powerhouse Nvidia.\nIn the most recent earnings report, the company delivered a 36% increase in revenue to a record level of $9.2 billion, and chief executive officer Lisa Su said quarterly performance and guidance for the next quarter marked \"a clear step up in our growth trajectory.\" Demand from data center customers for the company's EPYC processors and Instinct AI accelerators drove gains in the period.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD and OpenAI It's also important to note that AMD recently signed a deal with OpenAI for the deployment of six gigawatts of AMD GPUs, with the first gigawatt set to roll out in the second half of next year. (OpenAI also has a deal with Nvidia for the deployment of 10 gigawatts of Nvidia GPUs.)\nThough AMD has come a long way in a short period of time and surely will continue to gain many orders for its GPUs, I don't see the company unseating Nvidia and driving compute in the coming decade. And here's why: Nvidia truly has built out a massive ecosystem within the world of AI, offering everything needed to do the AI job, from GPUs to high-performance networking equipment and software, as well as platforms for specific industries like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and robotics. And within those industry platforms, Nvidia's built tools designed to help customers reach their goals.\n\nThough AMD also offers a significant array of products and services, it's not as far-reaching as that of its bigger competitor.\nLeading the next decade of AI All of this makes Nvidia better positioned to lead the next decade of compute -- but this doesn't mean AMD won't benefit from the upcoming phases of AI growth. AMD's chips and systems are powerful, pricing is competitive, and the company has seen demand take off in recent quarters. Major chip customers, like Amazon, just to name one, buy GPUs from a variety of chip designers -- not just from Nvidia. In its recent earnings call, Amazon chief Andy Jassy said Amazon Web Services continues \"to work closely with chip partners like Nvidia, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as well as with AMD and Intel .\"\n\nAll of this means that AMD may have plenty of very of bright days ahead, but considering the empire Nvidia has carefully built over time and its commitment to innovation, I expect this AI giant to keep powering the AI revolution.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Should Nvidia Worry About AMD and Google Breathing Down Its Neck in 2026?\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 11:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points AMD has an ambitious growth strategy and is already winning big AI chip deals.\nAlphabet's Google Cloud is making significant inroads in the AI chip market with its TPUs.\nNvidia shouldn't ignore the challenge from AMD and Google, but it's likely to continue dominating the market for now.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nLions reign as king of the jungle (although \"king of the savanna\" would probable more more accurate). Elvis is still the king of rock and roll. Michael Jackson remains the king of pop. However, if the subject is chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) applications, I'd say Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the king.\nBut the king's perch on the throne just might be at least a little shaky as the new year approaches. Should Nvidia worry about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) breathing down its neck in 2026?\nAMD's ambitious plans In November, AMD revealed a strategy to lead the $1 trillion AI and high-performance computing market. The company plans to deliver a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of greater than 35% over the next three to five years. AMD aims to achieve a revenue CAGR of more than 60% for its data center business.\n\nSuch ambitious plans are reminiscent of baseball legend Babe Ruth pointing to deep center field. You only make that kind of move unless you're confident you can back it up. Ruth, of course, proceeded to hit a home run. Can AMD deliver on its growth strategy? It's a definite maybe.\nThe company is already making progress toward its goal. For example, ChatGPT developer OpenAI will use AMD's Instinct MI450 GPUs in its next-generation AI infrastructure. The first deployment is scheduled for the second half of 2026. This deal also includes AMD issuing warrants for OpenAI to buy up to 160 million shares.\nAI cloud powerhouse Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is also using AMD's GPUs and CPUs with its first publicly available AI supercluster. The initial deployment is set for the third quarter of 2026. Privately held Cohere is integrating AMD's GPUs with its enterprise AI suite.\n\nAMD also won two major contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy. The agency will use AMD's GPUs and CPUs in its Lux and Discovery AI supercomputers.\nGoogle's TPUs are making inroads, too GPUs aren't the only game in town for powering AI systems, though. Alphabet's Google Cloud unit is also making inroads with its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) revealed last year that its Apple Intelligence generative AI functionality was trained using Google's TPUs rather than Nvidia's GPUs. Google, of course, also uses its TPUs with the widely acclaimed Google Gemini 3.0 large language model (LLM).\n\nStory Continues\nMore AI leaders are also turning to TPUs. Anthropic is spending tens of billions of dollars to expand its AI compute capacity in 2026 using Google's TPUs. The deal with Google is Anthropic's largest purchase of TPUs so far.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is reportedly in talks to use Google's TPUs in its data centers starting in 2027. In the past, Meta has been a major buyer of Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nGoogle could gain more traction in the AI chip market next year, thanks to its new Ironwood TPUs. Ironwood is four times more powerful than Google's previous highest-performing TPU.\nShould Nvidia worry? Both AMD and Google appear to be gaining momentum in the AI chip market. Should Nvidia worry? Yes and no.\nIt's always smart for companies to constantly monitor the competition and not rest on their laurels. Nvidia's management should recognize that its market dominance isn't guaranteed to last forever.\nHowever, I don't think Nvidia's top spot in the AI market is in jeopardy. The company doesn't, either, as evidenced by a post on X last month:\n\nIn my view, the AI chip market is large enough to support multiple winners. Nvidia will almost certainly remain the king for at least several more years. But either AMD or Google could deserve the title of crown prince.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop.

That compared with a multiple of 34 for Nvidia and 14 for AMD, MetaX said in a pre-listing statement.\n\nMetaX's debut catapulted the value of the five-year-old startup to more than 300 billion yuan ($42.58 billion) and boosted the wealth of founder and major shareholder Chen Weiliang, 49.\nAfter working for AMD Shanghai for 13 years, Chen founded MetaX with a mission to \"contribute to China's rejuvenation ​and national prosperity.\" The founding team also included Peng Li and Yang Jian, both former AMD engineers.\n\"The company is a leading GPU maker in China thanks to its AMD gene,\" ‌Li Hui, analyst at Huajin Securities, said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing.\n\nStory Continues\n\"It will likely benefit from China's continuous push to replace foreign suppliers using indigenous technology.\"\nMetaX, which controls 1% of China's AI chip market, projects the company's sales to more than double this year due to the tech self-reliance drive, and expects to break even as early as next year.\n\nCHINESE AI CHIPMAKERS RUSH FOR IPOS MetaX's market debut comes after Moore Threads ( 688795.SS ), dubbed by analysts as \"China's Nvidia\", raised $1.1 billion in its Shanghai IPO in late November.\n\nOn Monday, AI chip startup Biren Technology won regulatory approval to sell shares publicly in Hong Kong, while rival Kunlunxin also plans an IPO in the city. Another AI chipmaker, Enflame, has hired Citic Securities to prepare for a flotation.\n\"Chinese ⁠policymakers are greenlighting IPOs for AI chipmakers to support home-grown advanced technology,\" said fund manager Yuan Yuwei ​at Trinity Synergy Investments in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Domestic chipmakers lag U.S. rivals, but if they can raise tens or hundreds ​of billions to spend on talent, you cannot rule out their breakthrough.\"\nIPO fundraising in China jumped 23% in 2025 from a year earlier to exceed 160 billion yuan, according to KPMG, with 23% of the proceeds going to the technology, media and telecom sector.\nSIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY GAP MetaX flagged a number of ‍risk factors in its IPO prospectus, including supply ⁠chain disruption from U.S. technology restrictions as well as its significant technology gap with Nvidia and AMD.\nNvidia is considering adding production capacity for its H200 AI chips due to strong orders from Chinese clients, after U.S. President Donald Trump this month greenlighted export of Nvidia's second-fastest AI chips to China.\n\nIn the home GPU market, MetaX competes with ⁠Moore Threads as well as Hygon Information Technology and Biren.\nIn the so-called ASIC chip business, it competes with Cambricon, Huawei Technologies' HiSilicon, Baidu's Kunlunxin and Alibaba Group's T-Head.\n\"MetaX's technology lags Moore Threads, and it faces stiff competition ‌from Huawei and Alibaba,\" said Yuan of Trinity Synergy Investments.\nThere will be room to improve, \"but under the current circumstances, there's definitely froth in its share price.\"\n($1 = ‌7.0458 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee, Christopher Cushing and Thomas Derpinghaus)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
