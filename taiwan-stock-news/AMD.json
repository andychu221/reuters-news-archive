      "Content": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMU\n\nAVGO\n\nAMD\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock has underperformed its peers in the semiconductor space this year.\nThe company's valuation is becoming cheaper despite its historic operating performance.\nNvidia has a number of catalysts going into 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWhen it comes to leading semiconductor stocks, investors don't need to look much further than companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Broadcom , Advanced Micro Devices , Micron Technology , and of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nWhile Nvidia has been the headline act for much of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, shares have lagged its chip peers throughout 2025.\nAs 2026 draws closer, growth investors may be wondering if Nvidia remains a good buy , or if now is the time to rotate capital away from the world's most valuable company and seek new opportunities.\nWhat should Nvidia investors be on the lookout for in 2026? For the last three years, Wall Street's primary focus surrounding Nvidia is the performance of its data center business. This segment accounts for the bulk of Nvidia's revenue and profits, as it captures demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPU).\nThroughout the AI revolution, investors have paid close attention to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's commentary around the company's Hopper and Blackwell GPU architectures. While Blackwell remains an important catalyst for Nvidia, investors should start to pay closer attention to guidance around the upcoming Rubin chips. So far, investors have already gotten a small preview of demand for Rubin.\n\nFor instance, Huang recently noted that Nvidia has a total order backlog of around $500 billion for Blackwell, Rubin, and accompanying networking products. Of note, a portion of this revenue has already been booked, with an estimated $300 billion expected to be recognized during 2026.\nIn addition, Anthropic recently signed a $30 billion compute capacity agreement with Microsoft . As part of the deal, Anthropic will be leveraging clusters of Blackwell and Rubin chips.\nAt a macro level, Goldman Sachs estimates that hyperscalers including Microsoft, Alphabet , Amazon , and Meta Platforms will spend roughly $500 billion on AI capital expenditures (capex) next year. Taking this one step further, McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion opportunity over the next five years.\nAgainst this backdrop, investors should monitor how these secular tailwinds fueling accelerated investment in infrastructure continue to impact Nvidia, being aware that rising infrastructure will impact Nvidia well beyond its core data center operation.\n\nStory Continues\nThroughout next year and beyond, Nvidia's opportunities in adjacent markets, including next-generation CPUs and accelerated computing operating systems, should begin to come into focus as well, thanks to some savvy partnerships with Intel and Palantir Technologies .\nNvidia's valuation trends are getting interesting In the table, I've summarized Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, as of the end of each quarter over the last year.\nMetric\nCurrent\n3Q25\n2Q25\n1Q25\n4Q24\nPrice-to-sales (P/S)\n23.3\n30.2\n29.6\n20.7\n26.4\nForward price-to-earnings (P/E)\n23.4\n31.5\n57.4\n24.8\n28.1\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\nThere are two anomalies that stick out from the data.\nFirst, Nvidia's valuation multiples experienced notable compression during the company's first fiscal quarter of 2025 (ended April 30). This was driven by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, as well as fear that a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek could pose a threat to U.S. dominance in the AI landscape.\n\nThe second theme that's beginning to become more noticeable is that Nvidia's P/S and forward P/E ratios are hovering around the same levels as their prior lows earlier this year. Once again, I think this contraction revolves around fear more than anything else. Specifically, investors are concerned about rising competition from AMD and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from Broadcom.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy heading into the new year? While rising competition in the chip space is a very real thing, I don't see Nvidia necessarily losing its grip anytime soon. AI infrastructure is expected to be a multitrillion-dollar market that lasts several years. Buying into the idea that the hyperscalers will migrate away from Nvidia's GPUs overnight is unrealistic.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is becoming cheaper by the day despite the company operating at historic levels and signing new deals and partnerships -- effectively broadening its total addressable market (TAM) beyond data center services and simultaneously bringing new levels of business visibility as the AI infrastructure era kicks off.\nI think now is a great time to buy the dip and capitalize on the chip king's ongoing sell-off. Investors with a long-term time horizon could use the recent depressed price action to add to a core buy-and-hold position. Given these dynamics, I see Nvidia as a no-brainer heading into the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Did Nvidia Just Lose Its Spot as Wall Street’s AI Chip Darling? JPMorgan Says This ‘Overall Top Pick’ Is Better.\n\nJustin Estes\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAMD\n\nIf someone asked you to name a large AI chip manufacturer, you’d probably say Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), or maybe Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Your first thought probably wouldn’t be Broadcom (AVGO).\nBut Broadcom is actually a giant in the AI hyperscaler space with a $1.6 trillion market cap. Up 54% over the past year, the company has found defining success by pursuing only seven to 10 main customers who need billion-dollar buildouts rather than chasing many small $10 million contracts.\n\nMore News from Barchart 5 \"Best of the Best\" Dividend Stocks to Own in 2026\nThis 1 Lesser-Known Stock Is Set to Dominate with Nvidia and Broadcom in 2026\nNike, Tilray, and Palantir: Their Unusually Active Put Options Will Boost Your Wallet After Christmas\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nThat strategy is paying off in a major way. Broadcom reported an AI order backlog of $73 billion to be delivered over the next six quarters, with management expecting that figure to continue growing as new orders roll in.\nJPMorgan recently raised its price target on the stock and maintained its “Overweight” rating, calling the recent dip a buying opportunity. So what exactly does Broadcom do, and why are Wall Street’s biggest investors loading up on shares?\nWhat Does Broadcom Do? Broadcom has achieved its success through category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company operates two primary business segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.\nOn the semiconductor side, Broadcom is the leader in custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) designed specifically for data center AI workloads.\n\nASICs are specialized chips built to exact specifications for hyperscalers such as Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which need massive computing power.\nThe infrastructure software segment, which includes the VMware acquisition, provides enterprise software for planning, developing, automating, managing, and securing applications across different platforms.\nWith roots in the technical heritage of AT&T/Bell Labs, Lucent, and Hewlett-Packard/Agilent, Broadcom combines more than 60 years of innovation with global scale and engineering depth. The company serves the world’s most successful tech companies by focusing on technologies that connect our world.\nCEO Hock Tan explained the strategy at the Goldman Sachs technology conference: Broadcom is laser-focused on about seven customers building large language models and racing toward what he calls “super intelligence.” These companies are collectively spending around $30 billion annually on AI compute infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nRather than pursuing thousands of enterprise customers who might spend $10 million each on merchant GPUs, Broadcom sees its biggest opportunity in providing custom chips and networking infrastructure for these hyperscalers building AI at unprecedented scale.\nWhy Did JPMorgan Upgrade Broadcom Stock? JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur pointed to the continued surge in capital expenditure by hyperscalers and the consequent rise in demand for ASIC chips as key drivers for Broadcom’s growth.\nBroadcom reported Q4 2025 revenue of $18.02 billion, up 28% year over year. The semiconductor segment jumped 35% to $11.07 billion, while the high-margin infrastructure software segment grew 19% to $6.94 billion.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, Broadcom’s revenue hit $63.9 billion, a 24% increase driven overwhelmingly by AI, which saw revenue grow 65% year-over-year to $20 billion.\nBut here’s where it gets really interesting: Broadcom forecasts its AI business will hit $8.2 billion in Q1 2026 alone, marking roughly 100% year-over-year growth. And Tan revealed that his compensation package tied to 2030 targets includes achieving AI revenue over $120 billion — a sixfold increase from the $20 billion generated in fiscal 2025.\nOne customer prospect turned into over $10 billion in orders expected in the second half of fiscal 2026—a major driver behind this is that Broadcom designs and manufactures Google’s custom TPU chips, a specialized ASIC built specifically for AI tasks rather than general-purpose computing (GPU). Google’s latest TPUv7 chip is performing better than expected and attracting major customers like Anthropic and Meta, with Anthropic alone committing to potentially 1 million units.\n\nWall Street Doubled Down Many investors have been trying to make the most of the AI trade, but when AVGO dipped over 27% in Q1 2025 — hitting a yearly low of $138 in April — that was a green light for some of Wall Street’s most famous money managers.\nThese investors spotted what Michael Burry later articulated in his new Substack: while 40%-50% of hyperscaler spending goes to Nvidia GPUs with “ever shorter product cycles,” Broadcom is positioned differently.\n\nBurry specifically named Broadcom alongside Google, Amazon, and Microsoft as “very well-funded” and capable of challenging Nvidia’s dominance.\nMajor Q1 2025 buyers included:\nJeremy Grantham (GMO): Bought over 1.5 million shares despite calling AI a bubble. His fund holds a $291 million position in Broadcom versus just $21 million in Nvidia — nearly 14x more exposure to AVGO than NVDA.\nRenaissance Technologies: Purchased over 2.4 million shares, massively increasing its stake. Regarded as the most successful hedge fund of all time, Renaissance’s bet signals strong conviction in Broadcom’s differentiated positioning.\nTwo Sigma Advisors: Bought around 2.5 million shares, bringing its total position to 3.9 million shares — the largest holding since Q3 2024 when Broadcom traded at just $159 versus Q1’s average of $211.\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio): Added 280,000 shares, betting that Broadcom’s custom ASIC strategy offers structural advantages over commodity GPU manufacturers.\n\nThe stock has since recovered to around $330. While Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting hit other AI stocks, Broadcom’s $73 billion backlog of multi-year contracts with just 7-10 customers provides revenue certainty that short-cycle GPU sales can’t match.\nIs Broadcom a Buy? Broadcom stock has pulled back from December highs near $415 to around $330. If you’ve been on the sidelines, here are three bullish indicators worth considering:\n1. The structural moat is different. While Nvidia sells commodity GPUs facing shorter product cycles and growing competition, Broadcom has locked in $73 billion in backlog with just 7-10 hyperscaler customers through multi-year custom chip contracts. These aren’t off-the-shelf components that competitors can easily replicate.\n\n2. Wall Street’s smartest money doubled down. Renaissance Technologies, Jeremy Grantham, Two Sigma, and Ray Dalio all bought aggressively when the stock dipped in Q1. Grantham holds 14 times more Broadcom than Nvidia despite calling AI a bubble, betting that custom ASICs offer better risk-adjusted returns than merchant chip sales.\n3. Broadcom (mostly) dodged the Burry selloff. Michael Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting triggered the recent tech selloff, but he specifically named Broadcom as well-positioned to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. The company’s custom chip focus sidesteps the depreciation and replacement cycle concerns hitting pure-play GPU manufacturers.\nThe stock trades at 61x earnings, but with 100% AI revenue growth and signed contracts providing multi-year visibility, Broadcom offers a differentiated AI infrastructure play built on structural advantages rather than pure momentum and hype.\nOn the date of publication, Justin Estes did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Prediction: These 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks Could Be Worth More Than Palantir by 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 3:05 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nAMD\n\nCRM\n\nKey Points Palantir's valuation levels are far too high.\nAMD believes it can grow at a rapid pace.\nSalesforce's stock is reasonably priced for the growth it provides.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nPalantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) has been on a remarkable run since the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race began in 2023. Its stock is up over 2,700% since 2023, and has doubled in each year since then.\n\nHowever, there is a bit of a problem with Palantir's stock. It has become drastically overvalued, and I think it could be ripe for a pullback in 2026, opening the door to other companies to surge past it.\nTwo AI companies that could be larger than Palantir by the end of 2026 are AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) . Palantir currently sports a $435 billion market cap , while AMD and Salesforce are much smaller at $343 billion and $250 billion, respectively. Through a combination of these stocks rising and Palantir's falling, I think the order could be shaken up in 2026.\nWhy is Palantir overvalued? As mentioned, Palantir's stock has risen by over 2,700% since 2023. However, its revenue is only up a mere 104%. That's because investors are willing to pay more for Palantir's stock now than they were three years ago. There is a limit to how much investors should be willing to pay, and Palantir is well beyond that threshold.\nAt 120 times sales and 254 times forward earnings, Palantir is among the most expensive stocks in the market. These levels also convey massive growth expectations that Palantir may not be able to live up to. As a result, I think a large pullback may be coming in 2026, as these levels are impossible to sustain unless Palantir's growth rate continues to accelerate.\n\nI think Palantir's growth rate will moderate in 2026, which will send investors running. That opens the door for AMD and Salesforce, as each is slated to have a strong 2026 as well, but at a much more reasonable price tag.\nThe case for AMD AMD has played second fiddle to Nvidia throughout the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) and the technology that supports them aren't nearly as advanced as Nvidia's, although that gap is starting to close. Management is bullish about its progress over the next few years and has released a bold projection for its business through 2030. They believe that their data center revenue growth rate will be around a 60% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR).\n\nThat's a huge step forward compared to Q3's 22% growth rate, and if AMD can deliver on these expectations, there's no doubt it will be a strong stock pick for 2026 and beyond. AMD isn't all data center computing, and its other two segments are expected to deliver a 10% CAGR. Overall, that will lead to a 35% CAGR through 2030, but that will be plenty to push AMD to become an excellent pick.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD's valuation isn't cheap at 11 times sales and 54 times forward earnings, but it's far more reasonable than Palantir's. If Palantir stumbles and AMD stays steady, AMD should be a larger company by the end of 2026.\nThe case for Salesforce Salesforce has advertised its AI prowess, but has yet to see huge impacts in its financials. Salesforce is the industry leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software, and has saturated the market. It isn't easy to acquire new customers when you're only able to grow at the pace of the broader economy, so Salesforce has to create new products and upsell existing clients.\nAlthough its revenue growth has struggled to cross the double-digit mark, its diluted earnings per share (EPS) have been phenomenal. This is a sign of a maturing business and has also brought Salesforce's valuation to a reasonable level. The stock trades for 22 times forward earnings, making it the cheapest stock on this list.\n\nIf Palantir stumbles due to high expectations and Salesforce continues chugging along with incremental growth, I wouldn't be surprised to see Salesforce at a higher market cap than Palantir by the end of 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now? Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after investor optimism around artificial intelligence fueled broad market gains. Technology stocks with a focus on artificial intelligence once again led the market higher, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500.\nCompanies at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, saw significant jumps in their share prices. The rally reflects a renewed belief among investors in the transformative potential of AI technology to drive future growth and productivity.\n\nThe rally was further supported by a surprise cooling in the November consumer price index (CPI) report, which triggered market pricing for additional rate cuts in the coming year. This created a more favorable environment for growth-oriented companies.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\nProcessors and Graphics Chips company AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 6.8%.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 4.3% on the news that investors rotated out of AI-linked high-flyers following underwhelming earnings updates from Oracle and Broadcom as the core thesis shifted from \"growth at any cost\" to \"prove the returns.\"\n\nOracle triggered the alarm by missing revenue estimates while simultaneously hiking capital expenditures by $15 billion. This reignited fears that AI infrastructure spending is outpacing actual monetization. Broadcom compounded the anxiety; despite beating earnings, its stock fell as CFO Kirsten Spears cautioned that gross margins may come under pressure as product mix shifts further toward system-level AI sales. This sparked a macro rotation away from AI infrastructure and power plays. High-valuation names like AMD, Vertiv, and Bloom Energy fell as markets looked to sectors that can benefit from the recent Fed rate cut and a resilient economy.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD is up 77.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $214.30 per share, it is still trading 18.9% below its 52-week high of $264.33 from October 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,299.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

We're digging into all of this in today's options pit, sponsored by Tasty trade.\n00:15 Speaker A\nAnd Henry Schwartz, CBOE Vice President of Market Intelligence is here to discuss. Uh, let's talk about this surge in options demand. We were just talking offline. You said it's up what three times since uh COVID?\n00:32 Henry Schwartz\nYeah.\n00:33 Speaker A\nThat is incredible. So, what is this trend tell you?\n00:36 Henry Schwartz\nSo, I mean, this year we're going to see 15 billion option contracts trade. Uh if you go back to to just before COVID, it was about 4 billion contracts a year. So, and in fact, I've been doing the calculations. It looks like the 15 billionth contract will trade on Christmas Eve.\n00:52 Speaker A\nMhm.\n00:52 Henry Schwartz\nI think we should have a door prize or something. Let's see if we can figure out what trade.\n00:56 Speaker A\nThere might be some binary option futures betting markets that could uh take care of that.\n01:00 Henry Schwartz\nAbsolutely. Well, I mean, that that's actually kind of one of the big themes, right? As we've seen this the evolution of risk taking, betting, you know, there's a lot of different ways to discuss it. Um, you know, the the you know, COVID really or you know, that whole kind of market environment really changed the landscape for options trading. And basically, uh we saw growth of about 50% in 2020 and it has kept up and it is retail that is really driving most of that. You know, we continue to see, you know, a healthy institutional business. Uh we see, you know, we see, you know, the the big theme really for this year is kind of everything is just stronger. Across the board, no matter what asset classes you look at, if you're talking about index options like SPX or VIX. If you're talking about ETF options, which you know, we were just talking about kind of the explosion in in number of ETFs and single stock option flow, which is really, you know, primarily retail driven. And when you have a year like, you know, like we're seeing this year with, you know, basically the broad averages up, you know, between 15 and 20%, uh that just brings in more and more activity.\n02:08 Speaker A\nSo, I've been thinking about this and tell me if I'm just way offline here. But if we take it back to early late 2020, early 2021, that's when we had the whole Reddit GameStop phenomenon going on. Arguably, a lot of it was fueled with the stimulus checks, the stimmies. and next year is going to be a blockbuster record year for fiscal stimulus. Um there's going to be a lot of tax refunds and I'm just wondering, is there any way we could have some kind of a repeat of that, maybe not to the same extent, but do you think that we just get another surge, um perhaps just because people have more money to play with?\n02:46 Henry Schwartz\nI I mean, I think you have you have a lot of dynamics going on at the same time. You know, we do have a a a rate, you know, the rates are going down in the cycle, but you also do have some concerns about the labor market, you have concerns about, you know, just fundamental valuations. So there's a little bit of push and pull. I think, you know, that the the COVID situation and you know, zero interest rates and stimulus and meme stock, uh that that was such a perfect storm of just kind of\n03:28 Speaker A\nAgreed, perfect storm.\n03:29 Henry Schwartz\nexplosive bullish activity and and and retail were able to capitalize on it. You know, in a large part because they were at home and they kind of had the freedom to trade. You also had commissions that basically gone to zero just leading into that. So, everything came together and you know, a lot of these traders found each other and learned from each other on Reddit and on, you know, social media. Uh I don't know if 2026 is going to be quite the same. I think there's a little bit more kind of back and forth. Uh but you know, at least in terms of the options activity, you know, we continue to see new brokerage firms coming uh online. We see the existing brokerage firms, you know, innovating and and rolling out new platforms and doing some really interesting things. So, you know, I see the business, at least in the options world continuing to to do very, very well. And you know, in terms of assets, uh you know, I think that you have this environment now where, you know, the US has had an amazing run and there's a lot of people that say, oh, you know, I don't know, this is getting a little bit tired. Uh but at the same time, you you you know, every time we have a dip, uh,\n04:36 Speaker A\nAnd that's arguably better for options traders. I mean, option traders like volatility. I I I want to make sure we get to a couple other things here. The other is the rise of zero-dated options. And so that just gives more opportunities. Back in the day, you only had monthlies, so you had to wait every month. Then we had weeklies, then basically we have dailies now. And that has just increased uh this volume of options. Talk to me about some of the other innovations. I know CBOE has a bunch of new products, too.\n05:08 Henry Schwartz\nYeah, so the so we pioneered the zero DTE or the daily option option cycle starting 2022 and those are now about 2/3 of the activity uh in SPX and um and some of the big ETFs. Uh and there there's no signs of that slowing down. Uh we just rolled out the Mag 10 index, which is the Mag 7 plus uh Broadcom, uh AMD and Palantir. And you know, those 10 symbols together do about a third of the single stock option. Out of almost 4,000 single stocks. So you you can see how concentrated it is. That's what the trader, that's what the investing public really, really is interested in. They're following the stories, they're getting in and getting out of these stocks. And so the Mag 10 index which launched about a month ago, I'm very proud to say I was the very first trade in in Mag 10. and that option expired today and I made a little bit of money at it. Uh we actually have daily options coming in those just uh in two weeks. So that's, you know, and that's new, right? This this is the first time that that there's been a uh an index that's not quite as broad-based with the daily options on it as well. So, um you know, there's you know, the the industry just continues to keep innovating. You know, we see a lot of work going on in complex order execution, which is you know, basically about a third of the activity is customers trading one option against another, vertical spreads, calendar spreads, exactly. Uh and that you know, CBOE and all the other exchanges continue to kind of take steps to make that uh easier to do, add functionality. You can now trade flex options versus listed options, which is a kind of a special option that lets people pick their own expiration date and um and strike price and even exercise style.\n06:56 Speaker A\nAll right, Henry, we got to leave it there, but congratulations on your Mag 10 trade. I hope it pretends a bullish 2026. Thanks for joining us in studio here.\n07:05 Henry Schwartz\nAwesome.\n07:06 Speaker A\nAll right, we'll\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Revenue fell 28% in 2015, primarily due to declining processor sales, and the company posted a net loss of $660 million that year.\nHowever, in May 2015, AMD announced a new multi-year strategy focused on high-performance gaming, immersive platforms, and data center products. And investors who believed in the company's vision have seen incredible results.\nThe growth of a $10,000 investment in AMD Over the last 10 years, AMD's share price has risen by 8,710% (as of Dec. 16, 2025). If you'd invested $10,000 in AMD stock 10 years ago, your shares would now be worth a staggering $881,310. A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) , on the other hand, would be worth $33,210 -- still a great return, but not the life-changing results of AMD's stock.\n\nAMD's success is an example of why a company's management is such an important consideration when evaluating stocks. Lisa Su, who became president and CEO in October 2014, guided AMD's focus to high-growth areas and diversified its product line so it wasn't overly dependent on PC product sales.\nFor most investors, putting $10,000 into a company during the early stages of a comeback is too risky. However, AMD has continued to reward more recent investors as well. Over the last six months, it's up 79%. Considering it's now one of the leading artificial intelligence (AI) companies, providing CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing solutions, it also looks like a good pick to keep outperforming the market.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now? Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "US Reopens China's Door to Nvidia Chips--But Risks Undermining Its AI Edge\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:01 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nPolicy shifts in Washington have reopened a sensitive debate around Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and the balance between commercial opportunity and national security in advanced semiconductors. Earlier this month, the White House granted Nvidia permission to resume shipments of its H200 artificial intelligence chips to China, while also loosening restrictions on Intel and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ). Although the H200 is not Nvidia's most advanced product, it remains meaningfully ahead of Chinese-made alternatives. Research cited from the Institute for Progress suggests the H200 delivers 32% more processing power and 50% more memory bandwidth than Huawei's Ascend 910C, while also being cheaper to operate and more reliable, reinforcing its appeal for AI model training and deployment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nSupporters of the decision argue the policy could help slow China's domestic chip development by keeping Chinese customers dependent on US technology, while preserving revenue streams that US firms could reinvest into future semiconductor innovation. They point to concerns that Huawei may be closing the gap by linking more chips together and potentially expanding production next year. However, Commerce Department estimates indicate Huawei is expected to produce about 200,000 Ascend chips this year, compared with roughly 14 million AI chips deployed by US companies, raising questions about whether domestic supply can meaningfully satisfy Chinese demand. Under the current framework, companies must still apply for licenses to import H200s, and US officials have indicated the government would take a 25% cut of any such sales.\n\nCritics caution that allowing H200 exports could gradually chip away at what remains the US's largest advantage in AI: aggregate computing power. As of mid-2025, the US accounted for nearly three-quarters of global AI supercomputer capacity, compared with about 14% for China, a gap seen as critical for training frontier models. There is concern that Chinese authorities could direct imported H200s toward leading firms and, through civilian channels, into defense-related research, potentially accelerating advances in both commercial AI and military applications. With bipartisan support in Congress for tighter controls, lawmakers are expected to scrutinize the administration's assumptions on Huawei's progress and weigh testimony from AI developers and cloud providers on whether the current approach strengthens, or possibly undermines, long-term US competitiveness in artificial intelligence.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Both stocks have performed well in 2025, led by AMD, which is up more than 70% year to date, as of this writing, compared to about a 45% gain for Broadcom.\nThe question, though, is which stock will perform better in 2026. Let's look at the case for both stocks.\nThe case for AMD AMD is the distant No. 2 player in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market behind Nvidia. However, the company has carved out a nice niche in inference, where price-per-inference costs are more important than raw computing power, given its ongoing nature, and where Nvidia's CUDA software moat isn't quite as wide. Importantly, inference is also eventually expected to become a much larger market than training over time.\n\nMicrosoft has already been working on a toolkit to convert CUDA software code to AMD's ROCm in order to use more of AMD's GPUs for inference. Meanwhile, the company struck a partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of GPUs, beginning with 1 gigawatt next year. As part of the deal, OpenAI is also taking a stake in AMD through warrants that vest based on deployment milestones. It also has a deal with Saudi Arabian company Humain.\nGPUs are not AMD's only business, however. The company is also the leading provider of central processing units (CPUs), both in computers and in the data center. While GPUs provide the muscle, CPUs act as the brain. The market isn't as large as the one for GPUs, but it is growing quickly, and AMD has been taking share in the data center space.\n\nThe case for Broadcom Broadcom is attacking the AI chip market much differently than Nvidia and AMD. Instead of making GPUs, the company helps customers design custom AI ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). These are preprogrammed chips that are hardwired for specific tasks, and as such, they can both perform better and be more energy efficient.\n\nBroadcom helped Alphabet develop its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which have led to other big hyperscalers (owners of massive data centers) becoming customers. It has said its three furthest along customers could be a more than $60 billion opportunity in its fiscal year 2027 (ending October 2027), and a fourth customer, Anthropic, has placed a $21 billion order for Alphabet's TPUs that it will fulfill.\n\nStory Continues\nIn addition, Broadcom is working with OpenAI, and it will deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to be completed before the end of 2029. There have also been reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on developing its own custom AI chips and that they could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nBroadcom also has a strong networking portfolio, which consists of components, such as Ethernet switches and routers, that help transfer data and distribute AI workloads across servers. This business has also been booming, given the ongoing data center build-out.\nThe verdict Both AMD and Broadcom trade at similar valuations. AMD has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 32 times next year's analyst estimates, while Broadcom trades at around 33.5 times its fiscal-year 2026 estimates (ending October 2026). As such, which stock outperforms will likely come down to their growth next year, as well as future expectations.\n\nI think both stocks can once again have strong performances in 2026, but I think Broadcom will be the stock that will outperform. The company just has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it over the next few years with custom chips. The custom chip business requires high upfront costs, so these are multiyear commitments, usually for large projects. Many of these deals are already in place (as seen in its $73 billion backlog), and now it just has to deliver.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Sterling Infrastructure and Taylor Morrison have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:38 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: STRL\n\nTMHC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nMU\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 19, 2025 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL , as the Bull of the Day and Taylor Morrison Home Corporation TMHC, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on &mdash; Micron Technology, Inc. MU, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all three stocks:\nBull of the Day: Sterling Infrastructure , Inc. is a leading U.S. infrastructure company that&rsquo;s become an under-the-radar Wall Street star over the past five years, posting massive growth on the back of converging megatrends.\nSterling is benefiting from the artificial intelligence data center boom, reshoring, energy industry expansion, and big spending across traditional infrastructure segments, such as roads and beyond.\n\nThe U.S. infrastructure standout, which already more than doubled its earnings between 2021 and 2024, is projected to nearly double its EPS again from 2024 to 2026 on the back of strong sales growth.\nSTRL&rsquo;s impressive upward earnings revisions trend earns it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). And it launched a new $400 million stock repurchase plan in November.\nThe AI infrastructure-boosted stock has soared over 80% in 2025 as part of a huge ~1,500% run in the last five years. Yet investors can buy the stock around 25% below its November records as it looks to find support at a key technical range.\nBuy Soaring AI Infrastructure Stock STRL Now and Hold Sterling is a Texas-based infrastructure standout that specializes in heavy civil and site development projects across three main segments: E-Infrastructure, Transportation, and Building Solutions. The firm focuses on the first phase of construction, from site selection to planning and site prep. Sterling boasts that it can &ldquo;scale to meet any size project.&rdquo;\n\nThe company&rsquo;s E-Infrastructure Solutions unit operates across large-scale site work for data centers, e-commerce warehouses, manufacturing, and energy. Its Transportation Solutions space, as the name suggests, is focused on highways, bridges, airports, rail, and more. Sterling&rsquo;s Building Solutions segment is centered around foundations and more for homes, parking structures, and commercial buildings.\nSterling is capitalizing on compounding megatrends across the U.S. that are just beginning. The company is riding long-term multi-decade upside across the AI data center boom and the rapid energy and grid expansion that&rsquo;s needed to support the AI age.\nOn top of that, the U.S. is reshoring critical industries such as semiconductor manufacturing and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on traditional infrastructure such as bridges and roads after decades of neglect.\n\nStory Continues\nThe firm is ready to grow directly from expansion across &ldquo;Mission&ndash;Critical Markets: Data Centers, Next Generation Manufacturing, Semiconductor Fabrication.&rdquo;\nInfrastructure Stock STRL&rsquo;s Huge Growth Upside STRL is landing &ldquo;mission-critical projects, including data centers and manufacturing.&rdquo; The company posted a huge beat-and-raise third quarter in early November, topping our Zacks EPS estimate by 25% and providing another round of strong guidance.\nIt also flexed its financial muscles and upside to shareholders by authorizing a new $400 million stock repurchase program. This backdrop is why all four brokerage recommendations Zacks has are &ldquo;Strong Buys.&rdquo;\n\nIt grew its signed backlog 34% YoY to $2.6 billion. &ldquo;With the addition of CEC, the aggregate of our combined backlog and high-probability future phase work gives us visibility into a pool of work totaling more than $4 billion,&rdquo; CEO Joe Cutillo said in prepared comments.\nSterling is projected to grow its revenue by 13% in 2025 and 19% next year to reach $2.84 billion, after averaging 14% revenue growth in the trailing five years.\nBetter yet, it is projected to expand its adjusted earnings by 71% this year and 15% next year to nearly double its bottom line from $6.10 in FY24 to $11.95 share in 2026.\nThe growth-heavy infrastructure company&rsquo;s earnings estimates have surged by 9% for 2025 and 2026 since its Q3 release to earn Sterling a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The recent positivity extends its impressive run of upward EPS revisions.\n\nIt&rsquo;s also worth stressing that STRL grew its GAAP earnings from $1.50 a share in 2020 to $8.28 in 2024.\nBuy this Market-Crushing Stock on the Dip for Upside and Value STRL has skyrocketed ~1,500% in the past five years to blow away its industry&rsquo;s 145% and the S&P 500&rsquo;s 85%. This is part of a much larger surge over the past 25 years. Sterling shares have climbed 80% in 2025, including its 25% drop from its early November records.\nThe stock jumped 7% on Thursday as the market and the broader AI everything trade rebounded after a mid-week selloff. It found buyers at the critical level highlighted in blue below.\n\nSterling trades around 35% below its average Zacks price target. The recent 25% pullback, mixed with its strong earnings outlook, has it trading not too far above its industry and the S&P 500 (both around 22.8X) at 25X forward 12-month earnings. This marks impressive value considering STRL has crushed both over the last five and 25 years.\nBear of the Day: Taylor Morrison Home Corporation is a national land developer and homebuilder giant that&rsquo;s seen its earnings revisions tumble over the last year based on a multitude of headwinds.\nTMHC&rsquo;s recent negative earnings per share (EPS) revisions earn the homebuilder a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The company&rsquo;s near-term outlook remains strained, given the industry and economy-wide setbacks it is facing.\n\nShould Investors Stay Away from TMHC Stock for Now? Taylor Morrison is one of the largest U.S. homebuilders. The Scottsdale, Arizona-headquartered firm designs, builds, and sells single-family homes, ranging from first-time/entry-level to move-up and luxury/resort-style. TMHC posted booming revenue growth between 2013 and 2022, highlighted by 29% expansion in 2020 and 22% growth in 2021.\n\nThe wild Covid-driven housing boom created a massive pull forward across the home-buying market. The market also benefited from a buyer-friendly low mortgage rate environment.\nThe housing market has cooled significantly since then as home prices and mortgage rates soared.\nTaylor Morrison is projected to see its revenue fall 2.4% in 2025 and then fade 6.5% next year. Its adjusted earnings are expected to drop 5.5% and 12.5%, respectively.\nThe company&rsquo;s earnings estimate has dropped 21% for Q4 since its last report and 13% for 2026. TMHC&rsquo;s downbeat earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and extend its downward run that began in late 2024.\nThat said, the homebuilder&rsquo;s long-term outlook likely remains firmly intact given the dire need for more housing inventory in the U.S. &ldquo;Encouragingly, net absorption paces improved each month during the quarter, in contrast to typical seasonal slowing into the end of summer as the improvement in mortgage interest rates helped spur activity,&rdquo; CEO Sheryl Palmer said in prepared Q3 remarks in October.\n\n&ldquo;Going forward, we believe strengthened consumer confidence is critical to further stabilizing demand, especially for discretionary home purchase decisions in our move-up and resort lifestyle communities.&rdquo;\nIn the near term, persistently high mortgage rates could continue to suppress demand, leading to slower home sales, increased cancellations, and pressure on margins if TMHC is forced to rely more on incentives to move inventory.\nTaylor Morrison doesn&rsquo;t pay a dividend, and its Building Products - Home Builders industry is in the bottom 10% of 240 Zacks industries. This is worth stressing since studies have shown that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to a stock's industry group.\nInvestors might want to stay away from Taylor Morrison for now since the housing market remains under stress.\n\nAdditional content:\nMicron's Blowout Earnings: The Best AI Stock for 2026? As 2026 draws closer, investors are actively seeking stocks poised to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Micron Technology, Inc. stands out given its recent strong quarterly results. So, does the stock offer an attractive buying opportunity for the year ahead?\nLet&rsquo;s see in detail &ndash;\n\nMicron's Blowout Earnings Highlight AI-Driven Growth Micron recently reported strong fiscal first-quarter 2026 results, reassuring investors that demand for its products has strengthened significantly. Micron's revenues for the quarter came in at $13. 64 billion, up 56.8% from the same period a year ago, according to investors. micron.com. Wall Street analysts had expected Micron's sales to come in around $ 12.88 billion.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, all four of Micron's business segments posted revenue growth, led by its core cloud memory business unit, which reported sales of $5.28 billion, up a whopping 99.5%. This robust performance helped boost Micron's profitability, with non-GAAP net income reaching $5.48???billion, or $4.78 per diluted share, well above analysts&rsquo; expectations of $3.94.\nSoaring demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips has been a major driver of the company's stellar quarterly performance. HBM chips, which enable high-speed data processing and reduce power consumption, remain in short supply due to the AI infrastructure boom, which is why they are in high demand.\nSanjay Mehrotra, Micron's CEO, said that &ldquo;the growth in AI data center capacity is driving a significant increase in demand for high-performance and high-capacity memory and storage.&rdquo; He noted that demand for server units has risen significantly and is expected to remain strong through 2026.\n\nMicron expects even stronger results in fiscal second-quarter 2026, with revenues projected between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) ranging from $8.22 to $8.62. The company already reported a record free cash flow of $3.9 billion in fiscal first-quarter 2026, providing ample funds to support future growth initiatives.\nMicron's Record Earnings Make It a Leading AI Stock for 2026 Rising AI-driven demand for Micron's HBM chips has not only helped the company deliver a strong quarter but is also expected to drive the company's growth momentum further into 2026. This positions Micron as one of the most compelling AI stocks to buy for 2026.\nLest we forget, Micron supplies HBM chips to NVIDIA Corporation as well as to its rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. , ensuring strong demand for its products even if NVIDIA's competitive edge weakens. Thus, Micron's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 23.9%. The company's $19.85 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 80.9% year over year.\n\nMicron currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Why This AI Stock Could Outperform Nvidia Over the Next 5 Years\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Nvidia is sold out of cloud GPUs.\nAMD and Broadcom could take market share from it in the data center segment.\nAll three chipmakers outsource much of their manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has led the artificial intelligence (AI) investing sector since 2023. While 2025 hasn't been quite as good a year for its shareholders as the previous two were, the stock is still up around 30% year to date. The chipmaker is still a dominant force in the AI realm, but observers are raising the possibility that its competitors could start taking meaningful market share away from it.\nShould Nvidia start to lose its edge over the competition, it may no longer be the best AI stock to own. But over the next five years, which stock could overtake it?\nDifferent approaches to the AI computing problem Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , which are computing units that can process many thousands of calculations in parallel. This makes them perfectly suited for tasks that require a lot of computing power and that can be broken down into many smaller tasks that can be handled independently. Most artificial intelligence workloads fall into that category. Nvidia's GPUs have been the most popular parallel processors available since before the AI infrastructure buildout started in 2023, but that may change.\n\nOne issue Nvidia is having right now is that demand is outpacing its supply. In its earnings release for its fiscal 2026 third quarter (which ended Oct. 26), CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. While some may view this as a good problem to have, I think it's a bit of an issue. Its clients' needs for AI accelerator chips aren't going to decrease just because Nvidia can't fully supply them. Instead, they are going to look for alternative solutions.\nThat could open up the door for competing chipmakers to steal some significant market share, particularly if buyers find that the alternative products provide similar performance with lower costs. Two chipmakers that appear poised to benefit are AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) .\n\nAMD is a direct competitor to Nvidia, as it also makes GPUs. It recently forecast that it would grow its data center revenue at a 60% compound annual rate over the next five years. For reference, its data center division's revenue growth was a mere 22% during Q3. For AMD to grow as fast as predicted, it will need to eat into Nvidia's market share, which it already might be doing.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom is taking a different approach to the AI computing problem. Rather than designing another general-purpose GPU, it's partnering directly with hyperscalers to design custom AI computing units -- called application-specific integrated circuits -- that meet their precise needs. Among the best examples of these chips are Alphabet 's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nTPUs and other custom AI computing units aren't designed to handle a wide variety of workloads like GPUs are. However, when these computing units only see the one type of workload that they are configured for, they can deliver higher performance at lower costs. The trade-off of lower price and higher performance for less flexibility is a no-brainer for many data center operators, and Broadcom's approach could eat into Nvidia's market share as AI workloads become more streamlined.\nThese companies have the potential to steal some of Nvidia's market share over the next five years, but all the chip designers all have one thing in common.\nTaiwan Semiconductor will rise regardless of which chip designers are winning None of these companies fabricates its computing units in-house. Instead, the \"fabless\" chipmakers outsource that work to a handful of other companies that specialize in fabrication. In the chip production realm, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) captures nearly all of the highest-end work. It's not only the largest chip manufacturer by revenue in the world, but also a leader in its ability to deliver the most advanced chips. Broadcom, AMD, and Nvidia often work with Taiwan Semiconductor for their cutting-edge chips, and that's unlikely to change in the future, as that industry is nearly impossible to disrupt.\n\nWith Nvidia projecting between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in data center infrastructure spending by 2030, all three of these fabless chip companies could have a significant market opportunity to capture. I'm not sure which will be the ultimate winner among them. Still, I know that TSMC will be a winner regardless, giving it a strong chance of outperforming Nvidia over the next five years, particularly if Nvidia loses a meaningful amount of market share to its peers.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "The top 10 trending tickers of 2025 on Yahoo Finance\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Jared Blikre\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nSMCI\n\nPLTR\n\nAMD\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Palantir ( PLTR ) are some of the top-viewed ticker pages on Yahoo Finance in 2025.\nYahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre , who also hosts Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast , examines the 10 most popular ticker pages on Yahoo Finance, with AI names dominating the list, with the exception of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ).\nCatch more Stocks in Translation , with new episodes every Tuesday and Thursday.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:04 Speaker A\n2025 has been a year of surprises. At the outset, many pros were doubting that year three of this bull market could match the outside gains of the prior two.\n00:13 Speaker A\nBut the AI trade keeps driving attention and driving behavior. And on today's stocks in translation, we're not looking at the best performers of 2025. We are looking at the names that you, the viewers, checked in on the most on the Yahoo Finance platform. And we're breaking down our top 10 trending tickers of 2025.\n00:32 Speaker A\nSo let's take a look at the scores on the door. and here we got the top 10 tickers. The first thing you might notice is that this is an AI dominated list with maybe Bitcoin in the middle as the exception.\n00:46 Speaker A\nThen you're going to see the perennial favorites, uh that's Nvidia and Tesla to the left there. They are in a different zip code. Our Nvidia quote page has a cool quarter billion page views this year, while Tesla clocks in at over 180 million.\n01:03 Speaker A\nAnd while Apple is usually top three, it was edged out this year by Palantir with nearly 100 million views. And from there things stabilize as AMD, Amazon, Bitcoin, Meta, Super Micro and Intel, they all clocked 40 to 60 million viewers each.\n01:17 Speaker A\nNow, let's take a look at this list from a different perspective. This is our Yahoo Finance heat map and we're looking at the box size right here. So each box size corresponds to the market cap of the company and all of these are large to mega caps with two in the $4 trillion bucket. That would be Nvidia and Apple,\n01:36 Speaker A\nall the way down to Intel over here at 180 billion. and in the far lower right, you almost can't see it there. You can see Super Micro, which is just shy of $20 billion. But the other thing you might notice is that the only losing ticker this year is Bitcoin, although Amazon is pretty close to break even too.\n01:52 Speaker A\nSo each of these has a different story. Now let's dive into some of the charts that really uh tell this story and this is going to be a year-to-date. So we'll start with Nvidia here. This has arguably been the poster child for the entire AI trade and you can see it got kind of sucked into the post liberation day redness there, but it has bounced back strong.\n02:09 Speaker A\nReally hasn't done much over the last few months, but with 30% gains in a year after almost being up, what is it? a thousand percent over the last three years. There you go, 963%. I think investors are going to take that.\n02:19 Speaker A\nNow Tesla. Tesla's really interesting because over the last year, and this is a three-year chart too, it has traced out a cup and handle formation. If it can break above 480, it has the ability to really break out and 2026 could be the year to do this. If it fails at this level, well, maybe it's got to consolidate a little bit longer.\n02:37 Speaker A\nNow, let's take a look at Palantir. This stock is up 2,500% over the last three years. Let's dial down to a year-to-date and you can see like Nvidia, it hasn't really done much over the last few months, but still sitting on 140% year-to-date gains.\n02:50 Speaker A\nNow, Apple year to date, this stock is only up 9%, but it has come back nicely after it just kind of stalled out after the liberation day uh melee where a lot of stocks were taking off, it was going sideways, but it finally caught up over the last few months. and so Apple has been generating recent record highs even as Nvidia has been going sideways.\n03:07 Speaker A\nNow here's AMD to round out the top five, 71% year to date. This is a very volatile stock, but again, I think investors will uh happily hold on to gains like that for a stock like AMD.\n03:16 Speaker A\nNow, Amazon, barely positive for the year. This is a stock you kind of got to look at over this entire three-year bull market. Still up 150%, but this was a year of consolidation. We'll have to see if 2026 breaks to the upside or the downside.\n03:30 Speaker A\nAnd you know what? Bitcoin is a very similar story, sitting on more gains over the last three years, but this has been a year of consolidation. It happens to be down about 10% right now, and 75,000 is a line in the sand that I am watching. I think that gets hit before it takes off again.\n03:44 Speaker A\nThen Meta, this is another three-year story. Uh hasn't done much this year, but we'll have to see if it can continue the trend. 445%, very strong over this bull market.\n03:53 Speaker A\nGetting towards the end here. Super Micro is a very volatile stock and while it's up this year a decent percentage, you can see it was up a lot more in early 2024. So this is one of those high beta plays you got to trade with caution, but guess what, the Yahoo Finance audience loves to day trade this stock.\n04:06 Speaker A\nAnd finally here's Intel. This is another kind of uh sine wave pattern here. Let me just dial this down to year to date so you can see it has really taken off over the last few months. It's become a volatile stock, but it was doing nothing for the first 6, seven, eight months of the year. So I think investors at the end of the day, at the end of the year going to be pleased with this one.\n04:24 Speaker A\nSo let us dial it back down here. I got a few things that are going to tell us what to watch in 2026. So just think of these as the questions that move these tickers. First is the AI spend payback test. Investors are going to want to see the revenue and not just the profits of these uh companies, not just the spending.\n04:42 Speaker A\nAnd the next up is margins versus Mega Cap spending. Can these giants keep growing without the profit engine getting dented? Third, keep an eye on the chip cycle inflection point. Does demand for semiconductors, does it broaden out or is it just stay limited to AI?\n04:59 Speaker A\nFourth, watch those crypto regulation headlines. 2025 was arguably the best year ever for crypto regulation and Bitcoin isn't even positive. So let's see if sentiment can shift. And finally, monitor those rate cuts versus the real economy. If we get more cuts, ask why. Is it a soft landing scenario or are we sinking into recession?\n05:17 Speaker A\nBottom line, these were the tickers investors just could not stop watching in 2025. Next year, what matters is whether the stories hold up and that's where the rubber meets the road. And tune into the Stocks and Translation podcast for more jargon busting deep dives.

      "Content": "NVDA Stock Price Prediction: Where Nvidia Could Be by 2025, 2026, 2030\n\nAJ Fabino\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:25 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nSOFI\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nAnalysts are saying Nvidia could hit 920.09 dollars by 2030, a projection that has many investors assessing whether NVDA still has room to run after years of explosive gains. If you're bullish and want a simple, low-cost way to invest, SoFi lets you trade Nvidia stock with no commissions, and new users who fund their account can receive up to 1,000 dollars in stock . Plus, anyone who transfers existing investments to SoFi and keeps them there through December 31, 2025, can earn an additional 1 percent bonus, offering even more upside for new investors.\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has evolved from a graphics-chip manufacturer into the backbone of the modern artificial intelligence boom. As companies scale generative AI, autonomous systems and data-intensive cloud applications, Nvidia's GPUs have become central infrastructure powering these technological shifts. After soaring 171 percent in 2024 and adding another 26 percent in 2025, many investors are now weighing whether Nvidia's valuation still leaves enough room for meaningful future gains.\nDon’t Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel could be the next AI powerhouse — join 10,000+ early backers and invest now just $0.81 per share .\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here’s how you can earn passive income with $100 .\n\nThis forecast examines Nvidia's financial standing and uses a structured methodology to outline potential price targets for 2025, 2026 and 2030. By blending analyst sentiment, valuation metrics and algorithmic projections, it offers a clearer picture of where NVDA could be headed both in the near term and over the next decade.\nCurrent Overview Trading above 180 dollars as of October 2025\nMarket Cap: 4.37 trillion dollars\nTrailing P/E Ratio: 51.23\nGross Margins: near 70 percent\nYTD Performance: over 30 percent\nNvidia continues to report exceptional fundamentals, driven largely by its data center division, which remains the company's strongest revenue engine thanks to global AI demand from major technology firms and enterprise cloud platforms. Gross margins remain robust, earnings consistently exceed expectations and the company's leadership role in high-performance computing continues to set it apart from competitors.\n\nInvestor sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive. Out of 48 analysts, 43 rate Nvidia as a Buy or Strong Buy, reflecting strong confidence in its long-term prospects. The average 12-month price target sits around 209.97 dollars, with projections ranging from 100 dollars on the low end to 250 dollars on the high end. Still, valuation concerns linger, along with fears that competition from AMD, Intel and new AI-focused players could chip away at Nvidia's premium positioning.\n\nStory Continues\nQuick Snapshot Table of Predictions\n\nYear\nBullish Prediction\nAverage Prediction\nBearish Prediction\n2025\n183.13\n178.84\n173.92\n2026\n308.56\n207.13\n170.15\n2027\n566.89\n442.32\n285.19\n2028\n628.83\n537.29\n396.17\n2029\n873.74\n719.91\n493.76\n2030\n863.77\n799.05\n774.93\n2031\n1029.59\n950.43\n848.77\n2032\n1069.34\n1010.52\n920.01\n2033\n1226.54\n1127.95\n993.88\n2040\n2358.25\n2228.74\n2028.93\n2050\n6367.97\n5786.71\n5596.95\n\nThese forecasts are based on algorithmic modeling by CoinCodex, which assesses historical price movement, volatility cycles and long-term trend behavior across multiple time horizons.\nBull and Bear Case Bull Case The bull case for Nvidia centers on its unparalleled profitability and dominance across the AI supply chain. With net profit margins above 50 percent and gross margins holding near 70 percent, Nvidia remains one of the most financially efficient companies in the tech sector. Institutional support is strong, as shown by the overwhelming majority of Buy-rated analyst recommendations. Valuation multiples such as P/E and forward P/E have eased from their peak levels, suggesting healthier entry points compared to earlier years. Nvidia's low debt profile and consistent free cash flow growth further reinforce the thesis that it will continue to lead long-term AI infrastructure and data center expansion, giving bulls confidence in sustained multiyear upside.\n\nBear Case The bear case focuses on the early signs of slowing growth across key financial indicators. Earnings per share, net income and free cash flow are still rising, but at a noticeably slower rate than their three-year averages. Nvidia's valuation metrics, including PEG ratio, EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA, remain elevated relative to industry competitors, raising concerns that the stock may still be priced for perfection. The company's dividend yield is extremely low and recent growth in dividend payouts has stagnated, limiting appeal for income-driven investors. Bears argue that if financial momentum continues to cool and competition intensifies, Nvidia may struggle to justify the lofty expectations currently embedded in its share price.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction for 2025 Bullish Prediction: 183.13 dollars\nAverage Prediction: 178.84 dollars\nBearish Prediction: 173.92 dollars\nNvidia's 2025 outlook reflects cautious optimism, with modest upside expected if the company continues executing on its AI and data center roadmap. Its premium valuation signals strong confidence from the market, but it also leaves little room for disappointment. Any signs of slowing demand, regulatory pressure or margin compression could trigger volatility in the short term.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction for 2026 Bullish Prediction: 308.56 dollars\nAverage Prediction: 207.13 dollars\nBearish Prediction: 170.15 dollars\nThe 2026 projections suggest that Nvidia's long-term trajectory will depend heavily on its ability to maintain pricing power despite rising competition. Some models anticipate more moderate returns as valuations stabilize and GPU demand normalizes. However, Nvidia's entrenched position across cloud infrastructure and AI-driven enterprise ecosystems may provide resilience even in a cooling market, helping extend its revenue expansion through mid-decade.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction for 2030 Bullish Prediction: 863.77 dollars\nAverage Prediction: 799.05 dollars\nBearish Prediction: 774.93 dollars\nBy 2030, Nvidia's growth story becomes tightly interwoven with the long-term strength of the AI revolution. If demand for accelerated computing continues its upward trajectory and Nvidia sustains leadership in next-generation architectures, the company could see substantial long-term appreciation. Conservative models still show meaningful compounding returns through the end of the decade. However, risks remain, including intensified competition, cyclical demand disruptions and greater regulatory scrutiny surrounding AI hardware.\n\nInvestment Considerations Nvidia remains a quintessential growth stock — a pure play on next-generation computing and AI hardware infrastructure. Institutional ownership is strong, and retail investor enthusiasm remains high, but these factors also reflect elevated expectations built into the current share price. While Nvidia pays a dividend, its yield is negligible, functioning more as an indicator of corporate strength than an income generator.\n\nKey risks include competition from AMD and Intel, the possibility of slowing AI adoption, regulatory headwinds and global supply chain constraints. Still, Nvidia's deep integration into cloud ecosystems, its unmatched GPU leadership and its alignment with long-term technological megatrends make it one of the most compelling — and scrutinized — companies in the global market.\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market When evaluating any stock price forecast, it's wise to think about portfolio balance and not rely on a single company's trajectory. Markets shift quickly, and putting all of your capital into one sector or stock can increase risk. Many investors are turning to platforms that open the door to real estate, professional financial advice, fixed-income products, and even self-directed retirement options. These tools make it easier to diversify, smooth out volatility, and build wealth across multiple asset classes over time.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nRange Wealth Management Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools . Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.\nSee Next:\nThe ‘ChatGPT of marketing' just opened a $0.81 per share round — 10,000+ investors are already in .\nGM-backed EnergyX is tackling the global lithium supply shortage — invest before global expansion at just $10 per share by October 30 .\nThis article NVDA Stock Price Prediction: Where Nvidia Could Be by 2025, 2026, 2030 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Piper Sandler Reiterates Overweight on AMD, Sees AI Catalysts Ahead\n\nGhazal Ahmed\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 12:52 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nMETA\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) is one of the Buzzing AI Stocks on Wall Street. On December 15, Piper Sandler reiterated an “Overweight” rating on the stock with a $280.00 price target.\nThe rating affirmation follows the firm’s pre-quiet period call with AMD, with analysts citing several key AI catalysts working in favor of the stock.\nAMD elaborated that it is allocating a significant amount of resources toward the Helios rack, which is anticipated to launch in the middle of next year.

      "Content": "These AI Stocks Could Surge in December as Momentum Builds\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points The AI hyperscalers are planning on spending a record amount on capital expenditures during 2026.\nNvidia and AMD are sparring for GPU supremacy.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a neutral party in the AI build-out.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWith December rolling toward its close, there are a few stocks that I think could surge before the end of the month. While the market may be growing a bit weary of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade, the reality is that hyperscalers are going to be spending more than ever on AI computing power in 2026. This benefits a handful of companies in an outsized way, and some of those that have already been the biggest winners from that spending are positioned to keep prospering in 2026.\nThree such stocks that I think could surge to end the year are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\nNvidia Nvidia has been a top-performing artificial intelligence stock since the buildout began in 2023. While there have been some impressive technologies developed over the past few years, we've only scratched the surface of what generative AI is capable of. As a result, hyperscalers are planning on record-setting data center capital expenditures in 2026 after setting new spending records in 2025. Nvidia is one of the primary beneficiaries of this spending because its graphics processing units (GPUs) provide a significant chunk of the computing power that goes into these data centers.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are best in class, in part thanks to the technology stack that supports them. It continues to deliver impressive quarter after impressive quarter, and the third quarter of its fiscal 2026 (which ended Oct. 26) was no exception. Revenue rose by 63% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose by 67%. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs was so high that CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs.\nAI data center buildouts aren't expected to slow down anytime in the near future: Nvidia's management believes that by 2030, global data center capital expenditures will reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion. Nvidia may be down a bit heading into 2026, but assuming that the expected spending will occur, it should be an excellent stock to buy now.\n\nAMD AMD hasn't had nearly as much success of Nvidia in the AI arms race. While its GPUs aren't far off in performance from Nvidia's, its supporting technology has lagged, specifically its controlling software. However, AMD has made a few acquisitions and inked some partnerships that have improved its supporting products, and management believes it can turn the company's fortunes around and make a big splash in the AI computing world.\n\nStory Continues\nOver the next five years, management believes the company can grow its data center business at a 60% compound annual growth rate. That would be a massive increase from the 22% growth that segment achieved in its most recently reported quarter. AMD will have a long way to go to prove that it is capable of delivering growth that rivals Nvidia's, but if it can, the stock should perform impressively.\n\nI think the market may start to recognize this shift in fortunes, causing AMD's stock to rise in the last few days of December.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Both Nvidia and AMD design chips, but neither manufactures them in-house. Instead, like many other \"fabless\" chipmakers, they farm that work out to several companies. In the case of the most cutting-edge chips, that work mostly falls to Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's largest chip foundry by revenue. Taiwan Semiconductor is a genius investment because it doesn't matter whether it's Nvidia, AMD, or some other designer offering the best computing solution -- the foundry is still positioned to benefit from their sales. All that really matters to Taiwan Semi is that the AI hyperscalers are spending more and more.\n\nAdmittedly, its status as a neutral player in the AI buildout can limit its overall upside. However, based on the growth projections for the AI infrastructure market, I'd be surprised if Taiwan Semiconductor weren't a top-performing stock over the next five years.\nIt's also much cheaper than the GPU designers, trading at 28 times expected forward earnings.\nI'm a huge fan of Taiwan Semiconductor and its invaluable position in the AI space, and believe the market may reward it heading into 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Does Philippe Laffont Know Something Wall Street Doesn't? The Billionaire Investor Just Sold Nvidia and AMD, and Bought These Other Chip Stocks Instead\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points During the third quarter, Coatue Management reduced its exposure to GPU leaders Nvidia and AMD.\nAt the same time, the firm dramatically increased its stakes in Alphabet and Marvell Technology.\nPhilippe Laffont is making sure his fund has positions across the entire semiconductor landscape.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWithin 45 days of the end of each quarter, every institutional investor managing over $100 million is required to file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings itemize which stocks they bought and sold during that quarter. This provides everyday investors with a glimpse -- though a delayed one -- into what the \"smart money\" on Wall Street is doing.\nDuring the third quarter, Philippe Laffont's firm, Coatue Management, made a number of interesting moves. It trimmed its exposure in semiconductor leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) by 14% and 19%, respectively. In addition, Laffont more than tripled the fund's stakes in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) .\nLet's break down what may have influenced these decisions and assess if Laffont could be onto something big.\nNvidia and AMD dominate the AI chip market Nvidia and AMD are the two leading designers of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most widely used parallel processing chips for training large language models and building generative AI applications.\nThe rise of generative AI has ushered in a wave of unprecedented revenue and profit growth for chip designers. Shares of Nvidia and AMD have skyrocketed by nearly 900% and 200%, respectively, throughout the AI revolution.\nManagement consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting that investment in AI infrastructure will reach nearly $7 trillion over the next five years -- with the majority of that spending allocated toward building data centers and chip procurement.\nWith that in mind, it seems likely that the hyperscalers will continue accelerating their AI capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Given these secular tailwinds, the prospects surrounding Nvidia and AMD appear bright.\n\nThis begs the question: Does Laffont see something the rest of us don't?\nUnderstanding Alphabet and Marvell's positions in the chip market One of the biggest catalysts for Alphabet right now is its cloud infrastructure business. Google Cloud has attracted a number of high-profile customers, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms .\nMoreover, the company's custom-designed AI processors -- which it calls Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- are becoming a key part of the value proposition around its AI ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile GPUs and other specialized parallel processors get most of the attention among AI investors, there's a lot more that goes into a data center. Marvell can provide much of it: The company specializes in designing architecture for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) computing stacks, as well as other networking, security, and storage hardware.\nAs AI workloads become larger and more sophisticated -- requiring enhanced memory and storage processes -- demand for the offerings of players like Marvell should rise further.\nThe bottom line: The semiconductor opportunity is broadening While analysts appear optimistic about Alphabet's TPU business, these chips are heavily geared toward custom applications such as deep learning. Meanwhile, Marvell is carving out its own pocket in the AI realm focused on data centers' memory storage needs.\nIn my view, Laffont's moves during the third quarter look more like a structural mix shift than a reflection of souring sentiment toward AI GPUs. What I mean by that is the billionaire smartly reduced his fund's exposure to general-purpose chip designers such as Nvidia and AMD and rotated capital into other specific segments of the AI space.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a broader point: Laffont still has significant exposure to the GPU market. It's not as if Coatue completely dumped its stakes in Nvidia and AMD.\nDuring the third quarter, he merely increased his bets on other areas of the chip market beyond generic accelerators. The construction of Coatue's portfolio suggests the firm is quite bullish about the continuing expansion of AI infrastructure. It appears that Laffont is trying to capitalize on this trend by building a diversified portfolio around the proliferation of chips and their various applications in AI.\nAt the end of the day, I think building positions in the major players across GPUs, custom chipsets, memory architecture, and more will prove to be a winning investment strategy in the long run.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

(NASDAQ:AMD) to $300 from $350 while keeping an Overweight rating on the stock. The firm says the semiconductor index is set up to lead the broader market after beating the S&P 500 by about 30 points in 2025. Early momentum from the AI buildout is driving demand across computing, networking, memory, and chip equipment, according to the analyst.\n\nShort-term cycles may send mixed signals, but the bigger picture still looks supportive. Cantor points to a steady macro backdrop and what it sees as exponential growth in AI infrastructure spending. That combination, in its view, supports staying long the SOX and keeping above-average exposure to AI-focused names into 2026.\nAt the company level, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has made real progress on software. The Nod.ai acquisition has helped strengthen its ROCm platform, with AMD reporting that downloads have jumped tenfold year over year. Software was a weak spot before, and this shows traction. External support is also lining up.\nIn October, AMD announced a partnership with OpenAI to supply six gigawatts of computing capacity. The deal also includes collaboration on control software, which could further improve AMD’s appeal to large customers.\n\nCompetition remains intense, especially from Nvidia. At its financial analyst day, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) said it expects data center revenue to grow at a 60% compound annual rate through 2030. That would be a sharp step up from the 22% growth posted in the third quarter. Hitting that target would require major AI hyperscalers to adopt AMD’s full technology stack.

      "Content": "Stock Market Today, Dec. 18: Stocks Rise on Better-Than-Expected Inflation Data\n\nEmma Newbery, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:44 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\n^DJI\n\nNVDA\n\nORCL\n\nAMD\n\nStocks rebounded today on cooler November consumer price data. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) rose 0.79% to 6,774.76, the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) climbed 1.38% to 23,006.36 on tech strength, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDEX: ^DJI) edged up 0.14% to 47,951.85.\nMarket movers Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) rallied after stronger-than-expected earnings and an upbeat AI-memory outlook. This also lifted chipmakers and other growth names.\nRecent pressure on large-cap AI leaders such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) , Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) , and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) eased as inflation worries receded.\n\nWhat this means for investors Markets finished in the green today on the back of cooling November inflation . The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7%, lower than the expected 3.1%. This eased fears that stubborn price increases were here to stay, and boosted odds of Fed rate cuts in early 2026.\nThe CPI data, combined with Micron’s upbeat results, calmed recent jitters over AI and tech stocks. Bubble fears have not gone away, but the Nasdaq has erased some of this week's losses and is now up 2.56% in the past month.\n\nOil edged upwards slightly as markets reacted to geopolitical risks in Venezuela and Russia. Prices have hit multi-year lows recently over rising concerns about a so-called \"super glut.\" While supply from major oil projects and record U.S. shale production has increased, demand is falling.\nToday's upturn is good news for investors hoping for a seasonal Santa rally. Upcoming earnings reports will indicate whether it's sustainable.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Michael Burry Asks For Photos Of Warehoused Nvidia GPUs After Analyst Questions Jensen Huang's Blackwell Shipment Numbers (UPDATED)\n\nAnanya Gairola\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:31 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nGM\n\n^IXIC\n\nEditor’s Note: This story has been updated to provide additional clarity on Nvidia GPU dies shipped in 2025.\nOver the weekend, Michael Burry , the investor made famous by \"The Big Short\" for forecasting the 2008 housing collapse, asked for evidence of stockpiled Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GPUs.\n\nThis development came after an analysis on X questioned whether Jensen Huang's statement about Blackwell shipments aligns with the company's reported revenue and U.S. data-center capacity.\nBurry Joins Debate Over Nvidia's Blackwell Shipments Burry's statement came after a detailed thread on X from a user known as Kakashii ignited fresh scrutiny around Nvidia's latest GPU generation.\nThe user, who introduced themselves as an attorney on social media, questioned Huang's statement that six million Blackwell GPUs have already shipped.\n\nHuang said in October 2025 that demand for Nvidia's chips is still surging, noting that the company has shipped 6 million Blackwell GPUs over the past four quarters, reported CNBC.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAt the time, he also stated that Nvidia expects a combined $500 billion in GPU sales across the Blackwell line and next year's Rubin generation.\nAccording to the analysis shared by Kakashii on X, Nvidia's reported $111 billion in data-center revenue since Blackwell launched does not appear to support that shipment volume.\nEven after factoring in the more than $10 billion Nvidia disclosed in the 2024 fourth-quarter Blackwell revenue, the thread argues the numbers only account for roughly 4 million units, leaving a potential gap of hundreds of thousands to millions of GPUs.\n\nPower and Data-Center Capacity Add Another Layer Of Questions The thread also pointed to the enormous energy requirements of running Blackwell chips.\nIf 6 million GPUs shipped and 65% to 70% were deployed in U.S. data centers, they would require 8.5 to 11 gigawatts of power — roughly equivalent to the electricity capacity of Singapore, the analyst said.\nHowever, the U.S. only added an estimated 8.5 gigawatts of data-center-usable capacity between 2024 and 2025, the user noted. That assumes every new facility uses only Nvidia hardware and no Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) or Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google chips.\nEven then, the user argued, the power supply barely matches the stated GPU shipment volume.\n\nStory continues\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nBurry Calls For Receipts: ‘Calling For Pics And Proof' Sharing the thread, Burry urged X users to send him photos or proof of Nvidia GPUs being stored \"in mass quantities\" in the U.S. or overseas.\n\"Some have reached out to me,\" he wrote, adding, \"it is getting interesting. But I need more.\"\nNotably, the bar chart shown at Nvidia's GTC DC in October reflected 6 million GPU dies shipped in calendar year 2025.\nA footnote on the slide noted that the Blackwell and Rubin architectures use two GPU dies per chip. As a result, while 6 million GPU dies were shipped, the total came to 3 million complete GPU packages.\n\nDespite Nvidia's Pushback, Burry Says His Bearish Thesis Still Holds Up Last month, Burry doubled down on his bearish view of Nvidia, reaffirming his analysis on X just hours after the company privately pushed back his past claims. Burry argues the company's $112.5 billion in buybacks added no real shareholder value and only offset stock-based compensation.\nMeanwhile, analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo defended Nvidia, saying concerns about rising Days Sales Outstanding and inventory levels misunderstand the company's sales patterns and preparation for new Blackwell chips.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged 31.88% so far this year, outperforming both the Nasdaq Composite's 22.29% gain and the Nasdaq 100's 22.49% rise.

      "Content": "Micron's Blowout Earnings: The Best AI Stock for 2026?\n\nTirthankar Chakraborty\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 12:00 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nAs 2026 draws closer, investors are actively seeking stocks poised to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Micron Technology, Inc. MU stands out given its recent strong quarterly results. So, does the stock offer an attractive buying opportunity for the year ahead?\nLet’s see in detail –\n\nMicron's Blowout Earnings Highlight AI-Driven Growth Micron recently reported strong fiscal first-quarter 2026 results, reassuring investors that demand for its products has strengthened significantly. Micron's revenues for the quarter came in at $13. 64 billion, up 56.8% from the same period a year ago, according to investors. micron.com. Wall Street analysts had expected Micron's sales to come in around $ 12.88 billion.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, all four of Micron's business segments posted revenue growth, led by its core cloud memory business unit, which reported sales of $5.28 billion, up a whopping 99.5%. This robust performance helped boost Micron's profitability, with non-GAAP net income reaching $5.48???billion, or $4.78 per diluted share, well above analysts’ expectations of $3.94.\nSoaring demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips has been a major driver of the company's stellar quarterly performance. HBM chips, which enable high-speed data processing and reduce power consumption, remain in short supply due to the AI infrastructure boom, which is why they are in high demand.\nSanjay Mehrotra, Micron's CEO, said that “the growth in AI data center capacity is driving a significant increase in demand for high-performance and high-capacity memory and storage.” He noted that demand for server units has risen significantly and is expected to remain strong through 2026.\n\nMicron expects even stronger results in fiscal second-quarter 2026, with revenues projected between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) ranging from $8.22 to $8.62. The company already reported a record free cash flow of $3.9 billion in fiscal first-quarter 2026, providing ample funds to support future growth initiatives.\nMicron's Record Earnings Make It a Leading AI Stock for 2026 Rising AI-driven demand for Micron's HBM chips has not only helped the company deliver a strong quarter but is also expected to drive the company's growth momentum further into 2026. This positions Micron as one of the most compelling AI stocks to buy for 2026.\nLest we forget, Micron supplies HBM chips to NVIDIA Corporation NVDA as well as to its rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, ensuring strong demand for its products even if NVIDIA's competitive edge weakens. Thus, Micron's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 23.9%. The company's $19.85 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 80.9% year over year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicron currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

After the S&P 500 fell 1.2% on Wednesday, extending its losing streak to four sessions following a record high, JPMorgan's quantitative team pointed to a rotation out of recent winners, led by technology shares. The strategists said crowding in highly volatile, riskier stocks has reached the 99th percentile, a level they suggested could be vulnerable to a sharper unwind if a significant macro event were to emerge.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AVGO.\nIs AVGO fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nBram Kaplan, JPMorgan's head of Americas equity derivatives strategy, highlighted six stocks the bank views as speculative growth plays that could be more sensitive to sudden repricing: Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ), Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), Expedia Group ( NASDAQ:EXPE ), Estee Lauder ( NYSE:EL ), Invesco ( NYSE:IVZ ) and Nucor ( NYSE:NUE ). Since Dec. 10, Broadcom has fallen more than 21% and AMD is down 11%, while Estee Lauder, Invesco and Nucor are also lower, with Expedia up about 3%. Kaplan described many of these names as second-order speculative AI beneficiaries, noting they could be prone to larger swings because expansion may rely on access to capital or debt markets rather than internal growth alone.\n\nKaplan outlined a potential approach for navigating the environment, suggesting bearish put options on speculative names paired with bullish exposure to lower-volatility stocks such as Cigna ( NYSE:CI ), Pfizer ( NYSE:PFE ) and Verizon Communications ( NYSE:VZ ). There remains the possibility that the recent selloff reflects a temporary rotation rather than a broader shift, a view supported by Micron Technology's ( NASDAQ:MU ) strong earnings that helped lift AI-linked stocks again on Wednesday. Even so, JPMorgan's warning comes as investors increasingly question whether the AI trade can lift all boats, with attention gradually shifting toward sorting potential winners from possible laggards.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Forget Nvidia and Broadcom. This Forgotten Retail Stock Is a Top Performer in 2025.\n\nPathikrit Bose\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:26 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: DDS\n\nAMD\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nArtificial intelligence has been the theme on Wall Street for more than three years now. Headlined by the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO), chipmakers have been the undisputed winners, and their share price actions reflect the same. On the other hand, as inflation continues to hover around the 3% level, above the Fed's comfort rate of 2%, one would not expect stocks from the retail sector to outperform these AI juggernauts. However, that is precisely what Dillard's (DDS) has done over the past five years.\n\nAbout Dillard's Founded in 1938 and based out of Arkansas, Dillard's operates full-line department stores and clearance centers across the U.S., primarily in the Southeast, Southwest, West, and Midwest. Other than retail operations, the company is also engaged in providing construction services. It operates approximately 272 full-line department stores plus around 28 clearance centers across 30 U.S. states and over 140 cities as of late 2025.\n\nMore News from Barchart Cathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock.

This Analyst Thinks It Is One of the Highest-Quality Stocks to Buy for the Next Year Too.\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nValued at a market cap of $10.2 billion, the DDS stock is up 54% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, outperforming the likes of Broadcom, AMD, and Microsoft (MSFT). Notably, the stock offers a dividend yield of 4.76%, which is higher than the sector median of 1.023%. Further, the company has been raising dividends consecutively over the past 14 years, and with a payout ratio of just 2.87%, the headroom for growth remains.\nBut is that enough to warrant an investment? Let's analyze.\nAll Good (Except Sales Growth) Dillard's, despite its share price pop, is not for the growth enthusiasts. While its earnings have grown at a CAGR of 6.28% over the past 10 years, revenues have actually declined at a CAGR of 0.28% in the same period. Modest revenue growth was reported in the most recent quarter as well.\nIn Q3 2025, Dillard's net sales were $1.47 billion, up a mere 2.8% from the previous year. Comparable store sales, a key indicator of organic store sales, inched up by just 3% in the same period. Further, gross margins improved to 45.3% in the quarter, an increase from the previous year's figure of 44.5%, implying effective control over direct costs.\n\nStory Continues\nOverall, earnings for the quarter were reported to be $8.31 per share, a YoY rise of 7.5%. Notably, the EPS also came in higher than the consensus estimate of $6.18, as the past two years have seen the company's earnings miss estimates on just one occasion.\nComing to cash flows, for the nine months ended Nov. 1, Dillard's reported net cash from operating activities of $505.8 million, up from $349.4 million in the year-ago period. Overall, the company closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1.15 billion, much higher than its short-term debt levels of $96 million.\n\nFinally, aside from its record of shelling out regular dividends, Dillard's has rewarded shareholders through share repurchases. While during the quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $107.8 million, the past decade has seen the company carrying out share buybacks worth more than $3 billion.\nThus, a slowdown in sales growth cannot be squarely blamed on the company's operations, as the wider retail sector has been subdued for a while now. Structural headwinds such as mall traffic decline and the emergence of e-commerce over the years have played a significant role. Considering this, Dillard's showing has been commendable, as it has done what it can in this scenario: controlling costs, raising margins, keeping debt under control, and increasing earnings with an effective cash management strategy.\n\nCan the Good Times Continue to Roll? Now, Dillard's needs just one thing: sales growth. That will ensure that the company's upmove was not just based on effective balance sheet management but is built upon solid, sustainable growth. To that end, the company is taking some initiatives.\nFirst up, Dillard's has been putting more effort into freshening up its stock lately, bringing in clothes and accessories that feel current and on-trend, particularly on the men's side. This is to bring in younger shoppers and get the regulars to stop by more often. That's shown up in better sales numbers of late. The categories doing the heavy lifting are the ones with stronger margins and real pull, like women's clothing, handbags, shoes, and makeup.\n\nConversely, while the stores are still the main game for Dillard's, the company is spending serious cash on the website too. They're building out the online shopping experience and making it work hand-in-hand with what's in the stores, so customers don't feel any drop-off. It's beginning to click, with online sales expected to surpass $400 million for 2025. Stuff like ordering online and grabbing in-store, nicer product pages, and a wider catalog of items online are helping drive that.\nFinally, Dillard's uses targeted promotions and marketing to attract both value-conscious and brand-focused shoppers. Promotions are tailored to drive both traffic and conversion, emphasizing value without eroding margin.\nHowever, it's not all smooth sailing. Inflation is still biting, and the job picture is getting shakier, so shoppers are tightening their purse strings in ways Dillard's can't fully fix. And being smaller in scale than the giants means it's tougher to match them on price; Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT), the behemoths in the space, have much more financial muscle to pull customers to their aisles.\n\nThe shares are priced for a lot of good news already too, trading at a forward P/E of 20.06 and P/B of 5.81. Both stats are quite a bit above the sector averages of 17.66 and 2.70, which doesn't leave much buffer if the spending environment cools further.\nAnalyst Opinion on DDS Stock Taking all of this into account, analysts have deemed DDS stock a “Hold,” with a mean target price that has already been surpassed. The high target price of $700 denotes an upside potential of about 6% from current levels. Out of five analysts covering the stock, one has a “Strong Buy” rating, two have a “Hold” rating, and two have a “Strong Sell” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Better Semiconductor Stock for 2026: AMD vs. Intel\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:50 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nINTC\n\n^SOX\n\nKey Points AMD's and Intel's earnings are expected to grow significantly in 2026.\nA close look at their businesses reveals that one of them is outperforming the other financially.\nComparing their valuations will make it easy for investors to understand which one is the better buy right now.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\n\nSemiconductor stocks have delivered some stellar performances in 2025, as is evident from the 40% gains registered by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index this year. Though the sector has witnessed periods of volatility due to concerns such as the sustainability of the massive spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and questions about the returns on investment that this technology will actually deliver, strong chip demand has provided a solid tailwind so far.\nThe good news is that semiconductor stocks can keep doing well in 2026. The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization forecasts a 26% spike in semiconductor sales next year to $975 billion, higher than this year's projected growth of 22.5%. This should bode well for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , two chip companies that have clocked impressive returns in 2025.\nBut if you're choosing one of these two stocks to buy now based on their outlook for 2026, which one should it be?\nThe case for AMD As of this writing, AMD stock is up 72% in 2025. Its revenue and earnings have been growing at a healthy clip thanks to demand for its chips for use in personal computers (PCs), gaming consoles, and data centers .\nIts revenue in the first three quarters of 2025 increased by 35% from the year-ago period. AMD's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped by about 244% during this period to $2.8 billion. The new year could be even stronger for AMD. The proliferation of AI in PCs and data centers, along with a potential increase in the company's market share in AI chips, is likely to drive growth in 2026.\n\nAMD has been constantly gaining market share for central processing units (CPUs) in both PCs and data centers. Its share of PC CPUs increased by 1.4 percentage points year over year in the third quarter of 2025 to 25.4%, according to Mercury Research. Meanwhile, it recorded a jump of 3.6 points in server CPUs to 27.8%.\nAMD can continue to gain share in CPUs next year since it is moving to a 2-nanometer (nm) process node from the current-generation 3nm and 4nm nodes. The company claims that its Zen 6 CPU will be the first chip fabricated on foundry leader TSMC 's 2nm node. Importantly, that smaller process node should enable AMD to deliver increased computing performance while keeping power consumption in check.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company also notes that its 2nm chips will support a wider range of AI workloads in both PCs and data centers. Moreover, AMD sees its addressable opportunity in the data center market increasing at an annualized rate of over 40% for the next five years. On the other hand, shipments of AI PCs are projected to jump by 83% in 2026.\n\nAMD's expanding addressable market and its ability to acquire a greater share of the data center and PC chip markets explain why it expects annualized revenue growth of more than 35% for the next three to five years, up from the 21% annual growth it has recorded in the past five years. It also expects its operating margin to grow to 35% over the long run from around 24% this year.\n2026 will be the year when AMD steps on the gas. Analysts are estimating a 62% spike in earnings next year, up significantly from the 20% non-GAAP earnings growth it is set to deliver in 2025. Ideally, that should translate into more gains for AMD stock next year.\nThe case for Intel Intel has regained investor confidence in 2025 thanks to a few key positive developments, which explains the 87% spike in its share price this year.\nInvestments from the U.S. government, SoftBank , and Nvidia have strengthened its balance sheet. The company also divested its stake in programmable chip manufacturer Altera and sold a stake in Mobileye . As a result, Intel was sitting on almost $31 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. The $5 billion investment from Nvidia is set to close in the current quarter.\n\nThis solid cash position should enable Intel to bring more production capacity online for its most advanced chip nodes, which are experiencing healthy demand. CFO David Zinsner remarked on the October earnings conference call that the demand for its Intel 10 and Intel 7 process nodes exceeded supply, driven by the PC and data center markets.\nManagement also notes that its data center customers are interested in entering into long-term supply agreements to support the installation of additional AI infrastructure. At the same time, Intel's partnership with Nvidia for the joint development of data center chips and PC processors that will be deployed in the hyperscaler, enterprise, and consumer end markets should open up another opportunity for the company to accelerate its growth.\n\nIntel has been lacking on that front so far. The consensus estimate is for a 1% drop in revenue this year. However, the cost-cutting measures Intel has undertaken will help it post an adjusted profit of $0.34 per share in 2025, according to analysts, compared to its loss of $0.13 per share last year.\nIntel's cost-saving efforts are set to continue in 2026. Management expects to lower its operating expenses to $16 billion from this year's $16.8 billion, and its revenue is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2026. This combination of an improvement in its top line and control of spending could boost Intel's earnings by an impressive 76% next year, per consensus estimates.\nThis all looks like good news for Intel investors, but is it a better buy than AMD?\n\nThe verdict Both Intel and AMD are on track to clock healthy earnings growth next year. However, for Intel, that growth is expected to mainly be driven by its cost-optimization efforts -- its top-line growth has yet to kick into a higher gear. AMD, meanwhile, is clocking healthy growth in both revenue and earnings, and it expects to step on the gas next year.\nWhat's more, AMD is significantly cheaper than Intel on the valuation front.\nBased on all that, AMD appears to be the more convincing stock to buy now. Intel, of course, could do well next year if it continues to execute its turnaround, but AMD seems like the better bet for 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

Chen's stake in MetaX is worth about $6.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nOther early insiders also saw eye-popping paper gains.\nMetaX's other two cofounders and co-chief technology officers, Peng Li and Yang Jian, hold stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the blockbuster debut, according to Bloomberg's calculations.\n\nChina's AI rush Chen's rise follows that of another GPU entrepreneur, Zhang Jianzhong, the founder and CEO of Moore Threads Technology.\nEarlier this month, Zhang's net worth jumped to $4.3 billion after his company's successful IPO, continuing a wave of investor enthusiasm for homegrown semiconductor players.\n\nThe richest figure in China's AI chip scene is Chen Tianshi, a cofounder and CEO of Cambricon Technologies — a company retail traders have dubbed \"China's Nvidia.\"\nCambricon's Chen is now worth $22.5 billion, making him the country's 16th-richest individual on Bloomberg's list. He is the 115th richest person in the world.\nThese new fortunes reflect a sharp shift in investor sentiment.\nChinese AI and semiconductor stocks have been on a tear since the breakout of the China-made DeepSeek-R1 AI model released in January. The model helped spark a rally in local tech names and pushed the Hang Seng Tech Index up more than 20% so far this year.\nWashington's tightening export controls on advanced Nvidia chips also contributed to the boom.\n\nSuch restrictions on high-end AI processors have choked China's access to cutting-edge US hardware and pushed Beijing to lean harder on domestic suppliers .\nStill, China's new AI billionaires remain far from the top of the country's wealth rankings. The upper tier is still dominated by long-established tycoons.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the top spot is Zhong Shanshan, the low-key bottled-water magnate behind Nongfu Spring, with a fortune of $68.1 billion, per Bloomberg.\nPony Ma, a cofounder and CEO of Tencent, ranks second with $66.5 billion — a fortune up 38% this year, on the heels of Tencent's AI-induced rally — while ByteDance cofounder Zhang Yiming comes in third with $65.2 billion.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "As Nvidia Launches New Nemotron 3 Models, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold NVDA Stock?\n\nEbube Jones\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:46 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nOn Dec. 15, Nvidia (NVDA) announced the launch of its Nemotron 3 family of open models, built to support transparent, efficient, and specialized agentic artificial intelligence (AI) development across industries.\nThe Nemotron 3 Nano model delivers four times the throughput of the Nemotron 2 Nano, making it a more compute-cost-efficient open model for practical work, such as software debugging, content summarization, and AI assistant tasks.\n\nMore News from Barchart Cathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock. Should You?\nBroadcom Stock Is Up 120% in the Past Year.

Are You Loading Up on Shares Now?\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nThis launch comes at a tricky moment for the stock. Nvidia is currently valued at a market capitalization of approximately $4.15 trillion, but shares have also fallen more than 17% from recent highs. That pullback shows investors are still debating how long hyper-scalers can continue heavy spending on AI, especially with growing competition from chipmakers, like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO), and the push by Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) to build more custom chips in-house.\nAt the same time, Nemotron 3 points to Nvidia’s continued move into agentic AI, and early adopters already include ServiceNow (NOW), Palantir (PLTR), Perplexity, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. So for investors, the question is simple: Does Nemotron 3 strengthen Nvidia’s moat enough to support buying at current valuations? Or do valuation pressures and the macro risks justify a more cautious stance? Let’s find out.\n\nNvidia’s Financial Pulse in 2025 Nvidia is an AI infrastructure company. It sells high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) and closely integrated software that customers use to train and run AI in data centers, while also serving gaming and professional visualization markets on the side.\nOver the past 52 weeks, the stock is up about 40%, so the bigger trend remains positive, although sentiment has cooled. Over the past month, shares have declined by about 8%, which appears more like a normal reset after a strong run than a sign that the story has fallen apart.\nThe valuation indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium. NVDA’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 40x versus the sector’s 24.34x, which means the market is pricing in faster growth and stronger long-term earnings power than the average stock in the group.\n\nStory Continues\nIncome is still a small part of the picture. Nvidia’s annual dividend yield is 0.02%, well below the average technology yield of 1.37%.\nWhat really supports Nvidia's case is financial performance. For Q3, Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion, up 22% quarter-over-quarter and 62% year-over-year. That growth was driven by record data center revenue of $51.2 billion. Gross margins stayed high at 73.4% GAAP and 73.6% non-GAAP, and earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.30 on both GAAP and non-GAAP results. During the first nine months of fiscal 2026, Nvidia returned $37 billion through buybacks and dividends, and it still had $62.2 billion authorized for repurchases, which continues to support shareholder returns.\n\nThe Growth Engines Driving Nvidia’s AI Empire Nvidia’s newly expanded collaboration with Synopsys (SNPS) is a direct move into the design and engineering work that sits behind many major industries. By combining Nvidia’s AI and accelerated computing with Synopsys’s market-leading data analysis tools, the goal is to help research and development teams design, simulate, and verify complex intelligent systems faster, with lower costs, and under tighter time-to-market pressure.\n\nNvidia also backed this partnership financially, investing $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at $414.79 per share, which underlies its seriousness about AI becoming part of core engineering workflows.\nIn addition, Nvidia’s tie-up with HUMAIN, a PIF-backed full-stack AI firm, is focused on scaling real infrastructure and supporting sovereign computers. HUMAIN plans to deploy up to 600,000 Nvidia GB300 platforms over the next three years and will use Nemotron open models to train its own HUMAIN Chat models.\nThe partnership also includes the building of Nvidia-powered data centers in Saudi Arabia and expanding to AI data centers in the United States, which broadens Nvidia’s reach as agentic AI moves from testing to wider rollout across regions.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia’s collaboration with Upwind focuses on securing AI workloads where they run. Upwind is bringing its runtime-first cloud security platform onto Nvidia’s AI compute and inference stack, using Nvidia NIM microservices to boost its own AI-driven security operations while also adding dedicated protection for Nvidia GPU-based infrastructure, like DGX and Blackwell.\nWhat Analysts See Ahead for NVDA Stock For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026, the company expects revenue of about $65 billion. Earnings expectations are strong, too. The average EPS estimate is $1.44 versus $0.85 a year ago, and the next quarter is projected at $1.51 versus $0.77, which suggests year-over-year growth of 69.41% and 96.10%, respectively.\n\nThose numbers help explain why several major firms remain upbeat. Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore recently raised his price target to $250, citing Nvidia’s visibility into roughly $500 billion of data center infrastructure revenue between 2025 and 2026 as companies continue building out AI and agentic AI capacity. Loop Capital is even more aggressive with a Street-high $350 target, which would imply a market cap of about $8.5 trillion.\nNot everyone is on board, though. Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg has a “Sell” rating on NVDA, pointing to what he calls potential “circular financing” risks in the AI ecosystem.\nEven with that pushback, among 48 analysts, the consensus rating for Nvidia is a “Strong Buy,” and the average price target of $252.67 implies roughly 43.33% upside from the current price.\nIn Conclusion In my opinion, Nvidia looks like a “Hold” with a buy-on-the-dip bias, because Nemotron 3 strengthens Nvidia’s position in agentic AI while the company is still putting up elite revenue growth, margins, and shareholder returns. The stock’s recent pullback suggests the market is wrestling with valuation and fears regarding the spending cycle, not a breakdown in execution. If guidance stays on track and the next couple of earnings prints confirm the demand curve, shares are more likely to grind higher than roll over, even if the ride stays volatile. A clean break is highly likely to need another upside surprise or clearer visibility into 2026 demand.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Sign up now!\n\nLower bond yields today are also supporting stock index futures.\nInvestor focus now turns to delayed U.S. inflation data for November.\nIn yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s three main equity benchmarks ended in the red. AI-infrastructure stocks slumped, with GE Vernova (GEV) plunging over -10% to lead losers in the S&P 500 and Constellation Energy (CEG) sliding more than -6% to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100. Also, chip stocks slipped, with ARM Holdings (ARM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) falling over -5%. In addition, Lennar (LEN) slid over -4% after the homebuilder posted weaker-than-expected FQ4 adjusted EPS and issued soft FQ1 new orders guidance. On the bullish side, Texas Pacific Land (TPL) climbed more than +7% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 after the landowner announced a strategic agreement with Bolt Data & Energy to develop data center campuses on Texas Pacific property in West Texas.\n\n“The AI trade continues to take on water,” said Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG. “While it’s still premature to say this is ‘the’ top for AI stocks, evidence is growing that it’s more than just a speed bump. The other question is if, in fact, AI is losing its leadership, where will new leadership be?”\nFed Governor Christopher Waller said on Wednesday he supports additional interest rate cuts to bring the central bank’s setting back to neutral, while noting there is no need to move hastily. “Because inflation is still up, we can take our time — there’s no rush to get down,” Waller said in a CNBC forum. Outlining a scenario in which inflation continues to ease through 2026, Waller said monetary policy settings remain as much as 100 basis points above neutral. At the same time, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that while it is a “close call,” inflation currently poses a greater concern than the labor market.\n\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in a 73.4% chance of no rate change and a 26.6% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the next central bank meeting in January.\nToday, all eyes are on the U.S. consumer inflation report for November, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Notably, the report will have no monthly changes for most price categories, providing only a partial snapshot of inflation. That’s because the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it was unable to retroactively obtain much of the October price data, and November data collection was also delayed by the government shutdown. Economists, on average, forecast that the U.S. November CPI will come in at +3.1% y/y, compared to +3.0% y/y in September. Also, the U.S. core CPI is expected to be +3.0% y/y in November, unchanged from September.\n\nA survey conducted by 22V Research showed that 36% of investors expect a “risk-on” market reaction to the CPI report, 46% anticipate a “mixed/negligible” response, and just 18% expect a “risk-off” reaction.\nU.S. Initial Jobless Claims data will also be closely monitored today. Economists estimate this figure will come in at 224K, compared to last week’s number of 236K.\nThe U.S. Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index will be released today as well. Economists anticipate that the Philly Fed manufacturing index will stand at 2.5 in December, compared to last month’s value of -1.7.\nOn the earnings front, high-profile companies such as Accenture (ACN), Nike (NKE), Cintas (CTAS), and FedEx (FDX) are set to report their quarterly figures today.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.129%, down -0.48%.\n\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.26% this morning on a busy day for central bank meetings in the region. Retail and energy stocks gained ground on Thursday. Data released on Thursday showed that France’s manufacturing confidence index climbed to an over 1-1/2-year high in December. Past production rose for the first time in six months as auto output improved, while the decline in orders, especially foreign orders, eased. Meanwhile, Sweden’s central bank kept its key policy rate unchanged at 1.75% on Thursday, as expected, and reiterated that the next move will be a hike, though not anytime soon. Norway’s central bank also held its key policy rate unchanged at 4.00%, as expected, while reaffirming plans to gradually ease monetary policy in the coming years. Investor focus now shifts to monetary policy decisions from the European Central Bank and Bank of England later in the day. The ECB is widely expected to leave the deposit rate unchanged at 2.00%, with updated economic projections likely to signal solid growth and confidence that inflation will remain close to policymakers’ target. At the same time, the BoE is widely expected to lower interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75% as attention shifts from inflation concerns to the weakening U.K. economy and labor market. In corporate news, Aeroports DE Paris (ADP.P.DX) plunged over -10% after the French transport regulator rejected its 2026 tariff proposal.\n\nFrance’s Business Survey was released today.\nThe French December Business Survey came in at 102, stronger than expectations of 98.\nAsian stock markets today settled mixed. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.16%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -1.03%.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index closed slightly higher today as investors rotated into defensive sectors amid growing concerns about economic weakness and elevated tech valuations. Bank, defense, and energy stocks outperformed on Thursday. Limiting gains, AI-related stocks retreated after concerns over AI funding weighed on tech shares on Wall Street overnight. Property stocks also slumped as China Vanke’s debt crisis continued. Fitch Ratings downgraded the homebuilder’s long-term foreign- and local-currency issuer default ratings to “C” from “CCC-” and also cut ratings on its wholly owned subsidiary, Vanke Real Estate. Vanke began a second meeting with holders of a 2 billion yuan ($283.99 million) bond on Thursday, as it races to secure extensions on debt payments with bondholders and banks in a bid to avoid a default. Meanwhile, investor sentiment soured this week after fresh economic data indicated a further slowdown in domestic demand, with Beijing remaining hesitant to roll out broad stimulus measures. In corporate news, China International Capital Corp. rose over +3% after detailing plans to acquire two rivals in a share-swap deal valued at about $16 billion. CICC stated that the acquisitions would help expand its business network, grow its client base, and strengthen its capital as it aims to become a top-tier investment bank.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed sharply lower today, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street. Technology stocks led the declines on Thursday, with SoftBank Group sliding over -3% after Oracle shares sank in New York following a report that Blue Owl Capital would not support a $10 billion deal for a data center in Michigan. Earlier this year, SoftBank Group, together with Oracle and OpenAI, announced plans to build data centers in the U.S. as part of their ambitious Stargate project. “The Stargate project is the centre of U.S. data centre development, and SoftBank is deeply involved in it,” said Kazuaki Shimada, chief strategist at IwaiCosmo Securities. Meanwhile, the yen was little changed on Thursday ahead of the Bank of Japan’s policy decision on Friday. The BOJ is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate by a quarter point to 0.75%, the highest level in three decades, signaling growing confidence that it will achieve its stable inflation target. Market participants will closely watch Governor Kazuo Ueda’s post-meeting press conference for clues on how many additional rate hikes may be ahead. Bloomberg reported last week that BOJ officials believe the bank would still not be at the so-called neutral rate if borrowing costs are raised to 0.75%, with some officials seeing 1% as still below neutral. In other news, foreign investors bought a net 528.3 billion yen worth of Japanese stocks in the week through December 13th, marking a third consecutive week of net inflows, according to data from the Ministry of Finance. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -1.31% to 27.97.\n\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nMicron Technology (MU) surged over +10% in pre-market trading after the largest U.S. memory-chip maker posted upbeat FQ1 results and gave a blowout FQ2 forecast.\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) jumped over +21% in pre-market trading after announcing a merger with TAE Technologies in an all-stock deal valued at over $6 billion.\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) climbed more than +6% in pre-market trading after The Wall Street Journal reported that activist Elliott Investment Management had built a more than $1 billion stake in the company.\nGE Vernova (GEV) gained more than +4% in pre-market trading after Jefferies upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a price target of $815.\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) fell over -1% in pre-market trading after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $51.\n\nYou can see more pre-market stock movers here\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Thursday - December 18th\nAccenture (ACN), Nike (NKE), Cintas (CTAS), FedEx (FDX), Heico (HEI), Darden Restaurants (DRI), FactSet Research (FDS), Birkenstock Holding (BIRK), CarMax (KMX), KB Home (KBH), BlackBerry (BB), Nano Nuclear Energy (NNE), Mission Produce (AVO), Scholastic (SCHL), Innovative Solutions (ISSC), Bridgeline Digital (BLIN).\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "AMZN and AMD: Cowen Calls These 2 AI Stock Giants Its Best Ideas for 2026\n\nTipRanks\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 3:07 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nSo much has happened this year. After a spring correction triggered by President Trump ’s aggressive tariff policies, stocks staged a powerful rebound as inflation cooled and markets began pricing in a more accommodative Federal Reserve. At the same time, strong earnings and relentless enthusiasm around AI propelled mega-cap leadership, pushing the S&P 500 to nearly a 16% gain for the year.\n\nClaim 50% Off TipRanks Premium and Invest with Confidence Unlock hedge-fund level data and powerful investing tools designed to help you make smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis so your portfolio is always positioned for maximum potential\nLooking ahead, Cowen’s global head of research, Robert Fagin, sees a constructive backdrop forming as markets head into 2026, even with risks still in play.\n\n“For all the policy shocks and uncertainty in 2025, we are on track to end the year with global GDP growth at 3.0%, 10y Treasuries around 50bps lower, the USD 7% weaker, and the S&P 500 15% higher. Our forecasts for 2026 see fewer shocks, ongoing risks, but much the same outcome: global growth of 2.8%, a further 50bps decline in 10y rates, and a 6% fall in the USD. Central bank accommodation and ongoing fiscal support seem enough to keep risks to more bark than bite,” Fagin opined.\nActing on this outlook, Cowen’s analysts have named two stocks as their “best ideas” for the coming year – Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) , two major forces in AI. According to the TipRanks database, Wall Street rates both stocks as Strong Buys, with double-digit upside potential over the next year. Let’s take a closer look at why Cowen shares that optimism.\n\nAmazon\nFirst up, Amazon is currently the fifth most valuable publicly traded company on Wall Street, with a market cap of $2.38 trillion. Amazon has built itself up to that impressive scale through its dominance in the world of online retail, and through its expressed mastery of shipping and logistics. The company generated almost $640 billion in total revenue last year, and had over $70 billion in cash assets as of September 30 this year.\nAmazon hasn’t stood still on its retail business, even though that makes up approximately 80% of its revenue stream. The company is also well-known for its work with AI, cloud computing, and the combination of the two. AWS, Amazon’s subscription cloud platform, is a major revenue generator – with quarterly revenue of well over $30 billion in recent reports – and is also a key driver of Amazon’s AI work. Through AWS, Amazon offers a range of AI-powered features, including automation tools and apps, graphic design tools, autocomplete systems; it’s a long list.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is also a major collaborator with smaller companies in their own AI forays. Just this month, Amazon announced that the antibody company Proteintech had chosen AWS as its cloud provider of preference – and had used the service to create its industry’s fits AI antibody assistant. On the same day, Amazon also announced that Plaud, the AI conversational intelligence firm, was using AWS – and its AI – to speed up the global deployment of its meeting intelligence solutions. And to round out that day, Amazon made public that AWS had introduced its Graviton 5 processor chip, giving 25% higher performance than the preceding generation.\n\nAlong with AWS, Amazon’s retail business is also benefiting from the expansion of AI-powered tools and features. By now, we’ve all seen the commercials for Amazon’s visual shopping features, which are based on AI technology. The company is also using AI to make its e-commerce experience interactive in other ways, with a shopping assistant and improved search bar functionality.\nWhen we turn to Amazon’s last set of financial results, which covered 3Q25, we find that the retail giant generated $180.2 billion for the quarter. This figure represented a solid 13.4% year-over-year increase and beat the estimates by $2.4 billion. At Amazon’s bottom line, we saw an EPS of $1.95, based on a net income of $21.2 billion. Looking at some drill-downs, we see that Amazon’s North American sales reached $106.3 billion, for an 11% y/y increase, while international sales were up 14% to reach $40.9 billion. The biggest gainer, however, was AWS, which had a year-over-year jump of 20% and hit $33 billion in quarterly revenue, or 18.3% of the total.\n\nFor Cowen analyst John Blackledge, there are several reasons why Amazon is a ‘top pick.’ Laying them out, the 5-star analyst writes, “AMZN is our top ’26 large cap pick based on three key drivers, incl: i) Accelerating AWS revenue growth: We forecast AWS revenue to accelerate in 4Q25 and accelerate further in both ’26 and ’27 on the heels of strong core and AI workload demand and alongside expanding AI infrastructure capacity… ii) eCommerce and Advertising Momentum: AMZN’s eCommerce biz should see strong growth in ’26 driven by cont’d record delivery speed (which drives purchase conversion), expansion of same day perishables biz, & investment in rural markets. We estimate AMZN’s ’26 Ads rev grows high teens y/y driven by sponsored products, AMZN’s demand-side platform (DSP), and emerging Prime Video ad biz; and iii) Continued Margin Expansion: We forecast AMZN ’26 Op Inc of $104BN, ~4% above consensus, yielding 12.8% Op Inc (GAAP) margins, as high margin Ads and AWS businesses continue ramping while eCommerce margins benefit from lower cost to serve.”\n\nLooking forward from here, Blackledge rates Amazon’s stock as a Buy, with a $300 price target that indicates potential for a 35% upside in the coming year. (To watch Blackledge’s track record, click here )\nAmazon’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 45 analyst reviews, with a highly lopsided split of 44 Buys to 1 Hold. The shares are currently priced at $222.56 and the $296.85 average price target implies a one-year gain of 33%. (See AMZN stock forecast )\nAdvanced Micro Devices ( AMD )\nFrom the leader in online retail we’ll shift gears and look at a rising company in the semiconductor chip industry. The company is a ‘smaller’ chip maker in a relative sense – the industry leaders are the trillion-dollar-plus mega-cap giants Nvidia and Broadcom, but AMD’s $338 billion market cap is very respectable in itself – and places the company at number six among the most valuable semiconductor firms. AMD built its original reputation and market on PC processors, but is rapidly expanding its business in the AI market.\n\nOn the AI-related track, AMD has two important new products on the way, expected next year. The MI450 is the latest iteration of the Instinct chips, and is a next-gen, high-performance GPU designed especially for AI training and inference. It features advanced memory, ultra-fast interconnects, and deep integration capabilities, making it well suited to hyperscaler AI developers.\nThe second new product on the way next year is Helios, which AMD describes as its next generation in open‑standard, rack‑scale AI infrastructure, and which incorporates the MI450 as part of its rack‑level system. Helios is designed to facilitate the largest AI and high-performance computing workloads, to redefine AI training at the largest scales. In a statement earlier this month, AMD announced that HPE will be among the first original equipment manufacturers to adopt Helios.\n\nAMD’s AI-related businesses form the largest segment of the company’s revenue. The company’s data center segment, directly tied-in to AI, makes up almost 47% of the total revenue, and at $4.3 billion it was up 22% year-over-year in 3Q25.\nOverall, AMD reported total revenue of $9.2 billion in the third quarter, a quarterly record and up 32% year-over-year – and beating the forecast by $487.5 million. At the bottom line, AMD’s earnings came in at $1.20 per share by non-GAAP measures, beating the forecast by 3 cents per share and marking a sharp increase from the 92-cent non-GAAP EPS reported in 3Q24.\nThis stock has caught the attention of Cowen’s Josh Buchalter, who sees plenty more room for the shares to run up in the near future. He writes, “AMD’s hardware roadmap, progress building out its ROCm software ecosystem, and, most importantly, customer wins, have reinforced our confidence that it can create and capture value in AI compute. Against a very large TAM, we believe the Helios rack and MI450 will mark a key inflection in AMD’s story beginning in mid-2026. We think investors should own the stock ahead of the ramp, as we model 4Q26 EPS inflecting to a >$10 run-rate, or up ~2x… Y/Y and Q/Q.”\n\nThese comments support the analyst’s Buy rating on the shares, while his $290 price target suggests a 12-month upside potential of 39%. (To watch Buchalter’s track record, click here )\nAMD has 37 recent analyst reviews on record, and the Strong Buy consensus is supported by the 28-9 split favoring Buy over Hold. The stock has a trading price of $209.17 and its $281.84 average target price implies a gain of 35% on the one-year horizon.

      "Content": "JPMorgan Quants Warn of ‘Extreme Crowding’ in Speculative Stocks\n\nBernard Goyder\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: JPM\n\nAVGO\n\nAMD\n\nEXPE\n\nIVZ\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The latest bout of volatility in US equity markets highlights a risk that strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been warning about: “extreme crowding” in stocks that have rallied hard this year.\nThe bank has a list of six stocks it considers speculative growth plays and warned that they are “vulnerable to a reversal” in the event of any major macro event. The list includes Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Expedia Group Inc., Estee Lauder Cos Inc., Invesco Ltd. and Nucor Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nNew York Utility Says Queue for Large Power Users Has Tripled\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.2% Wednesday, a fourth straight day of loss after notching a record last week. The selloff has been led by tech shares as investors rotate out of winners — an event the JPMorgan quants warned about. They said “crowding” into the highly volatile, risky stocks had reached the 99th percentile — an “extreme” level that could lead to a sharp unwind that investors should hedge against.\n“These companies are more sensitive to shocks, leaving them at risk of sudden repricing,” wrote Bram Kaplan, JPMorgan’s head of Americas equity derivatives strategy. “Low Vol stocks possess a more attractive risk-reward profile” he added, compared to the more volatile stocks, many of which are “second order speculative AI plays.”\nSince Dec. 10, Broadcom shares are down more than 21%, while Advanced Micro Devices has dropped 11%. Estee Lauder, Invesco and Nucor are in the red as well, with only Expedia up about 3%.\nInvestors looking for winners from the artificial intelligence trade this year fanned out from Big Tech names like Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp., and piled into names they expect to benefit from the AI wave. JPMorgan called the ones that made its list “second-order speculative AI beneficiaries” and said they are vulnerable to big swings because they have to tap capital or debt markets to fund expansion, rather than rely on internal growth.\n\nKaplan offers a simple recipe for clients looking to trade the moment: buy bearish put options on speculative names and take bullish positions on less volatile stocks. Investors can consider shorting some of the high-momentum names, while taking long positions in duller “low volatility” stalwarts like Cigna Group, Pfizer Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nThere is the chance, of course, that the four-day slump in these momentum stocks could merely be a temporary rotation away from a few hot stocks, rather than any significant change to the landscape. That criticism is bolstered by Micron Technology Inc.’s blowout earnings on Wednesday, that are pushing AI stocks higher once again.\n\n“Real asset owners — retail investors and large institutions — are the only market participants capable of moving markets beyond short-term, shallow and technical drawdowns,” Alexis Maubourguet, chief investment officer of the Swiss hedge fund Adapt Investment Managers, said in an interview. “It will take a meaningful fundamental change for them to liquidate their positions, such as a material shift in the AI narrative.”\nNevertheless, there’s been a growing sense that the AI trade is no longer capable of lifting all boats, with investors trying to sort out winners and losers.\n--With assistance from Matt Turner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nThe Prosperity Gap Between Big and Small Businesses\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Not All AI Stocks Are Falling These Days. Micron Is Rising on Strong Earnings\n\nKara Greenberg\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nKey Takeaways Micron Technology posted earnings that topped analysts' estimates, sending shares higher in extended trading Wednesday.\nCEO Sanjay Mehrotra said growing AI demand drove record results for the memory chipmaker and Nvidia supplier.\nWorries about an AI bubble have weighed on the tech sector lately. Micron is still riding the AI boom higher.\n\nShares of the memory chip maker were up over 5% in extended trading Wednesday after the company posted earnings that blew past analysts' estimates, driven by growing demand for AI hardware.\nMicron Technology ( MU ) posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.78 for the fiscal first quarter, well above the $3.96 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for . Its revenue jumped nearly 60% year-over-year to a record $13.64 billion, also exceeding expectations.\n\nWhy This Matters to Investors As a supplier for leading AI chipmakers including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Micron has seen strong momentum in its data center business this year, helping it earn a reputation as a winning \"pick-and-shovel\" play for the AI trade.\n\"Micron delivered record revenue and significant margin expansion at the company level and also in each of our business units,” said CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, who called the company an \"essential AI enabler.\"\n\nMicron projected adjusted earnings per share of $8.22 to $8.62 on revenue of $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion for the second quarter, well ahead of consensus estimates.\n\nMicron's stock, though well off record highs seen earlier this month, has largely avoided the worst of the recent slump in the AI sector. It's continued to benefit from a shortage in the memory market , supporting stronger pricing and higher margins. Micron's GAAP gross margin jumped to 56% in the first quarter, up from around 38% a year earlier, with the company saying it expects that to climb as high as 68% in the current quarter.\nShares of Micron have nearly tripled in value in 2025 through Wednesday's close, making it one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 for the year.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025\n\nRyan Peterson\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:37 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nShares of AMD have steadied near recent highs as investors digest strong AI-related momentum alongside lingering questions about how quickly the company can meaningfully close the gap with Nvidia in data center acceleration. The story right now is less about AMD's growth prospects and more about whether enthusiasm around AI chips has largely been priced in heading into year-end.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, we ran AMD through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI's GPT. The goal wasn't to set a bold long-term target, but to produce a short, data-driven outlook that blends price action, technical signals, and the current narrative around AI demand and competition.\nWhat the AI model is actually predicting The agent was fed recent price action and a focused set of inputs to produce a short-term outlook. At the time of the run, AMD traded at $207.58. For the period from Dec. 16 through Jan. 6, the model's base-case projection came out to:\nAverage predicted price: $207.30\nImplied move: essentially flat drift into early January\nSignal snapshot: MACD remains low and flat, while RSI has begun to decline, pointing to cooling momentum rather than a breakdown\n\nIn plain language, the AI sees AMD's most likely path over the next few weeks as sideways, with little incentive for traders to push the stock meaningfully higher or lower without a new catalyst. That reflects a market that's comfortable with AMD's positioning, but not eager to expand the multiple further in the near term.\nFundamentally, AMD continues to benefit from rising demand for its MI300 AI accelerators, which management has highlighted as a key growth driver into 2025 as hyperscalers diversify beyond Nvidia. Recent earnings results showed data center revenue accelerating sharply year over year, reinforcing the idea that AMD is firmly in the AI spending cycle, even if it remains a distant second to Nvidia in market share.\nAt the same time, AMD's stock has already reflected much of that optimism. Shares rallied strongly earlier in the year on AI enthusiasm and improving PC demand, leaving less room for short-term upside unless orders or guidance surprise meaningfully. Broader coverage has also noted that while MI300 adoption is growing, the pace of revenue ramp and margins will be critical to sustaining investor confidence.\n\nPrice action in December supports that view. The stock has traded in a relatively tight range, with momentum indicators softening. The declining RSI suggests buying pressure is easing, while the flat MACD points to indecision rather than distribution. That combination often precedes consolidation rather than a sharp move, especially in large-cap semiconductor names late in the year.\n\nStory Continues\nThink of this AI outlook as a short-term temperature check. The model isn't making a judgment on AMD's long-term role in AI compute or its ability to take share over time. Instead, it's estimating how the market is likely to behave while investors wait for clearer signals on AI revenue scaling, margins, and competitive dynamics. In this run, the agent favors a muted move.\n\nFor longer-term investors bullish on AMD's AI roadmap and diversified chip portfolio, a flat few weeks is largely noise. For traders, it's a reminder that the next meaningful move in AMD will likely hinge on fresh data, either stronger-than-expected AI revenue traction or clearer signs that competition is pressuring pricing and margins.\nImage: Shutterstock\nThis article ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "Content": "Stock Market Today: Oracle Credit Controversy Causes Tech Selloff, Sending Nasdaq and S&P 500 Spiraling\n\nNoah Weidner\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nORCL\n\nAVGO\n\nAMD\n\nT his live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market. To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here .\nHappy Wednesday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Dec. 17, 2025. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nUpdate 4:01 p.m ET Closing Bell The U.S. markets are now closed, putting a cap on a rough day of trading for tech stocks. In total, 57.5% (3,197) issues were in decline today against 39.2% (2,178) advancing.\nThe Nasdaq (-1.81%) faced the brunt of the selloff as the Financial Times reported that Oracle (-5.4%) was losing a key source of funding on its $10 billion Michigan data center project. That revelation cooked up a significant selloff in semiconductor names, as well as the broader tech industry. The Nasdaq finished at 22,693.32.\nThe S&P 500 (-1.16%) sold off for a fourth straight day on the news, falling to 6,721.50. Here was the index today; notice those hot red pockets in tech and industrials.\nMeanwhile, the Russell 2000 (-1.07%) faced similar pockets of decline as the tech and industrial trouble boiled over into the small-cap index. It fell below 2,500 on the news, reversing from recent all-time highs.\nRounding out the major indexes, the Dow (-0.47%) was best-insulated, but still registered a decline. It closed out the day at 47,855.97.\n\nUpdate 1:20 p.m ET Midday Movers Now that the midday fireworks are in the rear view, all four U.S. market indexes are facing steeper declines -- near day lows.\nThe Russell 2000 (-1.26%) is down amid sluggishness in the industrial, technology, and communication services sector today.\nThe same is at least partially true for the Nasdaq (-1.23%) and S&P 500 (-0.83%), which are facing a similar downturn as the Oracle (-4.8%) drama permeates throughout the market, weighing on shares of other semiconductor names such as Broadcom (-5.3%), Advanced Micro Devices (-3.8%), and Nvidia (-3%).\n\nToday, the Dow (-0.39%) is making the best case today. Half of the index is in the red, the other half is in the red.\nIn total, 53.8% (2,992) of U.S. issues are in decline today against 42.8% (2,379) advancing, which brings us to our midday mover list for today. We'll take a look at the top and bottom 20 equities in the market among firms with at least a $2 billion market cap :\nWinners Despite it being a bad day for AI , today's top stock is an AI-fueled biotech play called Recursion Pharmaceuticals (+17.8%), who we haven't seen atop the list in quite awhile. A one-time retail favorite, the company was upgraded by JPMorgan today, which moved it from 'neutral' to 'overweight' citing the potential of its MEK inhibitor clinical trial.\n\nStory Continues\nFollowing close behind is Hut 8 (+12.5%), Anbio (+10.6%), and Via Transportation (+8.4%).\nAmong the larger firms making the list today are Elbit Systems (+4.3%), Texas Pacific Land Corporation (+5.6%), and Figma (+4.8%).\nLosers At the other end of the market, EverCommerce (-11.6%) is plummeting on some volatility . It's followed by some AI-related trades, independent power producer Bloom Energy (-10.1%) and Fermi (-9.6%).\nEven larger firms are being weighed down today by the AI jitters, including GE Vernova (-8.2%), Constellation Energy (-7.9%), and Vistra (-7.3%).\nUpdate 10:44 a.m ET More Oracle Drama Weighs on Tech Stocks Oracle is once again making itself the main character in the AI boom -- and maybe not in a good way.\nToday, the hyperscaler is declining on a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital won't go forward with funding the firm's $10 billion Michigan data center amid worries about \"tougher debt terms and the risk of delays,\" per the article.\n\nThe news comes just days after sources close to Oracle said it was pushing back key data center deliveries for partner OpenAI , who has committed billions to data center projects. Oracle was made to refute reports that it was not punting on these projects and that all milestones were coming along as planned. Obviously, Blue Owl seems to have sided with the anonymous sources cited in that Bloomberg report.\nWhy Does It Matter? Traders have remained relatively flighty about Oracle and ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Oracle counts more than half of its performance obligations from the Sam Altman-helmed company, which remains reliant on capital infusions from venture capital to stay afloat as it burns through money.\nAnd since the latter has not put up the money upfront, the hyperscaler has taken on gobs of debt to bring its data center ambitions to life. An astonishing $25 billion of the firm's $127 billion in debt is due within just three years. And with negative free cash flow -- in fact, -$13 billion -- a modest delay could seriously jeopardize the company's financial prospects.\n\nThe company's Altman Z-Score, a measure which is designed to predict likelihoods of bankruptcy within two years, is in the so-called \"grey area\" already, indicating financial stress.\nA deal with tech giant Meta seemed to help settle some concerns, but the underlying story is still the same: Oracle needs to deliver these projects or there might be trouble.\nWhat Does This Have to Do with WBD? Larry Ellison , the CEO and Co-Founder of Oracle, was seen trying to help finance the acquisition of HBO parent Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ).\nLarry's son, David, is the CEO of media company Skydance -- which recently acquired Paramount to become Paramount Skydance.\nHowever, the Ellison Family Trust was seen as a precarious sticking point in the recent negotiations between the media giants, leading WBD to go with Netflix for a proposed takeout. Partially harming matters for the Ellisons were questions about their financing, as well as Oracle's sagging stock.\n\nThat said, counting its decline today, Oracle has now fallen more than 45% from all-time highs.\nUpdate 9:34 a.m ET Opening Bell The U.S. markets are now open. The Russell 2000 (+0.57%) has already reversed yesterday's -0.45% decline from yesterday; it's now just a matter of holding onto those gains for the day.\nIn large caps, the Dow (+0.36%) is also having a solid start to the day. The S&P 500 (+0.12%) and Nasdaq (+0.09%), by contrast, are just up a few basis points at the market open. For the former, a gain today would put an end to a three day skid for the index.\n\nThe 10Y is up 0.8 bips to 4.157%.\nOne of the foreboding themes of the Tuesday trade -- aside from so-so payrolls -- was the large decline in U.S. energy stocks. The S&P Energy sector declined 3% as domestic oil prices approached a nearly four-year low. This morning, the U.S. oil benchmark known as WTI Crude , is trading at $56 -- up about 1.5%.\nToday, the sector is up about 1%, taking a bite of some of yesterday's losses. Financials and materials are also joining in the recovery, up more than half a percentage point.\nJoining in some of that excitement are Natural Gas continuous futures (+2.96% to $4.001) and the international oil benchmark, Brent Crude (+1.46% to $59.78), which is seeing a healthy bump in its continuous futures too.\nBut since it's the holiday season, there might not be a more timely trade than Silver (+3.75% and $65.675) and Gold (+0.81% to $4,367) -- they're up again today, continuing a hefty showing from precious metals in recent trading.\n\nUpdate 7:43 a.m ET A.M. Update Good morning. Futures this morning are currently pointing to modest gains in U.S. equities this morning, potentially offsetting Tuesday's tepid payrolls market reaction.\nEarnings Today: Micron, JBS, General Mills Here are all of the companies with at least a $1 billion market cap which are slated to report today, per Nasdaq:\nEconomic Data + Events Today will be a fairly relaxed day compared with yesterday, which saw the release of the overdue October payrolls alongside November's data.

You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nUpdate 1:20 p.m ET Midday Movers Now that the midday fireworks are in the rear view, all four U.S. market indexes are facing steeper declines -- near day lows.\nThe Russell 2000 (-1.26%) is down amid sluggishness in the industrial, technology, and communication services sector today.\nThe same is at least partially true for the Nasdaq (-1.23%) and S&P 500 (-0.83%), which are facing a similar downturn as the Oracle (-4.8%) drama permeates throughout the market, weighing on shares of other semiconductor names such as Broadcom (-5.3%), Advanced Micro Devices (-3.8%), and Nvidia (-3%).\n\nToday, the Dow (-0.39%) is making the best case today. Half of the index is in the red, the other half is in the red.\nIn total, 53.8% (2,992) of U.S. issues are in decline today against 42.8% (2,379) advancing, which brings us to our midday mover list for today. We'll take a look at the top and bottom 20 equities in the market among firms with at least a $2 billion market cap :\nWinners Despite it being a bad day for AI , today's top stock is an AI-fueled biotech play called Recursion Pharmaceuticals (+17.8%), who we haven't seen atop the list in quite awhile. A one-time retail favorite, the company was upgraded by JPMorgan today, which moved it from 'neutral' to 'overweight' citing the potential of its MEK inhibitor clinical trial.\nFollowing close behind is Hut 8 (+12.5%), Anbio (+10.6%), and Via Transportation (+8.4%).\nAmong the larger firms making the list today are Elbit Systems (+4.3%), Texas Pacific Land Corporation (+5.6%), and Figma (+4.8%).\nLosers At the other end of the market, EverCommerce (-11.6%) is plummeting on some volatility . It's followed by some AI-related trades, independent power producer Bloom Energy (-10.1%) and Fermi (-9.6%).\nEven larger firms are being weighed down today by the AI jitters, including GE Vernova (-8.2%), Constellation Energy (-7.9%), and Vistra (-7.3%).\nUpdate 10:44 a.m ET More Oracle Drama Weighs on Tech Stocks Oracle is once again making itself the main character in the AI boom -- and maybe not in a good way.\nToday, the hyperscaler is declining on a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital won't go forward with funding the firm's $10 billion Michigan data center amid worries about \"tougher debt terms and the risk of delays,\" per the article.\n\nStory Continues\nThe news comes just days after sources close to Oracle said it was pushing back key data center deliveries for partner OpenAI , who has committed billions to data center projects. Oracle was made to refute reports that it was not punting on these projects and that all milestones were coming along as planned. Obviously, Blue Owl seems to have sided with the anonymous sources cited in that Bloomberg report.\n\nWhy Does It Matter? Traders have remained relatively flighty about Oracle and ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Oracle counts more than half of its performance obligations from the Sam Altman-helmed company, which remains reliant on capital infusions from venture capital to stay afloat as it burns through money.\nAnd since the latter has not put up the money upfront, the hyperscaler has taken on gobs of debt to bring its data center ambitions to life. An astonishing $25 billion of the firm's $127 billion in debt is due within just three years. And with negative free cash flow -- in fact, -$13 billion -- a modest delay could seriously jeopardize the company's financial prospects.\n\nThe company's Altman Z-Score, a measure which is designed to predict likelihoods of bankruptcy within two years, is in the so-called \"grey area\" already, indicating financial stress.\nA deal with tech giant Meta seemed to help settle some concerns, but the underlying story is still the same: Oracle needs to deliver these projects or there might be trouble.\nWhat Does This Have to Do with WBD? Larry Ellison , the CEO and Co-Founder of Oracle, was seen trying to help finance the acquisition of HBO parent Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ).\nLarry's son, David, is the CEO of media company Skydance -- which recently acquired Paramount to become Paramount Skydance.\nHowever, the Ellison Family Trust was seen as a precarious sticking point in the recent negotiations between the media giants, leading WBD to go with Netflix for a proposed takeout. Partially harming matters for the Ellisons were questions about their financing, as well as Oracle's sagging stock.\n\nThat said, counting its decline today, Oracle has now fallen more than 45% from all-time highs.\nUpdate 9:34 a.m ET Opening Bell The U.S. markets are now open. The Russell 2000 (+0.57%) has already reversed yesterday's -0.45% decline from yesterday; it's now just a matter of holding onto those gains for the day.\nIn large caps, the Dow (+0.36%) is also having a solid start to the day. The S&P 500 (+0.12%) and Nasdaq (+0.09%), by contrast, are just up a few basis points at the market open. For the former, a gain today would put an end to a three day skid for the index.\n\nThe 10Y is up 0.8 bips to 4.157%.\nOne of the foreboding themes of the Tuesday trade -- aside from so-so payrolls -- was the large decline in U.S. energy stocks. The S&P Energy sector declined 3% as domestic oil prices approached a nearly four-year low. This morning, the U.S. oil benchmark known as WTI Crude , is trading at $56 -- up about 1.5%.\nToday, the sector is up about 1%, taking a bite of some of yesterday's losses. Financials and materials are also joining in the recovery, up more than half a percentage point.\nJoining in some of that excitement are Natural Gas continuous futures (+2.96% to $4.001) and the international oil benchmark, Brent Crude (+1.46% to $59.78), which is seeing a healthy bump in its continuous futures too.\nBut since it's the holiday season, there might not be a more timely trade than Silver (+3.75% and $65.675) and Gold (+0.81% to $4,367) -- they're up again today, continuing a hefty showing from precious metals in recent trading.\n\nUpdate 7:43 a.m ET A.M. Update Good morning. Futures this morning are currently pointing to modest gains in U.S. equities this morning, potentially offsetting Tuesday's tepid payrolls market reaction.\nEarnings Today: Micron, JBS, General Mills Here are all of the companies with at least a $1 billion market cap which are slated to report today, per Nasdaq:\nEconomic Data + Events Today will be a fairly relaxed day compared with yesterday, which saw the release of the overdue October payrolls alongside November's data.

Founded by former Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) executive Chen Weiliang after he left the US chipmaker five years ago, MetaX debuted at a valuation of about $5.9 billion before surging as much as 755% intraday and closing its first session up 693%. That move lifted the value of Chen's 55-million-share stake to roughly $6.5 billion, placing his rise alongside Moore Threads Technology Co. founder Zhang Jianzhong, another former US chip executive whose fortune expanded following a recent IPO. The developments reflect how Beijing's drive to build a self-sufficient chip supply chain is reshaping both capital markets and personal balance sheets, even as geopolitical tensions remain part of the backdrop.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with AMD.\nIs AMD fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nA key element behind MetaX's rapid build-out has been its approach to talent and incentives. Chen drew heavily from his former AMD network, recruiting senior engineers and executives such as Peng Li and Yang Jian into top technical roles, alongside other ex-AMD colleagues now embedded across management. To secure this talent in a highly competitive environment, the company leaned on equity as a primary tool, distributing 461 million yuan in share-based compensation in 2024. More than 80% of MetaX's roughly 870 employees hold indirect stakes through partnership structures, a model that has turned a broad swath of its workforce into high-net-worth individuals and helped shorten the typical startup learning curve.\n\nBeneath the headline gains, MetaX is still navigating the realities of heavy investment and operational risk. The company spent more than 2.2 billion yuan on research and development from 2022 through 2024 and reported a net loss of 1.41 billion yuan in 2024, underscoring the cash burn required to narrow gaps in system-level performance and production. Revenue reached 915 million yuan in the first half of 2025, surpassing the prior full year, while management projects a possible break-even point in 2026 that depends on the competitiveness of its C500 chip against domestic rivals including Huawei, Hygon and Cambricon. Reliance on a limited customer base and on third-party foundries also leaves the supply chain exposed to policy shifts and capacity constraints, suggesting the next phase of MetaX's story could hinge on execution as much as on capital-market momentum.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Micron's Make-or-Break Moment: Can AI Hype Justify a 176% Surge?\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nMarket participants are bracing for Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) to report earnings after Wednesday's close, with the bar set high as skepticism around the AI trade begins to surface. The shares have surged 176% in 2025, ranking as the fifth-best performer in the S&P 500 and marking Micron's strongest year since 2013, well ahead of the roughly 40% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. That momentum has softened in recent sessions, with the stock down about 12% over the past four days following a Dec. 10 high, suggesting investors may be reassessing expectations ahead of the report.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Sign with MU.\nIs MU fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe company is expected to post strong growth as sustained spending on AI data centers supports demand for its high-bandwidth memory chips, but the market appears focused on whether that momentum is still accelerating. Recent sharp declines in Oracle and Broadcom, both of which fell 11% in a single session last week, have highlighted how quickly sentiment can turn on perceived AI beneficiaries. Some investors may now be adopting a more cautious stance, waiting for clearer signals on how durable data-center growth could be before re-engaging with the sector.\nValuation remains a central part of the Micron debate. Despite this year's rally, the shares trade at roughly 11 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, the lowest multiple among the 30 stocks in the semiconductor index, which trades closer to 25 times forward earnings. That discount stands out against peers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ), and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), which command significantly higher multiples. At the same time, expectations for Micron's fundamentals have been moving higher, with consensus forecasts for fiscal 2026 net earnings up 16% over the past month and more than 50% over the past quarter, while revenue estimates have risen by more than 20% over the past three months. With enthusiasm elevated and memory demand still cyclical, the upcoming earnings report could either reinforce the view that Micron is reasonably valued or test how much optimism is already reflected in the shares.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Mining stocks are also moving higher as tensions in Venezuela escalate, boosting safe-haven demand for precious metals, with silver soaring to a new all-time high.\nDovish comments today from Fed Governor Christopher Waller were supportive of stocks and bonds, as he said the US labor market is \"pretty soft,\" with close to zero job growth, and that inflation is \"pretty well anchored\" around 2%. He added that interest rates are still 50-100 basis points above neutral, and the Fed can steadily lower them with no rush.\nUS MBA weekly mortgage applications fell -3.8% in the week ended December 12, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -2.8% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index down -3.6%.

T-notes recovered from early losses today and are slightly higher due to dovish comments from Fed Governor Waller, who said the Fed can keep cutting rates as interest rates are still 50-100 bp above neutral.\nT-notes initially moved lower today on negative carryover from a plunge in Japanese 10-year bonds to an 18-year low. Also, supply pressures are weighing on T-note prices ahead of the Treasury’s $13 billion auction of 20-year T-bonds later today.\nThe steepening yield curve is bearish for T-note prices. Steepening trades occur when bond investors buy short-term government debt and sell long -term debt. The yield curve has steepened since last Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, when the Fed said it would begin purchasing up to $40 billion of short-term T-bills a month to boost liquidity in the financial system. Longer-term Treasury securities are also under pressure from concerns about inflation and the Fed’s independence.\n\nEuropean government bond yields are mixed today.

      "Content": "Exclusive-Google works to erode Nvidia's software advantage with Meta's help\n\nReuters\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nDec 17 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google is working on a new initiative to make its artificial intelligence chips better at running PyTorch, the world’s most widely used AI software framework, in a move aimed at weakening Nvidia 's longstanding dominance of the AI computing market, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe effort is part of Google's aggressive plan to make its Tensor Processing ​Units a viable alternative to Nvidia's market-leading GPUs. TPU sales have become a crucial growth engine of Google's cloud revenue as it seeks to prove to investors that its AI investments are generating returns.\nBut ‌hardware alone is not enough to spur adoption. The new initiative, known internally as “TorchTPU,” aims to remove a key barrier that has slowed adoption of TPU chips by making them fully compatible and developer-friendly for customers who have already built their tech infrastructure using PyTorch software, the ‌sources said. Google is also considering open-sourcing parts of the software to speed uptake among customers, some of the people said.\n\nCompared with earlier attempts to support PyTorch on TPUs, Google has devoted more organizational focus, resources and strategic importance to TorchTPU, as demand grows from companies that want to adopt the chips but view the software stack as a bottleneck, the sources said.\nPyTorch, an open-source project heavily supported by Meta Platforms, is one of the most widely used tools for developers who make AI models. In Silicon Valley, very few developers write every line of code that chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices or Google will actually execute.\nInstead, those developers rely on tools like PyTorch, which is a ⁠collection of pre-written code libraries and frameworks that automate many common tasks in ‌developing AI software. Originally released in 2016, PyTorch’s history has been closely tied to Nvidia’s development of CUDA, the software that some Wall Street analysts regard as the company’s strongest shield against competitors.\n\nNvidia’s engineers have spent years ensuring that software developed with PyTorch runs as fast and efficiently as possible on its chips. Google, by contrast, has long ‍had its internal armies of software developers use a different code framework called Jax, and its TPU chips use a tool called XLA to make that code run efficiently. Much of Google’s own AI software stack and performance optimization has been built around Jax, widening the gap between how Google uses its chips and how customers want to use them.\nA Google Cloud spokesperson did not comment on the specifics of the project, but confirmed to Reuters that the move would provide customers with choice.\n\nStory Continues\n\"We ​are seeing massive, accelerating demand for both our TPU and GPU infrastructure,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our focus is providing the flexibility and scale developers need, regardless of the hardware they choose to build on.\"\nTPU FOR CUSTOMERS\nAlphabet had ‌long reserved the lion’s share of its own chips, or TPUs, for in-house use only. That changed in 2022, when Google’s cloud computing unit successfully lobbied to oversee the group that sells TPUs. The move drastically increased Google Cloud's allocation of TPUs and as customers' interest in AI has grown, Google has sought to capitalize by ramping up production and sales of TPUs to external customers.\n\nBut the mismatch between the PyTorch frameworks used by most of the world’s AI developers and the Jax frameworks that Google’s chips are currently most finely tuned to run means that most developers cannot easily adopt Google’s chips and get them to perform as well as Nvidia’s without undertaking significant, extra engineering work. Such work takes time and money in the fast-paced AI race.\nIf successful, Google's “TorchTPU” initiative could significantly reduce switching costs for companies that want alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia’s dominance has been reinforced ⁠not only by its hardware but by its CUDA software ecosystem, which is deeply embedded in PyTorch and has become the ​default method by which companies train and run large AI models.\n\nEnterprise customers have been telling Google that TPUs are harder to adopt ​for AI workloads because they historically required developers to switch to Jax, a machine-learning framework favored internally at Google, rather than PyTorch, which most AI developers already use, the sources said.\nJOINT EFFORTS WITH META\nTo speed development, Google is working closely with Meta, the creator and steward of PyTorch, according to the sources. The two tech giants have been discussing deals ‍for Meta to access more TPUs, a move first reported ⁠by The Information.\nEarly offerings for Meta were structured as Google-managed services, in which customers like Meta installed Google's chips designed to run Google software and models, with Google providing operational support. Meta has a strategic interest in working on software that makes it easier to run TPUs, in a bid to lower inference costs and diversify its AI infrastructure away from Nvidia’s GPUs to gain negotiating power, the people ⁠said.\n\nMeta declined to comment.\nThis year, Google has begun selling TPUs directly into customers’ data centers rather than limiting access to its own cloud. Amin Vahdat, a Google veteran, was named head of AI infrastructure this month, reporting directly to CEO Sundar Pichai.\nGoogle needs that ‌infrastructure both to run its own AI products, including the Gemini chatbot and AI-powered search, and to supply customers of Google Cloud, which sells access to TPUs to companies such as ‌Anthropic.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu, Kenrick Cai and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Exclusive-How China built its ‘Manhattan Project’ to rival the West in AI chips\n\nFanny Potkin\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:17 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nINTC\n\nSSNLF\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nBy Fanny Potkin\nSINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence , smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. ​The smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\nNevertheless, China still faces ‌major technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government ‌initiative to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.\n\nStory Continues\nChinese electronics giant Huawei plays a key role coordinating a web of companies and state research institutes across the country involving thousands of engineers, according to the two people and a third source.\nThe people described it as China's version of the Manhattan Project, the U.S. wartime effort to develop the atomic bomb.\n\n“The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,” one of the people said. \"China wants the United States 100% kicked out of its supply chains.\"\nHuawei, the State Council of China, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to requests for comment.\nUntil now, only one company has mastered EUV technology: ASML, headquartered in Veldhoven, Netherlands. Its machines, which cost around $250 million, are indispensable for manufacturing the most advanced chips designed by companies like Nvidia and AMD—and produced by chipmakers such as TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.\nASML built its first working prototype of EUV technology in 2001, and told Reuters it took nearly two decades and billions of euros in R&D spending before it produced its first commercially-available chips in 2019.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small ⁠feat,” ASML told Reuters in a statement.\nASML's EUV systems are currently available to U.S. allies including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.\nStarting in 2018, the United States began pressuring ‌the Netherlands to block ASML from selling EUV systems to China. The restrictions expanded in 2022, when the Biden administration imposed sweeping export controls designed to cut off China's access to advanced semiconductor technology.\nThe controls targeted not just EUV systems but also older deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines that produce less-advanced chips like Huawei’s, aiming to keep China at least a generation behind in chipmaking capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said the Trump Administration has strengthened enforcement of export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and is working with partners \"to close loopholes as technology advances.”\nThe Dutch Ministry of Defence said the Netherlands is developing policies requiring “knowledge institutions” to perform personnel screenings to prevent access to sensitive technology “by individuals that have ill intentions or who are at risk of being pressured.”\nExport restrictions ‍have slowed China's progress toward semiconductor self-sufficiency for years, and constrained advanced chip production at Huawei, the two people and a third person said.\nThe sources spoke on condition they not be identified due to the confidentiality of the project.\n\nCHINA'S MANHATTAN PROJECT\nOne veteran Chinese engineer from ASML recruited to the project was surprised to find that his generous signing bonus came with an identification card issued under a false name, according to one of the people, who was familiar with his recruitment.\nOnce inside, he recognized other former ASML colleagues who were also working under aliases and was instructed to use their fake names at work to maintain secrecy, the person said. Another person independently confirmed that recruits were given fake IDs to conceal their identities from other workers inside the secure facility.\nThe guidance was clear, the two people said: Classified under national security, no one outside the compound could know what they were building—or that they were there at all.\n\nThe team includes recently retired, Chinese-born former ASML engineers and scientists—prime recruitment targets because they possess sensitive technical knowledge but face fewer professional constraints after leaving the company, ​the people said.\nTwo current ASML employees of Chinese nationality in the Netherlands told Reuters they have been approached by recruiters from Huawei since at least 2020.\nHuawei did not respond to requests for comment.\nEuropean privacy laws limit ASML's ability to track former employees. Though employees sign non-disclosure agreements, enforcing them across borders has proven difficult.\nASML won an $845 million judgment in 2019 against a former Chinese engineer accused of stealing trade secrets, but the defendant filed for bankruptcy and continues to ‌operate in Beijing with Chinese government support, according to court documents.\n\nASML told Reuters that it “vigilantly guards” trade secrets and confidential information.\n\"While ASML cannot control or restrict where former employees work, all employees are bound by the confidentiality clauses in their contracts,\" the company said, and it has \"successfully pursued legal action in response to the theft of trade secrets.”\nReuters was unable to determine if any legal actions have been taken against former ASML employees involved in China’s lithography program.\nThe company said it safeguards EUV knowledge by ensuring only select employees can access the information even inside the company.\nDutch intelligence warned in an April report that China \"used extensive espionage programmes in its attempts to obtain advanced technology and knowledge from Western countries,\" including recruiting \"Western scientists and employees of high-tech companies.”\n\nThe ASML veterans made the breakthrough in Shenzhen possible, the people said. Without their intimate knowledge of the technology, reverse-engineering the machines would have been nearly impossible.\nTheir recruitment was part of an aggressive drive China launched in 2019 for semiconductor experts working abroad, offering signing bonuses that started at 3 million to 5 million yuan ($420,000 to $700,000) and home-purchase subsidies, according to a Reuters review of government policy documents.\nRecruits included Lin Nan, ASML's former head of light source technology, whose team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Shanghai Institute of Optics has filed eight patents on EUV light sources in 18 months, according to patent filings.\nThe Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics did not respond to requests for comment. Lin could not be reached for comment.\n\nTwo additional people familiar with China’s recruitment efforts said some naturalized citizens of other countries were given Chinese passports and allowed to maintain dual citizenship.\nChina officially prohibits dual citizenship and did not answer questions on issuing passports.\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nINSIDE CHINA'S EUV FAB\nASML's most advanced EUV systems are roughly the size of a school bus, and weigh 180 tons. After failed attempts to replicate its size, the prototype inside the Shenzhen lab became many times larger to improve its ⁠power, according to the two people.\nThe Chinese prototype is crude compared to ASML's machines but operational enough for testing, the people said.\nChina's prototype lags behind ASML's machines largely because researchers have struggled to obtain optical systems like those from Germany's Carl Zeiss AG, one of ASML's ​key suppliers, the two people said.\n\nZeiss declined to comment.\nThe machines fire lasers at molten tin 50,000 times per second, generating plasma at 200,000 degrees Celsius. The light is focused using mirrors that take months to produce, according to Zeiss' website.\nChina's top research institutes have played key roles in developing homegrown ​alternatives, according to the two people.\nThe Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIOMP) achieved a breakthrough in integrating extreme-ultraviolet light into the prototype's optical system, enabling it to become operational in early 2025, one of the people said, though the optics still require significant refinement.\nCIOMP did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a March online recruitment call on its website, the institute said it was offering \"uncapped\" salaries to PhD lithography researchers and research grants worth up to 4 million yuan ($560,000) plus 1 million yuan ($140,000) in personal subsidies.\n\nJeff Koch, an analyst at research firm SemiAnalysis and a former ASML engineer, said China will have achieved \"meaningful progress” if the “light source has enough power, is reliable, and doesn’t generate too much contamination.”\n\"No doubt this is technically feasible, it's ‍just a question of timeline,\" he said. \"China has the advantage that commercial EUV now exists, so they aren't starting from zero.\"\nTo ⁠get the required parts, China is salvaging components from older ASML machines and sourcing parts from ASML suppliers through secondhand markets, the two people said.\nNetworks of intermediary companies are sometimes used to mask the ultimate buyer, the people said.\nExport-restricted components from Japan’s Nikon and Canon are being used for the prototype, one of the people and an additional source said.\n\nNikon declined to comment. Canon said it was not aware of such reports. The Japanese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nInternational banks regularly auction older semiconductor fabrication equipment, the sources said. Auctions in China sold older ASML lithography equipment as recently as October 2025, according to a review of listings on Alibaba Auction, an Alibaba-owned platform.\nA team of around 100 recent university graduates is focused on reverse-engineering components from both EUV and DUV lithography machines, according to the people.\nEach worker's desk is filmed by an individual camera ⁠to document their efforts to disassemble and reassemble parts—work the people described as key to China's lithography efforts.\n\nStaffers who successfully reassemble a component receive bonuses, the people said.\nHUAWEI SCIENTISTS SLEEP ON-SITE\nWhile the EUV project is run by the Chinese government, Huawei is involved in every step of the supply chain from chip design and fabrication equipment to manufacturing and final integration into products like smartphones, according to four people familiar with Huawei’s operations.\nCEO Ren Zhengfei briefs senior Chinese leaders on progress, according to one of the people.\nThe U.S. placed Huawei on an entity list in 2019, banning American companies from ‌doing business with them without a license.\nHuawei has deployed employees to offices, fabrication plants, and research centers across the country for the effort. Employees assigned to semiconductor teams often sleep on-site and are barred from returning home during the work week, with phone access restricted for teams handling more sensitive tasks, according to the people.\nInside Huawei, few employees know the scope of this work. \"The teams are kept isolated from ‌each other to protect the confidentiality of the project,\" one of the people said. “They don't know what the other teams work on.”\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore, additional reporting by Alexandra Alper in Washington, editing by Ken Li and Michael Learmonth)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Its intelligent solutions–Generative Intelligence (Solar LLM) and Document Intelligence for extraction on any document–are transforming workflows for some of the world's largest enterprises, optimizing repetitive tasks while preserving human oversight and complex decision making.\nUpstage raised $45 million earlier this year in a Series B bridge round, bringing total funding to $157 million, to expand its growth in the U.S. Notably, the AI company secured funding from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and AMD in August, becoming a minority investor in Upstage.\nSince the company's U.S. launch, Upstage landed on three CB Insights' industry lists, AI 100 , InsurTech 50 , and FinTech 100 , and showcased its leadership as subject matter experts at five major insurance industry events. The company has quickly established its presence in the InsurTech ecosystem with appearances at ITC Vegas, InsurTech Insights, and InsurTech NY. Additionally, Upstage's U.S. CEO, Kasey Roh, was a featured speaker at this year's AWS re:Invent Conference where she shared her insights on scaling real-world AI on a panel with AMD .\n\n\"Upstage's first year in North America has brought our transformative AI solutions to the U.S. insurance and financial services industries,\" said Kasey Roh, U.S. CEO of Upstage . \"Our technology is particularly advantageous for these legacy industries that still rely heavily on manual document processing. Upstage's superpower is that our technology hinges on human decision making, forging a symbiotic relationship between AI and people. This crucial distinction is what sets Upstage apart from other AI companies.\"\nUpstage's domain-specific models distinguish it from an industry flooded with newcomers, many of whom have yet to show tangible results. The company has spent half of the last decade building its proprietary model stack, giving them a distinct edge and headstart from companies modifying third-party or open-source foundation models.\n\nTheir technology's ability to turn any type of unstructured document into structured data is unique and essential for insurance companies handling large amounts of manual document processing. It adapts in real time while automatically flagging uncertain extractions while keeping humans in the loop. This feature is unique and critical, significantly reducing AI hallucinations that put companies at extreme risk. These human corrections are part of an automatic feedback loop for the model, learning from human validation to improve its accuracy over time. The technology provides companies with a zero-training, high-accuracy solution with no setup, templates, or retraining.\n\nStory continues\nThe proof of the company's success is in the numbers, its technology has a 95%+ accuracy across complex document types and formats. Upstage has served Fortune 500 companies in Korea, including Samsung, and now provides their solutions in the U.S. to enterprise and mid-market companies processing millions of pages every day.\n\nWhat Upstage's customers have to say about the company\nfurther highlights its success:\n\"Once Upstage's solution was in our underwriters' hands, there was no taking it away. The tool landed at exactly the right moment—as our team was working to keep up with 30% volume growth without additional headcount. Our VP of Underwriting made it clear: she wasn't giving up the invoice extraction tool 'over her dead body.' Within days, all 18 underwriters were benefiting from the solution.\"\n— Steven Beauchem , VP of Digital Strategy at Amwins, a leading global specialty insurance distributor.\n\"We've been able to achieve 95%+ accuracy on data [extraction] as well as other unstructured data in the underwriting process. Before, it took our team 30 minutes to an hour to review an application [whereas] today it could take us less than 10 minutes. This has been extremely impactful to our ability to manage a larger volume of submissions without sacrificing the depth of our analysis or the nuance that we gain from that information.\"\n— Gabriel Mayer , Founder of Tricura Insurance Group, an InsurTech MGU focused on providing liability coverage and technology to Senior Living Communities across the US.\n\n\"We built the MVP using a random GitHub parser, DocuClipper, and ChatGPT just to make it work. When I discovered Upstage, we realized we could replace the entire patchwork with a single, clean API. That decision changed everything — faster results, higher accuracy, zero maintenance.\"\n— Michael Rodriguez , Founder, Best Option Co., a software development company that brings AI solutions to help small businesses streamline operations and drive revenue.\nUpstage AI is poised to make an even bigger impact in North America in the coming year as it continues to partner with top companies in the insurance and financial services industries. The company is expected to bridge the gap between AI and human interaction to transform operations for legacy carriers and startups alike.\n\nAbout Upstage\nUpstage is building the future of enterprise AI through domain-specific language models and intelligent tools designed for high-impact business use.

      "Content": "Nvidia vs AMD: Which AI Chipmaker Will Lead the Next Decade of Compute?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Nvidia has been the leading AI chip designer since the start of the AI boom, but AMD has been gaining ground.\nBoth companies design the chips powering crucial AI tasks.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the \"go-to\" source for artificial intelligence (AI) chips since the start of the AI boom, and this is thanks to two things: the company's first-to-market advantage and the strong performance of its chips. All of this has generated enormous earnings growth, with revenue and profit reaching record levels, and mind-boggling share price gains -- the stock has advanced more than 900% over three years.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't alone in the exciting AI space. It faces competition from other chip designers such as Broadcom and even some of its own customers that have developed their own chips, like Amazon , for example. But one name in particular represents perhaps the biggest threat to Nvidia's dominance, and that's Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) , a company that's been quickly advancing with new high-powered chips and attractive pricing. And the coming years could represent a crucial moment for chip companies, as Nvidia predicts AI infrastructure spending may reach as much as $4 trillion.\nWhich of these two AI chip designers will lead the next decade of compute? Let's find out.\nNvidia's path to leadership First, let's consider Nvidia's path to leadership and how it's managed to stay ahead of rivals so far. As mentioned, Nvidia entered the market first with its supercharged graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips that power the most crucial of AI tasks from training to inferencing . This offered the company the opportunity to build relationships with customers, and for customers to be won over by the quality of Nvidia's products.\n\nNvidia maintained this leadership by continuing to innovate on a regular basis, and in recent years, it committed to annual updates to its top chips.\nAMD made AI a focus with the launch of its Instinct line of accelerators back in 2017, and since then has added to GPU offerings, gaining in performance and therefore becoming a stronger rival for AI powerhouse Nvidia.\nIn the most recent earnings report, the company delivered a 36% increase in revenue to a record level of $9.2 billion, and chief executive officer Lisa Su said quarterly performance and guidance for the next quarter marked \"a clear step up in our growth trajectory.\" Demand from data center customers for the company's EPYC processors and Instinct AI accelerators drove gains in the period.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD and OpenAI It's also important to note that AMD recently signed a deal with OpenAI for the deployment of six gigawatts of AMD GPUs, with the first gigawatt set to roll out in the second half of next year. (OpenAI also has a deal with Nvidia for the deployment of 10 gigawatts of Nvidia GPUs.)\nThough AMD has come a long way in a short period of time and surely will continue to gain many orders for its GPUs, I don't see the company unseating Nvidia and driving compute in the coming decade. And here's why: Nvidia truly has built out a massive ecosystem within the world of AI, offering everything needed to do the AI job, from GPUs to high-performance networking equipment and software, as well as platforms for specific industries like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and robotics. And within those industry platforms, Nvidia's built tools designed to help customers reach their goals.\n\nThough AMD also offers a significant array of products and services, it's not as far-reaching as that of its bigger competitor.\nLeading the next decade of AI All of this makes Nvidia better positioned to lead the next decade of compute -- but this doesn't mean AMD won't benefit from the upcoming phases of AI growth. AMD's chips and systems are powerful, pricing is competitive, and the company has seen demand take off in recent quarters. Major chip customers, like Amazon, just to name one, buy GPUs from a variety of chip designers -- not just from Nvidia. In its recent earnings call, Amazon chief Andy Jassy said Amazon Web Services continues \"to work closely with chip partners like Nvidia, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as well as with AMD and Intel .\"\n\nAll of this means that AMD may have plenty of very of bright days ahead, but considering the empire Nvidia has carefully built over time and its commitment to innovation, I expect this AI giant to keep powering the AI revolution.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Should Nvidia Worry About AMD and Google Breathing Down Its Neck in 2026?\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 11:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points AMD has an ambitious growth strategy and is already winning big AI chip deals.\nAlphabet's Google Cloud is making significant inroads in the AI chip market with its TPUs.\nNvidia shouldn't ignore the challenge from AMD and Google, but it's likely to continue dominating the market for now.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nLions reign as king of the jungle (although \"king of the savanna\" would probable more more accurate). Elvis is still the king of rock and roll. Michael Jackson remains the king of pop. However, if the subject is chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) applications, I'd say Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the king.\nBut the king's perch on the throne just might be at least a little shaky as the new year approaches. Should Nvidia worry about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) breathing down its neck in 2026?\nAMD's ambitious plans In November, AMD revealed a strategy to lead the $1 trillion AI and high-performance computing market. The company plans to deliver a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of greater than 35% over the next three to five years. AMD aims to achieve a revenue CAGR of more than 60% for its data center business.\n\nSuch ambitious plans are reminiscent of baseball legend Babe Ruth pointing to deep center field. You only make that kind of move unless you're confident you can back it up. Ruth, of course, proceeded to hit a home run. Can AMD deliver on its growth strategy? It's a definite maybe.\nThe company is already making progress toward its goal. For example, ChatGPT developer OpenAI will use AMD's Instinct MI450 GPUs in its next-generation AI infrastructure. The first deployment is scheduled for the second half of 2026. This deal also includes AMD issuing warrants for OpenAI to buy up to 160 million shares.\nAI cloud powerhouse Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is also using AMD's GPUs and CPUs with its first publicly available AI supercluster. The initial deployment is set for the third quarter of 2026. Privately held Cohere is integrating AMD's GPUs with its enterprise AI suite.\n\nAMD also won two major contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy. The agency will use AMD's GPUs and CPUs in its Lux and Discovery AI supercomputers.\nGoogle's TPUs are making inroads, too GPUs aren't the only game in town for powering AI systems, though. Alphabet's Google Cloud unit is also making inroads with its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) revealed last year that its Apple Intelligence generative AI functionality was trained using Google's TPUs rather than Nvidia's GPUs. Google, of course, also uses its TPUs with the widely acclaimed Google Gemini 3.0 large language model (LLM).\n\nStory Continues\nMore AI leaders are also turning to TPUs. Anthropic is spending tens of billions of dollars to expand its AI compute capacity in 2026 using Google's TPUs. The deal with Google is Anthropic's largest purchase of TPUs so far.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is reportedly in talks to use Google's TPUs in its data centers starting in 2027. In the past, Meta has been a major buyer of Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nGoogle could gain more traction in the AI chip market next year, thanks to its new Ironwood TPUs. Ironwood is four times more powerful than Google's previous highest-performing TPU.\nShould Nvidia worry? Both AMD and Google appear to be gaining momentum in the AI chip market. Should Nvidia worry? Yes and no.\nIt's always smart for companies to constantly monitor the competition and not rest on their laurels. Nvidia's management should recognize that its market dominance isn't guaranteed to last forever.\nHowever, I don't think Nvidia's top spot in the AI market is in jeopardy. The company doesn't, either, as evidenced by a post on X last month:\n\nIn my view, the AI chip market is large enough to support multiple winners. Nvidia will almost certainly remain the king for at least several more years. But either AMD or Google could deserve the title of crown prince.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "MetaX soars 700% in debut as China AI chips push lures investors\n\nReuters\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 6:19 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nSHANGHAI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - MetaX Integrated Circuits jumped 700% in its Shanghai market debut as the Chinese AI chipmaker tapped into strong momentum triggered by Beijing's push to reduce reliance on chips from U.S. firms Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ).\nFounded by former AMD executives, MetaX raised roughly $600 million in an initial public ​offering last week, days after larger rival Moore Threads debuted with a 400% pop.\n\nMetaX opened at 700 yuan a share in Shanghai versus an IPO price of ‌104.66 yuan, before surging as high as 895 yuan, defying persistent AI bubble concerns in other markets. The stock ended the trading session at 829.9 yuan, up 693%.\n\"It's another IPO tale in China that turns a crow into ‌a phoenix,\" said fund manager Yang Tingwu at Tongheng Investment.\nThe price surge \"creates huge arbitrage opportunities\" for pre-IPO investors, Yang said, and \"we're likely witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years\".\nMakers of artificial intelligence (AI) chips are rushing to sell shares in China to capitalise on interest generated by a government drive to boost local production in competition with the U.S.\n\n\"AI and semiconductors are key areas of competition in the Sino-U.S. tech rivalry,\" Guotai Haitong Securities said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing. \"Against the backdrop of geopolitical tension, AI chipmaking has huge growth potential,\" as China seeks to achieve self-sufficiency.\nResearcher ⁠Frost & Sullivan forecast China AI chip sales to top $189 billion ‌by 2029 versus $54 billion in 2026.\nPOLICYMAKERS PUSH AI SELF-SUFFICIENCY MetaX, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs), raised 4.2 billion yuan ($596 million) last week in a share sale that was more than 4,000 times oversubscribed by retail investors.\nThe IPO - China's sixth biggest so far this year, according to KPMG - priced the money-losing ‍startup at 50 times its 2024 sales. That compared with a multiple of 34 for Nvidia and 14 for AMD, MetaX said in a pre-listing statement.\n\nMetaX's debut catapulted the value of the five-year-old startup to more than 300 billion yuan ($42.58 billion) and boosted the wealth of founder and major shareholder Chen Weiliang, 49.\nAfter working for AMD Shanghai for 13 years, Chen founded MetaX with a mission to \"contribute to China's rejuvenation ​and national prosperity.\" The founding team also included Peng Li and Yang Jian, both former AMD engineers.\n\"The company is a leading GPU maker in China thanks to its AMD gene,\" ‌Li Hui, analyst at Huajin Securities, said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing.\n\nStory Continues\n\"It will likely benefit from China's continuous push to replace foreign suppliers using indigenous technology.\"\nMetaX, which controls 1% of China's AI chip market, projects the company's sales to more than double this year due to the tech self-reliance drive, and expects to break even as early as next year.\n\nCHINESE AI CHIPMAKERS RUSH FOR IPOS MetaX's market debut comes after Moore Threads ( 688795.SS ), dubbed by analysts as \"China's Nvidia\", raised $1.1 billion in its Shanghai IPO in late November.\n\nOn Monday, AI chip startup Biren Technology won regulatory approval to sell shares publicly in Hong Kong, while rival Kunlunxin also plans an IPO in the city. Another AI chipmaker, Enflame, has hired Citic Securities to prepare for a flotation.\n\"Chinese ⁠policymakers are greenlighting IPOs for AI chipmakers to support home-grown advanced technology,\" said fund manager Yuan Yuwei ​at Trinity Synergy Investments in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Domestic chipmakers lag U.S. rivals, but if they can raise tens or hundreds ​of billions to spend on talent, you cannot rule out their breakthrough.\"\nIPO fundraising in China jumped 23% in 2025 from a year earlier to exceed 160 billion yuan, according to KPMG, with 23% of the proceeds going to the technology, media and telecom sector.\nSIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY GAP MetaX flagged a number of ‍risk factors in its IPO prospectus, including supply ⁠chain disruption from U.S. technology restrictions as well as its significant technology gap with Nvidia and AMD.\nNvidia is considering adding production capacity for its H200 AI chips due to strong orders from Chinese clients, after U.S. President Donald Trump this month greenlighted export of Nvidia's second-fastest AI chips to China.\n\nIn the home GPU market, MetaX competes with ⁠Moore Threads as well as Hygon Information Technology and Biren.\nIn the so-called ASIC chip business, it competes with Cambricon, Huawei Technologies' HiSilicon, Baidu's Kunlunxin and Alibaba Group's T-Head.\n\"MetaX's technology lags Moore Threads, and it faces stiff competition ‌from Huawei and Alibaba,\" said Yuan of Trinity Synergy Investments.\nThere will be room to improve, \"but under the current circumstances, there's definitely froth in its share price.\"\n($1 = ‌7.0458 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee, Christopher Cushing and Thomas Derpinghaus)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
