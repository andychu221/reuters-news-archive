      "Content": "Nvidia, joining Big Tech deal spree, to license Groq technology, hire executives\n\nStephen Nellis\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GROQ.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nCESY.PVT\n\nBy Stephen Nellis\nDec 24 (Reuters) - Nvidia has agreed to license chip technology from startup Groq and hire away its CEO, a veteran of Alphabet's Google, Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday.\nThe deal follows a familiar pattern ​in recent years where the world's biggest technology firms pay large sums in deals with promising startups to take their ‌technology and talent but stop short of formally acquiring the target.\n\nGroq specializes in what is known as inference, where artificial intelligence models that have already been trained respond ‌to requests from users. While Nvidia dominates the market for training AI models, it faces much more competition in inference, where traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices have aimed to challenge it as well as startups such as Groq and Cerebras Systems.\nNvidia has agreed to a \"non-exclusive\" license to Groq's technology, Groq said. It said its founder Jonathan Ross, who helped Google start its AI chip program, as well as Groq ⁠President Sunny Madra and other members of its ‌engineering team, will join Nvidia.\nA person close to Nvidia confirmed the licensing agreement.\nGroq did not disclose financial details of the deal. CNBC reported that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Groq for $20 billion in cash, but neither ‍Nvidia nor Groq commented on the report. Groq said in its blog post that it will continue to operate as an independent company with Simon Edwards as CEO and that its cloud business will continue operating.\n\nIn similar recent deals, Microsoft 's top AI executive came through a $650 million deal with a startup that ​was billed as a licensing fee, and Meta spent $15 billion to hire Scale AI's CEO without acquiring the entire firm. Amazon ‌hired away founders from Adept AI, and Nvidia did a similar deal this year. The deals have faced scrutiny by regulators, though none has yet been unwound.\n\"Antitrust would seem to be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive (even as Groq’s leadership and, we would presume, technical talent move over to Nvidia),\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday after Groq's announcement. And Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's \"relationship with the Trump administration appears among the strongest of ⁠the key US tech companies.\"\n\nGroq more than doubled its valuation to $6.9 billion from $2.8 ​billion in August last year, following a $750 million funding round in September.\nGroq is ​one of a number of upstarts that do not use external high-bandwidth memory chips, freeing them from the memory crunch affecting the global chip industry. The approach, which uses a form of on-chip memory called SRAM, helps ‍speed up interactions with chatbots and ⁠other AI models but also limits the size of the model that can be served.\n\nStory Continues\nGroq's primary rival in the approach is Cerebras Systems, which Reuters this month reported plans to go public as soon as next year. Groq and Cerebras have ⁠signed large deals in the Middle East.\nNvidia's Huang spent much of his biggest keynote speech of 2025 arguing that Nvidia would be able to maintain its lead as ‌AI markets shift from training to inference.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese ‌in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, Matthew Lewis and William Mallard)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "A Big China Catalyst Could Be Coming for AMD Stock in 2026. Should You Buy Shares Now?\n\nPathikrit Bose\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 11:42 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nBABA\n\nNVDA\n\nIt looks like after Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is next in line to rehash a deal to resume the sales of its chips to China. After CEO Lisa Su had a meeting with China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao in Beijing last week, reports have emerged that the country's tech giant Alibaba (BABA) is mulling ordering some of AMD's MI308 GPUs. According to this report, Alibaba could order between 40,000 and 50,000 of these GPUs. This could imply a revenue windfall in the range of $600 million to $1.25 billion for AMD.\n\nBut, before one jumps the gun over here, there are some unpleasant facts that one must consider. Firstly, though the U.S. has approved the sale of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, the Chinese regulators have not yet given their approval. So, the chances of AMD getting approval are also low at this point. Secondly, Alibaba is itself a chipmaker, although its chips are more of the ASIC kind rather than AMD's general-purpose chips. This means the latter has broader use cases than Alibaba's chips, which are optimized for its native cloud ecosystems and inference workloads.\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\n$800 for Tesla Stock Could Be Reality in 2026. Here’s Why.\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nHowever, amid this development, where does AMD stand as an investment option now? It should be pretty high. Let's find out why.\nAMD's Robust Financials With a market cap of about $350 billion, AMD seems like a minnow in front of its larger peer, Nvidia. However, on the basis of share price performance, the AMD stock, with a rally of nearly 78%, has outperformed Nvidia's uptick of 37.1% this year by a considerable margin. But AMD is not just a short-term phenomenon; the company has been growing its revenue and earnings at a healthy clip for a while now.\nAMD has strung together a good five-year run, pushing revenue and earnings higher at compound rates of 29.94% and 28.93%. Notably, the most recent quarter fit right into that pattern, coming in stronger than Wall Street figures.\nQ3 sales hit $9.25 billion, 36% above the year-earlier mark. The core data center segment reported sales of $4.3 billion, implying a 22% growth from last year. Client and gaming put up the biggest jump, however, rising 73% on an annual basis to $4 billion.\nMeanwhile, EPS moved up by 30% in the same period to $1.20, outpacing the $1.17 consensus and stretching the company's run of beats to four quarters straight.\n\nStory Continues\nCash flow stood out as well. Operating cash flow shot up to $1.8 billion, almost three times the $628 million posted in the same quarter last year. Overall, AMD wrapped up September with $4.81 billion in cash, easily topping the $873 million in short-term debt and $2.35 billion in longer-term debt.\nHowever, AMD continues to trade at heady valuations when compared to the industry averages. Its forward P/E, P/S, and P/CF of 54.21, 10.30, and 54.12 are all higher than the sector medians of 24.37, 3.40, and 20.36, respectively.\n\nOptimism Abounds Since my previous analysis on AMD, previewing the company's Financial Analyst Day event on Nov. 11, the company's stock is down 10.3%. However, the case for investing in it may have only gotten stronger amid all the ambitious targets the management aims to hit in the coming years. First up is CEO Lisa Su's assertion that the data center market is set to reach a trillion dollars by 2030, an increase from her earlier projection of a $500 billion market by 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, on a company-specific basis, AMD has targeted a revenue CAGR of >35%, operating margins of >35%, and an annual EPS of $20 in the next 3-5 years, with data center AI revenue exceeding 80% CAGR in the same period. The targets may seem a bit steep, but Lisa Su has walked the walk on many occasions for more than a decade now, with the share price jumping by more than 80 times in her tenure, creating enormous wealth for shareholders.\nMoreover, AMD's GPUs aren't the only thing picking up speed; the full stack around them is growing fast, heading toward complete rack-level setups like Helios, MI400, and MI450. Software is keeping pace, too, with ROCm 7 making it easier to move workloads between systems. Notably, the MI500 lineup is already slated for 2027, so the roadmap looks loaded for years.\n\nOutside pure accelerators, the upcoming “Venice” CPUs and AMD's networking gear open up fresh growth lanes inside data centers.\nIn the bigger picture, what really matters is how AMD has spread its bets across platforms. CPUs, GPUs, adaptive chips, and networking all connect like parts of one machine, where nothing stands alone. That setup cuts the risk from any single trend swinging and lets the company shift gears quickly as AI designs change.\nAnalyst Opinion on AMD Stock Thus, analysts have deemed the stock to be a consensus “Moderate Buy,” with a mean target price of $288.87. This indicates an upside potential of about 34.2% from current levels. Out of 43 analysts covering the stock, 28 have a “Strong Buy” rating, three have a “Moderate Buy” rating, and 12 have a “Hold” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The leak, shared by YouTube channel RedGamingTec, suggests the chip will combine Intel CPUs with Nvidia RTX graphics in a single design.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nSerpent Lake is expected to pair Intel's upcoming Titan Lake CPU architecture with Nvidia's RTX Rubin graphics, manufactured on TSMC's 3-nanometer process. The chip is reportedly aimed at competing with AMD's Strix Halo by delivering stronger graphics performance in high-end laptops.\nOne notable feature is memory bandwidth. The design is said to support up to 16 channels of LPDDR6 memory, a move intended to avoid bottlenecks that have limited graphics performance in competing processors.\nThe leak appears to offer the first real glimpse of what Intel and Nvidia's $5 billion partnership could produce. While Intel says it remains committed to its own Arc graphics roadmap, Serpent Lake points to deeper collaboration between the two companies, with a potential launch in late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Intel Rides on Strong Gross Margin Expansion: Will it Sustain?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:14 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nAMD\n\nNVDA\n\nASUUY\n\n2353.TW\n\nIntel Corporation INTC reported a non-GAAP gross profit of $5.45 billion during the third quarter of 2025, up from $2.39 billion a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin improves to 40% from 18% a year ago. The figure exceeded management guidance by 4%. The uptick was driven by multiple factors such as higher revenues, a favorable product mix and lower inventory reserves.\n\nIt is witnessing solid traction in the Client Computing Group. In the third quarter, the company reported revenues of $8.53 billion from this segment, up from $8.16 billion in the year-ago quarter. A rebounding PC market backed by growing adoption of Windows 11 PCs is a major growth driver.\n\nMoreover, it has also gained solid market traction in the growing AI PC market. Major PC manufacturers such as HP, Dell, ASUS, Acer and Samsung are collaborating with Intel to develop next-gen AI PCs. This is driving growth in the Client Computing Group and boosting gross margin.\n\nIntel has made significant developments in its cost discipline initiatives and streamlined its portfolio to enhance efficiency across its operations. In the third quarter, the company’s cost of sales decreased to $8.43 billion, down from $11.28 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring? Intel faces competition from Advanced Micro Devices AMD and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA in the semiconductor space. In the third quarter, AMD reported a non-GAAP gross profit of $4.99 billion, up from $3.65 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 54%, up 40 basis points year over year, while it improved from 43.3% reported in Q2. Revenue growth and a healthy product mix are propelling the gross margin.\n\nNVIDIA reported a Non-GAAP gross profit of $41.9 billion, up from $26.3 billion a year ago, with respective margins of 73.6% and 75%. The ongoing transition from offering Hopper HGX systems to Blackwell full-scale data center solutions is affecting gross margin. Sequentially, NVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin improved 90 basis points as Blackwell ramped with an improved mix and cost structure.\n\nINTC’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Intel has rallied 78.2% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 28.5%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/book ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 1.48 book value, lower than 32.65 of the industry average.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 13.33% to 34 cents, while those for 2026 have declined 9.38% to 58 cents over the past 58 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory Continues\nIntel stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Micron Technology and BigBear.ai\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:42 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nBBAI\n\nMU\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 24, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Intel Corp. INTC, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nForget NVIDIA: 2 AI Stocks Crushing It in 2025 with More Upside Ahead Shares of the most sought-after tech stock on Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp. , have surged 36.6% this year amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ongoing demand for NVIDIA's CUDA software platform, along with its competitive advantage in the AI hardware market, fueled growth. Demand for NVIDIA's Blackwell chips remains strong, and the company plans to ship H200 AI chips to China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nHowever, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions remain a risk and could pose a meaningful threat to NVIDIA's future growth trajectory. NVIDIA also faces intensifying competition from rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . and Intel Corp. , as data center capital expenditures continue to rise.\nTherefore, investors may look beyond NVIDIA at stocks that have outperformed it this year and still offer upside as the AI boom continues. Notable among them are Micron Technology, Inc . and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc . whose shares have gained 228.8% and 43.6%, respectively, this year. Let's take a closer look at why these stocks are compelling buys.\nReasons to Be Bullish on Micron Strong demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips is expected to help the company deliver strong quarterly results. These chips have the inherent capacity to reduce power consumption and process large volumes of data. With AI infrastructure rapidly expanding, demand for HBM chips has accelerated.\n\nBanking on rising AI-led demand for HBM chips, Micron expects its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $13.64 billion for the fiscal first quarter, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Analysts had projected revenues of around $12.88 billion.\nMicron expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter, with its cloud memory business unit expected to perform particularly well. Micron's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a solid 23.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nReasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai BigBear.ai's shares were adversely impacted at the beginning of the year due to the Trump administration's move to curb federal spending. Reduced funding may have affected BigBear.ai's sales, but its top-line performance is expected to improve going forward, supported by the definitive $250 million agreement to acquire Ask Sage.\n\nAsk Sage is a fast-growing generative AI platform that has seen broad adoption, with users including the U.S. Space Force and the Defense Health Agency. It is designed for secure AI deployment in restricted fields such as defense and national security, according to ir.bigbear.ai. Ask Sage serves 100,000 users across 16,000 government teams, and with its acquisition, BigBear.ai expects full-year sales to reach $125 million to $140 million.\nMoreover, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" could drive future growth for BigBear.ai, while the company's robust cash position provides ample resources to support its expansion. The company reached a significant milestone toward profitability in the third quarter, and its expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a stellar 73.1%.\n\nWhile BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Big Winners Again in 2026\n\nBeth McKenna, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock is a top buy for tech investors, as the company's AI-enabling GPUs are largely powering the AI revolution.\nBroadcom stock is a top buy, thanks largely to the strong demand for the company's custom AI chips.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing stock is a top buy because the world's largest chip foundry is profiting significantly from the powerful demand for AI chips, both GPUs and custom chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks, as a group, have been among the best-performing groups in 2025, just as they were in 2024.\nThree AI stocks that were big winners in 2025, as of Dec. 23, and that I believe will be big winners again in 2026, are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , or TSM (NYSE: TSM) .\n3 Top AI stocks to buy for 2026 Stocks are listed in order of 5-year return.\nCompany\nMarket Cap\nForward P/E\nWall Street's Estimated Annualized 5-Year EPS Growth\nYear-to-Date 2025 Stock Return\n5-Year Stock Return\nNvidia\n$4.8 trillion\n24.0\n48.5%\n40.9%\n1,359%\nBroadcom\n$1.7 trillion\n34.4\n35.9%\n52%\n813%\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n$1.2 trillion\n24.5\n30.4%\n52.4%\n211%\nS&P 500 Index\n--\n--\n--\n19%\n102%\n\nData sources: Yahoo! Finance and YCharts. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio . EPS = earnings per share. Data as of Dec. 23, 2025.\nNvidia: The dominant maker of AI chips and related tech Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), its flagship semiconductors, are considered the gold standard for training artificial intelligence (AI) models and deploying AI applications.\nThe company's data center platform had been performing well for quite some time. But demand began skyrocketing for its AI-enabling products -- its GPUs and high-performance networking products -- soon after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. This event demonstrated to company leaders and the general public the phenomenal capabilities of generative AI.\n\nIn late October at the company's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, D.C., CEO Jensen Huang said that management has \"visibility\" into $500 billion of demand for its key data center technology over the next five quarters . This demand of $100 billion per quarter, on average, is truly mind-blowing. As context, in its fiscal third quarter (ended late October), Nvidia's total revenue was $57.0 billion, of which $51.2 billion was from the data center platform.\nBroadcom: The leading maker of custom AI chips Broadcom develops semiconductors for various end markets and also develops infrastructure software.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's robust growth is being drven by strong demand for its custom AI-enabling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and Ethernet networking products, both for data centers. Its acquisition of software maker VMware in late 2023 is proving to be a shrewd move, as this business is also growing nicely.\n\nBroadcom is the top partner for big tech companies seeking custom ASICs. As the name suggests, these chips are designed for specific applications. These include internal uses and, in some cases, for availability in their cloud computing services. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs can be considered more general-purpose AI chips. There is a need for both GPUs and ASICs, so investors shouldn't be concerned that one of these types of chips will fully win out over the other.\nTSM: The world's largest chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest chip foundry. That means it produces chips of various types for companies that contract out all or some of the manufacturing of chips they design.\nTSM is the largest producer of AI chips worldwide, which has led to significant financial growth in recent years, driven by surging demand for these chips.\n\nTSM's customers include nearly every major chip company, such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which is Nvidia's main rival in the AI-enabling GPU market. Moreover, it also manufactures chips, including AI chips, for major tech companies that have designed their own chips. This includes Apple , widely considered the company's largest customer, though some Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to soon overtake Apple as TSM's top customer.\nAn added benefit for some investors is that TSM pays a decent dividend for a tech company. The dividend yield was 1.13%, as of the close of the market on Dec. 23.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\n\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\n\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory Continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE\nBefore heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms -- Walden International and Walden Catalyst -- did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO\nBorn in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\n\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\n\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\n\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\n\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL\nSo far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\n\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Forget NVDA: 2 AI Stocks Crushing it in 2025 With More Upside Ahead\n\nTirthankar Chakraborty\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:05 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nMU\n\nBBAI\n\nShares of the most sought-after tech stock on Wall Street, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, have surged 36.6% this year amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ongoing demand for NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform, along with its competitive advantage in the AI hardware market, fueled growth. Demand for NVIDIA’s Blackwell chips remains strong, and the company plans to ship H200 AI chips to China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nHowever, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions remain a risk and could pose a meaningful threat to NVIDIA’s future growth trajectory. NVIDIA also faces intensifying competition from rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . AMD and Intel Corporation INTC, as data center capital expenditures continue to rise.\nTherefore, investors may look beyond NVIDIA at stocks that have outperformed it this year and still offer upside as the AI boom continues. Notable among them are Micron Technology, Inc . MU and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc . BBAI, whose shares have gained 228.8% and 43.6%, respectively, this year. Let’s take a closer look at why these stocks are compelling buys.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nReasons to Be Bullish on Micron Strong demand for Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips is expected to help the company deliver strong quarterly results. These chips have the inherent capacity to reduce power consumption and process large volumes of data. With AI infrastructure rapidly expanding, demand for HBM chips has accelerated.\n\nBanking on rising AI-led demand for HBM chips, Micron expects its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $13.64 billion for the fiscal first quarter, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Analysts had projected revenues of around $12.88 billion.\nMicron expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter, with its cloud memory business unit expected to perform particularly well. Micron’s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a solid 23.5%.\nReasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai BigBear.ai’s shares were adversely impacted at the beginning of the year due to the Trump administration’s move to curb federal spending. Reduced funding may have affected BigBear.ai’s sales, but its top-line performance is expected to improve going forward, supported by the definitive $250 million agreement to acquire Ask Sage.\n\nAsk Sage is a fast-growing generative AI platform that has seen broad adoption, with users including the U.S. Space Force and the Defense Health Agency. It is designed for secure AI deployment in restricted fields such as defense and national security, according to ir.bigbear.ai. Ask Sage serves 100,000 users across 16,000 government teams, and with its acquisition, BigBear.ai expects full-year sales to reach $125 million to $140 million.\n\nStory Continues\nMoreover, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” could drive future growth for BigBear.ai, while the company’s robust cash position provides ample resources to support its expansion. The company reached a significant milestone toward profitability in the third quarter, and its expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a stellar 73.1%.\n\nWhile BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn't a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks.\nThis isn't to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we'll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential.\n\nIssues With AMD Stock One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn't pay a dividend. Consequently, you'll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit.\nMeanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices' valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x .\n\nIn addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock's price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices.\nThose are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here.\nBesides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don't have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let's perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices' financial health.\nBooming Sales, Zooming Profits Advanced Micro Devices' high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you'll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don't own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years.\n\nStory Continues\nAll in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company's results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025.\nImpressively, Advanced Micro Devices' net revenue grew 35.6% year over year, from $6.819 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $9.246 billion. Nearly half of that revenue stemmed from Advanced Micro Devices' Data Center segment; this suggests that the company continues to benefit from AI-associated sales.\n\nTurning to the bottom-line results, Advanced Micro Devices' net income surged 61.2%, from $771 in the year-earlier quarter to $1.243 billion. Also during that time frame, the company's cash and cash equivalents increased 27%, from $3.787 billion to $4.808 billion. So evidently, Advanced Micro Devices remains a cash-rich chipmaker that's on a powerful growth trajectory.\nMaking Headway in China While U.S. chip sales are crucial to Advanced Micro Devices' business model, it definitely appears that the company is making headway in China's chip market. To be more specific, Alibaba ( NASDAQ:BABA ) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices' MI308 AI accelerators.\n\nThis is important because investors need to think globally, not just locally, over the next 10 years. China is a major chip market, and Advanced Micro Devices has a long-term growth opportunity there.\nAdvanced Micro Devices made a savvy move in designing its MI308 chips to be compatible with export restrictions. Furthermore, the company has secured export licenses for these chips and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. on approved sales in China.\nAlso, it's a positive sign that Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently met with Chinese Commerce ​Minister Wang ‌Wentao in Beijing. They \"exchanged views on the company's business ⁠development in ​China and ​strengthening cooperation with China,\" according to the ‍ministry.\n\nSure, NVIDIA is also making headway into China's chip market. At the same time, however, NVDA stock may have already priced in the company's progress in this region.\nIn contrast, Advanced Micro Devices' growth story in China is still developing and the market needs time to recognize this. Give it a few years, and you should see AMD stock reflect strong chip sales in both the U.S. and China.\nGive AMD Stock a Chance In the final analysis, there's no need to overload your portfolio with AMD stock. Just holding a moderately sized share position for 10 years will, most likely, put you in a profitable position without undue risk.\nWhile Advanced Micro Devices doesn't pay a dividend and appears overvalued at first glance, I still encourage you to give the company a chance. If AI chip sales remain strong and Advanced Micro Devices keeps on growing its sales and profits, there's an attractive reward-to-risk profile here for buy-and-hold investors.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

CLS reported quarterly revenues of $3.19 billion, up 27.8% year over year. The figure exceeded management’s guidance of $2.875 billion to $3.125 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $170 million. The growth was driven by multiple factors.\n\nThe company boasts a robust portfolio of enterprise-level data communications and information processing infrastructure products, such as routers, switches, data center interconnects, edge solutions and servers. Such a comprehensive product suite, combined with a strong focus on innovation, is allowing Celestica to tap into the expanding AI infrastructure market. The company is actively collaborating with other industry leaders such as AMD and Broadcom to further augment its portfolio offerings.\n\nDuring the third quarter, net sales from the company’s Connectivity and Cable Solution portfolio surged 43.2% year over year to $2.41 billion. The growth was primarily driven by healthy demand for 800G and 400G switching products in the data center networking vertical.\n\nPer a report from Grand View Research, the global data center networking market is valued at $38.49 billion in 2024. The market is projected to witness a 17.2% compound annual growth rate from 2025 to 2033. This presents a solid growth opportunity for Celestica. Management is bullish about its revenue growth outlook. The company expects to generate revenue between $3.325-$3.575 billion, indicating 36% year over year growth backed by continuous momentum in the data center market.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring? Celestica faces competition from Jabil, Inc. JBL and Flex Ltd . FLEX in the Electronics Manufacturing Services industry. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Jabil reported revenues of $8.3 billion, up from $6.96 billion a year ago, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $227 million. The uptick was driven by healthy demand in the Capital Equipment and AI-related Cloud and Data Center Infrastructure verticals. Jabil is steadily expanding its portfolio offering to gain a competitive edge in the AI data center vertical.\n\nIn the September quarter, Flex generated $6.8 billion in revenues, up 4% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $142 million. The uptick was driven by strong data center growth in both the cloud and power end markets. Flex’s diversified portfolio, spanning multiple industries — from cloud infrastructure and AI data centers to automotive and healthcare — continues to be a key strength.\n\nCelestica's Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Celestica’s shares have soared 215.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 93.7%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Celestica trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 37.68, up from the industry average of 24.13.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 6.3% to $5.90 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 have also increased 20.9% to $8.20.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCelestica currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

But in an optimistic scenario, Leopold estimates AMD could generate roughly $500 million to $800 million in incremental revenue, translating into about $0.10 to $0.20 of non-GAAP EPS upside.\n\nFor Nvidia, the potential is materially larger, with an estimated $7 billion to $12.5 billion in additional revenue, or about $0.15 to $0.30 of non-GAAP EPS upside in 2026.\n“Questions remain regarding whether the Chinese government will allow or discourage its cloud operators from purchasing advanced GPUs, as well as how the U.S. government’s export license fee will be accounted for,” Leopold wrote.\nFor AMD, market speculation has centered on China-compliant accelerator orders tied to Alibaba, with reports pointing to 40,000 to 50,000 MI308 units. At the midpoint, Leopold notes that “a $15,000 chip could equate to $675M in sales,” likely spread across multiple quarters.\nHowever, uncertainty remains around approval timing, ramp linearity and whether China enforces restrictions on American AI semiconductors.\n\nThe required 15% payment to the U.S. government introduces accounting complexity around pricing and accounting.\nWhile modest relative to AMD’s total revenue base, momentum could build as roadmap execution continues and China-compliant offerings gain traction, Leopold said.\nNvidia faces a similar dynamic, with speculation focused on a limited resumption of H200 GPU shipments to large Chinese hyperscalers and internet companies.\nEven modest volumes could be meaningful, as “tens of thousands of units” at estimated average selling prices (ASPs) of $20,000 to $25,000, and up to roughly 350,000 to 500,000 units over time, could drive billions of dollars in incremental revenue.\nLeopold stresses that China remains a relatively small part of Nvidia’s overall data center business, with growth primarily driven by U.S. hyperscalers, sovereign AI and enterprise customers as newer platforms ramp through 2026.\n\n“We continue to view AI infrastructure as a multi-trilliondollar opportunity over the next decade, with Nvidia well positioned to sustain industry-leading growth, margins, and dominant share in data center accelerators, and we reiterate our Strong Buy rating,” he wrote.\nRelated articles\nWhat is the China upside potential for Nvidia and AMD?\n\nStory Continues\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The competitive landscape is shifting.\"\nRuffer is gaining exposure to the AI theme through Chinese tech giants such as Alibaba, which operates an AI chip unit, owns large language model Qwen, and is ploughing money into cloud infrastructure.\n\nGlobal asset managers are increasingly eyeing Chinese AI firms ⁠as a wave of startups lists on the mainland and in ‌Hong Kong, seeking to tap into surging investor appetite following the meteoric rise of DeepSeek, China’s answer to ChatGPT.\nTECH WAR SPURS DEMAND\nUBS Global Wealth Management in a report this month rated China tech as \"most attractive\", citing investors' search for geographical diversification and China's \"strong policy backing, technological self-reliance, and rapid ‍AI monetization\".\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq currently trades at 31 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 24 for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech, which enables AI bets via stocks including Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent and chip foundry SMIC.\nRiding the momentum, U.S. investment adviser Rayliant helped launch a Nasdaq-listed fund in September that gives investors access to \"China's versions of stocks like Google, Meta, Tesla , Apple , and OpenAI\".\nKraneShares Chief Investment Officer Brendan Ahern said the ​rapid ascent of Chinese AI chipmakers such as Cambricon speaks to the scale and speed of innovation across China's AI and semiconductor industries.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The element of this race narrative, this urgency, is ‌to the benefit of the companies,\" he said, referring to the bitter Sino-U.S. tech war.\n\"It's like yelling fire, right? When you make it an emergency, you get a lot of attention.\"\nKraneShares' exchange-traded fund dubbed KWEB, which invests in offshore-listed Chinese stocks including Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu, has jumped by two-thirds this year to nearly $9 billion.\n\nAnother KraneShares ETF that invests in China's onshore tech stocks, including chipmakers Cambricon, Montage Technology and Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment, has also grown this year.\nIn the AI race, the U.S. has an edge in innovation while China has advantages in engineering, manufacturing and power supply, said Jason Hsu, founder of U.S.-based Rayliant Global Advisors.\nRayliant has partnered with China Asset Management Co in launching a Nasdaq-listed ETF that bets on Chinese stocks with transformative technologies, including ⁠Cambricon.\nU.S. tech curbs have \"now forced China to pump money into hard technology and invent from scratch,\" said Hsu. \"For ​investors, the prudent and wise strategy is to capture AI opportunities and manage uncertainty through diversification.\"\n\n'DRIVEN BY HYPE'\nChinese ​AI chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits, founded by former AMD executives, jumped 700% in its Shanghai market debut last week, days after larger rival Moore Threads debuted with a 400% pop.\nHowever, some global fund managers say China's tech potential and foreign inflows remain limited.\n\"None of the chip companies that are currently listed have ‍any sort of valuation support and are almost ⁠entirely driven by hype,\" said Kamil Dimmich, partner and portfolio manager at UK-based North of South Capital.\nDimmich's fund owns stocks such as Alibaba and Baidu, which have both invested much less than U.S. players on AI development.\nCarol Fong, group CEO of CGS International Securities, said investors should selectively add companies that have benefited from China's \"self-reliance\" push in the ⁠AI and semiconductor sectors, while keeping global leaders in their portfolio.\nThere is a hunt for \"potential leaders in the high-tech segments such as robotics and AI, where they see clearer policy directions and relative value as compared to the ‌Western counterparts,\" Fong said, expecting more flows ahead.\nInvestors should \"balance exposure in the current fragmented, geopolitics-driven chip cycle,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Samuel Shen in Shanghai, Jiaxing Li ‌in Hong Kong and Laura Matthews in New York; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Sonali Paul)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could AMD Finally Close the Gap on Nvidia AI Dominance?\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market.\nExisting infrastructure and software reinforce Nvidia's dominance.\nDespite competitive challenges, AMD has earned business from key clients.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nThroughout its history, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has developed a reputation for closing or at least reducing the competitive gap with rivals. This was true when it challenged Intel 's supremacy in prior decades and, more recently, its clashes with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\n\nThis includes its rivalry with Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, and its upcoming releases have captured the attention of industry analysts. The question for investors is whether it is on the verge of catching up to Nvidia and ending its dominance. The more likely outcome is that AMD will narrow but not close the gap, and here's why.\nThe state of the AI accelerator market Indeed, the semiconductor industry appeared caught off guard when it became clear that Nvidia's AI accelerators powered OpenAI's game-changing GPT-4 AI platform in 2023. Nvidia was so far ahead of rivals that even now, Nvidia holds an estimated 80% of this market, according to a Susquehanna analyst.\n\nMoreover, closing the gap hinges on more than just processing power. Nvidia has its CUDA software platform, which has an army of loyal developers. That makes switching away from that architecture difficult.\nAdditionally, Nvidia offers rack-scale solutions that integrate with both its accelerators and CUDA. That presents an additional challenge to prospective competitors.\nNvidia is also growing faster. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2026, Nvidia reported 62% revenue growth. Its data center segment, which designs the accelerators and constitutes 89% of Nvidia's revenue, increased revenue by 65% during the same period.\nAMD's overall growth is also impressive, but not as rapid in either respect. In the first nine months of 2025, AMD's revenue rose by 36% year over year. Also, its data center segment makes up 46% of overall revenue, and during the period, the segment's revenue rose by 29%, slower than the overall gain.\n\nAMD's efforts to strike back Nonetheless, as bleak as that sounds, AMD bulls should remember that that is only one quarter, and data center segment growth is likely to improve along with its technology.\nDespite lagging behind, AMD has made headway in this market. The company has built strategic partnerships with OpenAI and Meta Platforms , and its accelerators support clouds for Microsoft 's Azure and Oracle 's Oracle Cloud. Moreover, Dell , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , and others have built servers with AMD's technology.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking forward, investors have focused on AMD's upcoming MI450 accelerator. The company has also claimed that the MI450 will surpass the performance of Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin accelerator.\nAdditionally, AMD relies on open-source software and can work with other tech ecosystems. That could wear away at Nvidia's software-driven competitive advantage as the industry grows.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia has struggled to keep up with demand, and AMD has traditionally sold its competing product at a lower cost. This gives companies all the more reason to consider AMD over Nvidia. Hence, if the MI450 can match or surpass the Vera Rubin, AMD could make significant competitive inroads.\nWill AMD close the gap with Nvidia? In the foreseeable future, investors should expect AMD to reduce but not completely close the competitive gap with Nvidia.\nIndeed, AMD has made significant efforts to catch up and has won business from several high-profile customers. If the MI450 matches or exceeds expectations, it could threaten AMD's dominance.\n\nUnfortunately for AMD, Nvidia is the established player in the AI accelerator market, and most companies are tied into its ecosystem. That means if AMD becomes the superior product, many of Nvidia's customers would likely be unable to switch to AMD without a tremendous disruption.\nUltimately, such conditions could be enough to stoke more rapid stock price increases for Advanced Micro Devices stock than Nvidia as the smaller company plays catch-up. However, investors should expect Nvidia to remain the leader in the AI accelerator industry for some time to come.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Advanced Micro Devices Could Score Major China Coup\n\nRich Duprey\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 9:16 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nBABAF\n\nBABA\n\nNVDA\n\nQuick Read Alibaba ( BABA ) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 MI308 AI accelerators from Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). The deal would generate hundreds of millions in revenue.\nAMD designed the MI308 to comply with U.S. export rules for China. AMD will pay a 15% fee to the U.S. government on approved sales.\nAMD excluded China revenue from recent guidance. A confirmed Alibaba order would likely trigger upward forecast revisions.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nFor more than two years, U.S. export restrictions have severely limited Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) and Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) from selling their most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators in China. The controls, progressively tightened by the federal government, aim to prevent Beijing from obtaining cutting-edge technology that could advance military or strategic AI capabilities. As a result, both companies have one of the world’s largest AI markets all but closed off to them.\nChina once accounted for a significant portion of their data-center revenue, but the restrictions have led to lost sales, inventory write-downs, and a material hit to growth expectations. Recent policy changes, however, suggest the U.S. is willing to allow limited shipments of compliant chips, creating a potential opening for both firms.\n\nA Chance for a Massive Sales Coup This morning, the website MLex reported that Alibaba ( NYSE:BABA ) is considering a purchase of 40,000 to 50,000 MI308 AI accelerators from AMD. The MI308 is AMD’s China-specific AI chip, engineered to comply with current U.S. export rules while still offering substantial performance for large-scale AI training and inference workloads.\n\nAccording to the report, AMD has already secured some export licenses for the MI308 and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. government on approved sales to Chinese customers. The MI308 is reportedly nearing commercial availability in China, and other major Chinese cloud providers and internet companies are also evaluating the chip.\nWhat Such a Large Order Would Mean for AMD If the rumored order materializes at the reported scale, it would represent one of the largest single deals for AMD in the Chinese market since the export curbs began. A 40,000 to 50,000 unit purchase would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, depending on final pricing, and would validate the MI308 as a viable alternative to Nvidia offerings.\n\nStory Continues\nSuch a deal would also strengthen AMD’s position in China’s rapidly growing data-center and AI infrastructure sector, where domestic players like Huawei and Cambricon are trying to fill the void left by Western vendors. Importantly, AMD has not included any meaningful China revenue in its recent financial guidance, so a confirmed order of this size would likely trigger upward revisions to full-year forecasts and provide a visible catalyst for the stock.\n\nDespite the headline-grabbing report, Advanced Micro shares traded only modestly higher in morning trading. The limited price movement suggests investors are either skeptical of the rumor or view it as too preliminary to justify aggressive buying.\nMLex is currently the sole source reporting the specific Alibaba-MI308 figure, and neither AMD nor Alibaba has commented publicly on the matter.\nNvidia Also Preparing China Shipments At the same time, Nvidia is preparing to resume limited shipments of its H200 GPU to China, with initial deliveries of 5,000 to 10,000 modules -- the equivalent of 40,000 to 80,000 individual chips -- expected to begin in mid-February, according to separate reports. Like AMD, Nvidia has received U.S. export approvals for the China-compliant version of the H200, though final shipments still require Chinese regulatory clearance, which may include conditions such as bundling with domestic semiconductors.\n\nKey Takeaway Should the reported Alibaba purchase of 40,000 to 50,000 MI308 chips be confirmed, it would mark a major commercial and strategic victory for AMD in a market that has been closed to its high-end products. The revenue upside would be meaningful, and because neither AMD nor Nvidia has baked China sales into their current guidance, any real order flow could lead to substantial analyst upgrades and improved sentiment.\n\nThat said, the report remains unconfirmed and is based on a single source. Until official announcements or concrete evidence emerge, investors should not rush in to buy Advanced Micro Devices' stock solely on the strength of this rumor.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "TER vs. AMD: Which AI Component Supplier Stock Is the Better Buy?\n\nNilanshi Mukherjee\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:38 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nTER\n\nTeradyne TER and Advanced Micro Devices AMD are key suppliers of AI components in the semiconductor market. While TER supplies critical automated test equipment used to validate and ensure the performance of advanced AI chips, AMD designs high-performance CPUs and GPUs that power AI workloads in data centers and enterprise applications.\n\nPer the Fortune Business Insight report, the global semiconductor market size was valued at $681.05 billion in 2024. It is expected to reach $2,062.59 billion by 2032 from $755.28 billion in 2025, witnessing a CAGR of 15.4%. Both Teradyne and Advanced Micro Devices are expected to benefit from this rapid growth pace.\n\nSo, TER or AMD — Which of these AI Component Supplier Stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out.\n\nThe Case for TER Stock Teradyne is positioning itself as a key player in the AI-driven semiconductor testing market. In the third quarter of 2025, Semiconductor Test revenues rose 7% year over year and 23% sequentially, accounting for 78.8% of sales in the reported quarter.\n\nThe uptick can be attributed to strong AI-related demand, which is driving significant investments in cloud AI build-out as customers accelerate the production of a wide range of AI accelerators, networking, memory, and power devices.

      "Content": "Nvidia dominated the headlines in 2025 — these were its 15 biggest events of the year\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:01 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nSSNLF\n\n005380.KS\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nIt’s difficult to think of any single company that had a bigger impact on Wall Street and the AI trade in 2025 than Nvidia ( NVDA ).\nInvestors scrutinized CEO Jensen Huang’s every move, whether that was his meetings with President Trump or a night out with the heads of Samsung and Hyundai for fried chicken and beer.\n\nNvidia’s revenue soared in 2025, bringing in $187.1 billion, and its market capitalization continued to climb, briefly eclipsing the $5 trillion mark, before settling back in the $4 trillion range.\nThere were plenty of major highs and deep lows throughout the year, but these 15 were among the biggest moments of Nvidia’s 2025.\nJan. 6: CES 2025 Nvidia rang in the new year with a series of product announcements ranging from a new pint-sized AI chip to more powerful gaming cards at CES 2025. Huang’s keynote touched on an array of topics, including physical AI, otherwise known as robots; desktop-based AI systems; and a litany of AI software updates that set the stage for the company’s 2025.\n\nJan. 27: The DeepSeek moment Nvidia had an incredible year by seemingly every measure, but it started out with a shock. In January, DeepSeek released its R-1 model, which the company claimed it trained using less than state-of-the-art processors. That sent the AI trade into a meltdown, with the company shedding nearly $600 billion from its market cap in a single day.\nDespite the initial blowup, fears that AI companies would no longer need high-powered chips seem to have been overblown. That’s because training AI models and running them are two different operations, and according to Nvidia, running models with more powerful chips improves overall performance.\nMarkets eventually settled down as more companies agreed with the assumption, but Nvidia’s stock price didn’t return to pre-DeepSeek levels until June.\n\nMarch 18: Nvidia reveals Blackwell Ultra chips at GTC Nvidia’s annual GTC event, held in San Jose, used to be a moderately sized tech conference. But this year’s GTC was far different . Huang’s keynote filled the SAP Center, home of the San Jose Sharks hockey team, and Nvidia took over a large swath of downtown San Jose, which included an enormous collection of food tents and stalls that covered the 2.3-acre Plaza de César Chávez.\nDuring his speech, Huang debuted Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra chip, the successor to its Blackwell GPU, and the GB300 superchip, which combined two Blackwell GPUs and one of Nvidia’s Grace CPUs.\nThe CEO said the offerings were built for the age of “AI reasoning” and said models like DeepSeek’s R-1 would run far better on Nvidia’s latest and greatest.\n\nStory Continues\nApril 2: 'Liberation Day' Trump’s decision to implement a series of tariffs on countries and goods on April 2, which he called “Liberation Day,” sent the stock market into such a nosedive that the president had no choice but to walk some of them back just a week later.\nNvidia wasn’t immune to the drop. The company saw its stock price decline from $110 on April 2 to $94.31 on April 4. Shares returned to pre-\"Liberation Day\" numbers by April 9, but continued to waffle until breaking out of their slump on April 25.\nApril 15: H20 effectively banned Nvidia’s April didn’t get much better when the Trump administration implemented new chip restrictions that called for Nvidia to receive a license to ship the H20 chip to China , effectively banning sales of the processor to the country.\nNvidia designed the GPU to meet restrictions set up during President Joe Biden’s administration. Trump, however, blocked the China-specific chip on security grounds. The company ended up writing down $4.5 billion in charges related to the H20 in Q1 and took an additional $4 billion in Q2.\n\nJuly 9: Nvidia hits $4 trillion Despite taking a hit from the DeepSeek meltdown and Trump’s China ban, Nvidia stock continued to perform, and in July the company became the first to see its market capitalization pass the $4 trillion mark .\nNvidia topped $1 trillion in 2023 and took just three years to add another $3 trillion, thanks to its leadership position in the AI chip market.\nJuly 14: Nvidia can sell H20 in China again In July, the on-again-off-again relationship between Washington and China was back on, with Nvidia announcing that the Trump administration had assured the company that it would allow sales of H20 chips to China .\nHuang successfully made the case that America would benefit from selling its technologies to China and risked falling behind if it completely cut itself off from the market, convincing Trump to allow Nvidia to sell to the country again.\n\nAug. 11: Nvidia to pay 15% cut on China sales Although the White House assured Nvidia it would approve the sale of its chips to China, the administration later announced that it would take a 15% cut of the sales . The same rule applied to Nvidia rival AMD ( AMD ).\nDespite the potential revenue haircut, investors on Wall Street weren’t too bothered by the announcement, figuring that 85% of the revenue from sales to the country was better than the 0% Nvidia was bringing in before.\n\nSept. 22: Nvidia says it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI In September, Nvidia announced it would invest upward of $100 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI . The partnership would let OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) build out 10 gigawatts or more of data center capacity, allowing it to train and run its GPT models.\nNvidia’s deals have raised eyebrows among analysts who warn that such circular investments, where a company (Nvidia) invests in a customer (OpenAI) and uses that cash to purchase chips from the investor (Nvidia), artificially boost AI spending.\nNvidia has faced criticism for a similar deal with CoreWeave ( CRWV ). Nvidia invested in the company, which then turned around and bought Nvidia chips. Such deals have driven at least part of the discussion around an AI bubble.\n\nOct. 17: Nvidia’s first Blackwell chip built in US The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has made reshoring chip manufacturing a national imperative. And while Nvidia doesn’t build its own chips — it outsources that to TSMC — it did celebrate that company’s completion of the first Blackwell chip built in the US in October .\n\nOct. 29: Nvidia hits $5 trillion Nvidia’s market capitalization hit $5 trillion in late October , just a few months after crossing the $4 trillion mark.\nThe exuberance came as the company announced a number of new deals with companies like Uber at its first GTC event in Washington, D.C. It also followed word that Huang would meet with Trump in South Korea ahead of the president’s meeting with Xi Jinping to discuss a trade deal.\nThe hope was that Trump and Xi would reach an agreement to allow Nvidia to sell its chips in the country, but a deal never materialized.\n\nOct. 30: Viral fried chicken photo with leaders of Samsung and Hyundai Huang’s star exploded throughout 2025, so much so that in October, reporters and onlookers swarmed a South Korean fried chicken restaurant to catch a glimpse of him dining with the heads of Samsung and Hyundai. An image of the trio subsequently went viral .\nNov. 19: Nvidia to ship chips to the Middle East Nvidia received authorization to ship the equivalent of more than 60,000 Blackwell chips to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in November as the company continued to vie for the opportunity to sell its processors to a wider array of countries.\nThe company has pushed the concept of sovereign AI throughout 2025, saying that it allows countries around the world to get access to their own AI data centers without having to rely on other nations.\nBut China hawks said the move could give the US adversary access to Nvidia chips, due to that country’s close relationship with the UAE.\n\nNov. 25: Nvidia’s Google tweet Nvidia has faced threats from its own customers, including Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Amazon ( AMZN ), building their own chips to power their AI platforms, but in November, a report that Google could provide Meta ( META ) with its own tensor processing units (TPUs) for the social media giant’s data centers seemed to spook Nvidia.\n\nThe company sent out a viral tweet in response to the story, congratulating Google on its chips’ performance, but pointed out that its own GPUs were a generation ahead of Google’s and noted that it’s the only chip that can run all AI models .\nDec. 9.: Nvidia H200 approved for China After a year of will he, won’t he, Trump wrote in a post on the Truth Social platform that he was greenlighting the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China . The H200 is two generations behind Nvidia’s current Blackwell Ultra processors.\nTrump said that Xi responded positively to the deal, which, if fully approved by the countries, could provide a boost to Nvidia’s bottom line.\nStill, there’s no guarantee that the arrangement won’t fall apart. Nvidia has become a negotiating chip for the two countries, just as Apple was before, and could see its chips banned again.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Why TSMC Is Winning the Most\n\nNauman Khan\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:33 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nGlobal semiconductor foundry revenue rose about 17% year over year to roughly $84.8 billion in the third quarter of 2025, supported by strong demand for artificial intelligence chips built on advanced manufacturing nodes, according to a research note from Counterpoint Research.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( NYSE:TSM ) widened its lead, with market share edging up to about 72%. The gains followed higher output of its 3-nanometer process and solid utilization of 4- and 5-nanometer capacity, used heavily by AI accelerator customers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), and Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ).\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with INTC.\nIs INTC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTSMC's foundry revenue grew more than 40% from a year earlier, outpacing the broader market. Counterpoint said most rival foundries posted slower growth, with non-TSMC players collectively expanding revenue by about 6%, reflecting softer orders after earlier tariff-related demand but some support from China's subsidy programs.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts said capacity limits at advanced nodes and constraints in advanced chip packaging, known as CoWoS, may cap sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Full-year 2025 foundry revenue growth is estimated at around 15%.\nCounterpoint expects the pure-play foundry segment to grow at a faster pace, helped by continued shipments of AI GPUs and custom AI chips. Texas Instruments ( NASDAQ:TXN ), Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ), Infineon (IFNNY), and Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) maintained mid-single-digit market shares.\n\nCondizioni e Informativa sulla privacy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/712ea1b4-0ae7-31df-b2cd-db872f810518/if-you-like-amd%E2%80%99s-future%2C.html",
      "Content": "If You Like AMD’s Future, AMDY Lets You Go Full Send With An Over 100% Distribution Yield\n\nMichael Williams\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:06 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nQuick Read AMDY’s 101.88% distribution rate comes from selling weekly AMD call options but caps upside to roughly 70% of AMD’s gains.\nAMD’s Q3 2025 revenue hit $9.25B (up 35.6% year-over-year) and a new OpenAI partnership targets over $100B in future revenue.\nThe distribution rate is unsustainable at current levels. The 30-day SEC yield of 1.15% offers a more realistic baseline.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF ( NYSEARCA:AMDY ) has captured investor attention with its extraordinary 101.88% distribution rate as of December 17, 2025. This isn't a traditional dividend ETF - AMDY generates income by selling weekly call options on Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) stock, collecting premiums from traders betting on AMD's price movements.\nHow AMDY Generates Its Extreme Yield AMDY employs a covered call strategy, selling short-term call options against synthetic AMD exposure. The fund's 101.88% distribution rate means investors theoretically receive more than their initial investment back annually through distributions. However, this assumes the most recent weekly distribution remains constant—a significant assumption given variable options premiums.\n\nThe fund's income depends entirely on AMD's volatility. With a beta of 1.93, AMD moves nearly twice as much as the broader market, creating rich options premiums. AMD's 52-week range of $76.48 to $267.08 illustrates this volatility—a 249% spread generating substantial options income. In 2025, AMD surged 76.7% through mid-December, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 16.13% gain. This explosive performance drove elevated options premiums enabling AMDY's triple-digit distribution rate.\n\nThe Critical Tradeoff: Income Versus Upside AMDY's strategy caps upside participation. While AMD gained 76.7% in 2025, AMDY delivered a 53.9% price return—capturing approximately 70% of AMD's appreciation. The fund sacrificed 23 percentage points of capital gains for its high distribution yield.\nMore concerning is downside risk. AMD currently trades at $213.43, down 20% from its 52-week high of $267.08. During this decline, options premiums compress, reducing AMDY's distribution potential. The fund offers no downside protection—if AMD falls 30%, AMDY's net asset value falls approximately 30%, and declining volatility simultaneously reduces income generation.\n\nStory Continues\nThis infographic details the YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (AMDY), explaining its covered call strategy, suitable use cases, and the associated pros and cons for investors.\n\nEvaluating AMD's Fundamental Strength AMD's business fundamentals support the bullish case underlying AMDY's strategy. Third quarter 2025 revenue reached $9.25 billion, up 35.6% year-over-year, with operating cash flow of $2.16 billion. The company maintains $4.81 billion in cash against $3.87 billion in debt. Management recently announced a multiyear partnership with OpenAI expected to generate over $100 billion in revenue.\n\nHowever, AMD's valuation leaves little room for disappointment. The stock trades at 112x trailing earnings, despite a more reasonable 35x forward multiple. Analysts maintain a consensus $282.82 price target, implying 32% upside—gains that AMDY holders would largely miss due to capped call positions. AMD pays no dividend, meaning AMDY's distributions come entirely from options premiums.\nDistribution Sustainability Assessment AMDY's 101.88% distribution rate is not sustainable in its current form. This figure represents an annualized rate based on a single week's distribution during elevated AMD volatility. As AMD's price stabilizes or declines, options premiums will compress, reducing weekly distributions significantly. The fund's 30-day SEC yield of just 1.15% provides a more conservative baseline.\n\nInvestors should expect substantial distribution variability. During periods when AMD trades sideways or declines, weekly distributions may fall 50% or more from current levels.\nAlternative: NVDY for Diversified Tech Exposure Investors seeking similar options-based income with different underlying exposure should consider the YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF ( NYSEARCA:NVDY ). This fund applies the same covered call strategy to NVIDIA stock. NVDY offers exposure to a different segment of the AI semiconductor market, currently yielding approximately 80% through its options premium strategy. Like AMDY, NVDY caps upside potential while maintaining full downside exposure.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

However, if it can break above that, which could happen today, we’d like to see NVDA retest $200 next.\nPlus, despite AI bubble fears, the global AI boom could grow from about $137 billion in 2022 to more than $1.81 trillion by 2030, as noted by Grand View Research.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices After gaining $12.37 on Friday, Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ: AMD ) is up another $4 in premarket. Technically, after finding strong support dating back to late November, AMD is just starting to pivot higher.\nFrom its last traded price of $213.43, we’d like to see it challenge its 50-day moving average at around $239.74. AMD is also just starting to pivot from oversold RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. Also fueling upside is optimism following AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su’s meeting with China’s Commerce Minister, where the two spoke about strengthening cooperation.\n\nOn her second day of a China trip, Su exchanged views with MIIT head Li Lecheng on “strengthening cooperation in the digital economy and artificial intelligence sectors, according to a statement issued by MIIT, as reported by the South China Morning Post.\nMicron After an explosive few days on earnings and guidance, Micron ( NASDAQ: MU ) is up another $10.45 a share in premarket.\nWhile Micron is becoming overbought after breaking above triple top resistance, analysts are arguing for more upside. Analysts at Rosenblatt, for example, have a $500 price target on MU with a buy rating, citing accelerating demand for memory and storage thanks to AI.\n\nStory Continues\nAs we noted the other day, Micron’s EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share, with revenue expected to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion.\n\nFueling further upside, Micron says supply-demand issues could create a $100 billion high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market by 2028 – a milestone projected to arrive two years before the company’s previous outlook.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

(NASDAQ: AMD ) is one of the best growth stocks to buy in 2026 . On December 16, Bank of America lowered the firm’s price target on AMD to $260 from $300 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. This sentiment was posted as BofA revised its targets for US semiconductor stocks, identifying 2026 as the midpoint of a decade-long transition toward AI-optimized IT infrastructure. While the firm warns of near-term volatility as investors scrutinize AI returns and hyperscaler spending, it expects this pressure to be mitigated by the expansion of AI factories and LLM development.\n\nIn other news, on December 2, AMD and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE: HPE ) announced an expanded collaboration to develop the next generation of open, scalable AI infrastructure. A central component of this partnership is the AMD Helios architecture, an open, full-stack, rack-scale AI platform. HPE will be among the first system providers to adopt this architecture, which is engineered to simplify the deployment of massive AI clusters for research, cloud, and enterprise environments.\nThe Helios platform is built on the OCP Open Rack Wide design and integrates a comprehensive suite of AMD technologies. This includes next-generation AMD EPYC Venice CPUs, AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs, and AMD Pensando Vulcano NICs for scale-out networking. By utilizing the open ROCm software stack, a single Helios rack can deliver up to 2.9 exaFLOPS of FP4 performance.\n\nTo ensure high-bandwidth and low-latency connectivity, HPE is contributing a purpose-built HPE Juniper Networking scale-up switch, developed in collaboration with Broadcom, which utilizes the Ultra Accelerator Link over Ethernet/UALoE standard. HPE plans to offer the AMD Helios architecture globally starting in 2026.\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor company worldwide. It operates in three segments: Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Can Completion of Qualcomm's Alphawave Buyout Deal Propel Its Shares?\n\nSupriyo Bose\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:19 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nAWE.L\n\nQualcomm Incorporated QCOM has completed the acquisition of U.K.-based chip firm Alphawave Semi for an enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion. The buyout offers Qualcomm an opportunity to expand its presence in high-growth applications, including data centers, artificial intelligence (AI), data networking and data storage.\n\nWith advanced technology solutions that are complementary to power-efficient CPU and NPU cores, Alphawave Semi delivers connectivity products and chiplets that drive faster, more reliable data transfer with higher performance and lower power consumption for 5G wireless, AI and data center applications. The acquisition, therefore, provides the firepower to enable Qualcomm to be the driving force of the next wave of AI innovation.\n\nOver the past few quarters, Qualcomm has aimed to expand its footprint in AI chips through focused R&D initiatives and strategic acquisitions. In April, the company acquired MovianAI, the former generative AI division of VinAI, a prominent Vietnam-based AI firm. The transaction provided Qualcomm access to VinAI’s comprehensive expertise in generative AI, machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing, significantly accelerating its fundamental AI research. The integration of VinAI’s portfolio with Qualcomm’s extensive R&D expertise facilitated the development of state-of-the-art AI-driven solutions for a wide range of industries, including smartphones, PCs, software-defined vehicles and more.\n\nOther Tech Firms Focusing on AI Chips Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD has strengthened its position in the semiconductor market on the back of its evolution as an enterprise-focused company from a pure-bred consumer-PC chip provider. The latest MI300 series accelerator family strengthens its competitive position in the generative AI space. The accelerator from Advanced Micro is based on AMD CDNA 3 accelerator architecture. It supports up to 192 GB of HBM3 memory, enabling efficient running of large language model training (up to 80 billion parameters) and inference for generative AI workloads. Advanced Micro is also benefiting from strong enterprise adoption and expanded cloud deployments.\n\nIntel Corporation INTC has launched the Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) processors engineered to redefine mobile computing for a wide range of use cases, such as gaming, content creation, IT applications and various other businesses.

      "Content": "This Year’s Best Growth Stock Isn’t What You Think It Is\n\nSushree Mohanty\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: APP\n\nAMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nWhen investors think of the market’s best growth stocks, the same familiar mega-cap names like Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Microsoft (MSFT) usually come to mind. But this year’s standout performer isn’t riding on just hype. AppLovin (APP) is achieving tremendous growth by quietly scaling its platform using artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology while producing significant cash flow. Furthermore, its inclusion in the S&P 500 Index signals that expectations are rising.\n\nAppLovin stock has surged 122% year-to-date (YTD), outperforming most in the “Magnificent Seven” group. Let’s see if now is a good time to buy APP stock.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nAnalysts Are Hot on the Foldable iPhone. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Before Apple’s Next Big Product Launch?\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\nA Strong Quarter Built on Core Momentum AppLovin, valued at $244.88 billion, is a technology company that helps mobile app creators sell, monetize, and expand their apps, particularly in mobile gaming. Simply put, AppLovin serves as a behind-the-scenes growth engine for mobile games, linking advertisers with users and assisting developers in scaling quickly, making it one of the most powerful ad-tech platforms in mobile gaming today.\n\nOne of the most significant recent achievements was AppLovin's inclusion in the S&P 500 ($SPX). However, management claims that this puts pressure on the company to enhance its performance to meet expectations. Its third-quarter results indicate that AppLovin is on the right track. AppLovin runs an ad platform that helps app developers find new users. Its AI-powered software shows ads to people most likely to download and engage with an app, which drives higher returns on ad spend for advertisers.\nIn Q3, total revenue increased 68% year-on-year (YoY) to $1.4 billion, owing mostly to model upgrades in the core gaming sector. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.16 billion, up 79% YoY, with an outstanding margin of 82%. Net income rose 92% to $836 million. Core models delivered multiple incremental improvements, and the company’s Max supply-side platform continued to grow at very healthy rates. In the quarter, international expansion also advanced faster than expected. The company extended foreign traffic to advertising marketing websites or shops ahead of schedule, increasing its reach and creating the framework for a broader global advertiser base.\n\nStory Continues\nIn October, the company launched its self-service platform and referral form. Management stated that early data revealed that the platform had efficiently filtered out low-quality ad accounts, and spending from self-service advertisers was already increasing by around 50% week over week. Looking ahead, the company's priority continues to be model improvement. It intends to continue refining onboarding routines while incorporating additional AI agents into workflows to provide a seamless experience for new advertisers.\n\nFree cash flow totaled $1.049 billion, a 92% increase YoY, indicating both profitability and disciplined capital management. The balance sheet also remains robust. The company ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Shareholder returns remain a priority for the company, with approximately 1.3 million shares repurchased for $571 million during the quarter. The company also increased its share repurchase authorization by an additional $3.2 billion.\nLooking ahead, management guided continued growth. For 2025, revenue is expected to be between $1.57 billion and $1.6 billion, representing 12% to 14% sequential growth. Adjusted EBITDA is projected between $1.29 billion and $1.32 billion, with margins holding strong in the 82% to 83% range. Analysts are forecasting rapid top-line and bottom-line growth. Revenue is expected to rise 22.1% to $5.7 billion, while earnings are projected to more than double (up 106.4%) in 2025. Looking ahead to 2026, both revenue (up 35.6%) and earnings (up 55.6%) are expected to keep growing at an unusually fast pace. Trading at 47x forward 2026 earnings, the stock is not cheap. Investors are already paying a premium for future growth, meaning the market expects these forecasts to be met or exceeded.\n\nWhy This Growth Story Stands Out AppLovin’s growth story is defined not just by rapid top-line expansion but by extraordinary margins, strong cash generation, disciplined capital returns, and a clear AI-driven roadmap. Furthermore, inclusion in the S&P 500 is already bringing broader visibility and long-term investors into the stock. If the company delivers on the aggressive growth and earnings expectations, the valuation can be justified.\n\nIs APP Stock a Buy on Wall Street? APP stock has all the love on Wall Street, holding an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Recently, BTIG raised its price target for APP to $771 from $705 while reiterating a “Buy” rating, signaling growing confidence in the stock’s outlook. The firm is constructive on the gaming and gambling end markets heading into 2026.\n\nOut of the 26 analysts who cover APP stock, 19 rate it as a “Strong Buy,” while two rate it as a “Moderate Buy,” four rate it a “Hold,” and one rates it a “Strong Sell.” The average target price of $720.46 is just a hair above current levels. However, the high price estimate of $860 implies that the stock could rally by up to 20% over the next 12 months.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Riding the AI wave? You need a 'strong stomach': Dan Ives' strategy\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: PLTR\n\nCRWV\n\nAMD\n\nIVES\n\nMETA\n\nIn the AI trade, you \"can't just bet on one company,\" Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research, Dan Ives, tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting the importance of diversification for AI investors.\nWatch the video above to hear more about Ives' AI thesis and the 30 stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF ( IVES ).\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThere's another stock I want to ask you about, and that is CoreWeave, which as you know, has sold off pretty sharply. Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

President Trump announced the news in the Oval Office in January, flanked by the respective companies’ leaders, including Oracle chair Larry Ellison — a move that sent the stock soaring .\n\nAI optimism continued to push Oracle shares higher following its quarterly earnings reports in June and September , with AI-driven deals set to push cloud segment revenue to $166 billion in 2030. The stock’s surge in September briefly made Ellison the world’s wealthiest person .\nBut AI euphoria quickly gave way to doubt. Investors became increasingly concerned over the rising use of debt to fund tech firms’ AI spending, just as the payoff of that spending remains hotly debated. Those concerns are evidenced in the budding demand for Big Tech credit default swaps (CDS) — financial contracts that act as insurance by letting investors bet on the likelihood that a company will default on its debt.",

(NASDAQ: AMD ) is one of the Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for 2026 . The share price of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has slid 13.97% during the past month. However, Wall Street maintains a positive opinion on the stock, with analysts’ 12 month price target reflecting 38.7% upside from the current levels.\n\n​On December 17, Louis Miscioscia from Daiwa reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $300 price target. Earlier on December 16, Cantor Fitzgerald and Bank of America Securities also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. However, both firms reduced the price targets. Cantor Fitzgerald reduced the price target from $350 to $300, and BofA lowered the target from $300 to $260.\n​Analyst Vivek Arya of BofA noted that the reduced price target reflects the firm’s updated outlook across the United States semiconductor stocks. The firm sees 2026 as the midpoint of an 8 to 10-year-long AI infrastructure cycle. However, BofA expects volatility in 2026, driven by increased investor scrutiny regarding return on investment and hyperscale cash flow. On the bright side, the firm expects that the volatility will be balanced by increased demand for large language model developers and AI factory expansions.\n\n​On the other hand, C J Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald noted that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is expected to outperform the S&P 500 by about 30 points in calendar year 2025. He noted that this outperformance is driven by the increased demand for AI compute, networking, memory, and equipment sectors. Although the analyst remains cautious in the short-term due to mixed signals, the macro environment remains robust, driven by increased demand for AI infrastructure. Therefore, Muse remains overweight on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company that manufactures GPUs, microprocessors, and high-performance computing solutions and serves a number of high-growth industries like gaming, data centers, and AI.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Intel stock soared in 2025. But the chipmaker still has a long road ahead.\n\nLaura Bratton\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBY\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nFor Intel ( INTC ), 2025 was an eventful year, but not one that necessarily changed its narrative .\nThe storied American chipmaker got a new CEO and won massive investments from the US government , Nvidia ( NVDA ), and SoftBank ( SFTBY ). Those developments helped push the stock up 86% for the year, ahead of gains for the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks and Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). At the same time, Intel's crucial manufacturing segment still lacks a major external customer — something it needs to make the cash-bleeding business viable.\n\n\"Intel's exiting the year with some optimism that they will be a relevant chip manufacturer in the US at some point in time ... and that was definitely an uncertain statement at the start of the year,\" MorningStar analyst Brian Colello told Yahoo Finance.\nAt the same time, he noted, \"There wasn't the massive sort of deal that really establishes Intel, either, in manufacturing.\"\n\nThe company's technology is largely responsible for the digital revolution and Silicon Valley's reputation as a global innovation hub: Intel invented the world's first microprocessors, or computer chips, and the x86 architecture, a critical blueprint for designing computer chips. Its co-founder Gordon Moore created Moore's Law, a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. The company has continued to make its own computer chips, even as the rest of the industry has gone \"fabless\" — outsourcing manufacturing to firms like Taiwan's TSMC ( TSM ).\n\nBut years of missteps and poor investment decisions put Intel's manufacturing segment behind TSMC, which in turn caused its products to lose their edge to competitors. As its chips — CPUs for servers, laptops, and desktops — have lost market share to rivals AMD and Arm ( ARM ), its manufacturing business has been stripped of the scale it needs to remain viable.\nFour years of an aggressive turnaround effort by former CEO Pat Gelsinger to revive Intel's manufacturing arm by opening it to outside customers sent investors fleeing. The massive amount of spending required to reboot the foundry, along with its uncertain success, spooked Wall Street.\nThe arrival of Lip-Bu Tan , who was named chief executive in March following the board's ousting of Gelsinger in late 2024, began to renew faith in the company's potential turnaround. While Intel's strategy remains mostly unchanged under Tan, analysts explained, investors have applauded his sober tone, cost-cutting measures, and wide-ranging industry connections.\n\nStory Continues\nThat tepid faith transformed into confidence when the US government made a rare $9 billion investment in the company — albeit funds Intel was supposed to get anyway from the Biden-era CHIPS Act — following Tan's tiff with President Trump over the CEO's business ties to China.\nOnshoring semiconductor manufacturing has been a focus of the US government since the pandemic highlighted the risk of a tech supply chain reliant on Taiwan. Escalating tensions with China, including the threat of a Taiwan invasion, have further intensified the sense of urgency.\n\n\"Semiconductors are not only economically important, they're actually important from a national security perspective,\" Technalysis analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \"Intel has by far the largest infrastructure in place as a true, real American company.\"\nMany critics believe the broader US turn toward state capitalism under Trump, exemplified by the Intel investment, raises questions about national security and the government's conflicting interests. But analysts say the US government's 10% stake in Intel could lead to various positive outcomes for the company, such as Intel having a say in trade policy that affects semiconductors. More importantly, the US could step in to incentivize or force a major company like Apple to use the chipmaker's foundry.\n\nA $2 billion investment from SoftBank and $5 billion from Nvidia further boosted investor sentiment on Intel stock. The cash infusion helped stem the company's steep losses as it figures out a path forward. Notably, though, the Nvidia deal didn't include an agreement for Intel's foundry business to manufacture the AI giant's chips.\n'Everything hinges on 14A' Intel's biggest potential customers for its foundry business — Nvidia, Apple ( AAPL ), and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) — are also, to some degree, competitors of its products arm and have longstanding relationships with TSMC. Not to mention, TSMC is building $165 billion worth of manufacturing capacity in the US, diminishing the geopolitical argument for those companies to use Intel to produce their chips.\nTo win those customers, Intel will need to prove that its latest generation manufacturing processes are up to snuff. The chipmaker's 18A process, a massive technological feat initially marketed to outside customers, is now being used primarily to make Intel's own products. Whether those products — Intel's upcoming Panther Lake chips for PCs and Clearwater Forest chips for data centers — succeed could help convince companies to use its next-generation processes called 18AP and 14A, analysts said.\n\nAlready, rumors have circulated that Apple could use Intel's manufacturing, specifically its 18AP process, for its lowest-end computer chips.\nIntel has 12 to 18 months to secure a big external customer for 14A in order for that process to continue as planned, BNB Paribas analyst David O'Connor estimated.\nHe called the process \"the crux of Intel being successful on the foundry business or not, or potentially even exiting manufacturing long term.\"\n\"Everything hinges on 14A and the success of that,\" O'Connor said.\nOther analysts gave longer timelines for when Intel would see a turnaround.\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said, \"It took 10 years to break it. Why would it take less than 10 years to fix it?\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Bluesky @laurabratton.bsky.social.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe launch marks Moore Threads' latest bid to challenge foreign rivals like Nvidia, and comes close on the heels of the company's blockbuster initial public offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on December 5.\nZhang Jianzhong, founder and CEO of Moore Threads, pictured in November 2023. Photo: Handout alt=Zhang Jianzhong, founder and CEO of Moore Threads, pictured in November 2023. Photo: Handout>\nThe company's shares have gained more than 480 per cent since their debut, closing at 664.1 yuan on Friday.\n\nZhang claimed that Huashan's performance exceeded that of Nvidia's Hopper series, which includes the H100 and H200 chips, in computing power, memory bandwidth and capacity, but did not provide specifications for the chips.\nThe sale of Nvidia's H100 and H200 - popular choices among global tech firms for AI training - to China was banned until recently by the US government, which cited national security concerns.\nWashington, in a surprising move, recently approved the sale of the H200 chips to China in a move to balance export control, economic interests and national security concerns. But Beijing has yet to approve its domestic sale.\nZhang, 59, an Nvidia veteran and former China market general manager who left to found Moore Threads in 2020, acknowledged that local AI developers had previously hesitated to use domestic chips to train their AI models, fearing subpar outcomes.\n\"But now we can confidently say that if you previously used Hopper [chips], switching to our new product for your large language models will yield better results,\" he said.\n\nStory continues\nMoore Threads also launched Lushan, a new chip focusing on high-performance graphics processing, which could be a boon for China's high-end gamers.\nZhang claimed that the Lushan chip provided 15 times higher gaming performance for triple-A games, an unofficial designation for games with large budgets and long development times.\n\nThe two chips were scheduled to go into mass production next year, Zhang said.\nThe chips were built on Huagang, Moore Thread's next generation of graphics processing unit architecture, which provided a 10 per cent better performance compared with the previous generation, he said.\nOther products announced at the event included a KUAE computing cluster that supports the interconnection of tens of thousands of chips for training large AI models.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) , the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

      "Content": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMU\n\nAVGO\n\nAMD\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock has underperformed its peers in the semiconductor space this year.\nThe company's valuation is becoming cheaper despite its historic operating performance.\nNvidia has a number of catalysts going into 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWhen it comes to leading semiconductor stocks, investors don't need to look much further than companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Broadcom , Advanced Micro Devices , Micron Technology , and of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nWhile Nvidia has been the headline act for much of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, shares have lagged its chip peers throughout 2025.\nAs 2026 draws closer, growth investors may be wondering if Nvidia remains a good buy , or if now is the time to rotate capital away from the world's most valuable company and seek new opportunities.\nWhat should Nvidia investors be on the lookout for in 2026? For the last three years, Wall Street's primary focus surrounding Nvidia is the performance of its data center business. This segment accounts for the bulk of Nvidia's revenue and profits, as it captures demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPU).\nThroughout the AI revolution, investors have paid close attention to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's commentary around the company's Hopper and Blackwell GPU architectures. While Blackwell remains an important catalyst for Nvidia, investors should start to pay closer attention to guidance around the upcoming Rubin chips. So far, investors have already gotten a small preview of demand for Rubin.\n\nFor instance, Huang recently noted that Nvidia has a total order backlog of around $500 billion for Blackwell, Rubin, and accompanying networking products. Of note, a portion of this revenue has already been booked, with an estimated $300 billion expected to be recognized during 2026.\nIn addition, Anthropic recently signed a $30 billion compute capacity agreement with Microsoft . As part of the deal, Anthropic will be leveraging clusters of Blackwell and Rubin chips.\nAt a macro level, Goldman Sachs estimates that hyperscalers including Microsoft, Alphabet , Amazon , and Meta Platforms will spend roughly $500 billion on AI capital expenditures (capex) next year. Taking this one step further, McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion opportunity over the next five years.\nAgainst this backdrop, investors should monitor how these secular tailwinds fueling accelerated investment in infrastructure continue to impact Nvidia, being aware that rising infrastructure will impact Nvidia well beyond its core data center operation.\n\nStory Continues\nThroughout next year and beyond, Nvidia's opportunities in adjacent markets, including next-generation CPUs and accelerated computing operating systems, should begin to come into focus as well, thanks to some savvy partnerships with Intel and Palantir Technologies .\nNvidia's valuation trends are getting interesting In the table, I've summarized Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, as of the end of each quarter over the last year.\nMetric\nCurrent\n3Q25\n2Q25\n1Q25\n4Q24\nPrice-to-sales (P/S)\n23.3\n30.2\n29.6\n20.7\n26.4\nForward price-to-earnings (P/E)\n23.4\n31.5\n57.4\n24.8\n28.1\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\nThere are two anomalies that stick out from the data.\nFirst, Nvidia's valuation multiples experienced notable compression during the company's first fiscal quarter of 2025 (ended April 30). This was driven by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, as well as fear that a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek could pose a threat to U.S. dominance in the AI landscape.\n\nThe second theme that's beginning to become more noticeable is that Nvidia's P/S and forward P/E ratios are hovering around the same levels as their prior lows earlier this year. Once again, I think this contraction revolves around fear more than anything else. Specifically, investors are concerned about rising competition from AMD and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from Broadcom.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy heading into the new year? While rising competition in the chip space is a very real thing, I don't see Nvidia necessarily losing its grip anytime soon. AI infrastructure is expected to be a multitrillion-dollar market that lasts several years. Buying into the idea that the hyperscalers will migrate away from Nvidia's GPUs overnight is unrealistic.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is becoming cheaper by the day despite the company operating at historic levels and signing new deals and partnerships -- effectively broadening its total addressable market (TAM) beyond data center services and simultaneously bringing new levels of business visibility as the AI infrastructure era kicks off.\nI think now is a great time to buy the dip and capitalize on the chip king's ongoing sell-off. Investors with a long-term time horizon could use the recent depressed price action to add to a core buy-and-hold position. Given these dynamics, I see Nvidia as a no-brainer heading into the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

The company operates two primary business segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.\nOn the semiconductor side, Broadcom is the leader in custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) designed specifically for data center AI workloads.\n\nASICs are specialized chips built to exact specifications for hyperscalers such as Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which need massive computing power.\nThe infrastructure software segment, which includes the VMware acquisition, provides enterprise software for planning, developing, automating, managing, and securing applications across different platforms.\nWith roots in the technical heritage of AT&T/Bell Labs, Lucent, and Hewlett-Packard/Agilent, Broadcom combines more than 60 years of innovation with global scale and engineering depth. The company serves the world’s most successful tech companies by focusing on technologies that connect our world.\nCEO Hock Tan explained the strategy at the Goldman Sachs technology conference: Broadcom is laser-focused on about seven customers building large language models and racing toward what he calls “super intelligence.” These companies are collectively spending around $30 billion annually on AI compute infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nRather than pursuing thousands of enterprise customers who might spend $10 million each on merchant GPUs, Broadcom sees its biggest opportunity in providing custom chips and networking infrastructure for these hyperscalers building AI at unprecedented scale.\nWhy Did JPMorgan Upgrade Broadcom Stock? JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur pointed to the continued surge in capital expenditure by hyperscalers and the consequent rise in demand for ASIC chips as key drivers for Broadcom’s growth.\nBroadcom reported Q4 2025 revenue of $18.02 billion, up 28% year over year. The semiconductor segment jumped 35% to $11.07 billion, while the high-margin infrastructure software segment grew 19% to $6.94 billion.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, Broadcom’s revenue hit $63.9 billion, a 24% increase driven overwhelmingly by AI, which saw revenue grow 65% year-over-year to $20 billion.\nBut here’s where it gets really interesting: Broadcom forecasts its AI business will hit $8.2 billion in Q1 2026 alone, marking roughly 100% year-over-year growth. And Tan revealed that his compensation package tied to 2030 targets includes achieving AI revenue over $120 billion — a sixfold increase from the $20 billion generated in fiscal 2025.\nOne customer prospect turned into over $10 billion in orders expected in the second half of fiscal 2026—a major driver behind this is that Broadcom designs and manufactures Google’s custom TPU chips, a specialized ASIC built specifically for AI tasks rather than general-purpose computing (GPU). Google’s latest TPUv7 chip is performing better than expected and attracting major customers like Anthropic and Meta, with Anthropic alone committing to potentially 1 million units.\n\nWall Street Doubled Down Many investors have been trying to make the most of the AI trade, but when AVGO dipped over 27% in Q1 2025 — hitting a yearly low of $138 in April — that was a green light for some of Wall Street’s most famous money managers.\nThese investors spotted what Michael Burry later articulated in his new Substack: while 40%-50% of hyperscaler spending goes to Nvidia GPUs with “ever shorter product cycles,” Broadcom is positioned differently.\n\nBurry specifically named Broadcom alongside Google, Amazon, and Microsoft as “very well-funded” and capable of challenging Nvidia’s dominance.\nMajor Q1 2025 buyers included:\nJeremy Grantham (GMO): Bought over 1.5 million shares despite calling AI a bubble. His fund holds a $291 million position in Broadcom versus just $21 million in Nvidia — nearly 14x more exposure to AVGO than NVDA.\nRenaissance Technologies: Purchased over 2.4 million shares, massively increasing its stake. Regarded as the most successful hedge fund of all time, Renaissance’s bet signals strong conviction in Broadcom’s differentiated positioning.\nTwo Sigma Advisors: Bought around 2.5 million shares, bringing its total position to 3.9 million shares — the largest holding since Q3 2024 when Broadcom traded at just $159 versus Q1’s average of $211.\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio): Added 280,000 shares, betting that Broadcom’s custom ASIC strategy offers structural advantages over commodity GPU manufacturers.\n\nThe stock has since recovered to around $330. While Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting hit other AI stocks, Broadcom’s $73 billion backlog of multi-year contracts with just 7-10 customers provides revenue certainty that short-cycle GPU sales can’t match.\nIs Broadcom a Buy? Broadcom stock has pulled back from December highs near $415 to around $330. If you’ve been on the sidelines, here are three bullish indicators worth considering:\n1. The structural moat is different. While Nvidia sells commodity GPUs facing shorter product cycles and growing competition, Broadcom has locked in $73 billion in backlog with just 7-10 hyperscaler customers through multi-year custom chip contracts. These aren’t off-the-shelf components that competitors can easily replicate.\n\n2. Wall Street’s smartest money doubled down. Renaissance Technologies, Jeremy Grantham, Two Sigma, and Ray Dalio all bought aggressively when the stock dipped in Q1. Grantham holds 14 times more Broadcom than Nvidia despite calling AI a bubble, betting that custom ASICs offer better risk-adjusted returns than merchant chip sales.\n3. Broadcom (mostly) dodged the Burry selloff. Michael Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting triggered the recent tech selloff, but he specifically named Broadcom as well-positioned to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. The company’s custom chip focus sidesteps the depreciation and replacement cycle concerns hitting pure-play GPU manufacturers.\nThe stock trades at 61x earnings, but with 100% AI revenue growth and signed contracts providing multi-year visibility, Broadcom offers a differentiated AI infrastructure play built on structural advantages rather than pure momentum and hype.\nOn the date of publication, Justin Estes did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Prediction: These 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks Could Be Worth More Than Palantir by 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 3:05 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nAMD\n\nCRM\n\nKey Points Palantir's valuation levels are far too high.\nAMD believes it can grow at a rapid pace.\nSalesforce's stock is reasonably priced for the growth it provides.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nPalantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) has been on a remarkable run since the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race began in 2023. Its stock is up over 2,700% since 2023, and has doubled in each year since then.\n\nHowever, there is a bit of a problem with Palantir's stock. It has become drastically overvalued, and I think it could be ripe for a pullback in 2026, opening the door to other companies to surge past it.\nTwo AI companies that could be larger than Palantir by the end of 2026 are AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) . Palantir currently sports a $435 billion market cap , while AMD and Salesforce are much smaller at $343 billion and $250 billion, respectively. Through a combination of these stocks rising and Palantir's falling, I think the order could be shaken up in 2026.\nWhy is Palantir overvalued? As mentioned, Palantir's stock has risen by over 2,700% since 2023. However, its revenue is only up a mere 104%. That's because investors are willing to pay more for Palantir's stock now than they were three years ago. There is a limit to how much investors should be willing to pay, and Palantir is well beyond that threshold.\nAt 120 times sales and 254 times forward earnings, Palantir is among the most expensive stocks in the market. These levels also convey massive growth expectations that Palantir may not be able to live up to. As a result, I think a large pullback may be coming in 2026, as these levels are impossible to sustain unless Palantir's growth rate continues to accelerate.\n\nI think Palantir's growth rate will moderate in 2026, which will send investors running. That opens the door for AMD and Salesforce, as each is slated to have a strong 2026 as well, but at a much more reasonable price tag.\nThe case for AMD AMD has played second fiddle to Nvidia throughout the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) and the technology that supports them aren't nearly as advanced as Nvidia's, although that gap is starting to close. Management is bullish about its progress over the next few years and has released a bold projection for its business through 2030. They believe that their data center revenue growth rate will be around a 60% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR).\n\nThat's a huge step forward compared to Q3's 22% growth rate, and if AMD can deliver on these expectations, there's no doubt it will be a strong stock pick for 2026 and beyond. AMD isn't all data center computing, and its other two segments are expected to deliver a 10% CAGR. Overall, that will lead to a 35% CAGR through 2030, but that will be plenty to push AMD to become an excellent pick.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD's valuation isn't cheap at 11 times sales and 54 times forward earnings, but it's far more reasonable than Palantir's. If Palantir stumbles and AMD stays steady, AMD should be a larger company by the end of 2026.\nThe case for Salesforce Salesforce has advertised its AI prowess, but has yet to see huge impacts in its financials. Salesforce is the industry leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software, and has saturated the market. It isn't easy to acquire new customers when you're only able to grow at the pace of the broader economy, so Salesforce has to create new products and upsell existing clients.\nAlthough its revenue growth has struggled to cross the double-digit mark, its diluted earnings per share (EPS) have been phenomenal. This is a sign of a maturing business and has also brought Salesforce's valuation to a reasonable level. The stock trades for 22 times forward earnings, making it the cheapest stock on this list.\n\nIf Palantir stumbles due to high expectations and Salesforce continues chugging along with incremental growth, I wouldn't be surprised to see Salesforce at a higher market cap than Palantir by the end of 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after investor optimism around artificial intelligence fueled broad market gains. Technology stocks with a focus on artificial intelligence once again led the market higher, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500.\nCompanies at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, saw significant jumps in their share prices. The rally reflects a renewed belief among investors in the transformative potential of AI technology to drive future growth and productivity.\n\nThe rally was further supported by a surprise cooling in the November consumer price index (CPI) report, which triggered market pricing for additional rate cuts in the coming year. This created a more favorable environment for growth-oriented companies.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\nProcessors and Graphics Chips company AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 6.8%.

Is now the time to buy Nova? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free for active Edge members.\n\nZooming In On AMD (AMD) AMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 29 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 4.3% on the news that investors rotated out of AI-linked high-flyers following underwhelming earnings updates from Oracle and Broadcom as the core thesis shifted from \"growth at any cost\" to \"prove the returns.\"\n\nOracle triggered the alarm by missing revenue estimates while simultaneously hiking capital expenditures by $15 billion. This reignited fears that AI infrastructure spending is outpacing actual monetization. Broadcom compounded the anxiety; despite beating earnings, its stock fell as CFO Kirsten Spears cautioned that gross margins may come under pressure as product mix shifts further toward system-level AI sales. This sparked a macro rotation away from AI infrastructure and power plays. High-valuation names like AMD, Vertiv, and Bloom Energy fell as markets looked to sectors that can benefit from the recent Fed rate cut and a resilient economy.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD is up 77.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $214.30 per share, it is still trading 18.9% below its 52-week high of $264.33 from October 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,299.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

Those gains \"helped stabilize a market that was kind of acting a little squirrely over the past week,\" he added.\nStocks have been choppy in recent weeks amid unease over the massive spending spree on AI infrastructure.

We're digging into all of this in today's options pit, sponsored by Tasty trade.\n00:15 Speaker A\nAnd Henry Schwartz, CBOE Vice President of Market Intelligence is here to discuss. Uh, let's talk about this surge in options demand. We were just talking offline. You said it's up what three times since uh COVID?\n00:32 Henry Schwartz\nYeah.\n00:33 Speaker A\nThat is incredible. So, what is this trend tell you?\n00:36 Henry Schwartz\nSo, I mean, this year we're going to see 15 billion option contracts trade. Uh if you go back to to just before COVID, it was about 4 billion contracts a year. So, and in fact, I've been doing the calculations. It looks like the 15 billionth contract will trade on Christmas Eve.\n00:52 Speaker A\nMhm.\n00:52 Henry Schwartz\nI think we should have a door prize or something. Let's see if we can figure out what trade.\n00:56 Speaker A\nThere might be some binary option futures betting markets that could uh take care of that.\n01:00 Henry Schwartz\nAbsolutely. Well, I mean, that that's actually kind of one of the big themes, right? As we've seen this the evolution of risk taking, betting, you know, there's a lot of different ways to discuss it. Um, you know, the the you know, COVID really or you know, that whole kind of market environment really changed the landscape for options trading. And basically, uh we saw growth of about 50% in 2020 and it has kept up and it is retail that is really driving most of that. You know, we continue to see, you know, a healthy institutional business. Uh we see, you know, we see, you know, the the big theme really for this year is kind of everything is just stronger. Across the board, no matter what asset classes you look at, if you're talking about index options like SPX or VIX. If you're talking about ETF options, which you know, we were just talking about kind of the explosion in in number of ETFs and single stock option flow, which is really, you know, primarily retail driven. And when you have a year like, you know, like we're seeing this year with, you know, basically the broad averages up, you know, between 15 and 20%, uh that just brings in more and more activity.\n02:08 Speaker A\nSo, I've been thinking about this and tell me if I'm just way offline here. But if we take it back to early late 2020, early 2021, that's when we had the whole Reddit GameStop phenomenon going on. Arguably, a lot of it was fueled with the stimulus checks, the stimmies. and next year is going to be a blockbuster record year for fiscal stimulus. Um there's going to be a lot of tax refunds and I'm just wondering, is there any way we could have some kind of a repeat of that, maybe not to the same extent, but do you think that we just get another surge, um perhaps just because people have more money to play with?\n02:46 Henry Schwartz\nI I mean, I think you have you have a lot of dynamics going on at the same time. You know, we do have a a a rate, you know, the rates are going down in the cycle, but you also do have some concerns about the labor market, you have concerns about, you know, just fundamental valuations. So there's a little bit of push and pull. I think, you know, that the the COVID situation and you know, zero interest rates and stimulus and meme stock, uh that that was such a perfect storm of just kind of\n03:28 Speaker A\nAgreed, perfect storm.\n03:29 Henry Schwartz\nexplosive bullish activity and and and retail were able to capitalize on it. You know, in a large part because they were at home and they kind of had the freedom to trade. You also had commissions that basically gone to zero just leading into that. So, everything came together and you know, a lot of these traders found each other and learned from each other on Reddit and on, you know, social media. Uh I don't know if 2026 is going to be quite the same. I think there's a little bit more kind of back and forth. Uh but you know, at least in terms of the options activity, you know, we continue to see new brokerage firms coming uh online. We see the existing brokerage firms, you know, innovating and and rolling out new platforms and doing some really interesting things. So, you know, I see the business, at least in the options world continuing to to do very, very well. And you know, in terms of assets, uh you know, I think that you have this environment now where, you know, the US has had an amazing run and there's a lot of people that say, oh, you know, I don't know, this is getting a little bit tired. Uh but at the same time, you you you know, every time we have a dip, uh,\n04:36 Speaker A\nAnd that's arguably better for options traders. I mean, option traders like volatility. I I I want to make sure we get to a couple other things here. The other is the rise of zero-dated options. And so that just gives more opportunities. Back in the day, you only had monthlies, so you had to wait every month. Then we had weeklies, then basically we have dailies now. And that has just increased uh this volume of options. Talk to me about some of the other innovations. I know CBOE has a bunch of new products, too.\n05:08 Henry Schwartz\nYeah, so the so we pioneered the zero DTE or the daily option option cycle starting 2022 and those are now about 2/3 of the activity uh in SPX and um and some of the big ETFs. Uh and there there's no signs of that slowing down. Uh we just rolled out the Mag 10 index, which is the Mag 7 plus uh Broadcom, uh AMD and Palantir. And you know, those 10 symbols together do about a third of the single stock option. Out of almost 4,000 single stocks. So you you can see how concentrated it is. That's what the trader, that's what the investing public really, really is interested in. They're following the stories, they're getting in and getting out of these stocks. And so the Mag 10 index which launched about a month ago, I'm very proud to say I was the very first trade in in Mag 10. and that option expired today and I made a little bit of money at it. Uh we actually have daily options coming in those just uh in two weeks. So that's, you know, and that's new, right? This this is the first time that that there's been a uh an index that's not quite as broad-based with the daily options on it as well. So, um you know, there's you know, the the industry just continues to keep innovating. You know, we see a lot of work going on in complex order execution, which is you know, basically about a third of the activity is customers trading one option against another, vertical spreads, calendar spreads, exactly. Uh and that you know, CBOE and all the other exchanges continue to kind of take steps to make that uh easier to do, add functionality. You can now trade flex options versus listed options, which is a kind of a special option that lets people pick their own expiration date and um and strike price and even exercise style.\n06:56 Speaker A\nAll right, Henry, we got to leave it there, but congratulations on your Mag 10 trade. I hope it pretends a bullish 2026. Thanks for joining us in studio here.\n07:05 Henry Schwartz\nAwesome.\n07:06 Speaker A\nAll right, we'll\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Revenue fell 28% in 2015, primarily due to declining processor sales, and the company posted a net loss of $660 million that year.\nHowever, in May 2015, AMD announced a new multi-year strategy focused on high-performance gaming, immersive platforms, and data center products. And investors who believed in the company's vision have seen incredible results.\nThe growth of a $10,000 investment in AMD Over the last 10 years, AMD's share price has risen by 8,710% (as of Dec. 16, 2025). If you'd invested $10,000 in AMD stock 10 years ago, your shares would now be worth a staggering $881,310. A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) , on the other hand, would be worth $33,210 -- still a great return, but not the life-changing results of AMD's stock.\n\nAMD's success is an example of why a company's management is such an important consideration when evaluating stocks. Lisa Su, who became president and CEO in October 2014, guided AMD's focus to high-growth areas and diversified its product line so it wasn't overly dependent on PC product sales.\nFor most investors, putting $10,000 into a company during the early stages of a comeback is too risky. However, AMD has continued to reward more recent investors as well. Over the last six months, it's up 79%. Considering it's now one of the leading artificial intelligence (AI) companies, providing CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive computing solutions, it also looks like a good pick to keep outperforming the market.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "US Reopens China's Door to Nvidia Chips--But Risks Undermining Its AI Edge\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:01 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nPolicy shifts in Washington have reopened a sensitive debate around Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and the balance between commercial opportunity and national security in advanced semiconductors. Earlier this month, the White House granted Nvidia permission to resume shipments of its H200 artificial intelligence chips to China, while also loosening restrictions on Intel and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ). Although the H200 is not Nvidia's most advanced product, it remains meaningfully ahead of Chinese-made alternatives. Research cited from the Institute for Progress suggests the H200 delivers 32% more processing power and 50% more memory bandwidth than Huawei's Ascend 910C, while also being cheaper to operate and more reliable, reinforcing its appeal for AI model training and deployment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nSupporters of the decision argue the policy could help slow China's domestic chip development by keeping Chinese customers dependent on US technology, while preserving revenue streams that US firms could reinvest into future semiconductor innovation. They point to concerns that Huawei may be closing the gap by linking more chips together and potentially expanding production next year. However, Commerce Department estimates indicate Huawei is expected to produce about 200,000 Ascend chips this year, compared with roughly 14 million AI chips deployed by US companies, raising questions about whether domestic supply can meaningfully satisfy Chinese demand. Under the current framework, companies must still apply for licenses to import H200s, and US officials have indicated the government would take a 25% cut of any such sales.\n\nCritics caution that allowing H200 exports could gradually chip away at what remains the US's largest advantage in AI: aggregate computing power. As of mid-2025, the US accounted for nearly three-quarters of global AI supercomputer capacity, compared with about 14% for China, a gap seen as critical for training frontier models. There is concern that Chinese authorities could direct imported H200s toward leading firms and, through civilian channels, into defense-related research, potentially accelerating advances in both commercial AI and military applications. With bipartisan support in Congress for tighter controls, lawmakers are expected to scrutinize the administration's assumptions on Huawei's progress and weigh testimony from AI developers and cloud providers on whether the current approach strengthens, or possibly undermines, long-term US competitiveness in artificial intelligence.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Broadcom vs. AMD: Which AI Chip Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 7:45 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points AMD is looking to carve a niche in the inference market.\nBroadcom has a massive opportunity with custom AI chips.\nThe stocks trade at similar valuations.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nTwo of the top semiconductor companies looking to eat into Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure dominance are Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) . Both stocks have performed well in 2025, led by AMD, which is up more than 70% year to date, as of this writing, compared to about a 45% gain for Broadcom.\nThe question, though, is which stock will perform better in 2026. Let's look at the case for both stocks.\nThe case for AMD AMD is the distant No. 2 player in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market behind Nvidia. However, the company has carved out a nice niche in inference, where price-per-inference costs are more important than raw computing power, given its ongoing nature, and where Nvidia's CUDA software moat isn't quite as wide. Importantly, inference is also eventually expected to become a much larger market than training over time.\n\nMicrosoft has already been working on a toolkit to convert CUDA software code to AMD's ROCm in order to use more of AMD's GPUs for inference. Meanwhile, the company struck a partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of GPUs, beginning with 1 gigawatt next year. As part of the deal, OpenAI is also taking a stake in AMD through warrants that vest based on deployment milestones. It also has a deal with Saudi Arabian company Humain.\nGPUs are not AMD's only business, however. The company is also the leading provider of central processing units (CPUs), both in computers and in the data center. While GPUs provide the muscle, CPUs act as the brain. The market isn't as large as the one for GPUs, but it is growing quickly, and AMD has been taking share in the data center space.\n\nThe case for Broadcom Broadcom is attacking the AI chip market much differently than Nvidia and AMD. Instead of making GPUs, the company helps customers design custom AI ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). These are preprogrammed chips that are hardwired for specific tasks, and as such, they can both perform better and be more energy efficient.\n\nBroadcom helped Alphabet develop its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which have led to other big hyperscalers (owners of massive data centers) becoming customers. It has said its three furthest along customers could be a more than $60 billion opportunity in its fiscal year 2027 (ending October 2027), and a fourth customer, Anthropic, has placed a $21 billion order for Alphabet's TPUs that it will fulfill.\n\nStory Continues\nIn addition, Broadcom is working with OpenAI, and it will deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to be completed before the end of 2029. There have also been reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on developing its own custom AI chips and that they could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nBroadcom also has a strong networking portfolio, which consists of components, such as Ethernet switches and routers, that help transfer data and distribute AI workloads across servers. This business has also been booming, given the ongoing data center build-out.\nThe verdict Both AMD and Broadcom trade at similar valuations. AMD has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 32 times next year's analyst estimates, while Broadcom trades at around 33.5 times its fiscal-year 2026 estimates (ending October 2026). As such, which stock outperforms will likely come down to their growth next year, as well as future expectations.\n\nI think both stocks can once again have strong performances in 2026, but I think Broadcom will be the stock that will outperform. The company just has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it over the next few years with custom chips. The custom chip business requires high upfront costs, so these are multiyear commitments, usually for large projects. Many of these deals are already in place (as seen in its $73 billion backlog), and now it just has to deliver.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

STRL , as the Bull of the Day and Taylor Morrison Home Corporation TMHC, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on &mdash; Micron Technology, Inc. MU, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all three stocks:\nBull of the Day: Sterling Infrastructure , Inc. is a leading U.S. infrastructure company that&rsquo;s become an under-the-radar Wall Street star over the past five years, posting massive growth on the back of converging megatrends.\nSterling is benefiting from the artificial intelligence data center boom, reshoring, energy industry expansion, and big spending across traditional infrastructure segments, such as roads and beyond.\n\nThe U.S. infrastructure standout, which already more than doubled its earnings between 2021 and 2024, is projected to nearly double its EPS again from 2024 to 2026 on the back of strong sales growth.\nSTRL&rsquo;s impressive upward earnings revisions trend earns it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). And it launched a new $400 million stock repurchase plan in November.\nThe AI infrastructure-boosted stock has soared over 80% in 2025 as part of a huge ~1,500% run in the last five years. Yet investors can buy the stock around 25% below its November records as it looks to find support at a key technical range.\nBuy Soaring AI Infrastructure Stock STRL Now and Hold Sterling is a Texas-based infrastructure standout that specializes in heavy civil and site development projects across three main segments: E-Infrastructure, Transportation, and Building Solutions. The firm focuses on the first phase of construction, from site selection to planning and site prep. Sterling boasts that it can &ldquo;scale to meet any size project.&rdquo;\n\nThe company&rsquo;s E-Infrastructure Solutions unit operates across large-scale site work for data centers, e-commerce warehouses, manufacturing, and energy. Its Transportation Solutions space, as the name suggests, is focused on highways, bridges, airports, rail, and more. Sterling&rsquo;s Building Solutions segment is centered around foundations and more for homes, parking structures, and commercial buildings.\nSterling is capitalizing on compounding megatrends across the U.S. that are just beginning. The company is riding long-term multi-decade upside across the AI data center boom and the rapid energy and grid expansion that&rsquo;s needed to support the AI age.\nOn top of that, the U.S. is reshoring critical industries such as semiconductor manufacturing and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on traditional infrastructure such as bridges and roads after decades of neglect.\n\nStory Continues\nThe firm is ready to grow directly from expansion across &ldquo;Mission&ndash;Critical Markets: Data Centers, Next Generation Manufacturing, Semiconductor Fabrication.&rdquo;\nInfrastructure Stock STRL&rsquo;s Huge Growth Upside STRL is landing &ldquo;mission-critical projects, including data centers and manufacturing.&rdquo; The company posted a huge beat-and-raise third quarter in early November, topping our Zacks EPS estimate by 25% and providing another round of strong guidance.\nIt also flexed its financial muscles and upside to shareholders by authorizing a new $400 million stock repurchase program. This backdrop is why all four brokerage recommendations Zacks has are &ldquo;Strong Buys.&rdquo;\n\nIt grew its signed backlog 34% YoY to $2.6 billion. &ldquo;With the addition of CEC, the aggregate of our combined backlog and high-probability future phase work gives us visibility into a pool of work totaling more than $4 billion,&rdquo; CEO Joe Cutillo said in prepared comments.\nSterling is projected to grow its revenue by 13% in 2025 and 19% next year to reach $2.84 billion, after averaging 14% revenue growth in the trailing five years.\nBetter yet, it is projected to expand its adjusted earnings by 71% this year and 15% next year to nearly double its bottom line from $6.10 in FY24 to $11.95 share in 2026.\nThe growth-heavy infrastructure company&rsquo;s earnings estimates have surged by 9% for 2025 and 2026 since its Q3 release to earn Sterling a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The recent positivity extends its impressive run of upward EPS revisions.\n\nIt&rsquo;s also worth stressing that STRL grew its GAAP earnings from $1.50 a share in 2020 to $8.28 in 2024.\nBuy this Market-Crushing Stock on the Dip for Upside and Value STRL has skyrocketed ~1,500% in the past five years to blow away its industry&rsquo;s 145% and the S&P 500&rsquo;s 85%. This is part of a much larger surge over the past 25 years. Sterling shares have climbed 80% in 2025, including its 25% drop from its early November records.\nThe stock jumped 7% on Thursday as the market and the broader AI everything trade rebounded after a mid-week selloff. It found buyers at the critical level highlighted in blue below.\n\nSterling trades around 35% below its average Zacks price target. The recent 25% pullback, mixed with its strong earnings outlook, has it trading not too far above its industry and the S&P 500 (both around 22.8X) at 25X forward 12-month earnings. This marks impressive value considering STRL has crushed both over the last five and 25 years.\nBear of the Day: Taylor Morrison Home Corporation is a national land developer and homebuilder giant that&rsquo;s seen its earnings revisions tumble over the last year based on a multitude of headwinds.\nTMHC&rsquo;s recent negative earnings per share (EPS) revisions earn the homebuilder a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The company&rsquo;s near-term outlook remains strained, given the industry and economy-wide setbacks it is facing.\n\nShould Investors Stay Away from TMHC Stock for Now? Taylor Morrison is one of the largest U.S. homebuilders. The Scottsdale, Arizona-headquartered firm designs, builds, and sells single-family homes, ranging from first-time/entry-level to move-up and luxury/resort-style. TMHC posted booming revenue growth between 2013 and 2022, highlighted by 29% expansion in 2020 and 22% growth in 2021.\n\nThe wild Covid-driven housing boom created a massive pull forward across the home-buying market. The market also benefited from a buyer-friendly low mortgage rate environment.\nThe housing market has cooled significantly since then as home prices and mortgage rates soared.\nTaylor Morrison is projected to see its revenue fall 2.4% in 2025 and then fade 6.5% next year. Its adjusted earnings are expected to drop 5.5% and 12.5%, respectively.\nThe company&rsquo;s earnings estimate has dropped 21% for Q4 since its last report and 13% for 2026. TMHC&rsquo;s downbeat earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and extend its downward run that began in late 2024.\nThat said, the homebuilder&rsquo;s long-term outlook likely remains firmly intact given the dire need for more housing inventory in the U.S. &ldquo;Encouragingly, net absorption paces improved each month during the quarter, in contrast to typical seasonal slowing into the end of summer as the improvement in mortgage interest rates helped spur activity,&rdquo; CEO Sheryl Palmer said in prepared Q3 remarks in October.\n\n&ldquo;Going forward, we believe strengthened consumer confidence is critical to further stabilizing demand, especially for discretionary home purchase decisions in our move-up and resort lifestyle communities.&rdquo;\nIn the near term, persistently high mortgage rates could continue to suppress demand, leading to slower home sales, increased cancellations, and pressure on margins if TMHC is forced to rely more on incentives to move inventory.\nTaylor Morrison doesn&rsquo;t pay a dividend, and its Building Products - Home Builders industry is in the bottom 10% of 240 Zacks industries. This is worth stressing since studies have shown that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to a stock's industry group.\nInvestors might want to stay away from Taylor Morrison for now since the housing market remains under stress.\n\nAdditional content:\nMicron's Blowout Earnings: The Best AI Stock for 2026? As 2026 draws closer, investors are actively seeking stocks poised to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Micron Technology, Inc. stands out given its recent strong quarterly results. So, does the stock offer an attractive buying opportunity for the year ahead?\nLet&rsquo;s see in detail &ndash;\n\nMicron's Blowout Earnings Highlight AI-Driven Growth Micron recently reported strong fiscal first-quarter 2026 results, reassuring investors that demand for its products has strengthened significantly. Micron's revenues for the quarter came in at $13. 64 billion, up 56.8% from the same period a year ago, according to investors. micron.com. Wall Street analysts had expected Micron's sales to come in around $ 12.88 billion.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, all four of Micron's business segments posted revenue growth, led by its core cloud memory business unit, which reported sales of $5.28 billion, up a whopping 99.5%. This robust performance helped boost Micron's profitability, with non-GAAP net income reaching $5.48???billion, or $4.78 per diluted share, well above analysts&rsquo; expectations of $3.94.\nSoaring demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips has been a major driver of the company's stellar quarterly performance. HBM chips, which enable high-speed data processing and reduce power consumption, remain in short supply due to the AI infrastructure boom, which is why they are in high demand.\nSanjay Mehrotra, Micron's CEO, said that &ldquo;the growth in AI data center capacity is driving a significant increase in demand for high-performance and high-capacity memory and storage.&rdquo; He noted that demand for server units has risen significantly and is expected to remain strong through 2026.\n\nMicron expects even stronger results in fiscal second-quarter 2026, with revenues projected between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) ranging from $8.22 to $8.62. The company already reported a record free cash flow of $3.9 billion in fiscal first-quarter 2026, providing ample funds to support future growth initiatives.\nMicron's Record Earnings Make It a Leading AI Stock for 2026 Rising AI-driven demand for Micron's HBM chips has not only helped the company deliver a strong quarter but is also expected to drive the company's growth momentum further into 2026. This positions Micron as one of the most compelling AI stocks to buy for 2026.\nLest we forget, Micron supplies HBM chips to NVIDIA Corporation as well as to its rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. , ensuring strong demand for its products even if NVIDIA's competitive edge weakens. Thus, Micron's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 23.9%. The company's $19.85 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 80.9% year over year.\n\nMicron currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Why This AI Stock Could Outperform Nvidia Over the Next 5 Years\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Nvidia is sold out of cloud GPUs.\nAMD and Broadcom could take market share from it in the data center segment.\nAll three chipmakers outsource much of their manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has led the artificial intelligence (AI) investing sector since 2023. While 2025 hasn't been quite as good a year for its shareholders as the previous two were, the stock is still up around 30% year to date. The chipmaker is still a dominant force in the AI realm, but observers are raising the possibility that its competitors could start taking meaningful market share away from it.\nShould Nvidia start to lose its edge over the competition, it may no longer be the best AI stock to own. But over the next five years, which stock could overtake it?\nDifferent approaches to the AI computing problem Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , which are computing units that can process many thousands of calculations in parallel. This makes them perfectly suited for tasks that require a lot of computing power and that can be broken down into many smaller tasks that can be handled independently. Most artificial intelligence workloads fall into that category. Nvidia's GPUs have been the most popular parallel processors available since before the AI infrastructure buildout started in 2023, but that may change.\n\nOne issue Nvidia is having right now is that demand is outpacing its supply. In its earnings release for its fiscal 2026 third quarter (which ended Oct. 26), CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. While some may view this as a good problem to have, I think it's a bit of an issue. Its clients' needs for AI accelerator chips aren't going to decrease just because Nvidia can't fully supply them. Instead, they are going to look for alternative solutions.\nThat could open up the door for competing chipmakers to steal some significant market share, particularly if buyers find that the alternative products provide similar performance with lower costs. Two chipmakers that appear poised to benefit are AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) .\n\nAMD is a direct competitor to Nvidia, as it also makes GPUs. It recently forecast that it would grow its data center revenue at a 60% compound annual rate over the next five years. For reference, its data center division's revenue growth was a mere 22% during Q3. For AMD to grow as fast as predicted, it will need to eat into Nvidia's market share, which it already might be doing.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom is taking a different approach to the AI computing problem. Rather than designing another general-purpose GPU, it's partnering directly with hyperscalers to design custom AI computing units -- called application-specific integrated circuits -- that meet their precise needs. Among the best examples of these chips are Alphabet 's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nTPUs and other custom AI computing units aren't designed to handle a wide variety of workloads like GPUs are. However, when these computing units only see the one type of workload that they are configured for, they can deliver higher performance at lower costs. The trade-off of lower price and higher performance for less flexibility is a no-brainer for many data center operators, and Broadcom's approach could eat into Nvidia's market share as AI workloads become more streamlined.\nThese companies have the potential to steal some of Nvidia's market share over the next five years, but all the chip designers all have one thing in common.\nTaiwan Semiconductor will rise regardless of which chip designers are winning None of these companies fabricates its computing units in-house. Instead, the \"fabless\" chipmakers outsource that work to a handful of other companies that specialize in fabrication. In the chip production realm, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) captures nearly all of the highest-end work. It's not only the largest chip manufacturer by revenue in the world, but also a leader in its ability to deliver the most advanced chips. Broadcom, AMD, and Nvidia often work with Taiwan Semiconductor for their cutting-edge chips, and that's unlikely to change in the future, as that industry is nearly impossible to disrupt.\n\nWith Nvidia projecting between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in data center infrastructure spending by 2030, all three of these fabless chip companies could have a significant market opportunity to capture. I'm not sure which will be the ultimate winner among them. Still, I know that TSMC will be a winner regardless, giving it a strong chance of outperforming Nvidia over the next five years, particularly if Nvidia loses a meaningful amount of market share to its peers.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

This is our Yahoo Finance heat map and we're looking at the box size right here. So each box size corresponds to the market cap of the company and all of these are large to mega caps with two in the $4 trillion bucket. That would be Nvidia and Apple,\n01:36 Speaker A\nall the way down to Intel over here at 180 billion. and in the far lower right, you almost can't see it there. You can see Super Micro, which is just shy of $20 billion. But the other thing you might notice is that the only losing ticker this year is Bitcoin, although Amazon is pretty close to break even too.\n01:52 Speaker A\nSo each of these has a different story. Now let's dive into some of the charts that really uh tell this story and this is going to be a year-to-date. So we'll start with Nvidia here. This has arguably been the poster child for the entire AI trade and you can see it got kind of sucked into the post liberation day redness there, but it has bounced back strong.\n02:09 Speaker A\nReally hasn't done much over the last few months, but with 30% gains in a year after almost being up, what is it? a thousand percent over the last three years. There you go, 963%. I think investors are going to take that.\n02:19 Speaker A\nNow Tesla. Tesla's really interesting because over the last year, and this is a three-year chart too, it has traced out a cup and handle formation. If it can break above 480, it has the ability to really break out and 2026 could be the year to do this. If it fails at this level, well, maybe it's got to consolidate a little bit longer.\n02:37 Speaker A\nNow, let's take a look at Palantir. This stock is up 2,500% over the last three years. Let's dial down to a year-to-date and you can see like Nvidia, it hasn't really done much over the last few months, but still sitting on 140% year-to-date gains.\n02:50 Speaker A\nNow, Apple year to date, this stock is only up 9%, but it has come back nicely after it just kind of stalled out after the liberation day uh melee where a lot of stocks were taking off, it was going sideways, but it finally caught up over the last few months. and so Apple has been generating recent record highs even as Nvidia has been going sideways.\n03:07 Speaker A\nNow here's AMD to round out the top five, 71% year to date. This is a very volatile stock, but again, I think investors will uh happily hold on to gains like that for a stock like AMD.\n03:16 Speaker A\nNow, Amazon, barely positive for the year. This is a stock you kind of got to look at over this entire three-year bull market. Still up 150%, but this was a year of consolidation. We'll have to see if 2026 breaks to the upside or the downside.\n03:30 Speaker A\nAnd you know what? Bitcoin is a very similar story, sitting on more gains over the last three years, but this has been a year of consolidation. It happens to be down about 10% right now, and 75,000 is a line in the sand that I am watching. I think that gets hit before it takes off again.\n03:44 Speaker A\nThen Meta, this is another three-year story. Uh hasn't done much this year, but we'll have to see if it can continue the trend. 445%, very strong over this bull market.\n03:53 Speaker A\nGetting towards the end here. Super Micro is a very volatile stock and while it's up this year a decent percentage, you can see it was up a lot more in early 2024. So this is one of those high beta plays you got to trade with caution, but guess what, the Yahoo Finance audience loves to day trade this stock.\n04:06 Speaker A\nAnd finally here's Intel. This is another kind of uh sine wave pattern here. Let me just dial this down to year to date so you can see it has really taken off over the last few months. It's become a volatile stock, but it was doing nothing for the first 6, seven, eight months of the year. So I think investors at the end of the day, at the end of the year going to be pleased with this one.\n04:24 Speaker A\nSo let us dial it back down here. I got a few things that are going to tell us what to watch in 2026. So just think of these as the questions that move these tickers. First is the AI spend payback test. Investors are going to want to see the revenue and not just the profits of these uh companies, not just the spending.\n04:42 Speaker A\nAnd the next up is margins versus Mega Cap spending. Can these giants keep growing without the profit engine getting dented? Third, keep an eye on the chip cycle inflection point. Does demand for semiconductors, does it broaden out or is it just stay limited to AI?\n04:59 Speaker A\nFourth, watch those crypto regulation headlines. 2025 was arguably the best year ever for crypto regulation and Bitcoin isn't even positive. So let's see if sentiment can shift. And finally, monitor those rate cuts versus the real economy. If we get more cuts, ask why. Is it a soft landing scenario or are we sinking into recession?\n05:17 Speaker A\nBottom line, these were the tickers investors just could not stop watching in 2025. Next year, what matters is whether the stories hold up and that's where the rubber meets the road. And tune into the Stocks and Translation podcast for more jargon busting deep dives.

      "Content": "NVDA Stock Price Prediction: Where Nvidia Could Be by 2025, 2026, 2030\n\nAJ Fabino\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:25 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nSOFI\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nAnalysts are saying Nvidia could hit 920.09 dollars by 2030, a projection that has many investors assessing whether NVDA still has room to run after years of explosive gains. If you're bullish and want a simple, low-cost way to invest, SoFi lets you trade Nvidia stock with no commissions, and new users who fund their account can receive up to 1,000 dollars in stock . Plus, anyone who transfers existing investments to SoFi and keeps them there through December 31, 2025, can earn an additional 1 percent bonus, offering even more upside for new investors.\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has evolved from a graphics-chip manufacturer into the backbone of the modern artificial intelligence boom. As companies scale generative AI, autonomous systems and data-intensive cloud applications, Nvidia's GPUs have become central infrastructure powering these technological shifts. After soaring 171 percent in 2024 and adding another 26 percent in 2025, many investors are now weighing whether Nvidia's valuation still leaves enough room for meaningful future gains.\nDon’t Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel could be the next AI powerhouse — join 10,000+ early backers and invest now just $0.81 per share .\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here’s how you can earn passive income with $100 .\n\nThis forecast examines Nvidia's financial standing and uses a structured methodology to outline potential price targets for 2025, 2026 and 2030. By blending analyst sentiment, valuation metrics and algorithmic projections, it offers a clearer picture of where NVDA could be headed both in the near term and over the next decade.\nCurrent Overview Trading above 180 dollars as of October 2025\nMarket Cap: 4.37 trillion dollars\nTrailing P/E Ratio: 51.23\nGross Margins: near 70 percent\nYTD Performance: over 30 percent\nNvidia continues to report exceptional fundamentals, driven largely by its data center division, which remains the company's strongest revenue engine thanks to global AI demand from major technology firms and enterprise cloud platforms. Gross margins remain robust, earnings consistently exceed expectations and the company's leadership role in high-performance computing continues to set it apart from competitors.\n\nInvestor sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive. Out of 48 analysts, 43 rate Nvidia as a Buy or Strong Buy, reflecting strong confidence in its long-term prospects. The average 12-month price target sits around 209.97 dollars, with projections ranging from 100 dollars on the low end to 250 dollars on the high end. Still, valuation concerns linger, along with fears that competition from AMD, Intel and new AI-focused players could chip away at Nvidia's premium positioning.\n\nStory Continues\nQuick Snapshot Table of Predictions\n\nYear\nBullish Prediction\nAverage Prediction\nBearish Prediction\n2025\n183.13\n178.84\n173.92\n2026\n308.56\n207.13\n170.15\n2027\n566.89\n442.32\n285.19\n2028\n628.83\n537.29\n396.17\n2029\n873.74\n719.91\n493.76\n2030\n863.77\n799.05\n774.93\n2031\n1029.59\n950.43\n848.77\n2032\n1069.34\n1010.52\n920.01\n2033\n1226.54\n1127.95\n993.88\n2040\n2358.25\n2228.74\n2028.93\n2050\n6367.97\n5786.71\n5596.95\n\nThese forecasts are based on algorithmic modeling by CoinCodex, which assesses historical price movement, volatility cycles and long-term trend behavior across multiple time horizons.\nBull and Bear Case Bull Case The bull case for Nvidia centers on its unparalleled profitability and dominance across the AI supply chain. With net profit margins above 50 percent and gross margins holding near 70 percent, Nvidia remains one of the most financially efficient companies in the tech sector. Institutional support is strong, as shown by the overwhelming majority of Buy-rated analyst recommendations. Valuation multiples such as P/E and forward P/E have eased from their peak levels, suggesting healthier entry points compared to earlier years. Nvidia's low debt profile and consistent free cash flow growth further reinforce the thesis that it will continue to lead long-term AI infrastructure and data center expansion, giving bulls confidence in sustained multiyear upside.\n\nBear Case The bear case focuses on the early signs of slowing growth across key financial indicators. Earnings per share, net income and free cash flow are still rising, but at a noticeably slower rate than their three-year averages. Nvidia's valuation metrics, including PEG ratio, EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA, remain elevated relative to industry competitors, raising concerns that the stock may still be priced for perfection. The company's dividend yield is extremely low and recent growth in dividend payouts has stagnated, limiting appeal for income-driven investors. Bears argue that if financial momentum continues to cool and competition intensifies, Nvidia may struggle to justify the lofty expectations currently embedded in its share price.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction for 2025 Bullish Prediction: 183.13 dollars\nAverage Prediction: 178.84 dollars\nBearish Prediction: 173.92 dollars\nNvidia's 2025 outlook reflects cautious optimism, with modest upside expected if the company continues executing on its AI and data center roadmap. Its premium valuation signals strong confidence from the market, but it also leaves little room for disappointment. Any signs of slowing demand, regulatory pressure or margin compression could trigger volatility in the short term.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction for 2026 Bullish Prediction: 308.56 dollars\nAverage Prediction: 207.13 dollars\nBearish Prediction: 170.15 dollars\nThe 2026 projections suggest that Nvidia's long-term trajectory will depend heavily on its ability to maintain pricing power despite rising competition. Some models anticipate more moderate returns as valuations stabilize and GPU demand normalizes. However, Nvidia's entrenched position across cloud infrastructure and AI-driven enterprise ecosystems may provide resilience even in a cooling market, helping extend its revenue expansion through mid-decade.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction for 2030 Bullish Prediction: 863.77 dollars\nAverage Prediction: 799.05 dollars\nBearish Prediction: 774.93 dollars\nBy 2030, Nvidia's growth story becomes tightly interwoven with the long-term strength of the AI revolution. If demand for accelerated computing continues its upward trajectory and Nvidia sustains leadership in next-generation architectures, the company could see substantial long-term appreciation. Conservative models still show meaningful compounding returns through the end of the decade. However, risks remain, including intensified competition, cyclical demand disruptions and greater regulatory scrutiny surrounding AI hardware.\n\nInvestment Considerations Nvidia remains a quintessential growth stock — a pure play on next-generation computing and AI hardware infrastructure. Institutional ownership is strong, and retail investor enthusiasm remains high, but these factors also reflect elevated expectations built into the current share price. While Nvidia pays a dividend, its yield is negligible, functioning more as an indicator of corporate strength than an income generator.\n\nKey risks include competition from AMD and Intel, the possibility of slowing AI adoption, regulatory headwinds and global supply chain constraints. Still, Nvidia's deep integration into cloud ecosystems, its unmatched GPU leadership and its alignment with long-term technological megatrends make it one of the most compelling — and scrutinized — companies in the global market.\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market When evaluating any stock price forecast, it's wise to think about portfolio balance and not rely on a single company's trajectory. Markets shift quickly, and putting all of your capital into one sector or stock can increase risk. Many investors are turning to platforms that open the door to real estate, professional financial advice, fixed-income products, and even self-directed retirement options. These tools make it easier to diversify, smooth out volatility, and build wealth across multiple asset classes over time.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nRange Wealth Management Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools . Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.\nSee Next:\nThe ‘ChatGPT of marketing' just opened a $0.81 per share round — 10,000+ investors are already in .\nGM-backed EnergyX is tackling the global lithium supply shortage — invest before global expansion at just $10 per share by October 30 .\nThis article NVDA Stock Price Prediction: Where Nvidia Could Be by 2025, 2026, 2030 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "These AI Stocks Could Surge in December as Momentum Builds\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points The AI hyperscalers are planning on spending a record amount on capital expenditures during 2026.\nNvidia and AMD are sparring for GPU supremacy.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a neutral party in the AI build-out.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWith December rolling toward its close, there are a few stocks that I think could surge before the end of the month. While the market may be growing a bit weary of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade, the reality is that hyperscalers are going to be spending more than ever on AI computing power in 2026. This benefits a handful of companies in an outsized way, and some of those that have already been the biggest winners from that spending are positioned to keep prospering in 2026.\nThree such stocks that I think could surge to end the year are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\nNvidia Nvidia has been a top-performing artificial intelligence stock since the buildout began in 2023. While there have been some impressive technologies developed over the past few years, we've only scratched the surface of what generative AI is capable of. As a result, hyperscalers are planning on record-setting data center capital expenditures in 2026 after setting new spending records in 2025. Nvidia is one of the primary beneficiaries of this spending because its graphics processing units (GPUs) provide a significant chunk of the computing power that goes into these data centers.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are best in class, in part thanks to the technology stack that supports them. It continues to deliver impressive quarter after impressive quarter, and the third quarter of its fiscal 2026 (which ended Oct. 26) was no exception. Revenue rose by 63% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose by 67%. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs was so high that CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs.\nAI data center buildouts aren't expected to slow down anytime in the near future: Nvidia's management believes that by 2030, global data center capital expenditures will reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion. Nvidia may be down a bit heading into 2026, but assuming that the expected spending will occur, it should be an excellent stock to buy now.\n\nAMD AMD hasn't had nearly as much success of Nvidia in the AI arms race. While its GPUs aren't far off in performance from Nvidia's, its supporting technology has lagged, specifically its controlling software. However, AMD has made a few acquisitions and inked some partnerships that have improved its supporting products, and management believes it can turn the company's fortunes around and make a big splash in the AI computing world.\n\nStory Continues\nOver the next five years, management believes the company can grow its data center business at a 60% compound annual growth rate. That would be a massive increase from the 22% growth that segment achieved in its most recently reported quarter. AMD will have a long way to go to prove that it is capable of delivering growth that rivals Nvidia's, but if it can, the stock should perform impressively.\n\nI think the market may start to recognize this shift in fortunes, causing AMD's stock to rise in the last few days of December.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Both Nvidia and AMD design chips, but neither manufactures them in-house. Instead, like many other \"fabless\" chipmakers, they farm that work out to several companies. In the case of the most cutting-edge chips, that work mostly falls to Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's largest chip foundry by revenue. Taiwan Semiconductor is a genius investment because it doesn't matter whether it's Nvidia, AMD, or some other designer offering the best computing solution -- the foundry is still positioned to benefit from their sales. All that really matters to Taiwan Semi is that the AI hyperscalers are spending more and more.\n\nAdmittedly, its status as a neutral player in the AI buildout can limit its overall upside. However, based on the growth projections for the AI infrastructure market, I'd be surprised if Taiwan Semiconductor weren't a top-performing stock over the next five years.\nIt's also much cheaper than the GPU designers, trading at 28 times expected forward earnings.\nI'm a huge fan of Taiwan Semiconductor and its invaluable position in the AI space, and believe the market may reward it heading into 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Does Philippe Laffont Know Something Wall Street Doesn't? The Billionaire Investor Just Sold Nvidia and AMD, and Bought These Other Chip Stocks Instead\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points During the third quarter, Coatue Management reduced its exposure to GPU leaders Nvidia and AMD.\nAt the same time, the firm dramatically increased its stakes in Alphabet and Marvell Technology.\nPhilippe Laffont is making sure his fund has positions across the entire semiconductor landscape.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWithin 45 days of the end of each quarter, every institutional investor managing over $100 million is required to file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings itemize which stocks they bought and sold during that quarter. This provides everyday investors with a glimpse -- though a delayed one -- into what the \"smart money\" on Wall Street is doing.\nDuring the third quarter, Philippe Laffont's firm, Coatue Management, made a number of interesting moves. It trimmed its exposure in semiconductor leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) by 14% and 19%, respectively. In addition, Laffont more than tripled the fund's stakes in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) .\nLet's break down what may have influenced these decisions and assess if Laffont could be onto something big.\nNvidia and AMD dominate the AI chip market Nvidia and AMD are the two leading designers of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most widely used parallel processing chips for training large language models and building generative AI applications.\nThe rise of generative AI has ushered in a wave of unprecedented revenue and profit growth for chip designers. Shares of Nvidia and AMD have skyrocketed by nearly 900% and 200%, respectively, throughout the AI revolution.\nManagement consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting that investment in AI infrastructure will reach nearly $7 trillion over the next five years -- with the majority of that spending allocated toward building data centers and chip procurement.\nWith that in mind, it seems likely that the hyperscalers will continue accelerating their AI capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Given these secular tailwinds, the prospects surrounding Nvidia and AMD appear bright.\n\nThis begs the question: Does Laffont see something the rest of us don't?\nUnderstanding Alphabet and Marvell's positions in the chip market One of the biggest catalysts for Alphabet right now is its cloud infrastructure business. Google Cloud has attracted a number of high-profile customers, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms .\nMoreover, the company's custom-designed AI processors -- which it calls Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- are becoming a key part of the value proposition around its AI ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile GPUs and other specialized parallel processors get most of the attention among AI investors, there's a lot more that goes into a data center. Marvell can provide much of it: The company specializes in designing architecture for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) computing stacks, as well as other networking, security, and storage hardware.\nAs AI workloads become larger and more sophisticated -- requiring enhanced memory and storage processes -- demand for the offerings of players like Marvell should rise further.\nThe bottom line: The semiconductor opportunity is broadening While analysts appear optimistic about Alphabet's TPU business, these chips are heavily geared toward custom applications such as deep learning. Meanwhile, Marvell is carving out its own pocket in the AI realm focused on data centers' memory storage needs.\nIn my view, Laffont's moves during the third quarter look more like a structural mix shift than a reflection of souring sentiment toward AI GPUs. What I mean by that is the billionaire smartly reduced his fund's exposure to general-purpose chip designers such as Nvidia and AMD and rotated capital into other specific segments of the AI space.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a broader point: Laffont still has significant exposure to the GPU market. It's not as if Coatue completely dumped its stakes in Nvidia and AMD.\nDuring the third quarter, he merely increased his bets on other areas of the chip market beyond generic accelerators. The construction of Coatue's portfolio suggests the firm is quite bullish about the continuing expansion of AI infrastructure. It appears that Laffont is trying to capitalize on this trend by building a diversified portfolio around the proliferation of chips and their various applications in AI.\nAt the end of the day, I think building positions in the major players across GPUs, custom chipsets, memory architecture, and more will prove to be a winning investment strategy in the long run.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

(NASDAQ: AMD ) is included among the 12 Best Long Term US Stocks to Buy Now .\nOn December 16, Cantor Fitzgerald cut its price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to $300 from $350 while keeping an Overweight rating on the stock. The firm says the semiconductor index is set up to lead the broader market after beating the S&P 500 by about 30 points in 2025. Early momentum from the AI buildout is driving demand across computing, networking, memory, and chip equipment, according to the analyst.\n\nShort-term cycles may send mixed signals, but the bigger picture still looks supportive. Cantor points to a steady macro backdrop and what it sees as exponential growth in AI infrastructure spending. That combination, in its view, supports staying long the SOX and keeping above-average exposure to AI-focused names into 2026.\nAt the company level, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has made real progress on software. The Nod.ai acquisition has helped strengthen its ROCm platform, with AMD reporting that downloads have jumped tenfold year over year. Software was a weak spot before, and this shows traction. External support is also lining up.\nIn October, AMD announced a partnership with OpenAI to supply six gigawatts of computing capacity. The deal also includes collaboration on control software, which could further improve AMD’s appeal to large customers.\n\nCompetition remains intense, especially from Nvidia. At its financial analyst day, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) said it expects data center revenue to grow at a 60% compound annual rate through 2030. That would be a sharp step up from the 22% growth posted in the third quarter. Hitting that target would require major AI hyperscalers to adopt AMD’s full technology stack. It is possible, but it sets a high bar.\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) designs and builds high-performance computing, graphics, and AI technologies used across data centers, PCs, and emerging AI workloads.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.79%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.38%.\nShares of the chipmaker have depreciated by 11.38% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.85%, and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Advanced Micro Devices in its forthcoming earnings report. In that report, analysts expect Advanced Micro Devices to post earnings of $1.31 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 20.18%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $9.64 billion, up 25.88% from the prior-year quarter.\nAMD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.96 per share and revenue of $33.94 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +19.64% and +31.61%, respectively.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Advanced Micro Devices should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the business operations and its ability to generate profits.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.14% lower within the past month. Advanced Micro Devices is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nWith respect to valuation, Advanced Micro Devices is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 49.99. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 24.24.\n\nWe can additionally observe that AMD currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.16. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AMD's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.06 as of yesterday's close.\nThe Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 20, putting it in the top 9% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAt the time, he also stated that Nvidia expects a combined $500 billion in GPU sales across the Blackwell line and next year's Rubin generation.\nAccording to the analysis shared by Kakashii on X, Nvidia's reported $111 billion in data-center revenue since Blackwell launched does not appear to support that shipment volume.\nEven after factoring in the more than $10 billion Nvidia disclosed in the 2024 fourth-quarter Blackwell revenue, the thread argues the numbers only account for roughly 4 million units, leaving a potential gap of hundreds of thousands to millions of GPUs.\n\nPower and Data-Center Capacity Add Another Layer Of Questions The thread also pointed to the enormous energy requirements of running Blackwell chips.\nIf 6 million GPUs shipped and 65% to 70% were deployed in U.S. data centers, they would require 8.5 to 11 gigawatts of power — roughly equivalent to the electricity capacity of Singapore, the analyst said.\nHowever, the U.S. only added an estimated 8.5 gigawatts of data-center-usable capacity between 2024 and 2025, the user noted. That assumes every new facility uses only Nvidia hardware and no Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) or Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google chips.\nEven then, the user argued, the power supply barely matches the stated GPU shipment volume.\n\nStory continues\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nBurry Calls For Receipts: ‘Calling For Pics And Proof' Sharing the thread, Burry urged X users to send him photos or proof of Nvidia GPUs being stored \"in mass quantities\" in the U.S. or overseas.\n\"Some have reached out to me,\" he wrote, adding, \"it is getting interesting. But I need more.\"\nNotably, the bar chart shown at Nvidia's GTC DC in October reflected 6 million GPU dies shipped in calendar year 2025.\nA footnote on the slide noted that the Blackwell and Rubin architectures use two GPU dies per chip. As a result, while 6 million GPU dies were shipped, the total came to 3 million complete GPU packages.\n\nDespite Nvidia's Pushback, Burry Says His Bearish Thesis Still Holds Up Last month, Burry doubled down on his bearish view of Nvidia, reaffirming his analysis on X just hours after the company privately pushed back his past claims. Burry argues the company's $112.5 billion in buybacks added no real shareholder value and only offset stock-based compensation.\nMeanwhile, analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo defended Nvidia, saying concerns about rising Days Sales Outstanding and inventory levels misunderstand the company's sales patterns and preparation for new Blackwell chips.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged 31.88% so far this year, outperforming both the Nasdaq Composite's 22.29% gain and the Nasdaq 100's 22.49% rise.

      "Content": "Micron's Blowout Earnings: The Best AI Stock for 2026?\n\nTirthankar Chakraborty\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 12:00 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nAs 2026 draws closer, investors are actively seeking stocks poised to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Micron Technology, Inc. MU stands out given its recent strong quarterly results. So, does the stock offer an attractive buying opportunity for the year ahead?\nLet’s see in detail –\n\nMicron's Blowout Earnings Highlight AI-Driven Growth Micron recently reported strong fiscal first-quarter 2026 results, reassuring investors that demand for its products has strengthened significantly. Micron's revenues for the quarter came in at $13. 64 billion, up 56.8% from the same period a year ago, according to investors. micron.com. Wall Street analysts had expected Micron's sales to come in around $ 12.88 billion.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, all four of Micron's business segments posted revenue growth, led by its core cloud memory business unit, which reported sales of $5.28 billion, up a whopping 99.5%. This robust performance helped boost Micron's profitability, with non-GAAP net income reaching $5.48???billion, or $4.78 per diluted share, well above analysts’ expectations of $3.94.\nSoaring demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips has been a major driver of the company's stellar quarterly performance. HBM chips, which enable high-speed data processing and reduce power consumption, remain in short supply due to the AI infrastructure boom, which is why they are in high demand.\nSanjay Mehrotra, Micron's CEO, said that “the growth in AI data center capacity is driving a significant increase in demand for high-performance and high-capacity memory and storage.” He noted that demand for server units has risen significantly and is expected to remain strong through 2026.\n\nMicron expects even stronger results in fiscal second-quarter 2026, with revenues projected between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) ranging from $8.22 to $8.62. The company already reported a record free cash flow of $3.9 billion in fiscal first-quarter 2026, providing ample funds to support future growth initiatives.\nMicron's Record Earnings Make It a Leading AI Stock for 2026 Rising AI-driven demand for Micron's HBM chips has not only helped the company deliver a strong quarter but is also expected to drive the company's growth momentum further into 2026. This positions Micron as one of the most compelling AI stocks to buy for 2026.\nLest we forget, Micron supplies HBM chips to NVIDIA Corporation NVDA as well as to its rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, ensuring strong demand for its products even if NVIDIA's competitive edge weakens. Thus, Micron's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is 23.9%. The company's $19.85 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 80.9% year over year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicron currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

After the S&P 500 fell 1.2% on Wednesday, extending its losing streak to four sessions following a record high, JPMorgan's quantitative team pointed to a rotation out of recent winners, led by technology shares. The strategists said crowding in highly volatile, riskier stocks has reached the 99th percentile, a level they suggested could be vulnerable to a sharper unwind if a significant macro event were to emerge.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AVGO.\nIs AVGO fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nBram Kaplan, JPMorgan's head of Americas equity derivatives strategy, highlighted six stocks the bank views as speculative growth plays that could be more sensitive to sudden repricing: Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ), Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), Expedia Group ( NASDAQ:EXPE ), Estee Lauder ( NYSE:EL ), Invesco ( NYSE:IVZ ) and Nucor ( NYSE:NUE ). Since Dec. 10, Broadcom has fallen more than 21% and AMD is down 11%, while Estee Lauder, Invesco and Nucor are also lower, with Expedia up about 3%. Kaplan described many of these names as second-order speculative AI beneficiaries, noting they could be prone to larger swings because expansion may rely on access to capital or debt markets rather than internal growth alone.\n\nKaplan outlined a potential approach for navigating the environment, suggesting bearish put options on speculative names paired with bullish exposure to lower-volatility stocks such as Cigna ( NYSE:CI ), Pfizer ( NYSE:PFE ) and Verizon Communications ( NYSE:VZ ). There remains the possibility that the recent selloff reflects a temporary rotation rather than a broader shift, a view supported by Micron Technology's ( NASDAQ:MU ) strong earnings that helped lift AI-linked stocks again on Wednesday. Even so, JPMorgan's warning comes as investors increasingly question whether the AI trade can lift all boats, with attention gradually shifting toward sorting potential winners from possible laggards.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Forget Nvidia and Broadcom. This Forgotten Retail Stock Is a Top Performer in 2025.\n\nPathikrit Bose\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:26 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: DDS\n\nAMD\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nArtificial intelligence has been the theme on Wall Street for more than three years now. Headlined by the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO), chipmakers have been the undisputed winners, and their share price actions reflect the same. On the other hand, as inflation continues to hover around the 3% level, above the Fed's comfort rate of 2%, one would not expect stocks from the retail sector to outperform these AI juggernauts. However, that is precisely what Dillard's (DDS) has done over the past five years.\n\nAbout Dillard's Founded in 1938 and based out of Arkansas, Dillard's operates full-line department stores and clearance centers across the U.S., primarily in the Southeast, Southwest, West, and Midwest. Other than retail operations, the company is also engaged in providing construction services. It operates approximately 272 full-line department stores plus around 28 clearance centers across 30 U.S. states and over 140 cities as of late 2025.\n\nMore News from Barchart Cathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock.

This Analyst Thinks It Is One of the Highest-Quality Stocks to Buy for the Next Year Too.\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nValued at a market cap of $10.2 billion, the DDS stock is up 54% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, outperforming the likes of Broadcom, AMD, and Microsoft (MSFT). Notably, the stock offers a dividend yield of 4.76%, which is higher than the sector median of 1.023%. Further, the company has been raising dividends consecutively over the past 14 years, and with a payout ratio of just 2.87%, the headroom for growth remains.\nBut is that enough to warrant an investment? Let's analyze.\nAll Good (Except Sales Growth) Dillard's, despite its share price pop, is not for the growth enthusiasts. While its earnings have grown at a CAGR of 6.28% over the past 10 years, revenues have actually declined at a CAGR of 0.28% in the same period. Modest revenue growth was reported in the most recent quarter as well.\nIn Q3 2025, Dillard's net sales were $1.47 billion, up a mere 2.8% from the previous year. Comparable store sales, a key indicator of organic store sales, inched up by just 3% in the same period. Further, gross margins improved to 45.3% in the quarter, an increase from the previous year's figure of 44.5%, implying effective control over direct costs.\n\nStory Continues\nOverall, earnings for the quarter were reported to be $8.31 per share, a YoY rise of 7.5%. Notably, the EPS also came in higher than the consensus estimate of $6.18, as the past two years have seen the company's earnings miss estimates on just one occasion.\nComing to cash flows, for the nine months ended Nov. 1, Dillard's reported net cash from operating activities of $505.8 million, up from $349.4 million in the year-ago period. Overall, the company closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1.15 billion, much higher than its short-term debt levels of $96 million.\n\nFinally, aside from its record of shelling out regular dividends, Dillard's has rewarded shareholders through share repurchases. While during the quarter, the company repurchased shares worth $107.8 million, the past decade has seen the company carrying out share buybacks worth more than $3 billion.\nThus, a slowdown in sales growth cannot be squarely blamed on the company's operations, as the wider retail sector has been subdued for a while now. Structural headwinds such as mall traffic decline and the emergence of e-commerce over the years have played a significant role. Considering this, Dillard's showing has been commendable, as it has done what it can in this scenario: controlling costs, raising margins, keeping debt under control, and increasing earnings with an effective cash management strategy.\n\nCan the Good Times Continue to Roll? Now, Dillard's needs just one thing: sales growth. That will ensure that the company's upmove was not just based on effective balance sheet management but is built upon solid, sustainable growth. To that end, the company is taking some initiatives.\nFirst up, Dillard's has been putting more effort into freshening up its stock lately, bringing in clothes and accessories that feel current and on-trend, particularly on the men's side. This is to bring in younger shoppers and get the regulars to stop by more often. That's shown up in better sales numbers of late. The categories doing the heavy lifting are the ones with stronger margins and real pull, like women's clothing, handbags, shoes, and makeup.\n\nConversely, while the stores are still the main game for Dillard's, the company is spending serious cash on the website too. They're building out the online shopping experience and making it work hand-in-hand with what's in the stores, so customers don't feel any drop-off. It's beginning to click, with online sales expected to surpass $400 million for 2025. Stuff like ordering online and grabbing in-store, nicer product pages, and a wider catalog of items online are helping drive that.\nFinally, Dillard's uses targeted promotions and marketing to attract both value-conscious and brand-focused shoppers. Promotions are tailored to drive both traffic and conversion, emphasizing value without eroding margin.\nHowever, it's not all smooth sailing. Inflation is still biting, and the job picture is getting shakier, so shoppers are tightening their purse strings in ways Dillard's can't fully fix. And being smaller in scale than the giants means it's tougher to match them on price; Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT), the behemoths in the space, have much more financial muscle to pull customers to their aisles.\n\nThe shares are priced for a lot of good news already too, trading at a forward P/E of 20.06 and P/B of 5.81. Both stats are quite a bit above the sector averages of 17.66 and 2.70, which doesn't leave much buffer if the spending environment cools further.\nAnalyst Opinion on DDS Stock Taking all of this into account, analysts have deemed DDS stock a “Hold,” with a mean target price that has already been surpassed. The high target price of $700 denotes an upside potential of about 6% from current levels. Out of five analysts covering the stock, one has a “Strong Buy” rating, two have a “Hold” rating, and two have a “Strong Sell” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Better Semiconductor Stock for 2026: AMD vs. Intel\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:50 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nINTC\n\n^SOX\n\nKey Points AMD's and Intel's earnings are expected to grow significantly in 2026.\nA close look at their businesses reveals that one of them is outperforming the other financially.\nComparing their valuations will make it easy for investors to understand which one is the better buy right now.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\n\nSemiconductor stocks have delivered some stellar performances in 2025, as is evident from the 40% gains registered by the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index this year. Though the sector has witnessed periods of volatility due to concerns such as the sustainability of the massive spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and questions about the returns on investment that this technology will actually deliver, strong chip demand has provided a solid tailwind so far.\nThe good news is that semiconductor stocks can keep doing well in 2026. The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization forecasts a 26% spike in semiconductor sales next year to $975 billion, higher than this year's projected growth of 22.5%. This should bode well for Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , two chip companies that have clocked impressive returns in 2025.\nBut if you're choosing one of these two stocks to buy now based on their outlook for 2026, which one should it be?\nThe case for AMD As of this writing, AMD stock is up 72% in 2025. Its revenue and earnings have been growing at a healthy clip thanks to demand for its chips for use in personal computers (PCs), gaming consoles, and data centers .\nIts revenue in the first three quarters of 2025 increased by 35% from the year-ago period. AMD's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped by about 244% during this period to $2.8 billion. The new year could be even stronger for AMD. The proliferation of AI in PCs and data centers, along with a potential increase in the company's market share in AI chips, is likely to drive growth in 2026.\n\nAMD has been constantly gaining market share for central processing units (CPUs) in both PCs and data centers. Its share of PC CPUs increased by 1.4 percentage points year over year in the third quarter of 2025 to 25.4%, according to Mercury Research. Meanwhile, it recorded a jump of 3.6 points in server CPUs to 27.8%.\nAMD can continue to gain share in CPUs next year since it is moving to a 2-nanometer (nm) process node from the current-generation 3nm and 4nm nodes. The company claims that its Zen 6 CPU will be the first chip fabricated on foundry leader TSMC 's 2nm node. Importantly, that smaller process node should enable AMD to deliver increased computing performance while keeping power consumption in check.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company also notes that its 2nm chips will support a wider range of AI workloads in both PCs and data centers. Moreover, AMD sees its addressable opportunity in the data center market increasing at an annualized rate of over 40% for the next five years. On the other hand, shipments of AI PCs are projected to jump by 83% in 2026.\n\nAMD's expanding addressable market and its ability to acquire a greater share of the data center and PC chip markets explain why it expects annualized revenue growth of more than 35% for the next three to five years, up from the 21% annual growth it has recorded in the past five years. It also expects its operating margin to grow to 35% over the long run from around 24% this year.\n2026 will be the year when AMD steps on the gas. Analysts are estimating a 62% spike in earnings next year, up significantly from the 20% non-GAAP earnings growth it is set to deliver in 2025. Ideally, that should translate into more gains for AMD stock next year.\nThe case for Intel Intel has regained investor confidence in 2025 thanks to a few key positive developments, which explains the 87% spike in its share price this year.\nInvestments from the U.S. government, SoftBank , and Nvidia have strengthened its balance sheet. The company also divested its stake in programmable chip manufacturer Altera and sold a stake in Mobileye . As a result, Intel was sitting on almost $31 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. The $5 billion investment from Nvidia is set to close in the current quarter.\n\nThis solid cash position should enable Intel to bring more production capacity online for its most advanced chip nodes, which are experiencing healthy demand. CFO David Zinsner remarked on the October earnings conference call that the demand for its Intel 10 and Intel 7 process nodes exceeded supply, driven by the PC and data center markets.\nManagement also notes that its data center customers are interested in entering into long-term supply agreements to support the installation of additional AI infrastructure. At the same time, Intel's partnership with Nvidia for the joint development of data center chips and PC processors that will be deployed in the hyperscaler, enterprise, and consumer end markets should open up another opportunity for the company to accelerate its growth.\n\nIntel has been lacking on that front so far. The consensus estimate is for a 1% drop in revenue this year. However, the cost-cutting measures Intel has undertaken will help it post an adjusted profit of $0.34 per share in 2025, according to analysts, compared to its loss of $0.13 per share last year.\nIntel's cost-saving efforts are set to continue in 2026. Management expects to lower its operating expenses to $16 billion from this year's $16.8 billion, and its revenue is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2026. This combination of an improvement in its top line and control of spending could boost Intel's earnings by an impressive 76% next year, per consensus estimates.\nThis all looks like good news for Intel investors, but is it a better buy than AMD?\n\nThe verdict Both Intel and AMD are on track to clock healthy earnings growth next year. However, for Intel, that growth is expected to mainly be driven by its cost-optimization efforts -- its top-line growth has yet to kick into a higher gear. AMD, meanwhile, is clocking healthy growth in both revenue and earnings, and it expects to step on the gas next year.\nWhat's more, AMD is significantly cheaper than Intel on the valuation front.\nBased on all that, AMD appears to be the more convincing stock to buy now. Intel, of course, could do well next year if it continues to execute its turnaround, but AMD seems like the better bet for 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

Chen's stake in MetaX is worth about $6.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nOther early insiders also saw eye-popping paper gains.\nMetaX's other two cofounders and co-chief technology officers, Peng Li and Yang Jian, hold stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the blockbuster debut, according to Bloomberg's calculations.\n\nChina's AI rush Chen's rise follows that of another GPU entrepreneur, Zhang Jianzhong, the founder and CEO of Moore Threads Technology.\nEarlier this month, Zhang's net worth jumped to $4.3 billion after his company's successful IPO, continuing a wave of investor enthusiasm for homegrown semiconductor players.\n\nThe richest figure in China's AI chip scene is Chen Tianshi, a cofounder and CEO of Cambricon Technologies — a company retail traders have dubbed \"China's Nvidia.\"\nCambricon's Chen is now worth $22.5 billion, making him the country's 16th-richest individual on Bloomberg's list. He is the 115th richest person in the world.\nThese new fortunes reflect a sharp shift in investor sentiment.\nChinese AI and semiconductor stocks have been on a tear since the breakout of the China-made DeepSeek-R1 AI model released in January. The model helped spark a rally in local tech names and pushed the Hang Seng Tech Index up more than 20% so far this year.\nWashington's tightening export controls on advanced Nvidia chips also contributed to the boom.\n\nSuch restrictions on high-end AI processors have choked China's access to cutting-edge US hardware and pushed Beijing to lean harder on domestic suppliers .\nStill, China's new AI billionaires remain far from the top of the country's wealth rankings. The upper tier is still dominated by long-established tycoons.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the top spot is Zhong Shanshan, the low-key bottled-water magnate behind Nongfu Spring, with a fortune of $68.1 billion, per Bloomberg.\nPony Ma, a cofounder and CEO of Tencent, ranks second with $66.5 billion — a fortune up 38% this year, on the heels of Tencent's AI-induced rally — while ByteDance cofounder Zhang Yiming comes in third with $65.2 billion.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "As Nvidia Launches New Nemotron 3 Models, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold NVDA Stock?\n\nEbube Jones\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:46 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nOn Dec. 15, Nvidia (NVDA) announced the launch of its Nemotron 3 family of open models, built to support transparent, efficient, and specialized agentic artificial intelligence (AI) development across industries.\nThe Nemotron 3 Nano model delivers four times the throughput of the Nemotron 2 Nano, making it a more compute-cost-efficient open model for practical work, such as software debugging, content summarization, and AI assistant tasks.\n\nMore News from Barchart Cathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock.

Are You Loading Up on Shares Now?\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nThis launch comes at a tricky moment for the stock. Nvidia is currently valued at a market capitalization of approximately $4.15 trillion, but shares have also fallen more than 17% from recent highs. That pullback shows investors are still debating how long hyper-scalers can continue heavy spending on AI, especially with growing competition from chipmakers, like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO), and the push by Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) to build more custom chips in-house.\nAt the same time, Nemotron 3 points to Nvidia’s continued move into agentic AI, and early adopters already include ServiceNow (NOW), Palantir (PLTR), Perplexity, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. So for investors, the question is simple: Does Nemotron 3 strengthen Nvidia’s moat enough to support buying at current valuations? Or do valuation pressures and the macro risks justify a more cautious stance? Let’s find out.\n\nNvidia’s Financial Pulse in 2025 Nvidia is an AI infrastructure company. It sells high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) and closely integrated software that customers use to train and run AI in data centers, while also serving gaming and professional visualization markets on the side.\nOver the past 52 weeks, the stock is up about 40%, so the bigger trend remains positive, although sentiment has cooled. Over the past month, shares have declined by about 8%, which appears more like a normal reset after a strong run than a sign that the story has fallen apart.\nThe valuation indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium. NVDA’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 40x versus the sector’s 24.34x, which means the market is pricing in faster growth and stronger long-term earnings power than the average stock in the group.\n\nStory Continues\nIncome is still a small part of the picture. Nvidia’s annual dividend yield is 0.02%, well below the average technology yield of 1.37%.\nWhat really supports Nvidia's case is financial performance. For Q3, Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion, up 22% quarter-over-quarter and 62% year-over-year. That growth was driven by record data center revenue of $51.2 billion. Gross margins stayed high at 73.4% GAAP and 73.6% non-GAAP, and earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.30 on both GAAP and non-GAAP results. During the first nine months of fiscal 2026, Nvidia returned $37 billion through buybacks and dividends, and it still had $62.2 billion authorized for repurchases, which continues to support shareholder returns.\n\nThe Growth Engines Driving Nvidia’s AI Empire Nvidia’s newly expanded collaboration with Synopsys (SNPS) is a direct move into the design and engineering work that sits behind many major industries. By combining Nvidia’s AI and accelerated computing with Synopsys’s market-leading data analysis tools, the goal is to help research and development teams design, simulate, and verify complex intelligent systems faster, with lower costs, and under tighter time-to-market pressure.\n\nNvidia also backed this partnership financially, investing $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at $414.79 per share, which underlies its seriousness about AI becoming part of core engineering workflows.\nIn addition, Nvidia’s tie-up with HUMAIN, a PIF-backed full-stack AI firm, is focused on scaling real infrastructure and supporting sovereign computers. HUMAIN plans to deploy up to 600,000 Nvidia GB300 platforms over the next three years and will use Nemotron open models to train its own HUMAIN Chat models.\nThe partnership also includes the building of Nvidia-powered data centers in Saudi Arabia and expanding to AI data centers in the United States, which broadens Nvidia’s reach as agentic AI moves from testing to wider rollout across regions.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia’s collaboration with Upwind focuses on securing AI workloads where they run. Upwind is bringing its runtime-first cloud security platform onto Nvidia’s AI compute and inference stack, using Nvidia NIM microservices to boost its own AI-driven security operations while also adding dedicated protection for Nvidia GPU-based infrastructure, like DGX and Blackwell.\nWhat Analysts See Ahead for NVDA Stock For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026, the company expects revenue of about $65 billion. Earnings expectations are strong, too. The average EPS estimate is $1.44 versus $0.85 a year ago, and the next quarter is projected at $1.51 versus $0.77, which suggests year-over-year growth of 69.41% and 96.10%, respectively.\n\nThose numbers help explain why several major firms remain upbeat. Morgan Stanley analyst Joe Moore recently raised his price target to $250, citing Nvidia’s visibility into roughly $500 billion of data center infrastructure revenue between 2025 and 2026 as companies continue building out AI and agentic AI capacity. Loop Capital is even more aggressive with a Street-high $350 target, which would imply a market cap of about $8.5 trillion.\nNot everyone is on board, though. Seaport Research analyst Jay Goldberg has a “Sell” rating on NVDA, pointing to what he calls potential “circular financing” risks in the AI ecosystem.\nEven with that pushback, among 48 analysts, the consensus rating for Nvidia is a “Strong Buy,” and the average price target of $252.67 implies roughly 43.33% upside from the current price.\nIn Conclusion In my opinion, Nvidia looks like a “Hold” with a buy-on-the-dip bias, because Nemotron 3 strengthens Nvidia’s position in agentic AI while the company is still putting up elite revenue growth, margins, and shareholder returns. The stock’s recent pullback suggests the market is wrestling with valuation and fears regarding the spending cycle, not a breakdown in execution. If guidance stays on track and the next couple of earnings prints confirm the demand curve, shares are more likely to grind higher than roll over, even if the ride stays volatile. A clean break is highly likely to need another upside surprise or clearer visibility into 2026 demand.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Sign up now!\n\nLower bond yields today are also supporting stock index futures.\nInvestor focus now turns to delayed U.S. inflation data for November.\nIn yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s three main equity benchmarks ended in the red. AI-infrastructure stocks slumped, with GE Vernova (GEV) plunging over -10% to lead losers in the S&P 500 and Constellation Energy (CEG) sliding more than -6% to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100. Also, chip stocks slipped, with ARM Holdings (ARM) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) falling over -5%. In addition, Lennar (LEN) slid over -4% after the homebuilder posted weaker-than-expected FQ4 adjusted EPS and issued soft FQ1 new orders guidance. On the bullish side, Texas Pacific Land (TPL) climbed more than +7% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 after the landowner announced a strategic agreement with Bolt Data & Energy to develop data center campuses on Texas Pacific property in West Texas.\n\n“The AI trade continues to take on water,” said Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG. “While it’s still premature to say this is ‘the’ top for AI stocks, evidence is growing that it’s more than just a speed bump. The other question is if, in fact, AI is losing its leadership, where will new leadership be?”\nFed Governor Christopher Waller said on Wednesday he supports additional interest rate cuts to bring the central bank’s setting back to neutral, while noting there is no need to move hastily. “Because inflation is still up, we can take our time — there’s no rush to get down,” Waller said in a CNBC forum. Outlining a scenario in which inflation continues to ease through 2026, Waller said monetary policy settings remain as much as 100 basis points above neutral. At the same time, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that while it is a “close call,” inflation currently poses a greater concern than the labor market.\n\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in a 73.4% chance of no rate change and a 26.6% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at the next central bank meeting in January.\nToday, all eyes are on the U.S. consumer inflation report for November, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Notably, the report will have no monthly changes for most price categories, providing only a partial snapshot of inflation. That’s because the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it was unable to retroactively obtain much of the October price data, and November data collection was also delayed by the government shutdown. Economists, on average, forecast that the U.S. November CPI will come in at +3.1% y/y, compared to +3.0% y/y in September. Also, the U.S. core CPI is expected to be +3.0% y/y in November, unchanged from September.\n\nA survey conducted by 22V Research showed that 36% of investors expect a “risk-on” market reaction to the CPI report, 46% anticipate a “mixed/negligible” response, and just 18% expect a “risk-off” reaction.\nU.S. Initial Jobless Claims data will also be closely monitored today. Economists estimate this figure will come in at 224K, compared to last week’s number of 236K.\nThe U.S. Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index will be released today as well. Economists anticipate that the Philly Fed manufacturing index will stand at 2.5 in December, compared to last month’s value of -1.7.\nOn the earnings front, high-profile companies such as Accenture (ACN), Nike (NKE), Cintas (CTAS), and FedEx (FDX) are set to report their quarterly figures today.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.129%, down -0.48%.\n\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.26% this morning on a busy day for central bank meetings in the region. Retail and energy stocks gained ground on Thursday. Data released on Thursday showed that France’s manufacturing confidence index climbed to an over 1-1/2-year high in December. Past production rose for the first time in six months as auto output improved, while the decline in orders, especially foreign orders, eased. Meanwhile, Sweden’s central bank kept its key policy rate unchanged at 1.75% on Thursday, as expected, and reiterated that the next move will be a hike, though not anytime soon. Norway’s central bank also held its key policy rate unchanged at 4.00%, as expected, while reaffirming plans to gradually ease monetary policy in the coming years. Investor focus now shifts to monetary policy decisions from the European Central Bank and Bank of England later in the day. The ECB is widely expected to leave the deposit rate unchanged at 2.00%, with updated economic projections likely to signal solid growth and confidence that inflation will remain close to policymakers’ target. At the same time, the BoE is widely expected to lower interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75% as attention shifts from inflation concerns to the weakening U.K. economy and labor market. In corporate news, Aeroports DE Paris (ADP.P.DX) plunged over -10% after the French transport regulator rejected its 2026 tariff proposal.\n\nFrance’s Business Survey was released today.\nThe French December Business Survey came in at 102, stronger than expectations of 98.\nAsian stock markets today settled mixed. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.16%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -1.03%.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index closed slightly higher today as investors rotated into defensive sectors amid growing concerns about economic weakness and elevated tech valuations. Bank, defense, and energy stocks outperformed on Thursday. Limiting gains, AI-related stocks retreated after concerns over AI funding weighed on tech shares on Wall Street overnight. Property stocks also slumped as China Vanke’s debt crisis continued. Fitch Ratings downgraded the homebuilder’s long-term foreign- and local-currency issuer default ratings to “C” from “CCC-” and also cut ratings on its wholly owned subsidiary, Vanke Real Estate. Vanke began a second meeting with holders of a 2 billion yuan ($283.99 million) bond on Thursday, as it races to secure extensions on debt payments with bondholders and banks in a bid to avoid a default. Meanwhile, investor sentiment soured this week after fresh economic data indicated a further slowdown in domestic demand, with Beijing remaining hesitant to roll out broad stimulus measures. In corporate news, China International Capital Corp. rose over +3% after detailing plans to acquire two rivals in a share-swap deal valued at about $16 billion. CICC stated that the acquisitions would help expand its business network, grow its client base, and strengthen its capital as it aims to become a top-tier investment bank.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed sharply lower today, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street. Technology stocks led the declines on Thursday, with SoftBank Group sliding over -3% after Oracle shares sank in New York following a report that Blue Owl Capital would not support a $10 billion deal for a data center in Michigan. Earlier this year, SoftBank Group, together with Oracle and OpenAI, announced plans to build data centers in the U.S. as part of their ambitious Stargate project. “The Stargate project is the centre of U.S. data centre development, and SoftBank is deeply involved in it,” said Kazuaki Shimada, chief strategist at IwaiCosmo Securities. Meanwhile, the yen was little changed on Thursday ahead of the Bank of Japan’s policy decision on Friday. The BOJ is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate by a quarter point to 0.75%, the highest level in three decades, signaling growing confidence that it will achieve its stable inflation target. Market participants will closely watch Governor Kazuo Ueda’s post-meeting press conference for clues on how many additional rate hikes may be ahead. Bloomberg reported last week that BOJ officials believe the bank would still not be at the so-called neutral rate if borrowing costs are raised to 0.75%, with some officials seeing 1% as still below neutral. In other news, foreign investors bought a net 528.3 billion yen worth of Japanese stocks in the week through December 13th, marking a third consecutive week of net inflows, according to data from the Ministry of Finance. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -1.31% to 27.97.\n\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nMicron Technology (MU) surged over +10% in pre-market trading after the largest U.S. memory-chip maker posted upbeat FQ1 results and gave a blowout FQ2 forecast.\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) jumped over +21% in pre-market trading after announcing a merger with TAE Technologies in an all-stock deal valued at over $6 billion.\nLululemon Athletica (LULU) climbed more than +6% in pre-market trading after The Wall Street Journal reported that activist Elliott Investment Management had built a more than $1 billion stake in the company.\nGE Vernova (GEV) gained more than +4% in pre-market trading after Jefferies upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a price target of $815.\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) fell over -1% in pre-market trading after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $51.\n\nYou can see more pre-market stock movers here\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Thursday - December 18th\nAccenture (ACN), Nike (NKE), Cintas (CTAS), FedEx (FDX), Heico (HEI), Darden Restaurants (DRI), FactSet Research (FDS), Birkenstock Holding (BIRK), CarMax (KMX), KB Home (KBH), BlackBerry (BB), Nano Nuclear Energy (NNE), Mission Produce (AVO), Scholastic (SCHL), Innovative Solutions (ISSC), Bridgeline Digital (BLIN).\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "AMZN and AMD: Cowen Calls These 2 AI Stock Giants Its Best Ideas for 2026\n\nTipRanks\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 3:07 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nSo much has happened this year. After a spring correction triggered by President Trump ’s aggressive tariff policies, stocks staged a powerful rebound as inflation cooled and markets began pricing in a more accommodative Federal Reserve. At the same time, strong earnings and relentless enthusiasm around AI propelled mega-cap leadership, pushing the S&P 500 to nearly a 16% gain for the year.\n\nClaim 50% Off TipRanks Premium and Invest with Confidence Unlock hedge-fund level data and powerful investing tools designed to help you make smarter, sharper decisions\nStay ahead of the market with the latest news and analysis so your portfolio is always positioned for maximum potential\nLooking ahead, Cowen’s global head of research, Robert Fagin, sees a constructive backdrop forming as markets head into 2026, even with risks still in play.\n\n“For all the policy shocks and uncertainty in 2025, we are on track to end the year with global GDP growth at 3.0%, 10y Treasuries around 50bps lower, the USD 7% weaker, and the S&P 500 15% higher. Our forecasts for 2026 see fewer shocks, ongoing risks, but much the same outcome: global growth of 2.8%, a further 50bps decline in 10y rates, and a 6% fall in the USD. Central bank accommodation and ongoing fiscal support seem enough to keep risks to more bark than bite,” Fagin opined.\nActing on this outlook, Cowen’s analysts have named two stocks as their “best ideas” for the coming year – Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) , two major forces in AI. According to the TipRanks database, Wall Street rates both stocks as Strong Buys, with double-digit upside potential over the next year. Let’s take a closer look at why Cowen shares that optimism.\n\nAmazon\nFirst up, Amazon is currently the fifth most valuable publicly traded company on Wall Street, with a market cap of $2.38 trillion. Amazon has built itself up to that impressive scale through its dominance in the world of online retail, and through its expressed mastery of shipping and logistics. The company generated almost $640 billion in total revenue last year, and had over $70 billion in cash assets as of September 30 this year.\nAmazon hasn’t stood still on its retail business, even though that makes up approximately 80% of its revenue stream. The company is also well-known for its work with AI, cloud computing, and the combination of the two. AWS, Amazon’s subscription cloud platform, is a major revenue generator – with quarterly revenue of well over $30 billion in recent reports – and is also a key driver of Amazon’s AI work. Through AWS, Amazon offers a range of AI-powered features, including automation tools and apps, graphic design tools, autocomplete systems; it’s a long list.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is also a major collaborator with smaller companies in their own AI forays. Just this month, Amazon announced that the antibody company Proteintech had chosen AWS as its cloud provider of preference – and had used the service to create its industry’s fits AI antibody assistant. On the same day, Amazon also announced that Plaud, the AI conversational intelligence firm, was using AWS – and its AI – to speed up the global deployment of its meeting intelligence solutions. And to round out that day, Amazon made public that AWS had introduced its Graviton 5 processor chip, giving 25% higher performance than the preceding generation.\n\nAlong with AWS, Amazon’s retail business is also benefiting from the expansion of AI-powered tools and features. By now, we’ve all seen the commercials for Amazon’s visual shopping features, which are based on AI technology. The company is also using AI to make its e-commerce experience interactive in other ways, with a shopping assistant and improved search bar functionality.\nWhen we turn to Amazon’s last set of financial results, which covered 3Q25, we find that the retail giant generated $180.2 billion for the quarter. This figure represented a solid 13.4% year-over-year increase and beat the estimates by $2.4 billion. At Amazon’s bottom line, we saw an EPS of $1.95, based on a net income of $21.2 billion. Looking at some drill-downs, we see that Amazon’s North American sales reached $106.3 billion, for an 11% y/y increase, while international sales were up 14% to reach $40.9 billion. The biggest gainer, however, was AWS, which had a year-over-year jump of 20% and hit $33 billion in quarterly revenue, or 18.3% of the total.\n\nFor Cowen analyst John Blackledge, there are several reasons why Amazon is a ‘top pick.’ Laying them out, the 5-star analyst writes, “AMZN is our top ’26 large cap pick based on three key drivers, incl: i) Accelerating AWS revenue growth: We forecast AWS revenue to accelerate in 4Q25 and accelerate further in both ’26 and ’27 on the heels of strong core and AI workload demand and alongside expanding AI infrastructure capacity… ii) eCommerce and Advertising Momentum: AMZN’s eCommerce biz should see strong growth in ’26 driven by cont’d record delivery speed (which drives purchase conversion), expansion of same day perishables biz, & investment in rural markets. We estimate AMZN’s ’26 Ads rev grows high teens y/y driven by sponsored products, AMZN’s demand-side platform (DSP), and emerging Prime Video ad biz; and iii) Continued Margin Expansion: We forecast AMZN ’26 Op Inc of $104BN, ~4% above consensus, yielding 12.8% Op Inc (GAAP) margins, as high margin Ads and AWS businesses continue ramping while eCommerce margins benefit from lower cost to serve.”\n\nLooking forward from here, Blackledge rates Amazon’s stock as a Buy, with a $300 price target that indicates potential for a 35% upside in the coming year. (To watch Blackledge’s track record, click here )\nAmazon’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 45 analyst reviews, with a highly lopsided split of 44 Buys to 1 Hold. The shares are currently priced at $222.56 and the $296.85 average price target implies a one-year gain of 33%. (See AMZN stock forecast )\nAdvanced Micro Devices ( AMD )\nFrom the leader in online retail we’ll shift gears and look at a rising company in the semiconductor chip industry. The company is a ‘smaller’ chip maker in a relative sense – the industry leaders are the trillion-dollar-plus mega-cap giants Nvidia and Broadcom, but AMD’s $338 billion market cap is very respectable in itself – and places the company at number six among the most valuable semiconductor firms. AMD built its original reputation and market on PC processors, but is rapidly expanding its business in the AI market.\n\nOn the AI-related track, AMD has two important new products on the way, expected next year. The MI450 is the latest iteration of the Instinct chips, and is a next-gen, high-performance GPU designed especially for AI training and inference. It features advanced memory, ultra-fast interconnects, and deep integration capabilities, making it well suited to hyperscaler AI developers.\nThe second new product on the way next year is Helios, which AMD describes as its next generation in open‑standard, rack‑scale AI infrastructure, and which incorporates the MI450 as part of its rack‑level system. Helios is designed to facilitate the largest AI and high-performance computing workloads, to redefine AI training at the largest scales. In a statement earlier this month, AMD announced that HPE will be among the first original equipment manufacturers to adopt Helios.\n\nAMD’s AI-related businesses form the largest segment of the company’s revenue. The company’s data center segment, directly tied-in to AI, makes up almost 47% of the total revenue, and at $4.3 billion it was up 22% year-over-year in 3Q25.\nOverall, AMD reported total revenue of $9.2 billion in the third quarter, a quarterly record and up 32% year-over-year – and beating the forecast by $487.5 million. At the bottom line, AMD’s earnings came in at $1.20 per share by non-GAAP measures, beating the forecast by 3 cents per share and marking a sharp increase from the 92-cent non-GAAP EPS reported in 3Q24.\nThis stock has caught the attention of Cowen’s Josh Buchalter, who sees plenty more room for the shares to run up in the near future. He writes, “AMD’s hardware roadmap, progress building out its ROCm software ecosystem, and, most importantly, customer wins, have reinforced our confidence that it can create and capture value in AI compute. Against a very large TAM, we believe the Helios rack and MI450 will mark a key inflection in AMD’s story beginning in mid-2026. We think investors should own the stock ahead of the ramp, as we model 4Q26 EPS inflecting to a >$10 run-rate, or up ~2x… Y/Y and Q/Q.”\n\nThese comments support the analyst’s Buy rating on the shares, while his $290 price target suggests a 12-month upside potential of 39%. (To watch Buchalter’s track record, click here )\nAMD has 37 recent analyst reviews on record, and the Strong Buy consensus is supported by the 28-9 split favoring Buy over Hold. The stock has a trading price of $209.17 and its $281.84 average target price implies a gain of 35% on the one-year horizon.

      "Content": "JPMorgan Quants Warn of ‘Extreme Crowding’ in Speculative Stocks\n\nBernard Goyder\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: JPM\n\nAVGO\n\nAMD\n\nEXPE\n\nIVZ\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The latest bout of volatility in US equity markets highlights a risk that strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been warning about: “extreme crowding” in stocks that have rallied hard this year.\nThe bank has a list of six stocks it considers speculative growth plays and warned that they are “vulnerable to a reversal” in the event of any major macro event. The list includes Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Expedia Group Inc., Estee Lauder Cos Inc., Invesco Ltd. and Nucor Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nNew York Utility Says Queue for Large Power Users Has Tripled\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.2% Wednesday, a fourth straight day of loss after notching a record last week. The selloff has been led by tech shares as investors rotate out of winners — an event the JPMorgan quants warned about. They said “crowding” into the highly volatile, risky stocks had reached the 99th percentile — an “extreme” level that could lead to a sharp unwind that investors should hedge against.\n“These companies are more sensitive to shocks, leaving them at risk of sudden repricing,” wrote Bram Kaplan, JPMorgan’s head of Americas equity derivatives strategy. “Low Vol stocks possess a more attractive risk-reward profile” he added, compared to the more volatile stocks, many of which are “second order speculative AI plays.”\nSince Dec. 10, Broadcom shares are down more than 21%, while Advanced Micro Devices has dropped 11%. Estee Lauder, Invesco and Nucor are in the red as well, with only Expedia up about 3%.\nInvestors looking for winners from the artificial intelligence trade this year fanned out from Big Tech names like Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp., and piled into names they expect to benefit from the AI wave. JPMorgan called the ones that made its list “second-order speculative AI beneficiaries” and said they are vulnerable to big swings because they have to tap capital or debt markets to fund expansion, rather than rely on internal growth.\n\nKaplan offers a simple recipe for clients looking to trade the moment: buy bearish put options on speculative names and take bullish positions on less volatile stocks. Investors can consider shorting some of the high-momentum names, while taking long positions in duller “low volatility” stalwarts like Cigna Group, Pfizer Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nThere is the chance, of course, that the four-day slump in these momentum stocks could merely be a temporary rotation away from a few hot stocks, rather than any significant change to the landscape. That criticism is bolstered by Micron Technology Inc.’s blowout earnings on Wednesday, that are pushing AI stocks higher once again.\n\n“Real asset owners — retail investors and large institutions — are the only market participants capable of moving markets beyond short-term, shallow and technical drawdowns,” Alexis Maubourguet, chief investment officer of the Swiss hedge fund Adapt Investment Managers, said in an interview. “It will take a meaningful fundamental change for them to liquidate their positions, such as a material shift in the AI narrative.”\nNevertheless, there’s been a growing sense that the AI trade is no longer capable of lifting all boats, with investors trying to sort out winners and losers.\n--With assistance from Matt Turner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nThe Prosperity Gap Between Big and Small Businesses\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Not All AI Stocks Are Falling These Days. Micron Is Rising on Strong Earnings\n\nKara Greenberg\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nKey Takeaways Micron Technology posted earnings that topped analysts' estimates, sending shares higher in extended trading Wednesday.\nCEO Sanjay Mehrotra said growing AI demand drove record results for the memory chipmaker and Nvidia supplier.\nWorries about an AI bubble have weighed on the tech sector lately. Micron is still riding the AI boom higher.\n\nShares of the memory chip maker were up over 5% in extended trading Wednesday after the company posted earnings that blew past analysts' estimates, driven by growing demand for AI hardware.\nMicron Technology ( MU ) posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.78 for the fiscal first quarter, well above the $3.96 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for . Its revenue jumped nearly 60% year-over-year to a record $13.64 billion, also exceeding expectations.\n\nWhy This Matters to Investors As a supplier for leading AI chipmakers including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Micron has seen strong momentum in its data center business this year, helping it earn a reputation as a winning \"pick-and-shovel\" play for the AI trade.\n\"Micron delivered record revenue and significant margin expansion at the company level and also in each of our business units,” said CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, who called the company an \"essential AI enabler.\"\n\nMicron projected adjusted earnings per share of $8.22 to $8.62 on revenue of $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion for the second quarter, well ahead of consensus estimates.\n\nMicron's stock, though well off record highs seen earlier this month, has largely avoided the worst of the recent slump in the AI sector. It's continued to benefit from a shortage in the memory market , supporting stronger pricing and higher margins. Micron's GAAP gross margin jumped to 56% in the first quarter, up from around 38% a year earlier, with the company saying it expects that to climb as high as 68% in the current quarter.\nShares of Micron have nearly tripled in value in 2025 through Wednesday's close, making it one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 for the year.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025\n\nRyan Peterson\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:37 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nShares of AMD have steadied near recent highs as investors digest strong AI-related momentum alongside lingering questions about how quickly the company can meaningfully close the gap with Nvidia in data center acceleration. The story right now is less about AMD's growth prospects and more about whether enthusiasm around AI chips has largely been priced in heading into year-end.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, we ran AMD through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI's GPT. The goal wasn't to set a bold long-term target, but to produce a short, data-driven outlook that blends price action, technical signals, and the current narrative around AI demand and competition.\nWhat the AI model is actually predicting The agent was fed recent price action and a focused set of inputs to produce a short-term outlook. At the time of the run, AMD traded at $207.58. For the period from Dec. 16 through Jan. 6, the model's base-case projection came out to:\nAverage predicted price: $207.30\nImplied move: essentially flat drift into early January\nSignal snapshot: MACD remains low and flat, while RSI has begun to decline, pointing to cooling momentum rather than a breakdown\n\nIn plain language, the AI sees AMD's most likely path over the next few weeks as sideways, with little incentive for traders to push the stock meaningfully higher or lower without a new catalyst. That reflects a market that's comfortable with AMD's positioning, but not eager to expand the multiple further in the near term.\nFundamentally, AMD continues to benefit from rising demand for its MI300 AI accelerators, which management has highlighted as a key growth driver into 2025 as hyperscalers diversify beyond Nvidia. Recent earnings results showed data center revenue accelerating sharply year over year, reinforcing the idea that AMD is firmly in the AI spending cycle, even if it remains a distant second to Nvidia in market share.\nAt the same time, AMD's stock has already reflected much of that optimism. Shares rallied strongly earlier in the year on AI enthusiasm and improving PC demand, leaving less room for short-term upside unless orders or guidance surprise meaningfully. Broader coverage has also noted that while MI300 adoption is growing, the pace of revenue ramp and margins will be critical to sustaining investor confidence.\n\nPrice action in December supports that view. The stock has traded in a relatively tight range, with momentum indicators softening. The declining RSI suggests buying pressure is easing, while the flat MACD points to indecision rather than distribution. That combination often precedes consolidation rather than a sharp move, especially in large-cap semiconductor names late in the year.\n\nStory Continues\nThink of this AI outlook as a short-term temperature check. The model isn't making a judgment on AMD's long-term role in AI compute or its ability to take share over time. Instead, it's estimating how the market is likely to behave while investors wait for clearer signals on AI revenue scaling, margins, and competitive dynamics. In this run, the agent favors a muted move.\n\nFor longer-term investors bullish on AMD's AI roadmap and diversified chip portfolio, a flat few weeks is largely noise. For traders, it's a reminder that the next meaningful move in AMD will likely hinge on fresh data, either stronger-than-expected AI revenue traction or clearer signs that competition is pressuring pricing and margins.\nImage: Shutterstock\nThis article ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here .\nHappy Wednesday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Dec. 17, 2025. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nUpdate 4:01 p.m ET Closing Bell The U.S. markets are now closed, putting a cap on a rough day of trading for tech stocks. In total, 57.5% (3,197) issues were in decline today against 39.2% (2,178) advancing.\nThe Nasdaq (-1.81%) faced the brunt of the selloff as the Financial Times reported that Oracle (-5.4%) was losing a key source of funding on its $10 billion Michigan data center project. That revelation cooked up a significant selloff in semiconductor names, as well as the broader tech industry. The Nasdaq finished at 22,693.32.\nThe S&P 500 (-1.16%) sold off for a fourth straight day on the news, falling to 6,721.50. Here was the index today; notice those hot red pockets in tech and industrials.\nMeanwhile, the Russell 2000 (-1.07%) faced similar pockets of decline as the tech and industrial trouble boiled over into the small-cap index. It fell below 2,500 on the news, reversing from recent all-time highs.\nRounding out the major indexes, the Dow (-0.47%) was best-insulated, but still registered a decline. It closed out the day at 47,855.97.\n\nUpdate 1:20 p.m ET Midday Movers Now that the midday fireworks are in the rear view, all four U.S. market indexes are facing steeper declines -- near day lows.\nThe Russell 2000 (-1.26%) is down amid sluggishness in the industrial, technology, and communication services sector today.\nThe same is at least partially true for the Nasdaq (-1.23%) and S&P 500 (-0.83%), which are facing a similar downturn as the Oracle (-4.8%) drama permeates throughout the market, weighing on shares of other semiconductor names such as Broadcom (-5.3%), Advanced Micro Devices (-3.8%), and Nvidia (-3%).\n\nToday, the Dow (-0.39%) is making the best case today. Half of the index is in the red, the other half is in the red.\nIn total, 53.8% (2,992) of U.S. issues are in decline today against 42.8% (2,379) advancing, which brings us to our midday mover list for today. We'll take a look at the top and bottom 20 equities in the market among firms with at least a $2 billion market cap :\nWinners Despite it being a bad day for AI , today's top stock is an AI-fueled biotech play called Recursion Pharmaceuticals (+17.8%), who we haven't seen atop the list in quite awhile. A one-time retail favorite, the company was upgraded by JPMorgan today, which moved it from 'neutral' to 'overweight' citing the potential of its MEK inhibitor clinical trial.\n\nStory Continues\nFollowing close behind is Hut 8 (+12.5%), Anbio (+10.6%), and Via Transportation (+8.4%).\nAmong the larger firms making the list today are Elbit Systems (+4.3%), Texas Pacific Land Corporation (+5.6%), and Figma (+4.8%).\nLosers At the other end of the market, EverCommerce (-11.6%) is plummeting on some volatility . It's followed by some AI-related trades, independent power producer Bloom Energy (-10.1%) and Fermi (-9.6%).\nEven larger firms are being weighed down today by the AI jitters, including GE Vernova (-8.2%), Constellation Energy (-7.9%), and Vistra (-7.3%).\nUpdate 10:44 a.m ET More Oracle Drama Weighs on Tech Stocks Oracle is once again making itself the main character in the AI boom -- and maybe not in a good way.\nToday, the hyperscaler is declining on a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital won't go forward with funding the firm's $10 billion Michigan data center amid worries about \"tougher debt terms and the risk of delays,\" per the article.\n\nThe news comes just days after sources close to Oracle said it was pushing back key data center deliveries for partner OpenAI , who has committed billions to data center projects. Oracle was made to refute reports that it was not punting on these projects and that all milestones were coming along as planned. Obviously, Blue Owl seems to have sided with the anonymous sources cited in that Bloomberg report.\nWhy Does It Matter? Traders have remained relatively flighty about Oracle and ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Oracle counts more than half of its performance obligations from the Sam Altman-helmed company, which remains reliant on capital infusions from venture capital to stay afloat as it burns through money.\nAnd since the latter has not put up the money upfront, the hyperscaler has taken on gobs of debt to bring its data center ambitions to life. An astonishing $25 billion of the firm's $127 billion in debt is due within just three years. And with negative free cash flow -- in fact, -$13 billion -- a modest delay could seriously jeopardize the company's financial prospects.\n\nThe company's Altman Z-Score, a measure which is designed to predict likelihoods of bankruptcy within two years, is in the so-called \"grey area\" already, indicating financial stress.\nA deal with tech giant Meta seemed to help settle some concerns, but the underlying story is still the same: Oracle needs to deliver these projects or there might be trouble.\nWhat Does This Have to Do with WBD? Larry Ellison , the CEO and Co-Founder of Oracle, was seen trying to help finance the acquisition of HBO parent Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ).\nLarry's son, David, is the CEO of media company Skydance -- which recently acquired Paramount to become Paramount Skydance.\nHowever, the Ellison Family Trust was seen as a precarious sticking point in the recent negotiations between the media giants, leading WBD to go with Netflix for a proposed takeout. Partially harming matters for the Ellisons were questions about their financing, as well as Oracle's sagging stock.\n\nThat said, counting its decline today, Oracle has now fallen more than 45% from all-time highs.\nUpdate 9:34 a.m ET Opening Bell The U.S. markets are now open. The Russell 2000 (+0.57%) has already reversed yesterday's -0.45% decline from yesterday; it's now just a matter of holding onto those gains for the day.\nIn large caps, the Dow (+0.36%) is also having a solid start to the day. The S&P 500 (+0.12%) and Nasdaq (+0.09%), by contrast, are just up a few basis points at the market open. For the former, a gain today would put an end to a three day skid for the index.\n\nThe 10Y is up 0.8 bips to 4.157%.\nOne of the foreboding themes of the Tuesday trade -- aside from so-so payrolls -- was the large decline in U.S. energy stocks. The S&P Energy sector declined 3% as domestic oil prices approached a nearly four-year low. This morning, the U.S. oil benchmark known as WTI Crude , is trading at $56 -- up about 1.5%.\nToday, the sector is up about 1%, taking a bite of some of yesterday's losses. Financials and materials are also joining in the recovery, up more than half a percentage point.\nJoining in some of that excitement are Natural Gas continuous futures (+2.96% to $4.001) and the international oil benchmark, Brent Crude (+1.46% to $59.78), which is seeing a healthy bump in its continuous futures too.\nBut since it's the holiday season, there might not be a more timely trade than Silver (+3.75% and $65.675) and Gold (+0.81% to $4,367) -- they're up again today, continuing a hefty showing from precious metals in recent trading.\n\nUpdate 7:43 a.m ET A.M. Update Good morning. Futures this morning are currently pointing to modest gains in U.S. equities this morning, potentially offsetting Tuesday's tepid payrolls market reaction.\nEarnings Today: Micron, JBS, General Mills Here are all of the companies with at least a $1 billion market cap which are slated to report today, per Nasdaq:\nEconomic Data + Events Today will be a fairly relaxed day compared with yesterday, which saw the release of the overdue October payrolls alongside November's data.

      "Content": "China's $6.5B Chip Shock: Ex-AMD Exec's Startup Skyrockets 755% in Market Frenzy\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:44 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nMetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai Co.'s Shanghai listing has quickly become a focal point in China's semiconductor push, highlighting how domestic chip ambitions are translating into rapid wealth creation. Founded by former Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) executive Chen Weiliang after he left the US chipmaker five years ago, MetaX debuted at a valuation of about $5.9 billion before surging as much as 755% intraday and closing its first session up 693%. That move lifted the value of Chen's 55-million-share stake to roughly $6.5 billion, placing his rise alongside Moore Threads Technology Co. founder Zhang Jianzhong, another former US chip executive whose fortune expanded following a recent IPO. The developments reflect how Beijing's drive to build a self-sufficient chip supply chain is reshaping both capital markets and personal balance sheets, even as geopolitical tensions remain part of the backdrop.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with AMD.\nIs AMD fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nA key element behind MetaX's rapid build-out has been its approach to talent and incentives. Chen drew heavily from his former AMD network, recruiting senior engineers and executives such as Peng Li and Yang Jian into top technical roles, alongside other ex-AMD colleagues now embedded across management. To secure this talent in a highly competitive environment, the company leaned on equity as a primary tool, distributing 461 million yuan in share-based compensation in 2024. More than 80% of MetaX's roughly 870 employees hold indirect stakes through partnership structures, a model that has turned a broad swath of its workforce into high-net-worth individuals and helped shorten the typical startup learning curve.\n\nBeneath the headline gains, MetaX is still navigating the realities of heavy investment and operational risk. The company spent more than 2.2 billion yuan on research and development from 2022 through 2024 and reported a net loss of 1.41 billion yuan in 2024, underscoring the cash burn required to narrow gaps in system-level performance and production. Revenue reached 915 million yuan in the first half of 2025, surpassing the prior full year, while management projects a possible break-even point in 2026 that depends on the competitiveness of its C500 chip against domestic rivals including Huawei, Hygon and Cambricon. Reliance on a limited customer base and on third-party foundries also leaves the supply chain exposed to policy shifts and capacity constraints, suggesting the next phase of MetaX's story could hinge on execution as much as on capital-market momentum.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Micron's Make-or-Break Moment: Can AI Hype Justify a 176% Surge?\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nMarket participants are bracing for Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) to report earnings after Wednesday's close, with the bar set high as skepticism around the AI trade begins to surface. The shares have surged 176% in 2025, ranking as the fifth-best performer in the S&P 500 and marking Micron's strongest year since 2013, well ahead of the roughly 40% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. That momentum has softened in recent sessions, with the stock down about 12% over the past four days following a Dec. 10 high, suggesting investors may be reassessing expectations ahead of the report.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Sign with MU.\nIs MU fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe company is expected to post strong growth as sustained spending on AI data centers supports demand for its high-bandwidth memory chips, but the market appears focused on whether that momentum is still accelerating. Recent sharp declines in Oracle and Broadcom, both of which fell 11% in a single session last week, have highlighted how quickly sentiment can turn on perceived AI beneficiaries. Some investors may now be adopting a more cautious stance, waiting for clearer signals on how durable data-center growth could be before re-engaging with the sector.\nValuation remains a central part of the Micron debate. Despite this year's rally, the shares trade at roughly 11 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, the lowest multiple among the 30 stocks in the semiconductor index, which trades closer to 25 times forward earnings. That discount stands out against peers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ), and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), which command significantly higher multiples. At the same time, expectations for Micron's fundamentals have been moving higher, with consensus forecasts for fiscal 2026 net earnings up 16% over the past month and more than 50% over the past quarter, while revenue estimates have risen by more than 20% over the past three months. With enthusiasm elevated and memory demand still cyclical, the upcoming earnings report could either reinforce the view that Micron is reasonably valued or test how much optimism is already reflected in the shares.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Exclusive-Google works to erode Nvidia's software advantage with Meta's help\n\nReuters\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nDec 17 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google is working on a new initiative to make its artificial intelligence chips better at running PyTorch, the world’s most widely used AI software framework, in a move aimed at weakening Nvidia 's longstanding dominance of the AI computing market, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe effort is part of Google's aggressive plan to make its Tensor Processing ​Units a viable alternative to Nvidia's market-leading GPUs. TPU sales have become a crucial growth engine of Google's cloud revenue as it seeks to prove to investors that its AI investments are generating returns.\nBut ‌hardware alone is not enough to spur adoption. The new initiative, known internally as “TorchTPU,” aims to remove a key barrier that has slowed adoption of TPU chips by making them fully compatible and developer-friendly for customers who have already built their tech infrastructure using PyTorch software, the ‌sources said. Google is also considering open-sourcing parts of the software to speed uptake among customers, some of the people said.\n\nCompared with earlier attempts to support PyTorch on TPUs, Google has devoted more organizational focus, resources and strategic importance to TorchTPU, as demand grows from companies that want to adopt the chips but view the software stack as a bottleneck, the sources said.\nPyTorch, an open-source project heavily supported by Meta Platforms, is one of the most widely used tools for developers who make AI models. In Silicon Valley, very few developers write every line of code that chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices or Google will actually execute.\nInstead, those developers rely on tools like PyTorch, which is a ⁠collection of pre-written code libraries and frameworks that automate many common tasks in ‌developing AI software. Originally released in 2016, PyTorch’s history has been closely tied to Nvidia’s development of CUDA, the software that some Wall Street analysts regard as the company’s strongest shield against competitors.\n\nNvidia’s engineers have spent years ensuring that software developed with PyTorch runs as fast and efficiently as possible on its chips. Google, by contrast, has long ‍had its internal armies of software developers use a different code framework called Jax, and its TPU chips use a tool called XLA to make that code run efficiently. Much of Google’s own AI software stack and performance optimization has been built around Jax, widening the gap between how Google uses its chips and how customers want to use them.\nA Google Cloud spokesperson did not comment on the specifics of the project, but confirmed to Reuters that the move would provide customers with choice.\n\nStory Continues\n\"We ​are seeing massive, accelerating demand for both our TPU and GPU infrastructure,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our focus is providing the flexibility and scale developers need, regardless of the hardware they choose to build on.\"\nTPU FOR CUSTOMERS\nAlphabet had ‌long reserved the lion’s share of its own chips, or TPUs, for in-house use only. That changed in 2022, when Google’s cloud computing unit successfully lobbied to oversee the group that sells TPUs. The move drastically increased Google Cloud's allocation of TPUs and as customers' interest in AI has grown, Google has sought to capitalize by ramping up production and sales of TPUs to external customers.\n\nBut the mismatch between the PyTorch frameworks used by most of the world’s AI developers and the Jax frameworks that Google’s chips are currently most finely tuned to run means that most developers cannot easily adopt Google’s chips and get them to perform as well as Nvidia’s without undertaking significant, extra engineering work. Such work takes time and money in the fast-paced AI race.\nIf successful, Google's “TorchTPU” initiative could significantly reduce switching costs for companies that want alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia’s dominance has been reinforced ⁠not only by its hardware but by its CUDA software ecosystem, which is deeply embedded in PyTorch and has become the ​default method by which companies train and run large AI models.\n\nEnterprise customers have been telling Google that TPUs are harder to adopt ​for AI workloads because they historically required developers to switch to Jax, a machine-learning framework favored internally at Google, rather than PyTorch, which most AI developers already use, the sources said.\nJOINT EFFORTS WITH META\nTo speed development, Google is working closely with Meta, the creator and steward of PyTorch, according to the sources. The two tech giants have been discussing deals ‍for Meta to access more TPUs, a move first reported ⁠by The Information.\nEarly offerings for Meta were structured as Google-managed services, in which customers like Meta installed Google's chips designed to run Google software and models, with Google providing operational support. Meta has a strategic interest in working on software that makes it easier to run TPUs, in a bid to lower inference costs and diversify its AI infrastructure away from Nvidia’s GPUs to gain negotiating power, the people ⁠said.\n\nMeta declined to comment.\nThis year, Google has begun selling TPUs directly into customers’ data centers rather than limiting access to its own cloud. Amin Vahdat, a Google veteran, was named head of AI infrastructure this month, reporting directly to CEO Sundar Pichai.\nGoogle needs that ‌infrastructure both to run its own AI products, including the Gemini chatbot and AI-powered search, and to supply customers of Google Cloud, which sells access to TPUs to companies such as ‌Anthropic.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu, Kenrick Cai and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Exclusive-How China built its ‘Manhattan Project’ to rival the West in AI chips\n\nFanny Potkin\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:17 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nINTC\n\nSSNLF\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nBy Fanny Potkin\nSINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence , smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. ​The smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\nNevertheless, China still faces ‌major technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government ‌initiative to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.\n\nStory Continues\nChinese electronics giant Huawei plays a key role coordinating a web of companies and state research institutes across the country involving thousands of engineers, according to the two people and a third source.\nThe people described it as China's version of the Manhattan Project, the U.S. wartime effort to develop the atomic bomb.\n\n“The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,” one of the people said. \"China wants the United States 100% kicked out of its supply chains.\"\nHuawei, the State Council of China, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to requests for comment.\nUntil now, only one company has mastered EUV technology: ASML, headquartered in Veldhoven, Netherlands. Its machines, which cost around $250 million, are indispensable for manufacturing the most advanced chips designed by companies like Nvidia and AMD—and produced by chipmakers such as TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.\nASML built its first working prototype of EUV technology in 2001, and told Reuters it took nearly two decades and billions of euros in R&D spending before it produced its first commercially-available chips in 2019.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small ⁠feat,” ASML told Reuters in a statement.\nASML's EUV systems are currently available to U.S. allies including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.\nStarting in 2018, the United States began pressuring ‌the Netherlands to block ASML from selling EUV systems to China. The restrictions expanded in 2022, when the Biden administration imposed sweeping export controls designed to cut off China's access to advanced semiconductor technology.\nThe controls targeted not just EUV systems but also older deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines that produce less-advanced chips like Huawei’s, aiming to keep China at least a generation behind in chipmaking capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said the Trump Administration has strengthened enforcement of export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and is working with partners \"to close loopholes as technology advances.”\nThe Dutch Ministry of Defence said the Netherlands is developing policies requiring “knowledge institutions” to perform personnel screenings to prevent access to sensitive technology “by individuals that have ill intentions or who are at risk of being pressured.”\nExport restrictions ‍have slowed China's progress toward semiconductor self-sufficiency for years, and constrained advanced chip production at Huawei, the two people and a third person said.\nThe sources spoke on condition they not be identified due to the confidentiality of the project.\n\nCHINA'S MANHATTAN PROJECT\nOne veteran Chinese engineer from ASML recruited to the project was surprised to find that his generous signing bonus came with an identification card issued under a false name, according to one of the people, who was familiar with his recruitment.\nOnce inside, he recognized other former ASML colleagues who were also working under aliases and was instructed to use their fake names at work to maintain secrecy, the person said. Another person independently confirmed that recruits were given fake IDs to conceal their identities from other workers inside the secure facility.\nThe guidance was clear, the two people said: Classified under national security, no one outside the compound could know what they were building—or that they were there at all.\n\nThe team includes recently retired, Chinese-born former ASML engineers and scientists—prime recruitment targets because they possess sensitive technical knowledge but face fewer professional constraints after leaving the company, ​the people said.\nTwo current ASML employees of Chinese nationality in the Netherlands told Reuters they have been approached by recruiters from Huawei since at least 2020.\nHuawei did not respond to requests for comment.\nEuropean privacy laws limit ASML's ability to track former employees. Though employees sign non-disclosure agreements, enforcing them across borders has proven difficult.\nASML won an $845 million judgment in 2019 against a former Chinese engineer accused of stealing trade secrets, but the defendant filed for bankruptcy and continues to ‌operate in Beijing with Chinese government support, according to court documents.\n\nASML told Reuters that it “vigilantly guards” trade secrets and confidential information.\n\"While ASML cannot control or restrict where former employees work, all employees are bound by the confidentiality clauses in their contracts,\" the company said, and it has \"successfully pursued legal action in response to the theft of trade secrets.”\nReuters was unable to determine if any legal actions have been taken against former ASML employees involved in China’s lithography program.\nThe company said it safeguards EUV knowledge by ensuring only select employees can access the information even inside the company.\nDutch intelligence warned in an April report that China \"used extensive espionage programmes in its attempts to obtain advanced technology and knowledge from Western countries,\" including recruiting \"Western scientists and employees of high-tech companies.”\n\nThe ASML veterans made the breakthrough in Shenzhen possible, the people said. Without their intimate knowledge of the technology, reverse-engineering the machines would have been nearly impossible.\nTheir recruitment was part of an aggressive drive China launched in 2019 for semiconductor experts working abroad, offering signing bonuses that started at 3 million to 5 million yuan ($420,000 to $700,000) and home-purchase subsidies, according to a Reuters review of government policy documents.\nRecruits included Lin Nan, ASML's former head of light source technology, whose team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Shanghai Institute of Optics has filed eight patents on EUV light sources in 18 months, according to patent filings.\nThe Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics did not respond to requests for comment. Lin could not be reached for comment.\n\nTwo additional people familiar with China’s recruitment efforts said some naturalized citizens of other countries were given Chinese passports and allowed to maintain dual citizenship.\nChina officially prohibits dual citizenship and did not answer questions on issuing passports.\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nINSIDE CHINA'S EUV FAB\nASML's most advanced EUV systems are roughly the size of a school bus, and weigh 180 tons. After failed attempts to replicate its size, the prototype inside the Shenzhen lab became many times larger to improve its ⁠power, according to the two people.\nThe Chinese prototype is crude compared to ASML's machines but operational enough for testing, the people said.\nChina's prototype lags behind ASML's machines largely because researchers have struggled to obtain optical systems like those from Germany's Carl Zeiss AG, one of ASML's ​key suppliers, the two people said.\n\nZeiss declined to comment.\nThe machines fire lasers at molten tin 50,000 times per second, generating plasma at 200,000 degrees Celsius. The light is focused using mirrors that take months to produce, according to Zeiss' website.\nChina's top research institutes have played key roles in developing homegrown ​alternatives, according to the two people.\nThe Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIOMP) achieved a breakthrough in integrating extreme-ultraviolet light into the prototype's optical system, enabling it to become operational in early 2025, one of the people said, though the optics still require significant refinement.\nCIOMP did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a March online recruitment call on its website, the institute said it was offering \"uncapped\" salaries to PhD lithography researchers and research grants worth up to 4 million yuan ($560,000) plus 1 million yuan ($140,000) in personal subsidies.\n\nJeff Koch, an analyst at research firm SemiAnalysis and a former ASML engineer, said China will have achieved \"meaningful progress” if the “light source has enough power, is reliable, and doesn’t generate too much contamination.”\n\"No doubt this is technically feasible, it's ‍just a question of timeline,\" he said. \"China has the advantage that commercial EUV now exists, so they aren't starting from zero.\"\nTo ⁠get the required parts, China is salvaging components from older ASML machines and sourcing parts from ASML suppliers through secondhand markets, the two people said.\nNetworks of intermediary companies are sometimes used to mask the ultimate buyer, the people said.\nExport-restricted components from Japan’s Nikon and Canon are being used for the prototype, one of the people and an additional source said.\n\nNikon declined to comment. Canon said it was not aware of such reports. The Japanese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nInternational banks regularly auction older semiconductor fabrication equipment, the sources said. Auctions in China sold older ASML lithography equipment as recently as October 2025, according to a review of listings on Alibaba Auction, an Alibaba-owned platform.\nA team of around 100 recent university graduates is focused on reverse-engineering components from both EUV and DUV lithography machines, according to the people.\nEach worker's desk is filmed by an individual camera ⁠to document their efforts to disassemble and reassemble parts—work the people described as key to China's lithography efforts.\n\nStaffers who successfully reassemble a component receive bonuses, the people said.\nHUAWEI SCIENTISTS SLEEP ON-SITE\nWhile the EUV project is run by the Chinese government, Huawei is involved in every step of the supply chain from chip design and fabrication equipment to manufacturing and final integration into products like smartphones, according to four people familiar with Huawei’s operations.\nCEO Ren Zhengfei briefs senior Chinese leaders on progress, according to one of the people.\nThe U.S. placed Huawei on an entity list in 2019, banning American companies from ‌doing business with them without a license.\nHuawei has deployed employees to offices, fabrication plants, and research centers across the country for the effort. Employees assigned to semiconductor teams often sleep on-site and are barred from returning home during the work week, with phone access restricted for teams handling more sensitive tasks, according to the people.\nInside Huawei, few employees know the scope of this work. \"The teams are kept isolated from ‌each other to protect the confidentiality of the project,\" one of the people said. “They don't know what the other teams work on.”\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore, additional reporting by Alexandra Alper in Washington, editing by Ken Li and Michael Learmonth)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Its intelligent solutions–Generative Intelligence (Solar LLM) and Document Intelligence for extraction on any document–are transforming workflows for some of the world's largest enterprises, optimizing repetitive tasks while preserving human oversight and complex decision making.\nUpstage raised $45 million earlier this year in a Series B bridge round, bringing total funding to $157 million, to expand its growth in the U.S. Notably, the AI company secured funding from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and AMD in August, becoming a minority investor in Upstage.\nSince the company's U.S. launch, Upstage landed on three CB Insights' industry lists, AI 100 , InsurTech 50 , and FinTech 100 , and showcased its leadership as subject matter experts at five major insurance industry events. The company has quickly established its presence in the InsurTech ecosystem with appearances at ITC Vegas, InsurTech Insights, and InsurTech NY. Additionally, Upstage's U.S. CEO, Kasey Roh, was a featured speaker at this year's AWS re:Invent Conference where she shared her insights on scaling real-world AI on a panel with AMD .\n\n\"Upstage's first year in North America has brought our transformative AI solutions to the U.S. insurance and financial services industries,\" said Kasey Roh, U.S. CEO of Upstage . \"Our technology is particularly advantageous for these legacy industries that still rely heavily on manual document processing. Upstage's superpower is that our technology hinges on human decision making, forging a symbiotic relationship between AI and people. This crucial distinction is what sets Upstage apart from other AI companies.\"\nUpstage's domain-specific models distinguish it from an industry flooded with newcomers, many of whom have yet to show tangible results. The company has spent half of the last decade building its proprietary model stack, giving them a distinct edge and headstart from companies modifying third-party or open-source foundation models.\n\nTheir technology's ability to turn any type of unstructured document into structured data is unique and essential for insurance companies handling large amounts of manual document processing. It adapts in real time while automatically flagging uncertain extractions while keeping humans in the loop. This feature is unique and critical, significantly reducing AI hallucinations that put companies at extreme risk. These human corrections are part of an automatic feedback loop for the model, learning from human validation to improve its accuracy over time. The technology provides companies with a zero-training, high-accuracy solution with no setup, templates, or retraining.\n\nStory continues\nThe proof of the company's success is in the numbers, its technology has a 95%+ accuracy across complex document types and formats. Upstage has served Fortune 500 companies in Korea, including Samsung, and now provides their solutions in the U.S. to enterprise and mid-market companies processing millions of pages every day.\n\nWhat Upstage's customers have to say about the company\nfurther highlights its success:\n\"Once Upstage's solution was in our underwriters' hands, there was no taking it away. The tool landed at exactly the right moment—as our team was working to keep up with 30% volume growth without additional headcount. Our VP of Underwriting made it clear: she wasn't giving up the invoice extraction tool 'over her dead body.' Within days, all 18 underwriters were benefiting from the solution.\"\n— Steven Beauchem , VP of Digital Strategy at Amwins, a leading global specialty insurance distributor.\n\"We've been able to achieve 95%+ accuracy on data [extraction] as well as other unstructured data in the underwriting process. Before, it took our team 30 minutes to an hour to review an application [whereas] today it could take us less than 10 minutes. This has been extremely impactful to our ability to manage a larger volume of submissions without sacrificing the depth of our analysis or the nuance that we gain from that information.\"\n— Gabriel Mayer , Founder of Tricura Insurance Group, an InsurTech MGU focused on providing liability coverage and technology to Senior Living Communities across the US.\n\n\"We built the MVP using a random GitHub parser, DocuClipper, and ChatGPT just to make it work. When I discovered Upstage, we realized we could replace the entire patchwork with a single, clean API. That decision changed everything — faster results, higher accuracy, zero maintenance.\"\n— Michael Rodriguez , Founder, Best Option Co., a software development company that brings AI solutions to help small businesses streamline operations and drive revenue.\nUpstage AI is poised to make an even bigger impact in North America in the coming year as it continues to partner with top companies in the insurance and financial services industries. The company is expected to bridge the gap between AI and human interaction to transform operations for legacy carriers and startups alike.\n\nAbout Upstage\nUpstage is building the future of enterprise AI through domain-specific language models and intelligent tools designed for high-impact business use. With deep expertise in LLM development, document AI, and agentic workflows, the company enables regulated industries and global enterprises to unlock the full potential of generative AI — securely, efficiently, and at scale.

      "Content": "Nvidia vs AMD: Which AI Chipmaker Will Lead the Next Decade of Compute?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Nvidia has been the leading AI chip designer since the start of the AI boom, but AMD has been gaining ground.\nBoth companies design the chips powering crucial AI tasks.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the \"go-to\" source for artificial intelligence (AI) chips since the start of the AI boom, and this is thanks to two things: the company's first-to-market advantage and the strong performance of its chips. All of this has generated enormous earnings growth, with revenue and profit reaching record levels, and mind-boggling share price gains -- the stock has advanced more than 900% over three years.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't alone in the exciting AI space. It faces competition from other chip designers such as Broadcom and even some of its own customers that have developed their own chips, like Amazon , for example. But one name in particular represents perhaps the biggest threat to Nvidia's dominance, and that's Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) , a company that's been quickly advancing with new high-powered chips and attractive pricing. And the coming years could represent a crucial moment for chip companies, as Nvidia predicts AI infrastructure spending may reach as much as $4 trillion.\nWhich of these two AI chip designers will lead the next decade of compute? Let's find out.\nNvidia's path to leadership First, let's consider Nvidia's path to leadership and how it's managed to stay ahead of rivals so far. As mentioned, Nvidia entered the market first with its supercharged graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips that power the most crucial of AI tasks from training to inferencing . This offered the company the opportunity to build relationships with customers, and for customers to be won over by the quality of Nvidia's products.\n\nNvidia maintained this leadership by continuing to innovate on a regular basis, and in recent years, it committed to annual updates to its top chips.\nAMD made AI a focus with the launch of its Instinct line of accelerators back in 2017, and since then has added to GPU offerings, gaining in performance and therefore becoming a stronger rival for AI powerhouse Nvidia.\nIn the most recent earnings report, the company delivered a 36% increase in revenue to a record level of $9.2 billion, and chief executive officer Lisa Su said quarterly performance and guidance for the next quarter marked \"a clear step up in our growth trajectory.\" Demand from data center customers for the company's EPYC processors and Instinct AI accelerators drove gains in the period.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD and OpenAI It's also important to note that AMD recently signed a deal with OpenAI for the deployment of six gigawatts of AMD GPUs, with the first gigawatt set to roll out in the second half of next year. (OpenAI also has a deal with Nvidia for the deployment of 10 gigawatts of Nvidia GPUs.)\nThough AMD has come a long way in a short period of time and surely will continue to gain many orders for its GPUs, I don't see the company unseating Nvidia and driving compute in the coming decade. And here's why: Nvidia truly has built out a massive ecosystem within the world of AI, offering everything needed to do the AI job, from GPUs to high-performance networking equipment and software, as well as platforms for specific industries like autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and robotics. And within those industry platforms, Nvidia's built tools designed to help customers reach their goals.\n\nThough AMD also offers a significant array of products and services, it's not as far-reaching as that of its bigger competitor.\nLeading the next decade of AI All of this makes Nvidia better positioned to lead the next decade of compute -- but this doesn't mean AMD won't benefit from the upcoming phases of AI growth. AMD's chips and systems are powerful, pricing is competitive, and the company has seen demand take off in recent quarters. Major chip customers, like Amazon, just to name one, buy GPUs from a variety of chip designers -- not just from Nvidia. In its recent earnings call, Amazon chief Andy Jassy said Amazon Web Services continues \"to work closely with chip partners like Nvidia, with whom we continue to order very significant amounts as well as with AMD and Intel .\"\n\nAll of this means that AMD may have plenty of very of bright days ahead, but considering the empire Nvidia has carefully built over time and its commitment to innovation, I expect this AI giant to keep powering the AI revolution.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Should Nvidia Worry About AMD and Google Breathing Down Its Neck in 2026?\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 11:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points AMD has an ambitious growth strategy and is already winning big AI chip deals.\nAlphabet's Google Cloud is making significant inroads in the AI chip market with its TPUs.\nNvidia shouldn't ignore the challenge from AMD and Google, but it's likely to continue dominating the market for now.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nLions reign as king of the jungle (although \"king of the savanna\" would probable more more accurate). Elvis is still the king of rock and roll. Michael Jackson remains the king of pop. However, if the subject is chips that power artificial intelligence (AI) applications, I'd say Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the king.\nBut the king's perch on the throne just might be at least a little shaky as the new year approaches. Should Nvidia worry about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) breathing down its neck in 2026?\nAMD's ambitious plans In November, AMD revealed a strategy to lead the $1 trillion AI and high-performance computing market. The company plans to deliver a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of greater than 35% over the next three to five years. AMD aims to achieve a revenue CAGR of more than 60% for its data center business.\n\nSuch ambitious plans are reminiscent of baseball legend Babe Ruth pointing to deep center field. You only make that kind of move unless you're confident you can back it up. Ruth, of course, proceeded to hit a home run. Can AMD deliver on its growth strategy? It's a definite maybe.\nThe company is already making progress toward its goal. For example, ChatGPT developer OpenAI will use AMD's Instinct MI450 GPUs in its next-generation AI infrastructure. The first deployment is scheduled for the second half of 2026. This deal also includes AMD issuing warrants for OpenAI to buy up to 160 million shares.\nAI cloud powerhouse Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is also using AMD's GPUs and CPUs with its first publicly available AI supercluster. The initial deployment is set for the third quarter of 2026. Privately held Cohere is integrating AMD's GPUs with its enterprise AI suite.\n\nAMD also won two major contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy. The agency will use AMD's GPUs and CPUs in its Lux and Discovery AI supercomputers.\nGoogle's TPUs are making inroads, too GPUs aren't the only game in town for powering AI systems, though. Alphabet's Google Cloud unit is also making inroads with its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) revealed last year that its Apple Intelligence generative AI functionality was trained using Google's TPUs rather than Nvidia's GPUs. Google, of course, also uses its TPUs with the widely acclaimed Google Gemini 3.0 large language model (LLM).\n\nStory Continues\nMore AI leaders are also turning to TPUs. Anthropic is spending tens of billions of dollars to expand its AI compute capacity in 2026 using Google's TPUs. The deal with Google is Anthropic's largest purchase of TPUs so far.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is reportedly in talks to use Google's TPUs in its data centers starting in 2027. In the past, Meta has been a major buyer of Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nGoogle could gain more traction in the AI chip market next year, thanks to its new Ironwood TPUs. Ironwood is four times more powerful than Google's previous highest-performing TPU.\nShould Nvidia worry? Both AMD and Google appear to be gaining momentum in the AI chip market. Should Nvidia worry? Yes and no.\nIt's always smart for companies to constantly monitor the competition and not rest on their laurels. Nvidia's management should recognize that its market dominance isn't guaranteed to last forever.\nHowever, I don't think Nvidia's top spot in the AI market is in jeopardy. The company doesn't, either, as evidenced by a post on X last month:\n\nIn my view, the AI chip market is large enough to support multiple winners. Nvidia will almost certainly remain the king for at least several more years. But either AMD or Google could deserve the title of crown prince.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "MetaX soars 700% in debut as China AI chips push lures investors\n\nReuters\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 6:19 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nSHANGHAI, Dec 17 (Reuters) - MetaX Integrated Circuits jumped 700% in its Shanghai market debut as the Chinese AI chipmaker tapped into strong momentum triggered by Beijing's push to reduce reliance on chips from U.S. firms Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ).\nFounded by former AMD executives, MetaX raised roughly $600 million in an initial public ​offering last week, days after larger rival Moore Threads debuted with a 400% pop.\n\nMetaX opened at 700 yuan a share in Shanghai versus an IPO price of ‌104.66 yuan, before surging as high as 895 yuan, defying persistent AI bubble concerns in other markets. The stock ended the trading session at 829.9 yuan, up 693%.\n\"It's another IPO tale in China that turns a crow into ‌a phoenix,\" said fund manager Yang Tingwu at Tongheng Investment.\nThe price surge \"creates huge arbitrage opportunities\" for pre-IPO investors, Yang said, and \"we're likely witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years\".\nMakers of artificial intelligence (AI) chips are rushing to sell shares in China to capitalise on interest generated by a government drive to boost local production in competition with the U.S.\n\n\"AI and semiconductors are key areas of competition in the Sino-U.S. tech rivalry,\" Guotai Haitong Securities said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing. \"Against the backdrop of geopolitical tension, AI chipmaking has huge growth potential,\" as China seeks to achieve self-sufficiency.\nResearcher ⁠Frost & Sullivan forecast China AI chip sales to top $189 billion ‌by 2029 versus $54 billion in 2026.\nPOLICYMAKERS PUSH AI SELF-SUFFICIENCY MetaX, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs), raised 4.2 billion yuan ($596 million) last week in a share sale that was more than 4,000 times oversubscribed by retail investors.\nThe IPO - China's sixth biggest so far this year, according to KPMG - priced the money-losing ‍startup at 50 times its 2024 sales. That compared with a multiple of 34 for Nvidia and 14 for AMD, MetaX said in a pre-listing statement.\n\nMetaX's debut catapulted the value of the five-year-old startup to more than 300 billion yuan ($42.58 billion) and boosted the wealth of founder and major shareholder Chen Weiliang, 49.\nAfter working for AMD Shanghai for 13 years, Chen founded MetaX with a mission to \"contribute to China's rejuvenation ​and national prosperity.\" The founding team also included Peng Li and Yang Jian, both former AMD engineers.\n\"The company is a leading GPU maker in China thanks to its AMD gene,\" ‌Li Hui, analyst at Huajin Securities, said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing.\n\nStory Continues\n\"It will likely benefit from China's continuous push to replace foreign suppliers using indigenous technology.\"\nMetaX, which controls 1% of China's AI chip market, projects the company's sales to more than double this year due to the tech self-reliance drive, and expects to break even as early as next year.\n\nCHINESE AI CHIPMAKERS RUSH FOR IPOS MetaX's market debut comes after Moore Threads ( 688795.SS ), dubbed by analysts as \"China's Nvidia\", raised $1.1 billion in its Shanghai IPO in late November.\n\nOn Monday, AI chip startup Biren Technology won regulatory approval to sell shares publicly in Hong Kong, while rival Kunlunxin also plans an IPO in the city. Another AI chipmaker, Enflame, has hired Citic Securities to prepare for a flotation.\n\"Chinese ⁠policymakers are greenlighting IPOs for AI chipmakers to support home-grown advanced technology,\" said fund manager Yuan Yuwei ​at Trinity Synergy Investments in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Domestic chipmakers lag U.S. rivals, but if they can raise tens or hundreds ​of billions to spend on talent, you cannot rule out their breakthrough.\"\nIPO fundraising in China jumped 23% in 2025 from a year earlier to exceed 160 billion yuan, according to KPMG, with 23% of the proceeds going to the technology, media and telecom sector.\nSIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY GAP MetaX flagged a number of ‍risk factors in its IPO prospectus, including supply ⁠chain disruption from U.S. technology restrictions as well as its significant technology gap with Nvidia and AMD.\nNvidia is considering adding production capacity for its H200 AI chips due to strong orders from Chinese clients, after U.S. President Donald Trump this month greenlighted export of Nvidia's second-fastest AI chips to China.\n\nIn the home GPU market, MetaX competes with ⁠Moore Threads as well as Hygon Information Technology and Biren.\nIn the so-called ASIC chip business, it competes with Cambricon, Huawei Technologies' HiSilicon, Baidu's Kunlunxin and Alibaba Group's T-Head.\n\"MetaX's technology lags Moore Threads, and it faces stiff competition ‌from Huawei and Alibaba,\" said Yuan of Trinity Synergy Investments.\nThere will be room to improve, \"but under the current circumstances, there's definitely froth in its share price.\"\n($1 = ‌7.0458 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee, Christopher Cushing and Thomas Derpinghaus)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
