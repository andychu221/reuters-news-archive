      "Content": "Will AMD Be a Must-Own AI Stock in 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points AMD is starting to make a comeback in the AI revolution.\nAMD's management believes it can deliver 60% data center growth through 2030.\nThe stock has a premium price tag over its chief rival.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nAMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has spent most of the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout in second place to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . This has caused AMD's stock to dramatically underperform Nvidia since 2023, with AMD rising aboiut 230% while Nvidia is up around 1,160%. However, AMD flipped the script in 2025, as it outperformed Nvidia stock significantly. AMD is up nearly 80% while Nvidia rose around 35%.\nThat's strong performance from both stocks, but AMD's 2025 comeback made it a must-own stock this year. The question is, will AMD be a must-own stock in 2026? Let's find out.\nAMD's comeback is real Nvidia was, and still is, the preferred graphics processing unit (GPU) vendor for the AI hyperscalers. Its GPUs and technology stack truly lead the industry, with AMD serving as a viable alternative. However, AMD has started to close the gap, particularly with controlling software.\nNvidia's CUDA software was one of the major differentiators between the two offerings, as AMD's wasn't nearly as good. However, thanks to various acquisitions and partnerships, AMD's ROCm software has dramatically improved. In fact, AMD reported that downloads for ROCm software increased 10 times year over year as of November 2025. This shows AMD is gaining ground, and there's another important consideration as well.\n\nDuring Nvidia's Q3 FY 2026 results, its CEO, Jensen Huang, noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. This is a huge deal, as its cloud clients aren't going to sit around idle while Nvidia fulfills demand. Instead, they're going to go looking for alternative computing providers, and AMD is near the top of the list. This could allow AMD to build a strong position in the computing hardware industry. If AI clients find out that AMD's hardware offers similar performance at a much lower price point, you could see more clients begin to use AMD's hardware stack instead of Nvidia's. This would be a huge shift for AMD, making it one of the best AI stocks to own in 2026 and beyond.\nAMD's internal projections reflect this, as management believes the data center division can achieve a 60% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030. In Q3, its data center growth rate was a mere 22%. This is a lofty goal AMD set for itself, but if it can achieve it, AMD will become a top artificial intelligence stock to own for the next few years.\n\nStory Continues\nCompanywide, AMD expects its CAGR to come in around 35%, because its consumer hardware and embedded processor divisions are only expected to grow at around a 10% CAGR over the next five years. Still, a 35% growth rate is nothing to be disappointed with, and if AMD's growth starts to accelerate in 2026, the stock could go on an incredible run. But there's one factor holding it back.\n\nSome of AMD's comeback is already priced in The market is well aware of the situation laid out above, which is why AMD's stock has done so well in 2025. Part of that success is already priced into its stock, as it trades for a significant premium over rival Nvidia when next year's earnings are used as the forward earnings valuation metric.\nInvestors must pay nearly 50% more to own AMD's stock versus Nvidia's. That's a hefty premium to place on a company that hasn't started its comeback yet; it's only talked about it. That's concerning to me, as I want to see some progress before I'm willing to say that AMD is the better stock to own for 2026. However, I still think that AMD will be successful, but just maybe not as successful as Nvidia will be in 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "What Is the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 8:36 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Chip designers such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom serve as the backbone of generative AI development.\nWhile chip designers steal the spotlight, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is playing a hugely important supporting role in the background.\nAs demand for AI chips and data centers accelerates, Taiwan Semi is poised for explosive long-term growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nFor the last three years, investing in semiconductor stocks has proven to be a profitable decision given the critical role chips play in the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Companies such as Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices , Broadcom , and Micron Technology have been some of the biggest contributors to the semiconductor industry throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nFlying under the radar is another chip company whose storyline seems muted compared to its peers. That's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , the pick-and-shovel specialist of the chip realm.\nLet's dive into Taiwan Semi's increasingly important role for the future of AI and assess why the stock looks like a no-brainer buying opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon.\nHow does Taiwan Semiconductor benefit from AI? Throughout the AI revolution, hyperscalers such as Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and OpenAI have collectively poured hundreds of billions of dollars into AI-related capital expenditures (capex) -- namely, chips and networking gear for data centers.\nOn the surface, this is great news for the likes of Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. But underneath the surface, it's even better news for Taiwan Semi. Why is that?\n\nTSMC is the largest chip manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue. While Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom design the most-in demand GPUs and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) on the planet, each of these giants relies heavily on Taiwan Semi's cutting-edge fabrication processes.\nIn other words, if Nvidia and its competitors represent the body of the car moving the AI narrative forward, TSMC holds the keys to the ignition.\nTSMC's growth is off the charts Over the last year, Taiwan Semi's revenue has been growing strongly thanks to ongoing demand for AI accelerators. What's interesting to point out is that the company's revenue trajectory is actually steepening. This is largely driven by rising demand for Nvidia's and AMD's next-generation Rubin and MI400 Series chips, as well as increasing investment in custom hardware from cloud infrastructure providers.\n\nStory Continues\nThe more subtle aspect from the financial picture above is Taiwan Semi's expanding profitability profile. Given its near-70% market share, TSMC is able to command enormous pricing power relative to competitors like Intel or Samsung .\nAgainst this backdrop, Taiwan Semi's gross margin is widening -- with excess cash flowing straight to the bottom line. The company is making the most of this new wave of capital by expanding its geographic footprint -- building additional foundries in Arizona, Germany, and Japan.\n\nIs Taiwan Semi stock a good buy right now? At the moment, TSMC boasts a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28.4 -- hovering near its highest level during the AI revolution. If you were to base your investment decision purely off of this metric, you may think Taiwan Semi is overvalued.\nSmart investors understand that TSMC's premium valuation could be warranted, though. McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion market through 2030 -- with the majority of spend allocated toward refining AI workloads.\nIn essence, building out AI-equipped data centers is expected to accelerate throughout the rest of the decade as training and inferencing models becomes more sophisticated and demanding. This is great news for TSMC as it paves the way for long-run visibility across the business.\n\nThe AI infrastructure chapter is still in its early innings. Over the course of the next several years, Taiwan Semi is positioned to benefit from the secular tailwind of rising investment in infrastructure both domestically and abroad.\nTaking this one step further, physical applications such as autonomous systems and robotics are yet to be deployed in a commercial sense. Looking beyond into the 2030s, these use cases are expected to drive additional trillions in economic value.\nShould they achieve some form of adoption and set the stage for the next wave of AI, Taiwan Semi has the potential to benefit immensely beyond where AI stands today -- building large language models (LLMs) and other software-based applications.\nWhen you consider the bigger picture and begin to think longer-term, TSMC's growth potential relative to its valuation looks compelling. So while the stock may not appear dirt cheap at first glance, I think there is ample room for meaningful valuation expansion over the course of the next decade -- making the stock a no-brainer buy right now in my eyes.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

(NASDAQ: AMD ) is one of the Best Quality Stocks to Buy Before 2026 . Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has risen more than 76.9% year-to-date. The share price moved further up on December 17, after South China Morning Post reported the company’s chair and CEO, Lisa SU met with the Chinese minister of industry and information technology.\nAccording to the report, Lisa Su affirmed the commitment to deepen its investment in China. The chief executive also noted that China will offer greater corporate opportunities for foreign enterprises, including Advanced Micro Devices.\n​This report comes as President Trump released a statement suggesting eased export control on Nvidia’s H200 chips and also indicated potential relaxation for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. This is an important update for the company as during fiscal 2024, China and Hong Kong combined generated roughly $6.2 billion in revenue for the company, thereby making it the second largest market for AMD.\n\n​That said, Wall Street also maintains a positive outlook on the stock. On December 19, Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but slightly lowered the price target from $279 to $277. On the same day, William Stein from Truist Financial also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $201.06 price target.\n​Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

However, recent trading suggests that some investors are booking profits. AMD stock is down 19% since hitting a 52-week high on Oct. 29.\nThis pullback could be a buying opportunity for investors looking to add a fast-growing company that's benefiting from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) . Additionally, a recent announcement by President Donald Trump, which will allow companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD, and Intel to sell their advanced AI chips to Chinese customers, is going to give AMD an additional boost in 2026.\nLet's take a closer look at AMD's catalysts for the new year and see why this stock has the potential to soar once again.\nThe Trump administration's announcement could give AMD a big shot in the arm AMD's business grew at a nice clip in 2025. It is on track to deliver $34 billion in revenue for the year, up 31% over 2024 revenue. It might have been even better, but AMD hasn't been able to sell its chips into the Chinese market since April, when the Trump administration imposed export controls on sales of advanced AI data center chips to that country.\n\nAs a result, AMD incurred an $800 million inventory charge in the second quarter. Moreover, the company lost a significant chunk of its revenue stream thanks to the Trump administration's move. That's because China accounted for nearly a quarter of AMD's 2024 revenue of $25.8 billion, or almost $6.2 billion.\nDespite the headwind, analysts expect a 20% increase in the company's earnings for 2025 to $3.97 per share. Consensus estimates suggest that AMD's earnings could jump 62% next year to $6.46 per share. I think it could end up doing much better than that.\nTake Nvidia, for example. The Trump administration now allows Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to Chinese customers. Nvidia was previously only selling its downsized H20 chips in China to comply with export regulations. Those chips were significantly cheaper and less powerful than Nvidia's flagship Hopper processor, the H200.\n\nStory Continues\nWith the change, Nvidia will likely see a significant bump in its revenue next year, even after paying the 25% tax that the administration plans to charge on sales to China. President Trump pointed out in his Truth Social post that the \"same approach will apply to AMD,\" suggesting that the company may be able to sell its high-end chips to Chinese customers.\n\nIt was earlier selling the downgraded MI308 processor to Chinese customers. It may now be able to ship its more powerful chips into that market, just like Nvidia has been allowed to. So, there is a possibility of AMD regaining the lost Chinese revenue in 2026, even with the 25% export fee.\nThat's because a full-fledged AMD data center graphics processing unit (GPU) will carry a significant premium over the nerfed MI308. This is why AMD's sales next year could turn out to be much higher than expected.\nThe stock could skyrocket in 2026 Analysts anticipate AMD's revenue to jump by 31% in 2026 to $44.6 billion. Assuming its revenue from China next year lands at 2024 levels of $6.2 billion, its top line could be somewhere around $51 billion. What's worth noting is that analysts haven't adjusted their 2026 revenue expectations for AMD following the Trump administration's rule change, suggesting that the company's potential gains from China aren't baked in just yet.\nAssuming AMD does achieve $51 billion in revenue next year and maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 11 at that time, its market cap could jump to $561 billion. That points toward a potential jump of 60% from its current market cap. So, now it would be a good time to buy this semiconductor stock following its recent pullback, as it has the potential to soar impressively in the new year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could 5X by 2030\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points AMD's technology stack is improving.\nAMD's margins could expand to deliver outsized profit growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nFinding stocks that can increase in value 5 times within five years is a lofty goal. That requires serious stock performance, and few companies can deliver that. To achieve 5 times returns in five years, a company must grow at a 38% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) . A 38% CAGR isn't an easy return to achieve, and it requires a massive market opportunity.\n\nWhat's a bigger opportunity than artificial intelligence (AI) ? There are several names in this industry, including AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) . AMD has outperformed rival Nvidia in 2025, rising around 80% versus Nvidia's 35%. Furthermore, AMD gave an incredible growth projection set to come about over the next five years, so it's the perfect candidate to see if it could return 5 times in five years. Management's numbers line up with the 38% CAGR laid out above, giving AMD a real shot at delivering this incredible return.\nAMD's management is bullish on its five-year outlook Frankly, AMD has not done well in the AI revolution. Its hardware isn't as good as Nvidia's, and its software was well behind. However, AMD has made various acquisitions and partnerships to improve its controlling software, ROCm. It noted that downloads for ROCm were up 10 times year over year as of November 2025, so there is a possibility that AMD could start gaining some ground on Nvidia once AI clients realize that AMD's technology stack could compete with Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia has controlled the data center computing market with an iron fist, and this dominance shows up in each company's results. In Q3 2025, AMD's data center revenue rose 22% year over year to $4.3 billion. During Nvidia's Q3 FY 2026 (ending Oct. 26, 2025), its data center revenue totaled $51.2 billion, up 66% year over year. AMD is clearly getting smoked here, but the tides could be changing.\nIn Nvidia's release, they noted that they are \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. This could be a concern for Nvidia, as clients will now likely search for alternative computing providers to fulfill their massive computing power needs. AMD could emerge as a top option to provide this power, and once they realize how far AMD's technology has come, they could become greater clients of AMD's because of its lower price point. That could increase AMD's business in the future, and so could a return to selling in the Chinese market.\n\nStory continues\nCurrently, neither AMD nor Nvidia is allowed to sell in China. However, they recently made a deal with the U.S. government to give up 15% of revenue for the right to export these GPUs to China. These GPUs aren't the cutting-edge ones used in the U.S. and are specifically downgraded to meet export restrictions. But if this sales channel returns, it could be a huge boost to AMD over the long run.\n\nWhile these are positive catalysts, are they enough to provide the 38% CAGR necessary to return 5 times in five years?\nAMD's guidance is slightly lower than a 38% CAGR Over the next five years, AMD believes it can deliver a 60% CAGR in its data center division. That clears the 38% threshold by a wide margin, but that's not the only part of AMD's business. AMD also has a consumer hardware and embedded processor division, and each of those is expected to grow at a 10% CAGR over the next five years. That brings AMD's total CAGR to 35%, slightly less than the 38% needed.\nHowever, revenue growth isn't the only thing the market looks at. If AMD can achieve outsized profit growth as well, it may be able to surpass the 38% CAGR in profit growth. After all, AMD's margins are far slimmer than Nvidia's.\nIf AMD can improve its profit margin to the 15% to 20% range, that will double the profits it generates from its revenue, providing another growth lever. If AMD can improve its margins and grow at the expected growth rate, I do not doubt that the stock could return 5 times in five years. If it does this, AMD will be a top stock to buy and hold.\n\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare?\n\nJordan Chussler, MarketBeat\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 1:45 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n688802.SS\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points After China-based GPU manufacturer MetaX recently debuted on the Shanghai market, the stock gained 700%.\nWith investors rotating out of U.S.-listed AI stocks, the news was reminiscent of January 2025’s DeepSeek market scare.\nBut NVIDIA’s central role in the AI landscape and its strategic partnerships with companies like OpenAI nearly assures its long-term success.\nInterested in NVIDIA Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nOn Dec. 17, news broke about China-based MetaX Integrated Circuits making its public debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and subsequently surging by around 700%.\nThe company—not to be confused with Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)—was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) executives and develops general-purpose graphics processing units, or GPUs, for applications in artificial intelligence.\n→ Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nBecause of the AI-focus of its microchips, the company has drawn comparisons to NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), the largest publicly traded company by market cap at $4.58 trillion.\nAs an increasing level of global competition comes to the forefront, should shareholders be concerned about threats to NVIDIA’s dominance?\n\n→ These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nMetaX Is the Latest Example of a DeepSeek Market Scare On Dec. 21, CNBC reported that AI-linked IPOs in China are undergoing rapid growth, with some of the listings “delivering eye-popping gains.” One week before MetaX made its debut, another GPU designer—Moore Threads Technology—also had its IPO, with its shares gaining approximately 400% thereafter.\nAt the same time, investors continued to rotate out of U.S.-listed tech stocks as concerns about elevated valuations, market concentration, and the specter of an AI bubble looms over the S&P 500.\n\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nThe MetaX news accelerated selling of NVDA, which, after hitting its all-time high in late October 2025, had fallen by more than 17% by Dec. 17 before finding its footing.\nFor analysts and pundits, there was no shortage of correlations being drawn between MetaX’s market disruption and the one investors grappled with on Jan. 27, 2025, when news of DeepSeek—a generative AI company based in China—would present an alternative to OpenAI at comparatively attractive prices.\nIn turn, a majority of large and mega-cap U.S. equities with any exposure to AI underwent a short-term sell-off. Within days, hundreds of billions of dollars in Magnificent Seven market cap was wiped out.\n\nStory Continues\nBut it turned out that DeepSeek, despite its low-cost models that could run training models at a fraction of the compute power as OpenAI, was a flash in the pan. Numerous issues—from government censorship and a notable security breach to slowdowns in updates and uninspiring subsequent models—saw the company’s hype die down as quickly as it arrived.\n\nNow, nearly 12 months later, the market could be seeing another iteration of that with MetaX.\nWhy MetaX Isn’t the Market Threat It’s Made out to Be NVIDIA’s dominance in the broad AI landscape, and in the GPU industry in particular, is unquestioned. But importantly, when the market overreacts to newcomers—as it is prone to do—oftentimes the investors who panic-sell are the ones who suffer long term.\nOver the last three years, NVIDIA has delivered 11 earnings beats in the past 12 quarters. Over the same period, the company has beat on revenue estimates 12 out of 12 times.\n\nMetaX, on the other hand, continues to operate at a loss. Analysts have determined that the company’s technology lags that of mainstream competitors by two to three years.\nAdditionally, being based in China, the company relies heavily on domestic, state-sanctioned investments, which put into question the viability of its long-term success.\nCompounding matters, as CNBC reported, it isn’t easy for overseas investors to partake in these rallies. According to the outlet, “foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs.”\nFund manager Yang Tingwu of Tongheng Investment told Reuters that the surge in these China-based AI companies’ stock prices is very likely a run-up that will result in the markets “witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years.”\n\nNVIDIA and Its Shareholders Will Be Fine Meanwhile, NVIDIA is less than 9% removed from its all-time high, has gained nearly 1,352% over the past five years, and finds itself at the center of a circular financing network that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\nNVIDIA and its ilk are nearly cemented in strategic partnerships with other AI companies, including OpenAI—a role that the Santa Clara, Calif.-based fabless GPU company is unlikely to relinquish any time soon.\n\nThe stock maintains a consensus Buy rating based on 53 analysts that cover it, with its average 12-month price target of $262.14 representing potential upside of more than 39%.\nOver the past year, institutional owners have been pouring money into the company to the tune of $339.17 billion compared to outflows of $116.47 billion. Another strong indication of health is that current short interest stands at just 1.13% of the float.\nThe article \" Is MetaX a NVIDIA Threat—or Just Another DeepSeek Market Scare? \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal Is a Warning Shot to AI Rivals\n\nJeffrey Neal Johnson, MarketBeat\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 12:12 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points NVIDIA has solidified its leadership position by securing the industry's fastest inference technology to power real-time artificial intelligence applications.\nThe company used its substantial free cash flow to fund this strategic expansion while also returning capital to investors through a cash dividend.\nThis strategic move effectively neutralizes potential competition by integrating top engineering talent and proprietary technology into the NVIDIA ecosystem.\nInterested in NVIDIA Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nWhile the markets were quiet for the post-Christmas trading session, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) made a noise that will echo for years. The company announced a definitive agreement to pay approximately $20 billion in cash to license the technology and hire the core engineering team of AI chip startup Groq.\nThe timing of this announcement is poetic. On the very day NVIDIA is distributing its quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share to loyal shareholders, it is aggressively reinvesting its massive cash pile to secure its future dominance. The market reaction has been swift and bullish. NVIDIA shares climbed roughly 1.5% following the news, trading in the $188 to $191 range. This move pushes the company’s market capitalization firmly past the $4.6 trillion milestone.\n\n→ Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nWall Street’s reaction reflects a clear consensus: this is not just a purchase; it is a fortification. By securing the fastest chip technology in the market, NVIDIA is widening its competitive moat against rivals like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD). This deal helps ensure that NVIDIA remains the only game in town for the next phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\nHow Groq Solves NVIDIA’s Speed Limit To understand why NVIDIA would spend $20 billion on a startup, investors must first understand how the AI market changed in 2025. For the last three years, the industry focused on Training. This is the process of teaching an AI model, which requires massive amounts of raw computing power to crunch data. NVIDIA’s Blackwell and Hopper GPUs were perfect for this heavy lifting.\n\n→ These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nHowever, late in 2025, the market reached a tipping point known as the Inference Flip. Global revenue from using AI models (Inference) officially surpassed the revenue from building them (Training). While training is a one-time event, inference is a continuous, 24/7 utility, much like electricity. Every time a user asks a chatbot a question or a robot moves, that is an inference event.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Speed Problem As AI moves into real-time applications like voice assistants and humanoid robotics, speed becomes the critical metric. This created a vulnerability for NVIDIA because its chips were designed for size rather than speed.\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nThe Freight Train: NVIDIA’s GPUs are like massive freight trains. They have an incredible capacity to haul data, but they take time to get up to speed. They are optimized for throughput (volume), not instant speed.\nThe Formula 1 Car: Groq’s technology, known as the Language Processing Unit (LPU), is built differently. It is like a Formula 1 car, lightweight and capable of instant acceleration.\n\nThe Benchmark Gap Data shows that Groq’s LPUs can process between 300 and 500 tokens per second on standard models like Llama 2. In comparison, a standard GPU setup typically manages around 100 tokens per second. By absorbing this technology, NVIDIA ensures it owns the fastest solution for the fastest-growing segment of the market. This also addresses a total cost of ownership risk; because Groq chips are faster, they use less energy per task, which appeals to cost-conscious data centers.\n\nThe Smartest Deal in Tech: How NVIDIA Avoided the FTC In today's strict regulatory environment, a standard merger between a $4.6 trillion giant and a rising competitor would likely be blocked by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Regulators are wary of monopolies buying up their rivals. NVIDIA’s management navigated this risk by structuring the deal as a reverse acqui-hire and a non-exclusive licensing agreement rather than a traditional corporate acquisition.\n\nHow the Deal Works: Licensing: NVIDIA pays for the right to use Groq’s intellectual property in perpetuity, but Groq retains theoretical ownership.\nHiring: NVIDIA hires the majority of Groq’s engineering staff and leadership.\nIndependence: The Groq corporate entity technically remains independent, avoiding the mandatory antitrust waiting periods required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act.\n\nThis structure mirrors successful strategies recently employed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It allows NVIDIA to integrate the technology immediately without getting bogged down in 18 to 24 months of litigation. This speed of execution is a major bullish signal for the stock, as it prevents competitors from catching up while the deal is stuck in court.\nA Blow to Rivals Perhaps the most valuable asset in this deal is the human capital. NVIDIA has hired Jonathan Ross, the founder of Groq. Before starting Groq, Ross invented the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) at Google. By bringing Ross into the fold, NVIDIA has effectively neutralized a key competitor and deprived Google, its biggest rival in custom silicon, of the talent that built its foundation.\n\nThe Buy vs. Build Calculation: Why This Deal Was Cheap A $20 billion price tag is massive for most companies, but for NVIDIA, it represents a highly efficient use of capital. Investors should view this through the lens of buy vs. build. Could NVIDIA have built this technology itself? Likely yes. But it would have taken three to four years of research and development. In the fast-moving world of AI, three years is an eternity. By spending cash now, NVIDIA buys time.\n\nBy the Numbers: Free Cash Flow: In the third quarter alone, NVIDIA generated $22.1 billion in free cash flow. Effectively, the company paid for this entire strategic expansion with just three months of cash generation.\nShareholder Rewards: As a testament to this financial strength, NVIDIA is paying out its quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share today , Dec. 26. This proves that the company can fund massive growth while rewarding shareholders simultaneously.\n\nValuation Perspective Despite the stock trading near all-time highs, analysts argue that the valuation is reasonable given the growth potential. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 23x. This is significantly lower than its trailing P/E of around 52x, suggesting that earnings are growing fast enough to justify NVIDIA’s current stock price. By securing the Groq technology, NVIDIA protects these future earnings from competitive erosion.\n\nNVIDIA’s Evolution Into the OS of AI This transaction serves as a powerful reminder that NVIDIA is evolving. It is no longer just a hardware vendor; it is becoming the inevitable operating system for the entire AI economy.\nLooking ahead, investors can expect NVIDIA to integrate Groq’s low-latency technology into its upcoming Rubin architecture and its robotics initiative, Project GR00T . With fourth-quarter r evenue guidance projected at $65 billion , the company’s fundamentals remain flawless. This deal silences the bear case that competitors would eventually catch up in speed. For investors, the thesis remains intact: NVIDIA is building the foundation for the future of artificial intelligence.\nThe article \" NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal Is a Warning Shot to AI Rivals \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Advanced Micro (AMD) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nInvestors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAdvanced Micro currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.61, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 44 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.61 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 44 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 65.9% and 6.8% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMD Check price target & stock forecast for Advanced Micro here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying Advanced Micro, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1--5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nStory Continues\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs AMD a Good Investment? Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Advanced Micro, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.96.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Advanced Micro.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nJordan Rosenfeld\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is not just infiltrating everyday lives; it has been the driving force behind stock market gains for the past two years. From chipmakers to software, anything tied to AI has surged. But investors are starting to wonder what happens if the momentum slows and the market decides AI valuations have gone too far. While no one can predict the future, I asked ChatGPT to look more deeply into the history of stock market bubbles and what might happen if the AI bubble were to burst.\n\nHere are its predictions.\nA Sharp Repricing of AI Stocks A correction in AI stocks would not just be another bad day for tech, ChatGPT warned. Because a handful of companies, including Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, now make up such a large percentage of the S&P 500, their movements shape the entire market.\nIf the market decides these large AI players are overvalued, those big company stocks will be the first to see a rapid decline as well as any company heavily tied to AI infrastructure, ChatGPT said.\n\nBecause these companies now make up a huge share of the market, a correction in even a handful of them could lead to a fall in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. This could lead to an environment similar to the dot-com bubble burst of the early 2000s.\nLearn More: I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Middle Class\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nA Broader Market Correction If the AI market trend reverses, the entire stock market index would likely follow, ChatGPT said. We could be looking at a broad correction of 10% to 20% if sentiment turns and investors begin to question AI revenue projections.\nNot all sectors would be hit equally, however. What tends to happen during sector slowdowns is that investors rotate their money into other areas like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples, ChatGPT noted. That means companies with steady earnings and predictable cash flows tend to look attractive. Thus, investors with diversified portfolios would be less affected than those concentrated in a single theme.\n\nStartup Valuations Could Cool Fast The ripple effects of an AI market correction would also have an impact on startups. Venture funding has been pouring into AI startups with the assumption that adoption will keep accelerating, ChatGPT said. If the market “gets skittish,” these valuations could fall as quickly as public tech stocks. That means less hiring, more consolidation and a good chance that many AI startups might fail.\n\nStory Continues\nLarger companies with strong balance sheets would likely scoop up talent or intellectual property, however, again similar to what happened after the dot-com bust. For workers and entrepreneurs, this could hit hard.\nWill an Economic Crisis Be Coming? The good news for investors is that a complete collapse similar to 2000 or 2008 is much less likely. Many AI companies today generate revenue that’s grounded in other profitable business products or services outside of AI. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon have the funds and the services to withstand a downturn . In the dot-com era, many companies going public had no profits or even customers. ChatGPT said “the fundamentals today are stronger.”\n\nHow Likely Is an AI Bubble To Burst? While an economic crisis is not likely coming, a sharp correction in AI stocks is more likely than not, ChatGPT said. It pointed out that “high-growth sectors tend to overshoot,” and the enthusiasm around AI has created valuations that may be more speculative than accurate in certain areas. A moderate pullback of 15% to 30% in leading AI names would not be surprising.\n\nIt did say that a complete bubble collapse is less likely, however. AI already has real commercial value, and early gains are showing up across industries. Just like the early days of the smartphone, there may be volatility, but the long-term trajectory remains positive.\nWhat Investors Should Focus On Now Everyday investors should expect volatility. The smartest bet is to keep a diversified portfolio , balanced allocation and long-term time horizon to have the best protections.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n10 Kirkland Products Costco Quietly Raised Prices on -- and Where To Buy Instead\n5 Reliable Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Winter 2025\n9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump, giving Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin, Reuters\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:03 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 a.m. Pacific Time on Aug. 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia, AMD, OpenAI, Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\n\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThe transition to Tan comes as Intel is in the middle of an announced $28 billion project to construct microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany . While the factories were originally slated to begin operations this year, that has been delayed to 2030 at the earliest as Intel seeks buyers for the chips those factories are to produce .\n\nStory Continues\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 minutes in the Oval Office Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms - Walden International and Walden Catalyst - did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies, including coming to Intel's formal groundbreaking ceremony in Licking County in 2022 .\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nIntel's venture capitalist CEO Born in Malaysia to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger , and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA 'lifeline' for Intel So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Is AMD’s Soaring AI Fueled Share Price Still Justified in 2025?\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:32 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nIf you are wondering whether Advanced Micro Devices at around $215 a share is still a smart buy or if the big gains are largely behind it, you are not alone. This is exactly the question we are going to unpack.\nThe stock is up 8.5% over the last week and 78.3% year to date, building on a 70.3% gain over the past year and a 243.7% return over three years that has reset expectations and risk perceptions for investors.\nRecent headlines have focused on AMD expanding its presence in artificial intelligence and data center chips, including aggressive pushes to challenge Nvidia in AI accelerators and deepen partnerships with major cloud providers. At the same time, ongoing coverage around chip supply chains, US semiconductor policy, and competitive dynamics in GPUs and CPUs has kept AMD firmly in the spotlight and helped fuel the latest moves.\nOn our checklist of undervaluation signals, AMD currently scores a 3/6 valuation score . This means half of the tests suggest the market may be underpricing some aspects of its fundamentals. Next we will break down how different valuation methods look at those signals before circling back to a more nuanced way of thinking about what AMD is really worth.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices delivered 70.3% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Semiconductor industry.\nApproach 1: Advanced Micro Devices Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth today by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and then discounting those amounts back to a present value.\nFor Advanced Micro Devices, the latest twelve month free cash flow is about $5.6 billion. Analysts see that rising sharply, with projections stepping up to roughly $7.2 billion in 2026 and $12.4 billion in 2027, before extrapolated estimates climb further to around $27.9 billion by 2029 and over $59 billion by 2035. Simply Wall St uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, combining these analyst forecasts with longer term growth assumptions to map out the next decade of cash flows.\n\nWhen those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of roughly $302 per share. Compared with a current price near $215, this implies AMD trades at about a 28.8% discount to its DCF based fair value. This suggests potential upside if the projected cash flow path occurs as modeled.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Advanced Micro Devices is undervalued by 28.8%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 904 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\n\nStory Continues\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Advanced Micro Devices.\nApproach 2: Advanced Micro Devices Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like Advanced Micro Devices, the Price to Earnings ratio is a useful way to think about valuation because it directly links what investors pay for each share to the profits the business is currently generating. In general, faster growth and lower risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth and higher uncertainty should command a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nAMD currently trades at around 111.8x earnings, well above the broader semiconductor industry average of about 36.5x and also richer than its peer group average near 58.8x. Simply Wall St goes a step further with its Fair Ratio, an estimate of what a normal PE should be for AMD given its earnings growth outlook, profitability, size, industry and risk profile. For AMD, that Fair Ratio sits at roughly 64.8x, which is already demanding but still meaningfully below the current market multiple.\nThis suggests that, even after accounting for AMD short term growth potential and competitive position, the stock trades at a premium to what its fundamentals justify on an earnings basis.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1460 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Advanced Micro Devices Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple framework that lets you turn your view of Advanced Micro Devices into a clear story behind the numbers by connecting your assumptions about future revenue, earnings and margins to a specific fair value estimate.\n\nA Narrative starts with the company story you believe, links that story to a financial forecast, and then translates the forecast into a fair value you can compare with today’s share price to consider whether AMD looks like a buy, a hold, or a sell.\nOn Simply Wall St, Narratives are an easy, accessible tool inside the Community page, where millions of investors share different AMD outlooks that update automatically as new news, earnings and guidance come in, so the stories and the numbers stay current without you having to rebuild your model.\nFor example, one bullish AMD Narrative on the platform assumes rapid AI data center adoption and arrives at a fair value near $362 per share, while a more cautious Narrative, focused on export controls and margin pressure, lands closer to $137, showing how the same company can justify very different decisions depending on the story you believe.\n\nFor Advanced Micro Devices however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Advanced Micro Devices Narratives:\n🐂 Advanced Micro Devices Bull Case\nFair value estimate: $283.57 per share\nImplied undervaluation vs current price: 23.9%\nAssumed annual revenue growth: 34.73%\nFrames AMD as a long term AI and data center winner, with multiyear accelerator and CPU ramps driving sustained double digit revenue and margin expansion.\nBuilds in rising profitability, with margins moving above 20% as AI, data center, and adaptive computing scale, while operating leverage improves over time.\nSees recent AI supercomputer and hyperscaler agreements as catalysts that justify a premium multiple and a fair value well above the current share price.\n\n🐻 Advanced Micro Devices Bear Case\nFair value estimate: $193.68 per share\nImplied overvaluation vs current price: 11.0%\nAssumed annual revenue growth: 18.84%\nHighlights intense competition from Nvidia, Intel, ARM based designs, and custom silicon, which could limit AMD AI share gains and pressure pricing.\nStresses execution, supply chain, and geopolitical risks, including reliance on TSMC and export restrictions, as potential brakes on growth and margins.\nArgues that while AMD has strong long term AI and data center potential, today’s valuation already prices in much of that upside, leaving less room for error.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Advanced Micro Devices?

While Nvidia dominates the market for training AI models, it faces much more competition in inference, where traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices have aimed to challenge it as well as startups such as Groq and Cerebras Systems.\nNvidia has agreed to a \"non-exclusive\" license to Groq's technology, Groq said. It said its founder Jonathan Ross, who helped Google start its AI chip program, as well as Groq ⁠President Sunny Madra and other members of its ‌engineering team, will join Nvidia.\nA person close to Nvidia confirmed the licensing agreement.\nGroq did not disclose financial details of the deal. CNBC reported that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Groq for $20 billion in cash, but neither ‍Nvidia nor Groq commented on the report. Groq said in its blog post that it will continue to operate as an independent company with Simon Edwards as CEO and that its cloud business will continue operating.\n\nIn similar recent deals, Microsoft 's top AI executive came through a $650 million deal with a startup that ​was billed as a licensing fee, and Meta spent $15 billion to hire Scale AI's CEO without acquiring the entire firm. Amazon ‌hired away founders from Adept AI, and Nvidia did a similar deal this year. The deals have faced scrutiny by regulators, though none has yet been unwound.\n\"Antitrust would seem to be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive (even as Groq’s leadership and, we would presume, technical talent move over to Nvidia),\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday after Groq's announcement. And Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's \"relationship with the Trump administration appears among the strongest of ⁠the key US tech companies.\"\n\nGroq more than doubled its valuation to $6.9 billion from $2.8 ​billion in August last year, following a $750 million funding round in September.\nGroq is ​one of a number of upstarts that do not use external high-bandwidth memory chips, freeing them from the memory crunch affecting the global chip industry. The approach, which uses a form of on-chip memory called SRAM, helps ‍speed up interactions with chatbots and ⁠other AI models but also limits the size of the model that can be served.\n\nStory Continues\nGroq's primary rival in the approach is Cerebras Systems, which Reuters this month reported plans to go public as soon as next year. Groq and Cerebras have ⁠signed large deals in the Middle East.\nNvidia's Huang spent much of his biggest keynote speech of 2025 arguing that Nvidia would be able to maintain its lead as ‌AI markets shift from training to inference.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese ‌in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, Matthew Lewis and William Mallard)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "A Big China Catalyst Could Be Coming for AMD Stock in 2026. Should You Buy Shares Now?\n\nPathikrit Bose\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 11:42 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nBABA\n\nNVDA\n\nIt looks like after Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is next in line to rehash a deal to resume the sales of its chips to China. After CEO Lisa Su had a meeting with China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao in Beijing last week, reports have emerged that the country's tech giant Alibaba (BABA) is mulling ordering some of AMD's MI308 GPUs. According to this report, Alibaba could order between 40,000 and 50,000 of these GPUs. This could imply a revenue windfall in the range of $600 million to $1.25 billion for AMD.\n\nBut, before one jumps the gun over here, there are some unpleasant facts that one must consider. Firstly, though the U.S. has approved the sale of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, the Chinese regulators have not yet given their approval. So, the chances of AMD getting approval are also low at this point. Secondly, Alibaba is itself a chipmaker, although its chips are more of the ASIC kind rather than AMD's general-purpose chips. This means the latter has broader use cases than Alibaba's chips, which are optimized for its native cloud ecosystems and inference workloads.\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\n$800 for Tesla Stock Could Be Reality in 2026. Here’s Why.\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nHowever, amid this development, where does AMD stand as an investment option now? It should be pretty high. Let's find out why.\nAMD's Robust Financials With a market cap of about $350 billion, AMD seems like a minnow in front of its larger peer, Nvidia. However, on the basis of share price performance, the AMD stock, with a rally of nearly 78%, has outperformed Nvidia's uptick of 37.1% this year by a considerable margin. But AMD is not just a short-term phenomenon; the company has been growing its revenue and earnings at a healthy clip for a while now.\nAMD has strung together a good five-year run, pushing revenue and earnings higher at compound rates of 29.94% and 28.93%. Notably, the most recent quarter fit right into that pattern, coming in stronger than Wall Street figures.\nQ3 sales hit $9.25 billion, 36% above the year-earlier mark. The core data center segment reported sales of $4.3 billion, implying a 22% growth from last year. Client and gaming put up the biggest jump, however, rising 73% on an annual basis to $4 billion.\nMeanwhile, EPS moved up by 30% in the same period to $1.20, outpacing the $1.17 consensus and stretching the company's run of beats to four quarters straight.\n\nStory Continues\nCash flow stood out as well. Operating cash flow shot up to $1.8 billion, almost three times the $628 million posted in the same quarter last year. Overall, AMD wrapped up September with $4.81 billion in cash, easily topping the $873 million in short-term debt and $2.35 billion in longer-term debt.\nHowever, AMD continues to trade at heady valuations when compared to the industry averages. Its forward P/E, P/S, and P/CF of 54.21, 10.30, and 54.12 are all higher than the sector medians of 24.37, 3.40, and 20.36, respectively.\n\nOptimism Abounds Since my previous analysis on AMD, previewing the company's Financial Analyst Day event on Nov. 11, the company's stock is down 10.3%. However, the case for investing in it may have only gotten stronger amid all the ambitious targets the management aims to hit in the coming years. First up is CEO Lisa Su's assertion that the data center market is set to reach a trillion dollars by 2030, an increase from her earlier projection of a $500 billion market by 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, on a company-specific basis, AMD has targeted a revenue CAGR of >35%, operating margins of >35%, and an annual EPS of $20 in the next 3-5 years, with data center AI revenue exceeding 80% CAGR in the same period. The targets may seem a bit steep, but Lisa Su has walked the walk on many occasions for more than a decade now, with the share price jumping by more than 80 times in her tenure, creating enormous wealth for shareholders.\nMoreover, AMD's GPUs aren't the only thing picking up speed; the full stack around them is growing fast, heading toward complete rack-level setups like Helios, MI400, and MI450. Software is keeping pace, too, with ROCm 7 making it easier to move workloads between systems. Notably, the MI500 lineup is already slated for 2027, so the roadmap looks loaded for years.\n\nOutside pure accelerators, the upcoming “Venice” CPUs and AMD's networking gear open up fresh growth lanes inside data centers.\nIn the bigger picture, what really matters is how AMD has spread its bets across platforms. CPUs, GPUs, adaptive chips, and networking all connect like parts of one machine, where nothing stands alone. That setup cuts the risk from any single trend swinging and lets the company shift gears quickly as AI designs change.\nAnalyst Opinion on AMD Stock Thus, analysts have deemed the stock to be a consensus “Moderate Buy,” with a mean target price of $288.87. This indicates an upside potential of about 34.2% from current levels. Out of 43 analysts covering the stock, 28 have a “Strong Buy” rating, three have a “Moderate Buy” rating, and 12 have a “Hold” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Forget The Chips: Oracle Wins Phase 2 of AI\n\nJeffrey Neal Johnson, MarketBeat\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:35 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nNVDA\n\nOWL\n\nAMD\n\nKey Points Oracle is transitioning from legacy software to become the essential utility provider for running powerful artificial intelligence chips.\nThe acquisition of a stake in TikTok validates the sovereign cloud strategy by demonstrating that Oracle can meet the immense national security requirements.\nA massive backlog of signed contracts provides strong revenue visibility and supports the aggressive expansion of data center capacity to meet demand.\nInterested in Oracle Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nInvestors watched Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) surge to a closing price of $198.38 on Dec. 22, marking a gain of over 3% on heavy trading volume. While the broader technology sector has spent the last two years obsessing over which company manufactures the best artificial intelligence (AI) chips, the market is beginning to shift its focus.\nTwo developments—a massive U.S. joint venture and a critical infrastructure project in Michigan—suggest that the AI trade is moving into a new phase.\n→ Tesla Is Knocking on $500 Again—Here’s What It Means For January\nPhase one of the AI boom was about hardware procurement. During this time, companies spent billions buying processors from designers like NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). Phase two, however, is all about deployment.\n\nThese powerful chips require a place to live—massive, secure data centers with immense power capacity.\n→ Micron Just Changed the AI Cycle—and the Market Knows It\nBased on recent strategic moves, Oracle has emerged not as a competitor to the chipmakers but as the essential utility provider required to run them.\nFor investors, this distinction is critical: Oracle doesn't need to win the chip war; it just needs to rent the space where the winner lives.\n→ Why 2026 Could Be the Year D-Wave Breaks Out\nThe Infrastructure Engine: Building the AI Factory Oracle’s transition from a legacy software company to a cloud infrastructure giant is no longer a projection; it is evident in the hard numbers. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2026, the company reported growth metrics that outpaced many of its hyperscale competitors.\nCloud Infrastructure Growth: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenue grew by 68% year-over-year.\nAI Demand: Revenue specifically related to graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that power AI, jumped 177%.\nCapacity Delivery: The company delivered nearly 400 megawatts of capacity in the quarter to meet this surging demand.\n\nA key driver of this success is the company’s strategic pivot to Chip Neutrality. Oracle recently sold its stake in Ampere, a proprietary chipmaker, netting a $2.7 billion pre-tax gain. This move signals that Oracle is no longer interested in fighting a hardware war. Instead, it is deepening partnerships with Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) to become the most flexible distributor of computing power. By focusing on infrastructure rather than silicon, Oracle reduces manufacturing risk while still capturing the upside of the AI boom.\n\nStory Continues\nThis strategy faced a real-world test recently regarding a planned $10 billion AI supercluster in Michigan. Last week, financing partner Blue Owl Capital (NYSE: OWL) withdrew from the project, raising fears that Oracle might struggle to fund its ambitious buildout. However, on Dec. 22, Oracle confirmed that the project is proceeding \"on schedule,\" and the developer said it has chosen a new equity partner, though the firm was not named. This rapid resolution demonstrates that capital markets remain eager to fund Oracle's expansion, effectively removing an execution risk for the company.\n\nSecurity as a Strategy: Validating the Sovereign Cloud The most headline-grabbing news of the day is the confirmation of the TikTok U.S. joint venture. A consortium led by Oracle, Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX has agreed to acquire a 45% stake in TikTok’s U.S. operations. While the headlines focus on the app, the deal's details reveal a much bigger story for Oracle shareholders.\n\nThe deal structure breaks down as follows:\nOracle: 15% Ownership Stake.\nSilver Lake: 15% Ownership Stake.\nMGX: 15% Ownership Stake.\nOperational Role: Oracle will serve as the platform's exclusive cloud provider.\nFor investors, the value of this deal goes far beyond owning a piece of a popular social media app. This transaction validates Oracle’s Sovereign Cloud strategy. Sovereign cloud involves physically separating and ring-fencing data so that it remains within a specific national jurisdiction and adheres to strict security protocols.\nBy meeting the U.S. government's demanding national security requirements for TikTok, Oracle is demonstrating its capabilities to the rest of the market. If Oracle is trusted to secure the data for one of the most scrutinized apps in the world, it becomes a logical default choice for other highly regulated sectors. Industries such as defense, healthcare, and finance often cannot use public clouds due to privacy concerns. The TikTok deal acts as a proof of concept that Oracle can deliver the Sovereign AI security these industries require.\n\nRevenue Visibility: The $523 Billion Safety Net To support these massive contracts, Oracle is spending heavily. Capital expenditures (CapEx) hit $12 billion in the second quarter, and the company raised its full-year spending forecast by approximately $15 billion. Typically, such high spending might worry investors about cash flow and debt levels. However, this spending is backed by a massive safety net that changes the investment calculus.\n\nOracle reported Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) of $523.3 billion, an increase of 438% year-over-year.\nIn plain English, RPO represents a backlog of signed contracts that have not yet been fulfilled. Customers have already committed to paying this money; Oracle just needs to build the data centers to service them. This creates a unique dynamic for the stock:\nSuccess-Based Capital: Oracle is not building data centers on speculation or hype. It is deploying capital to fulfill invoices that are already waiting.\nRevenue Visibility: This level of backlog provides a floor for the stock price. Even if the economy slows, Oracle has half a trillion dollars' worth of work to do.\nFuture Growth: Management raised its fiscal year 2027 revenue outlook by roughly $4 billion, signaling that it expects to convert this backlog into cash faster than anticipated.\n\nThe Value Play in a Hype Market As the artificial intelligence market matures, capital is rotating. Investors are moving funds from companies that build the hardware to those that provide the critical infrastructure. Oracle successfully transitioned from a traditional database firm to a modern cloud leader, and the market is rewarding that shift.\n\nTrading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 37x, Oracle offers exposure to the AI sector at a valuation that is often more reasonable than pure-play hardware manufacturers.\nWith the TikTok deal securing a massive anchor tenant and the Michigan project back on track, the company has cleared significant hurdles that were previously holding the stock back.\nFurthermore, Oracle is looking ahead to Phase Three of AI: Reasoning.\nThe company recently launched its AI Data Platform, which allows customers to use models like GPT-5 to reason across data stored in Oracle and non-Oracle databases alike.\nAs the demand for data security and capacity increases, Oracle’s unique combination of physical infrastructure, sovereign security, and enterprise software positions it to capture long-term value.\nFor investors seeking the next logical step in the AI trade, Oracle presents a compelling case for growth, backed by hundreds of billions in committed revenue.\nThe article \" Forget The Chips: Oracle Wins Phase 2 of AI \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The leak, shared by YouTube channel RedGamingTec, suggests the chip will combine Intel CPUs with Nvidia RTX graphics in a single design.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nSerpent Lake is expected to pair Intel's upcoming Titan Lake CPU architecture with Nvidia's RTX Rubin graphics, manufactured on TSMC's 3-nanometer process. The chip is reportedly aimed at competing with AMD's Strix Halo by delivering stronger graphics performance in high-end laptops.\nOne notable feature is memory bandwidth. The design is said to support up to 16 channels of LPDDR6 memory, a move intended to avoid bottlenecks that have limited graphics performance in competing processors.\nThe leak appears to offer the first real glimpse of what Intel and Nvidia's $5 billion partnership could produce. While Intel says it remains committed to its own Arc graphics roadmap, Serpent Lake points to deeper collaboration between the two companies, with a potential launch in late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Intel Rides on Strong Gross Margin Expansion: Will it Sustain?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:14 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nAMD\n\nNVDA\n\nASUUY\n\n2353.TW\n\nIntel Corporation INTC reported a non-GAAP gross profit of $5.45 billion during the third quarter of 2025, up from $2.39 billion a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin improves to 40% from 18% a year ago. The figure exceeded management guidance by 4%. The uptick was driven by multiple factors such as higher revenues, a favorable product mix and lower inventory reserves.\n\nIt is witnessing solid traction in the Client Computing Group. In the third quarter, the company reported revenues of $8.53 billion from this segment, up from $8.16 billion in the year-ago quarter. A rebounding PC market backed by growing adoption of Windows 11 PCs is a major growth driver.\n\nMoreover, it has also gained solid market traction in the growing AI PC market. Major PC manufacturers such as HP, Dell, ASUS, Acer and Samsung are collaborating with Intel to develop next-gen AI PCs. This is driving growth in the Client Computing Group and boosting gross margin.\n\nIntel has made significant developments in its cost discipline initiatives and streamlined its portfolio to enhance efficiency across its operations. In the third quarter, the company’s cost of sales decreased to $8.43 billion, down from $11.28 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring? Intel faces competition from Advanced Micro Devices AMD and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA in the semiconductor space. In the third quarter, AMD reported a non-GAAP gross profit of $4.99 billion, up from $3.65 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 54%, up 40 basis points year over year, while it improved from 43.3% reported in Q2. Revenue growth and a healthy product mix are propelling the gross margin.\n\nNVIDIA reported a Non-GAAP gross profit of $41.9 billion, up from $26.3 billion a year ago, with respective margins of 73.6% and 75%. The ongoing transition from offering Hopper HGX systems to Blackwell full-scale data center solutions is affecting gross margin. Sequentially, NVIDIA’s non-GAAP gross margin improved 90 basis points as Blackwell ramped with an improved mix and cost structure.\n\nINTC’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Intel has rallied 78.2% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 28.5%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/book ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 1.48 book value, lower than 32.65 of the industry average.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 13.33% to 34 cents, while those for 2026 have declined 9.38% to 58 cents over the past 58 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory Continues\nIntel stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Micron Technology and BigBear.ai\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:42 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nBBAI\n\nMU\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 24, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Intel Corp. INTC, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nForget NVIDIA: 2 AI Stocks Crushing It in 2025 with More Upside Ahead Shares of the most sought-after tech stock on Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp. , have surged 36.6% this year amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ongoing demand for NVIDIA's CUDA software platform, along with its competitive advantage in the AI hardware market, fueled growth. Demand for NVIDIA's Blackwell chips remains strong, and the company plans to ship H200 AI chips to China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nHowever, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions remain a risk and could pose a meaningful threat to NVIDIA's future growth trajectory. NVIDIA also faces intensifying competition from rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . and Intel Corp. , as data center capital expenditures continue to rise.\nTherefore, investors may look beyond NVIDIA at stocks that have outperformed it this year and still offer upside as the AI boom continues. Notable among them are Micron Technology, Inc . and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc . whose shares have gained 228.8% and 43.6%, respectively, this year. Let's take a closer look at why these stocks are compelling buys.\nReasons to Be Bullish on Micron Strong demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips is expected to help the company deliver strong quarterly results. These chips have the inherent capacity to reduce power consumption and process large volumes of data. With AI infrastructure rapidly expanding, demand for HBM chips has accelerated.\n\nBanking on rising AI-led demand for HBM chips, Micron expects its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $13.64 billion for the fiscal first quarter, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Analysts had projected revenues of around $12.88 billion.\nMicron expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter, with its cloud memory business unit expected to perform particularly well. Micron's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a solid 23.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nReasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai BigBear.ai's shares were adversely impacted at the beginning of the year due to the Trump administration's move to curb federal spending. Reduced funding may have affected BigBear.ai's sales, but its top-line performance is expected to improve going forward, supported by the definitive $250 million agreement to acquire Ask Sage.\n\nAsk Sage is a fast-growing generative AI platform that has seen broad adoption, with users including the U.S. Space Force and the Defense Health Agency. It is designed for secure AI deployment in restricted fields such as defense and national security, according to ir.bigbear.ai. Ask Sage serves 100,000 users across 16,000 government teams, and with its acquisition, BigBear.ai expects full-year sales to reach $125 million to $140 million.\nMoreover, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" could drive future growth for BigBear.ai, while the company's robust cash position provides ample resources to support its expansion. The company reached a significant milestone toward profitability in the third quarter, and its expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a stellar 73.1%.\n\nWhile BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Big Winners Again in 2026\n\nBeth McKenna, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock is a top buy for tech investors, as the company's AI-enabling GPUs are largely powering the AI revolution.\nBroadcom stock is a top buy, thanks largely to the strong demand for the company's custom AI chips.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing stock is a top buy because the world's largest chip foundry is profiting significantly from the powerful demand for AI chips, both GPUs and custom chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks, as a group, have been among the best-performing groups in 2025, just as they were in 2024.\nThree AI stocks that were big winners in 2025, as of Dec. 23, and that I believe will be big winners again in 2026, are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , or TSM (NYSE: TSM) .\n3 Top AI stocks to buy for 2026 Stocks are listed in order of 5-year return.\nCompany\nMarket Cap\nForward P/E\nWall Street's Estimated Annualized 5-Year EPS Growth\nYear-to-Date 2025 Stock Return\n5-Year Stock Return\nNvidia\n$4.8 trillion\n24.0\n48.5%\n40.9%\n1,359%\nBroadcom\n$1.7 trillion\n34.4\n35.9%\n52%\n813%\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n$1.2 trillion\n24.5\n30.4%\n52.4%\n211%\nS&P 500 Index\n--\n--\n--\n19%\n102%\n\nData sources: Yahoo! Finance and YCharts. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio . EPS = earnings per share. Data as of Dec. 23, 2025.\nNvidia: The dominant maker of AI chips and related tech Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), its flagship semiconductors, are considered the gold standard for training artificial intelligence (AI) models and deploying AI applications.\nThe company's data center platform had been performing well for quite some time. But demand began skyrocketing for its AI-enabling products -- its GPUs and high-performance networking products -- soon after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. This event demonstrated to company leaders and the general public the phenomenal capabilities of generative AI.\n\nIn late October at the company's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, D.C., CEO Jensen Huang said that management has \"visibility\" into $500 billion of demand for its key data center technology over the next five quarters . This demand of $100 billion per quarter, on average, is truly mind-blowing. As context, in its fiscal third quarter (ended late October), Nvidia's total revenue was $57.0 billion, of which $51.2 billion was from the data center platform.\nBroadcom: The leading maker of custom AI chips Broadcom develops semiconductors for various end markets and also develops infrastructure software.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's robust growth is being drven by strong demand for its custom AI-enabling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and Ethernet networking products, both for data centers. Its acquisition of software maker VMware in late 2023 is proving to be a shrewd move, as this business is also growing nicely.\n\nBroadcom is the top partner for big tech companies seeking custom ASICs. As the name suggests, these chips are designed for specific applications. These include internal uses and, in some cases, for availability in their cloud computing services. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs can be considered more general-purpose AI chips. There is a need for both GPUs and ASICs, so investors shouldn't be concerned that one of these types of chips will fully win out over the other.\nTSM: The world's largest chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest chip foundry. That means it produces chips of various types for companies that contract out all or some of the manufacturing of chips they design.\nTSM is the largest producer of AI chips worldwide, which has led to significant financial growth in recent years, driven by surging demand for these chips.\n\nTSM's customers include nearly every major chip company, such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which is Nvidia's main rival in the AI-enabling GPU market. Moreover, it also manufactures chips, including AI chips, for major tech companies that have designed their own chips. This includes Apple , widely considered the company's largest customer, though some Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to soon overtake Apple as TSM's top customer.\nAn added benefit for some investors is that TSM pays a decent dividend for a tech company. The dividend yield was 1.13%, as of the close of the market on Dec. 23.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\n\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\n\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory Continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE\nBefore heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms -- Walden International and Walden Catalyst -- did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO\nBorn in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\n\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\n\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\n\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\n\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL\nSo far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\n\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Forget NVDA: 2 AI Stocks Crushing it in 2025 With More Upside Ahead\n\nTirthankar Chakraborty\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:05 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nMU\n\nBBAI\n\nShares of the most sought-after tech stock on Wall Street, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, have surged 36.6% this year amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ongoing demand for NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform, along with its competitive advantage in the AI hardware market, fueled growth. Demand for NVIDIA’s Blackwell chips remains strong, and the company plans to ship H200 AI chips to China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nHowever, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions remain a risk and could pose a meaningful threat to NVIDIA’s future growth trajectory. NVIDIA also faces intensifying competition from rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . AMD and Intel Corporation INTC, as data center capital expenditures continue to rise.\nTherefore, investors may look beyond NVIDIA at stocks that have outperformed it this year and still offer upside as the AI boom continues. Notable among them are Micron Technology, Inc . MU and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc . BBAI, whose shares have gained 228.8% and 43.6%, respectively, this year. Let’s take a closer look at why these stocks are compelling buys.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nReasons to Be Bullish on Micron Strong demand for Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips is expected to help the company deliver strong quarterly results. These chips have the inherent capacity to reduce power consumption and process large volumes of data. With AI infrastructure rapidly expanding, demand for HBM chips has accelerated.\n\nBanking on rising AI-led demand for HBM chips, Micron expects its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $13.64 billion for the fiscal first quarter, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Analysts had projected revenues of around $12.88 billion.\nMicron expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter, with its cloud memory business unit expected to perform particularly well. Micron’s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a solid 23.5%.\nReasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai BigBear.ai’s shares were adversely impacted at the beginning of the year due to the Trump administration’s move to curb federal spending. Reduced funding may have affected BigBear.ai’s sales, but its top-line performance is expected to improve going forward, supported by the definitive $250 million agreement to acquire Ask Sage.\n\nAsk Sage is a fast-growing generative AI platform that has seen broad adoption, with users including the U.S. Space Force and the Defense Health Agency. It is designed for secure AI deployment in restricted fields such as defense and national security, according to ir.bigbear.ai. Ask Sage serves 100,000 users across 16,000 government teams, and with its acquisition, BigBear.ai expects full-year sales to reach $125 million to $140 million.\n\nStory Continues\nMoreover, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” could drive future growth for BigBear.ai, while the company’s robust cash position provides ample resources to support its expansion. The company reached a significant milestone toward profitability in the third quarter, and its expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a stellar 73.1%.\n\nWhile BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "What Is One of the Best Chip Stocks to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nDavid Moadel\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:26 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nBABAF\n\nBABA\n\nNVDA\n\nQuick Read Alibaba (BABA) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) MI308 AI accelerators.\nAMD stock looks compelling as Advanced Micro Devices recently demonstrated 35.6% year-over-year revenue growth and 61.2% income growth.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nOver the next decade, you'll surely want to own at least one artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock. You might assume that all you need is NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) stock and nothing else. However, even though NVIDIA is the market's darling, your best pick could actually be Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) stock.\nEven though it's a giant company, Advanced Micro Devices is an underdog in some respects. Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn't a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks.\nThis isn't to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we'll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential.\n\nIssues With AMD Stock One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn't pay a dividend. Consequently, you'll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit.\nMeanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices' valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x .\n\nIn addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock's price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices.\nThose are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here.\nBesides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don't have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let's perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices' financial health.\nBooming Sales, Zooming Profits Advanced Micro Devices' high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you'll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don't own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years.\n\nStory Continues\nAll in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company's results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025.\nImpressively, Advanced Micro Devices' net revenue grew 35.6% year over year, from $6.819 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $9.246 billion. Nearly half of that revenue stemmed from Advanced Micro Devices' Data Center segment; this suggests that the company continues to benefit from AI-associated sales.\n\nTurning to the bottom-line results, Advanced Micro Devices' net income surged 61.2%, from $771 in the year-earlier quarter to $1.243 billion. Also during that time frame, the company's cash and cash equivalents increased 27%, from $3.787 billion to $4.808 billion. So evidently, Advanced Micro Devices remains a cash-rich chipmaker that's on a powerful growth trajectory.\nMaking Headway in China While U.S. chip sales are crucial to Advanced Micro Devices' business model, it definitely appears that the company is making headway in China's chip market. To be more specific, Alibaba ( NASDAQ:BABA ) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices' MI308 AI accelerators.\n\nThis is important because investors need to think globally, not just locally, over the next 10 years. China is a major chip market, and Advanced Micro Devices has a long-term growth opportunity there.\nAdvanced Micro Devices made a savvy move in designing its MI308 chips to be compatible with export restrictions. Furthermore, the company has secured export licenses for these chips and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. on approved sales in China.\nAlso, it's a positive sign that Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently met with Chinese Commerce ​Minister Wang ‌Wentao in Beijing. They \"exchanged views on the company's business ⁠development in ​China and ​strengthening cooperation with China,\" according to the ‍ministry.\n\nSure, NVIDIA is also making headway into China's chip market. At the same time, however, NVDA stock may have already priced in the company's progress in this region.\nIn contrast, Advanced Micro Devices' growth story in China is still developing and the market needs time to recognize this. Give it a few years, and you should see AMD stock reflect strong chip sales in both the U.S. and China.\nGive AMD Stock a Chance In the final analysis, there's no need to overload your portfolio with AMD stock. Just holding a moderately sized share position for 10 years will, most likely, put you in a profitable position without undue risk.\nWhile Advanced Micro Devices doesn't pay a dividend and appears overvalued at first glance, I still encourage you to give the company a chance. If AI chip sales remain strong and Advanced Micro Devices keeps on growing its sales and profits, there's an attractive reward-to-risk profile here for buy-and-hold investors.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "CLS Rides on Steady Revenue Growth: Will the Uptrend Persist?\n\nAritra Chatterjee\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:55 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: CLS\n\nJBL\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nCelestica, Inc. CLS reported quarterly revenues of $3.19 billion, up 27.8% year over year. The figure exceeded management’s guidance of $2.875 billion to $3.125 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $170 million. The growth was driven by multiple factors.\n\nThe company boasts a robust portfolio of enterprise-level data communications and information processing infrastructure products, such as routers, switches, data center interconnects, edge solutions and servers. Such a comprehensive product suite, combined with a strong focus on innovation, is allowing Celestica to tap into the expanding AI infrastructure market. The company is actively collaborating with other industry leaders such as AMD and Broadcom to further augment its portfolio offerings.\n\nDuring the third quarter, net sales from the company’s Connectivity and Cable Solution portfolio surged 43.2% year over year to $2.41 billion. The growth was primarily driven by healthy demand for 800G and 400G switching products in the data center networking vertical.\n\nPer a report from Grand View Research, the global data center networking market is valued at $38.49 billion in 2024. The market is projected to witness a 17.2% compound annual growth rate from 2025 to 2033. This presents a solid growth opportunity for Celestica. Management is bullish about its revenue growth outlook. The company expects to generate revenue between $3.325-$3.575 billion, indicating 36% year over year growth backed by continuous momentum in the data center market.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring? Celestica faces competition from Jabil, Inc. JBL and Flex Ltd . FLEX in the Electronics Manufacturing Services industry. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Jabil reported revenues of $8.3 billion, up from $6.96 billion a year ago, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $227 million. The uptick was driven by healthy demand in the Capital Equipment and AI-related Cloud and Data Center Infrastructure verticals. Jabil is steadily expanding its portfolio offering to gain a competitive edge in the AI data center vertical.\n\nIn the September quarter, Flex generated $6.8 billion in revenues, up 4% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $142 million. The uptick was driven by strong data center growth in both the cloud and power end markets. Flex’s diversified portfolio, spanning multiple industries — from cloud infrastructure and AI data centers to automotive and healthcare — continues to be a key strength.\n\nCelestica's Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Celestica’s shares have soared 215.6% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 93.7%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, Celestica trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 37.68, up from the industry average of 24.13.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 6.3% to $5.90 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2026 have also increased 20.9% to $8.20.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCelestica currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

TSMC stood out again, growing revenue 41% from a year earlier and lifting its market share to 39%. The gains were fueled by a faster ramp in 3nm production and near-full utilization of 4nm and 5nm lines, largely tied to AI chip demand from Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), AMD ( NASDAQ:AMD ), and Broadcom.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with NVO.\nIs TSM fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nElsewhere, growth was far more muted. Non-TSMC foundries posted just 6% growth as tariff-related pull-forward orders faded, even with help from China's subsidies. Analysts say the next challenge is capacity, with advanced nodes and CoWoS packaging already running close to full. AI demand is still strong, but physical limits could start slowing growth as 2026 approaches.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What is the China upside potential for Nvidia and AMD?\n\nVahid Karaahmetovic\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 3:16 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nInvesting.com -- Recent reports around a potential resumption of GPU sales to China have reopened the debate over how much upside U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD could see if export approvals materialize.\nAccording to Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold, assessing the exact outcome is challenging as several moving parts remain. But in an optimistic scenario, Leopold estimates AMD could generate roughly $500 million to $800 million in incremental revenue, translating into about $0.10 to $0.20 of non-GAAP EPS upside.\n\nFor Nvidia, the potential is materially larger, with an estimated $7 billion to $12.5 billion in additional revenue, or about $0.15 to $0.30 of non-GAAP EPS upside in 2026.\n“Questions remain regarding whether the Chinese government will allow or discourage its cloud operators from purchasing advanced GPUs, as well as how the U.S. government’s export license fee will be accounted for,” Leopold wrote.\nFor AMD, market speculation has centered on China-compliant accelerator orders tied to Alibaba, with reports pointing to 40,000 to 50,000 MI308 units. At the midpoint, Leopold notes that “a $15,000 chip could equate to $675M in sales,” likely spread across multiple quarters.\nHowever, uncertainty remains around approval timing, ramp linearity and whether China enforces restrictions on American AI semiconductors.\n\nThe required 15% payment to the U.S. government introduces accounting complexity around pricing and accounting.\nWhile modest relative to AMD’s total revenue base, momentum could build as roadmap execution continues and China-compliant offerings gain traction, Leopold said.\nNvidia faces a similar dynamic, with speculation focused on a limited resumption of H200 GPU shipments to large Chinese hyperscalers and internet companies.\nEven modest volumes could be meaningful, as “tens of thousands of units” at estimated average selling prices (ASPs) of $20,000 to $25,000, and up to roughly 350,000 to 500,000 units over time, could drive billions of dollars in incremental revenue.\nLeopold stresses that China remains a relatively small part of Nvidia’s overall data center business, with growth primarily driven by U.S. hyperscalers, sovereign AI and enterprise customers as newer platforms ramp through 2026.\n\n“We continue to view AI infrastructure as a multi-trilliondollar opportunity over the next decade, with Nvidia well positioned to sustain industry-leading growth, margins, and dominant share in data center accelerators, and we reiterate our Strong Buy rating,” he wrote.\nRelated articles\nWhat is the China upside potential for Nvidia and AMD?\n\nStory Continues\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

On December 19, Truist reiterated the stock at “Buy” and raised its price target to $275 per share from $255. The firm revised price targets in the semiconductor and artificial intelligence group after establishing 2027 projections.\nWhile Truist acknowledges that there are challenges in finding power to run AI infrastructure and sourcing the funds, it believes AI infrastructure stocks remain cheap compared to their growth.\nThe firm also sees more upside pressure to estimates for the group compared to more diversified analog semis heading into 2026. Analysts also noted how AI capital expenditure upside will continue in 2026.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Right now, a potential Alibaba order for 40,000–50,000 MI308 accelerators is the key short term catalyst, while shifting export rules and China exposure remain the biggest risk.

      "Content": "Could AMD Finally Close the Gap on Nvidia AI Dominance?\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market.\nExisting infrastructure and software reinforce Nvidia's dominance.\nDespite competitive challenges, AMD has earned business from key clients.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nThroughout its history, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has developed a reputation for closing or at least reducing the competitive gap with rivals. This was true when it challenged Intel 's supremacy in prior decades and, more recently, its clashes with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\n\nThis includes its rivalry with Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, and its upcoming releases have captured the attention of industry analysts. The question for investors is whether it is on the verge of catching up to Nvidia and ending its dominance. The more likely outcome is that AMD will narrow but not close the gap, and here's why.\nThe state of the AI accelerator market Indeed, the semiconductor industry appeared caught off guard when it became clear that Nvidia's AI accelerators powered OpenAI's game-changing GPT-4 AI platform in 2023. Nvidia was so far ahead of rivals that even now, Nvidia holds an estimated 80% of this market, according to a Susquehanna analyst.\n\nMoreover, closing the gap hinges on more than just processing power. Nvidia has its CUDA software platform, which has an army of loyal developers. That makes switching away from that architecture difficult.\nAdditionally, Nvidia offers rack-scale solutions that integrate with both its accelerators and CUDA. That presents an additional challenge to prospective competitors.\nNvidia is also growing faster. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2026, Nvidia reported 62% revenue growth. Its data center segment, which designs the accelerators and constitutes 89% of Nvidia's revenue, increased revenue by 65% during the same period.\nAMD's overall growth is also impressive, but not as rapid in either respect. In the first nine months of 2025, AMD's revenue rose by 36% year over year. Also, its data center segment makes up 46% of overall revenue, and during the period, the segment's revenue rose by 29%, slower than the overall gain.\n\nAMD's efforts to strike back Nonetheless, as bleak as that sounds, AMD bulls should remember that that is only one quarter, and data center segment growth is likely to improve along with its technology.\nDespite lagging behind, AMD has made headway in this market. The company has built strategic partnerships with OpenAI and Meta Platforms , and its accelerators support clouds for Microsoft 's Azure and Oracle 's Oracle Cloud. Moreover, Dell , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , and others have built servers with AMD's technology.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking forward, investors have focused on AMD's upcoming MI450 accelerator. The company has also claimed that the MI450 will surpass the performance of Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin accelerator.\nAdditionally, AMD relies on open-source software and can work with other tech ecosystems. That could wear away at Nvidia's software-driven competitive advantage as the industry grows.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia has struggled to keep up with demand, and AMD has traditionally sold its competing product at a lower cost. This gives companies all the more reason to consider AMD over Nvidia. Hence, if the MI450 can match or surpass the Vera Rubin, AMD could make significant competitive inroads.\nWill AMD close the gap with Nvidia? In the foreseeable future, investors should expect AMD to reduce but not completely close the competitive gap with Nvidia.\nIndeed, AMD has made significant efforts to catch up and has won business from several high-profile customers. If the MI450 matches or exceeds expectations, it could threaten AMD's dominance.\n\nUnfortunately for AMD, Nvidia is the established player in the AI accelerator market, and most companies are tied into its ecosystem. That means if AMD becomes the superior product, many of Nvidia's customers would likely be unable to switch to AMD without a tremendous disruption.\nUltimately, such conditions could be enough to stoke more rapid stock price increases for Advanced Micro Devices stock than Nvidia as the smaller company plays catch-up. However, investors should expect Nvidia to remain the leader in the AI accelerator industry for some time to come.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Advanced Micro Devices Could Score Major China Coup\n\nRich Duprey\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 9:16 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nBABAF\n\nBABA\n\nNVDA\n\nQuick Read Alibaba ( BABA ) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 MI308 AI accelerators from Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). The deal would generate hundreds of millions in revenue.\nAMD designed the MI308 to comply with U.S. export rules for China. AMD will pay a 15% fee to the U.S. government on approved sales.\nAMD excluded China revenue from recent guidance. A confirmed Alibaba order would likely trigger upward forecast revisions.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nFor more than two years, U.S. export restrictions have severely limited Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) and Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) from selling their most advanced artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators in China. The controls, progressively tightened by the federal government, aim to prevent Beijing from obtaining cutting-edge technology that could advance military or strategic AI capabilities. As a result, both companies have one of the world’s largest AI markets all but closed off to them.\nChina once accounted for a significant portion of their data-center revenue, but the restrictions have led to lost sales, inventory write-downs, and a material hit to growth expectations. Recent policy changes, however, suggest the U.S. is willing to allow limited shipments of compliant chips, creating a potential opening for both firms.\n\nA Chance for a Massive Sales Coup This morning, the website MLex reported that Alibaba ( NYSE:BABA ) is considering a purchase of 40,000 to 50,000 MI308 AI accelerators from AMD. The MI308 is AMD’s China-specific AI chip, engineered to comply with current U.S. export rules while still offering substantial performance for large-scale AI training and inference workloads.\n\nAccording to the report, AMD has already secured some export licenses for the MI308 and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. government on approved sales to Chinese customers. The MI308 is reportedly nearing commercial availability in China, and other major Chinese cloud providers and internet companies are also evaluating the chip.\nWhat Such a Large Order Would Mean for AMD If the rumored order materializes at the reported scale, it would represent one of the largest single deals for AMD in the Chinese market since the export curbs began. A 40,000 to 50,000 unit purchase would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, depending on final pricing, and would validate the MI308 as a viable alternative to Nvidia offerings.\n\nStory Continues\nSuch a deal would also strengthen AMD’s position in China’s rapidly growing data-center and AI infrastructure sector, where domestic players like Huawei and Cambricon are trying to fill the void left by Western vendors. Importantly, AMD has not included any meaningful China revenue in its recent financial guidance, so a confirmed order of this size would likely trigger upward revisions to full-year forecasts and provide a visible catalyst for the stock.\n\nDespite the headline-grabbing report, Advanced Micro shares traded only modestly higher in morning trading. The limited price movement suggests investors are either skeptical of the rumor or view it as too preliminary to justify aggressive buying.\nMLex is currently the sole source reporting the specific Alibaba-MI308 figure, and neither AMD nor Alibaba has commented publicly on the matter.\nNvidia Also Preparing China Shipments At the same time, Nvidia is preparing to resume limited shipments of its H200 GPU to China, with initial deliveries of 5,000 to 10,000 modules -- the equivalent of 40,000 to 80,000 individual chips -- expected to begin in mid-February, according to separate reports. Like AMD, Nvidia has received U.S. export approvals for the China-compliant version of the H200, though final shipments still require Chinese regulatory clearance, which may include conditions such as bundling with domestic semiconductors.\n\nKey Takeaway Should the reported Alibaba purchase of 40,000 to 50,000 MI308 chips be confirmed, it would mark a major commercial and strategic victory for AMD in a market that has been closed to its high-end products. The revenue upside would be meaningful, and because neither AMD nor Nvidia has baked China sales into their current guidance, any real order flow could lead to substantial analyst upgrades and improved sentiment.\n\nThat said, the report remains unconfirmed and is based on a single source. Until official announcements or concrete evidence emerge, investors should not rush in to buy Advanced Micro Devices' stock solely on the strength of this rumor.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "TER vs. AMD: Which AI Component Supplier Stock Is the Better Buy?\n\nNilanshi Mukherjee\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:38 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nTER\n\nTeradyne TER and Advanced Micro Devices AMD are key suppliers of AI components in the semiconductor market. While TER supplies critical automated test equipment used to validate and ensure the performance of advanced AI chips, AMD designs high-performance CPUs and GPUs that power AI workloads in data centers and enterprise applications.\n\nPer the Fortune Business Insight report, the global semiconductor market size was valued at $681.05 billion in 2024. It is expected to reach $2,062.59 billion by 2032 from $755.28 billion in 2025, witnessing a CAGR of 15.4%. Both Teradyne and Advanced Micro Devices are expected to benefit from this rapid growth pace.\n\nSo, TER or AMD — Which of these AI Component Supplier Stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out.\n\nThe Case for TER Stock Teradyne is positioning itself as a key player in the AI-driven semiconductor testing market. In the third quarter of 2025, Semiconductor Test revenues rose 7% year over year and 23% sequentially, accounting for 78.8% of sales in the reported quarter.\n\nThe uptick can be attributed to strong AI-related demand, which is driving significant investments in cloud AI build-out as customers accelerate the production of a wide range of AI accelerators, networking, memory, and power devices. The company’s UltraFLEXplus system is specifically designed for high-performance processors and networking devices, which are critical for AI applications.\n\nTeradyne’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy, particularly through its focus on AI-driven technologies and semiconductor testing solutions. In October 2025, Teradyne announced the launch of the ETS-800 D20, the latest addition to the ETS-800 platform of high-performance test systems for power semiconductors.\n\nTeradyne is integrating AI features into its robotics products, such as UR cobots and AMRs, to enhance performance in AI-driven work cell applications. In the third quarter of 2025, 8% of robotics sales were for AI-related products, up from 6% in the previous quarter.\n\nThe Case for AMD Stock Advanced Micro Devices is positioning itself as a key player as an AI component supplier by focusing on expanding its data center AI business and delivering advanced AI solutions.\n\nThe company’s data center AI business is experiencing significant growth, driven by the ramp-up of its Instinct MI350 Series GPUs and the upcoming launch of the MI400 Series accelerators and Helios rack-scale solutions in 2026. These products are designed to deliver high performance and efficiency for AI training and inference workloads.\n\nIn December, AMD expanded its partnership with HPE to introduce the open, rack-scale “Helios” AI architecture. This new setup combines AMD GPUs, EPYC CPUs, ROCm software, and Broadcom-backed Ethernet networking. It aims to support next-generation global and European AI and HPC systems starting in 2026.\n\nThe company has also secured a multiyear agreement with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of Instinct GPUs, starting with MI450 Series accelerators in 2026. This partnership is expected to generate more than $100 billion in revenues in the coming years. AMD is also collaborating with Oracle, IBM, Cohere, and other major AI players for large-scale deployments.\n\nStory Continues\nPrice Performance and Valuation of TER and AMD In the trailing six-month period, TER and AMD shares have rallied 123.4% and 64.7%, respectively. Teradyne’s robust and diversified portfolio to meet the rising demand for AI-driven technologies is contributing to its growth prospects continuously, driving top-line growth.\n\nDespite AMD’s expanding portfolio and rich partner base, the company is facing stiff competition from NVIDIA and Intel.\n\nTER and AMD Stock Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation-wise, TER and AMD shares are currently overvalued as suggested by a Value Score of D and F, respectively.\n\nIn terms of forward 12-month Price/Sales, TER shares are trading at 8.26X, higher than AMD’s 8.12X.\nTER and AMD Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHow Do Earnings Estimates Compare for TER & AMD? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TER’s 2025 earnings is currently pegged at $3.51 per share, which has remained unchanged over the past 30 days, indicating a 9.01% year-over-year rise.\nTeradyne, Inc. Price and Consensus Teradyne, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Teradyne, Inc. Quote\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD’s 2025 earnings is currently pegged at $3.96 per share, which has declined by a penny over the past 30 days, indicating a 19.64% year-over-year rise.\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

      "Content": "Nvidia dominated the headlines in 2025 — these were its 15 biggest events of the year\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:01 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nSSNLF\n\n005380.KS\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nIt’s difficult to think of any single company that had a bigger impact on Wall Street and the AI trade in 2025 than Nvidia ( NVDA ).\nInvestors scrutinized CEO Jensen Huang’s every move, whether that was his meetings with President Trump or a night out with the heads of Samsung and Hyundai for fried chicken and beer.\n\nNvidia’s revenue soared in 2025, bringing in $187.1 billion, and its market capitalization continued to climb, briefly eclipsing the $5 trillion mark, before settling back in the $4 trillion range.\nThere were plenty of major highs and deep lows throughout the year, but these 15 were among the biggest moments of Nvidia’s 2025.\nJan. 6: CES 2025 Nvidia rang in the new year with a series of product announcements ranging from a new pint-sized AI chip to more powerful gaming cards at CES 2025. Huang’s keynote touched on an array of topics, including physical AI, otherwise known as robots; desktop-based AI systems; and a litany of AI software updates that set the stage for the company’s 2025.\n\nJan. 27: The DeepSeek moment Nvidia had an incredible year by seemingly every measure, but it started out with a shock. In January, DeepSeek released its R-1 model, which the company claimed it trained using less than state-of-the-art processors. That sent the AI trade into a meltdown, with the company shedding nearly $600 billion from its market cap in a single day.\nDespite the initial blowup, fears that AI companies would no longer need high-powered chips seem to have been overblown. That’s because training AI models and running them are two different operations, and according to Nvidia, running models with more powerful chips improves overall performance.\nMarkets eventually settled down as more companies agreed with the assumption, but Nvidia’s stock price didn’t return to pre-DeepSeek levels until June.\n\nMarch 18: Nvidia reveals Blackwell Ultra chips at GTC Nvidia’s annual GTC event, held in San Jose, used to be a moderately sized tech conference. But this year’s GTC was far different . Huang’s keynote filled the SAP Center, home of the San Jose Sharks hockey team, and Nvidia took over a large swath of downtown San Jose, which included an enormous collection of food tents and stalls that covered the 2.3-acre Plaza de César Chávez.\nDuring his speech, Huang debuted Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra chip, the successor to its Blackwell GPU, and the GB300 superchip, which combined two Blackwell GPUs and one of Nvidia’s Grace CPUs.\nThe CEO said the offerings were built for the age of “AI reasoning” and said models like DeepSeek’s R-1 would run far better on Nvidia’s latest and greatest.\n\nStory Continues\nApril 2: 'Liberation Day' Trump’s decision to implement a series of tariffs on countries and goods on April 2, which he called “Liberation Day,” sent the stock market into such a nosedive that the president had no choice but to walk some of them back just a week later.\nNvidia wasn’t immune to the drop. The company saw its stock price decline from $110 on April 2 to $94.31 on April 4. Shares returned to pre-\"Liberation Day\" numbers by April 9, but continued to waffle until breaking out of their slump on April 25.\nApril 15: H20 effectively banned Nvidia’s April didn’t get much better when the Trump administration implemented new chip restrictions that called for Nvidia to receive a license to ship the H20 chip to China , effectively banning sales of the processor to the country.\nNvidia designed the GPU to meet restrictions set up during President Joe Biden’s administration. Trump, however, blocked the China-specific chip on security grounds. The company ended up writing down $4.5 billion in charges related to the H20 in Q1 and took an additional $4 billion in Q2.\n\nJuly 9: Nvidia hits $4 trillion Despite taking a hit from the DeepSeek meltdown and Trump’s China ban, Nvidia stock continued to perform, and in July the company became the first to see its market capitalization pass the $4 trillion mark .\nNvidia topped $1 trillion in 2023 and took just three years to add another $3 trillion, thanks to its leadership position in the AI chip market.\nJuly 14: Nvidia can sell H20 in China again In July, the on-again-off-again relationship between Washington and China was back on, with Nvidia announcing that the Trump administration had assured the company that it would allow sales of H20 chips to China .\nHuang successfully made the case that America would benefit from selling its technologies to China and risked falling behind if it completely cut itself off from the market, convincing Trump to allow Nvidia to sell to the country again.\n\nAug. 11: Nvidia to pay 15% cut on China sales Although the White House assured Nvidia it would approve the sale of its chips to China, the administration later announced that it would take a 15% cut of the sales . The same rule applied to Nvidia rival AMD ( AMD ).\nDespite the potential revenue haircut, investors on Wall Street weren’t too bothered by the announcement, figuring that 85% of the revenue from sales to the country was better than the 0% Nvidia was bringing in before.\n\nSept. 22: Nvidia says it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI In September, Nvidia announced it would invest upward of $100 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI . The partnership would let OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) build out 10 gigawatts or more of data center capacity, allowing it to train and run its GPT models.\nNvidia’s deals have raised eyebrows among analysts who warn that such circular investments, where a company (Nvidia) invests in a customer (OpenAI) and uses that cash to purchase chips from the investor (Nvidia), artificially boost AI spending.\nNvidia has faced criticism for a similar deal with CoreWeave ( CRWV ). Nvidia invested in the company, which then turned around and bought Nvidia chips. Such deals have driven at least part of the discussion around an AI bubble.\n\nOct. 17: Nvidia’s first Blackwell chip built in US The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has made reshoring chip manufacturing a national imperative. And while Nvidia doesn’t build its own chips — it outsources that to TSMC — it did celebrate that company’s completion of the first Blackwell chip built in the US in October .\n\nOct. 29: Nvidia hits $5 trillion Nvidia’s market capitalization hit $5 trillion in late October , just a few months after crossing the $4 trillion mark.\nThe exuberance came as the company announced a number of new deals with companies like Uber at its first GTC event in Washington, D.C. It also followed word that Huang would meet with Trump in South Korea ahead of the president’s meeting with Xi Jinping to discuss a trade deal.\nThe hope was that Trump and Xi would reach an agreement to allow Nvidia to sell its chips in the country, but a deal never materialized.\n\nOct. 30: Viral fried chicken photo with leaders of Samsung and Hyundai Huang’s star exploded throughout 2025, so much so that in October, reporters and onlookers swarmed a South Korean fried chicken restaurant to catch a glimpse of him dining with the heads of Samsung and Hyundai. An image of the trio subsequently went viral .\nNov. 19: Nvidia to ship chips to the Middle East Nvidia received authorization to ship the equivalent of more than 60,000 Blackwell chips to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in November as the company continued to vie for the opportunity to sell its processors to a wider array of countries.\nThe company has pushed the concept of sovereign AI throughout 2025, saying that it allows countries around the world to get access to their own AI data centers without having to rely on other nations.\nBut China hawks said the move could give the US adversary access to Nvidia chips, due to that country’s close relationship with the UAE.\n\nNov. 25: Nvidia’s Google tweet Nvidia has faced threats from its own customers, including Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Amazon ( AMZN ), building their own chips to power their AI platforms, but in November, a report that Google could provide Meta ( META ) with its own tensor processing units (TPUs) for the social media giant’s data centers seemed to spook Nvidia.\n\nThe company sent out a viral tweet in response to the story, congratulating Google on its chips’ performance, but pointed out that its own GPUs were a generation ahead of Google’s and noted that it’s the only chip that can run all AI models .\nDec. 9.: Nvidia H200 approved for China After a year of will he, won’t he, Trump wrote in a post on the Truth Social platform that he was greenlighting the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China .

      "Content": "AI Chips Are Driving a Foundry Boom. Why TSMC Is Winning the Most\n\nNauman Khan\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:33 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nGlobal semiconductor foundry revenue rose about 17% year over year to roughly $84.8 billion in the third quarter of 2025, supported by strong demand for artificial intelligence chips built on advanced manufacturing nodes, according to a research note from Counterpoint Research.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( NYSE:TSM ) widened its lead, with market share edging up to about 72%. The gains followed higher output of its 3-nanometer process and solid utilization of 4- and 5-nanometer capacity, used heavily by AI accelerator customers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), and Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ).\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with INTC.\nIs INTC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTSMC's foundry revenue grew more than 40% from a year earlier, outpacing the broader market. Counterpoint said most rival foundries posted slower growth, with non-TSMC players collectively expanding revenue by about 6%, reflecting softer orders after earlier tariff-related demand but some support from China's subsidy programs.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts said capacity limits at advanced nodes and constraints in advanced chip packaging, known as CoWoS, may cap sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Full-year 2025 foundry revenue growth is estimated at around 15%.\nCounterpoint expects the pure-play foundry segment to grow at a faster pace, helped by continued shipments of AI GPUs and custom AI chips. Texas Instruments ( NASDAQ:TXN ), Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ), Infineon (IFNNY), and Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) maintained mid-single-digit market shares.\n\nCondizioni e Informativa sulla privacy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "If You Like AMD’s Future, AMDY Lets You Go Full Send With An Over 100% Distribution Yield\n\nMichael Williams\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:06 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nQuick Read AMDY’s 101.88% distribution rate comes from selling weekly AMD call options but caps upside to roughly 70% of AMD’s gains.\nAMD’s Q3 2025 revenue hit $9.25B (up 35.6% year-over-year) and a new OpenAI partnership targets over $100B in future revenue.\nThe distribution rate is unsustainable at current levels. The 30-day SEC yield of 1.15% offers a more realistic baseline.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF ( NYSEARCA:AMDY ) has captured investor attention with its extraordinary 101.88% distribution rate as of December 17, 2025. This isn't a traditional dividend ETF - AMDY generates income by selling weekly call options on Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) stock, collecting premiums from traders betting on AMD's price movements.\nHow AMDY Generates Its Extreme Yield AMDY employs a covered call strategy, selling short-term call options against synthetic AMD exposure. The fund's 101.88% distribution rate means investors theoretically receive more than their initial investment back annually through distributions. However, this assumes the most recent weekly distribution remains constant—a significant assumption given variable options premiums.\n\nThe fund's income depends entirely on AMD's volatility. With a beta of 1.93, AMD moves nearly twice as much as the broader market, creating rich options premiums. AMD's 52-week range of $76.48 to $267.08 illustrates this volatility—a 249% spread generating substantial options income. In 2025, AMD surged 76.7% through mid-December, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 16.13% gain. This explosive performance drove elevated options premiums enabling AMDY's triple-digit distribution rate.\n\nThe Critical Tradeoff: Income Versus Upside AMDY's strategy caps upside participation. While AMD gained 76.7% in 2025, AMDY delivered a 53.9% price return—capturing approximately 70% of AMD's appreciation. The fund sacrificed 23 percentage points of capital gains for its high distribution yield.\nMore concerning is downside risk. AMD currently trades at $213.43, down 20% from its 52-week high of $267.08. During this decline, options premiums compress, reducing AMDY's distribution potential. The fund offers no downside protection—if AMD falls 30%, AMDY's net asset value falls approximately 30%, and declining volatility simultaneously reduces income generation.\n\nStory Continues\nThis infographic details the YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (AMDY), explaining its covered call strategy, suitable use cases, and the associated pros and cons for investors.\n\nEvaluating AMD's Fundamental Strength AMD's business fundamentals support the bullish case underlying AMDY's strategy. Third quarter 2025 revenue reached $9.25 billion, up 35.6% year-over-year, with operating cash flow of $2.16 billion. The company maintains $4.81 billion in cash against $3.87 billion in debt. Management recently announced a multiyear partnership with OpenAI expected to generate over $100 billion in revenue.\n\nHowever, AMD's valuation leaves little room for disappointment. The stock trades at 112x trailing earnings, despite a more reasonable 35x forward multiple. Analysts maintain a consensus $282.82 price target, implying 32% upside—gains that AMDY holders would largely miss due to capped call positions. AMD pays no dividend, meaning AMDY's distributions come entirely from options premiums.\nDistribution Sustainability Assessment AMDY's 101.88% distribution rate is not sustainable in its current form. This figure represents an annualized rate based on a single week's distribution during elevated AMD volatility. As AMD's price stabilizes or declines, options premiums will compress, reducing weekly distributions significantly. The fund's 30-day SEC yield of just 1.15% provides a more conservative baseline.\n\nInvestors should expect substantial distribution variability. During periods when AMD trades sideways or declines, weekly distributions may fall 50% or more from current levels.\nAlternative: NVDY for Diversified Tech Exposure Investors seeking similar options-based income with different underlying exposure should consider the YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF ( NYSEARCA:NVDY ). This fund applies the same covered call strategy to NVIDIA stock. NVDY offers exposure to a different segment of the AI semiconductor market, currently yielding approximately 80% through its options premium strategy. Like AMDY, NVDY caps upside potential while maintaining full downside exposure.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

However, if it can break above that, which could happen today, we’d like to see NVDA retest $200 next.\nPlus, despite AI bubble fears, the global AI boom could grow from about $137 billion in 2022 to more than $1.81 trillion by 2030, as noted by Grand View Research.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices After gaining $12.37 on Friday, Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ: AMD ) is up another $4 in premarket. Technically, after finding strong support dating back to late November, AMD is just starting to pivot higher.\nFrom its last traded price of $213.43, we’d like to see it challenge its 50-day moving average at around $239.74. AMD is also just starting to pivot from oversold RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. Also fueling upside is optimism following AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su’s meeting with China’s Commerce Minister, where the two spoke about strengthening cooperation.\n\nOn her second day of a China trip, Su exchanged views with MIIT head Li Lecheng on “strengthening cooperation in the digital economy and artificial intelligence sectors, according to a statement issued by MIIT, as reported by the South China Morning Post.\nMicron After an explosive few days on earnings and guidance, Micron ( NASDAQ: MU ) is up another $10.45 a share in premarket.\nWhile Micron is becoming overbought after breaking above triple top resistance, analysts are arguing for more upside. Analysts at Rosenblatt, for example, have a $500 price target on MU with a buy rating, citing accelerating demand for memory and storage thanks to AI.\n\nStory Continues\nAs we noted the other day, Micron’s EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share, with revenue expected to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion.\n\nFueling further upside, Micron says supply-demand issues could create a $100 billion high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market by 2028 – a milestone projected to arrive two years before the company’s previous outlook.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

(NASDAQ: AMD ) is one of the best growth stocks to buy in 2026 . On December 16, Bank of America lowered the firm’s price target on AMD to $260 from $300 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. This sentiment was posted as BofA revised its targets for US semiconductor stocks, identifying 2026 as the midpoint of a decade-long transition toward AI-optimized IT infrastructure. While the firm warns of near-term volatility as investors scrutinize AI returns and hyperscaler spending, it expects this pressure to be mitigated by the expansion of AI factories and LLM development.\n\nIn other news, on December 2, AMD and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (NYSE: HPE ) announced an expanded collaboration to develop the next generation of open, scalable AI infrastructure. A central component of this partnership is the AMD Helios architecture, an open, full-stack, rack-scale AI platform. HPE will be among the first system providers to adopt this architecture, which is engineered to simplify the deployment of massive AI clusters for research, cloud, and enterprise environments.\nThe Helios platform is built on the OCP Open Rack Wide design and integrates a comprehensive suite of AMD technologies. This includes next-generation AMD EPYC Venice CPUs, AMD Instinct MI455X GPUs, and AMD Pensando Vulcano NICs for scale-out networking. By utilizing the open ROCm software stack, a single Helios rack can deliver up to 2.9 exaFLOPS of FP4 performance.\n\nTo ensure high-bandwidth and low-latency connectivity, HPE is contributing a purpose-built HPE Juniper Networking scale-up switch, developed in collaboration with Broadcom, which utilizes the Ultra Accelerator Link over Ethernet/UALoE standard. HPE plans to offer the AMD Helios architecture globally starting in 2026.\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) operates as a semiconductor company worldwide. It operates in three segments: Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Can Completion of Qualcomm's Alphawave Buyout Deal Propel Its Shares?\n\nSupriyo Bose\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:19 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nAWE.L\n\nQualcomm Incorporated QCOM has completed the acquisition of U.K.-based chip firm Alphawave Semi for an enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion. The buyout offers Qualcomm an opportunity to expand its presence in high-growth applications, including data centers, artificial intelligence (AI), data networking and data storage.\n\nWith advanced technology solutions that are complementary to power-efficient CPU and NPU cores, Alphawave Semi delivers connectivity products and chiplets that drive faster, more reliable data transfer with higher performance and lower power consumption for 5G wireless, AI and data center applications. The acquisition, therefore, provides the firepower to enable Qualcomm to be the driving force of the next wave of AI innovation.\n\nOver the past few quarters, Qualcomm has aimed to expand its footprint in AI chips through focused R&D initiatives and strategic acquisitions.

      "Content": "This Year’s Best Growth Stock Isn’t What You Think It Is\n\nSushree Mohanty\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: APP\n\nAMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nWhen investors think of the market’s best growth stocks, the same familiar mega-cap names like Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Microsoft (MSFT) usually come to mind. But this year’s standout performer isn’t riding on just hype. AppLovin (APP) is achieving tremendous growth by quietly scaling its platform using artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology while producing significant cash flow. Furthermore, its inclusion in the S&P 500 Index signals that expectations are rising.\n\nAppLovin stock has surged 122% year-to-date (YTD), outperforming most in the “Magnificent Seven” group. Let’s see if now is a good time to buy APP stock.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nAnalysts Are Hot on the Foldable iPhone.

Sign Up Now!\nA Strong Quarter Built on Core Momentum AppLovin, valued at $244.88 billion, is a technology company that helps mobile app creators sell, monetize, and expand their apps, particularly in mobile gaming. Simply put, AppLovin serves as a behind-the-scenes growth engine for mobile games, linking advertisers with users and assisting developers in scaling quickly, making it one of the most powerful ad-tech platforms in mobile gaming today.\n\nOne of the most significant recent achievements was AppLovin's inclusion in the S&P 500 ($SPX). However, management claims that this puts pressure on the company to enhance its performance to meet expectations. Its third-quarter results indicate that AppLovin is on the right track. AppLovin runs an ad platform that helps app developers find new users. Its AI-powered software shows ads to people most likely to download and engage with an app, which drives higher returns on ad spend for advertisers.\nIn Q3, total revenue increased 68% year-on-year (YoY) to $1.4 billion, owing mostly to model upgrades in the core gaming sector. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.16 billion, up 79% YoY, with an outstanding margin of 82%. Net income rose 92% to $836 million. Core models delivered multiple incremental improvements, and the company’s Max supply-side platform continued to grow at very healthy rates. In the quarter, international expansion also advanced faster than expected. The company extended foreign traffic to advertising marketing websites or shops ahead of schedule, increasing its reach and creating the framework for a broader global advertiser base.\n\nStory Continues\nIn October, the company launched its self-service platform and referral form. Management stated that early data revealed that the platform had efficiently filtered out low-quality ad accounts, and spending from self-service advertisers was already increasing by around 50% week over week. Looking ahead, the company's priority continues to be model improvement. It intends to continue refining onboarding routines while incorporating additional AI agents into workflows to provide a seamless experience for new advertisers.\n\nFree cash flow totaled $1.049 billion, a 92% increase YoY, indicating both profitability and disciplined capital management. The balance sheet also remains robust. The company ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Shareholder returns remain a priority for the company, with approximately 1.3 million shares repurchased for $571 million during the quarter. The company also increased its share repurchase authorization by an additional $3.2 billion.\nLooking ahead, management guided continued growth. For 2025, revenue is expected to be between $1.57 billion and $1.6 billion, representing 12% to 14% sequential growth. Adjusted EBITDA is projected between $1.29 billion and $1.32 billion, with margins holding strong in the 82% to 83% range. Analysts are forecasting rapid top-line and bottom-line growth. Revenue is expected to rise 22.1% to $5.7 billion, while earnings are projected to more than double (up 106.4%) in 2025. Looking ahead to 2026, both revenue (up 35.6%) and earnings (up 55.6%) are expected to keep growing at an unusually fast pace. Trading at 47x forward 2026 earnings, the stock is not cheap. Investors are already paying a premium for future growth, meaning the market expects these forecasts to be met or exceeded.\n\nWhy This Growth Story Stands Out AppLovin’s growth story is defined not just by rapid top-line expansion but by extraordinary margins, strong cash generation, disciplined capital returns, and a clear AI-driven roadmap. Furthermore, inclusion in the S&P 500 is already bringing broader visibility and long-term investors into the stock. If the company delivers on the aggressive growth and earnings expectations, the valuation can be justified.\n\nIs APP Stock a Buy on Wall Street? APP stock has all the love on Wall Street, holding an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Recently, BTIG raised its price target for APP to $771 from $705 while reiterating a “Buy” rating, signaling growing confidence in the stock’s outlook. The firm is constructive on the gaming and gambling end markets heading into 2026.\n\nOut of the 26 analysts who cover APP stock, 19 rate it as a “Strong Buy,” while two rate it as a “Moderate Buy,” four rate it a “Hold,” and one rates it a “Strong Sell.” The average target price of $720.46 is just a hair above current levels. However, the high price estimate of $860 implies that the stock could rally by up to 20% over the next 12 months.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
