The most recent funding round drew investors including BlackRock , Neuberger Berman, Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter and 1789 Capital.\nGroq is expected to notify investors about the deal later on Wednesday, Davis said. While the acquisition includes Groq’s assets, its early-stage cloud business is excluded from the transaction.\nThe startup was founded by former engineers behind Google’s tensor processing unit, or TPU, a chip designed to compete with Nvidia in artificial intelligence workloads.\nIf completed, the deal would represent Nvidia’s largest acquisition to date, underscoring the company’s push to strengthen its position in advanced AI hardware.\nRelated articles\nNvidia to acquire Groq for $20 billion in its largest deal ever, CNBC reports\nLoading Up HEAVY on These 3 Stocks by End of 2025 (+ 1 New ETF)\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

If it doesn't, you know, the market's going to come off its wheels. But having said that, I mean, recently, you can look at, you know, some poster childs of the AI trade. You know, I think of an AI heavy name like an Nvidia. It's well off its 52-week high, Joseph, but this market has continued to grind higher. I'm just curious what you make of that.\n00:23 Joseph\nWell, I think that it it it bolsters the the thesis that the 493 certainly have legs. And I think that I think more broadly, the economy is stronger than people thought it would be when we started the year. Uh, rates are probably lower than uh, lower today than where where we thought they would be. Inflation is probably a tick lower uh, than we thought it would be. So the underlying conditions are somewhat better for the broad market and the broad market has been able to weather as you talked about, the bumps in the road that are inevitable uh uh with regard to the Mag 7 and and the AI trade. So, I think it's positive for the index as we enter 2026 that we've seen some level of broadening. And obviously, we see opportunities uh in the defense sector, uh in in healthcare and selectively in technology as well as as this rally continues to broaden.\n01:21 Speaker A\nYeah, let's get to some of those specific names and picks, Joseph. Uh you like Broadcom here for example. How come? What do you like about C.O. Hock Tan's company specifically? Is it the business model, margins, his AI story?\n01:40 Joseph\nWell, you know, our strategy is to invest in recurring revenue businesses and Broadcom has one of the great uh technology recurring revenue businesses. When you think about how they're positioned with regard to AI, they're really very, very well positioned uh in a category where the product, the GPU is 90% of the cost of the solution. And Broadcom with their XPUs is dramatically reducing the cost of effectuating the outcome that AI provides. And so we think that they'll continue to take market share among the hyperscalers, which is going to drive fantastic revenue growth in the AI business. We see the AI business doubling uh in 2026 for Broadcom and we see it growing very, very rapidly uh after 2026. So long-term, they're very, very well positioned with a product that is that is highly efficient for their customers.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "LIVE\n\nStock market today: Dow, S&P 500 notch records, Nasdaq gains as Wall Street flies high into Christmas holiday\n\nBrett LoGiurato · Front Page Editor\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:05 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\nINTC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nGC=F\n\nUS stocks set more records on Wednesday, as Wall Street rode into the Christmas holiday on a high note.\nThe blue chip-focused Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) led the way up, gaining 0.6%, or nearly 300 points, to close at a fresh record high. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) picked up 0.3% to notch its second consecutive record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained a bit under 0.2%.\n\nMarkets closed early on Wednesday for Christmas Eve and are off Thursday for the holiday. Wall Street's bid for a \"Santa Claus\" rally is looking hopeful after the major indexes gained for the fifth consecutive day.\nWall Street's advance over the past several sessions has come despite new economic data that only served to dampen bets for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the near term. US GDP growth stood at 4.3% in the third quarter , according to a first estimate from the government, much higher than forecast as consumer spending held up over the summer.\n\nBut the GDP data led investors to trim bets on a January rate cut from the Fed — just more than 13% now expect that outcome. Most traders, however, still expect two rate cuts by the end of next year, as the divisions that defined the central bank this year are likely to persist even with a new chair set to replace Jerome Powell by mid-year.\nInvestors got one more sign of an economy that is nominally moving in the right direction as unemployment claims fell for the second week in a row, according to data released Wednesday — even as consumer confidence continues to falter .\nElsewhere, precious metals powered ahead on Wednesday, with gold ( GC=F ) rising to an all-time high above $4,500 an ounce before paring gains. Silver ( SI=F ) also advanced to a record, while platinum ( PL=F ) reversed, shedding more than 3%. Oil ( BZ=F , CL=F ) steadied after a run-up through the last few days.\nIntel ( INTC ) managed to pare losses to a drop of around 0.5% on the day after reports that Nvidia ( NVDA ) had halted a test using Intel's fabrication process for advanced chips.\n\nLIVE 15 updates\n24 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nGold, silver, copper steady after touching record highs as metals outperform in 2025 Gold ( GC=F ) and silver ( SI=F ) are among this year’s biggest winners, with momentum driving prices to record highs and setting up their best year since 1979.\nGold traded above $4,500 per troy ounce on Wednesday before paring gains as it notched another milestone in a year packed with more than 50 record highs.\nSilver has had an even stronger year, soaring 150% on robust industrial demand and physical shortages. The metal topped $70 on Wednesday, while futures climbed past $72 an ounce.\nMeanwhile, copper ( HG=F ) also participated in the metals rally, reaching all-time highs on supply concerns before trimming gains.\n\n55 mins ago Jake Conley\n\nDiverging spending levels continue to drive a \"K-shaped\" US economy The US consumer landscape is firmly K-shaped, and the economy is likely to continue to hold that shape into 2026, according to economic strategists. As the economy has grown while consumer sentiment has soured, higher-income households have outspent and out-earned lower-income households by a widening margin.\nYahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports:",

The chip is reportedly aimed at competing with AMD's Strix Halo by delivering stronger graphics performance in high-end laptops.\nOne notable feature is memory bandwidth. The design is said to support up to 16 channels of LPDDR6 memory, a move intended to avoid bottlenecks that have limited graphics performance in competing processors.\nThe leak appears to offer the first real glimpse of what Intel and Nvidia's $5 billion partnership could produce. While Intel says it remains committed to its own Arc graphics roadmap, Serpent Lake points to deeper collaboration between the two companies, with a potential launch in late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

It's according to Reuters. Nvidia recently tested the so-called 18A process. This highlights a pain point for Intel amid its struggling manufacturing business. Nvidia, remember, earlier this year invested $5 billion in Intel, but did not commit to using its chip manufacturing services.\n00:36 Speaker A\nUp next, take a look at Tesla as the company faces a new investigation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is launching a probe into the EV Maker's Model 3 compact sedans. This comes amid concerns that emergency door release controls may not be easily accessible or clearly identifiable. The focus of this investigation is on model year 2022 electric vehicles. The US auto safety regulator has also been looking into Tesla's advanced driver assistance system over alleged violations of traffic safety laws.\n01:17 Speaker A\nAnd lastly, let's check a check here on crypto. Bitcoin continues to slip missing out on the broader seasonal optimism. The world's largest cryptocurrency stalling here between 85,000 to 90,000 range. The slump in the digital asset follows a turbulent couple of months as crypto struggles to regain its footing after falling sharply from its record high back in early October.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Let's start there, explain that. I mean, is that is that valuation, Joseph, is it is it earnings growth, positioning, explain it.\n00:27 Joseph\nI think that there have been a number of businesses in the magnificent 493 that are perceived as being uh hurt or uh compromised by the growth of AI. Valuations have gone significantly lower for a number of those companies and businesses that are just not participants in in uh the opportunity of AI have also not performed particularly well uh in that bucket of the magnificent 493. And I think in 2026, what we're going to find is that many of these companies are harnessing AI to get better, to lower their costs, to improve the velocity of introducing new products, um, and those businesses will begin to get the benefits of that uh as people recognize it. It hasn't happened uh in the last couple of years, but I think we're going to notice that in the next couple of years.\n01:29 Speaker A\nWell, what does that suggest Joseph about what do you think I do with the Mag 7 though in 2026? You know, am I avoiding those names? Am I trimming exposure? You know, do I have to be more discerning? Maybe next year, Joseph, it's more like, you know, the mag three or four.\n01:46 Joseph\nI think so. I think the Mag 7 it's tough to paint them with a broad brush because each one of them has a specific story associated with them. But I think just from a valuation perspective and the fact that they've performed so well for such a long period of time, I think that some of them will take a break, some of them will perform well, but really the opportunities for outsized returns next year are going to be outside of those seven businesses.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Uh-Oh! Did Nvidia Just Signal Problems with Intel’s Comeback?\n\nRich Duprey\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nTSM\n\nQuick Read Intel ( INTC ) secured $8.9B from the U.S. government and $5B from Nvidia ( NVDA ) to revive its foundry business.\nNvidia halted testing of Intel’s 18A chip manufacturing process and stopped moving forward with production plans.\nIntel’s foundry turnaround depends on 18A attracting major customers beyond smaller deals with Microsoft and Amazon .\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIntel ( NASDAQ: INTC ) has experienced a dramatic shift in fortunes over the past year. Once viewed as a failing chipmaker losing ground to competitors like Broadcom ( NASDAQ: AVGO ), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( NYSE: TSM ), and Nvidia ( NASDAQ: NVDA ), Intel faced speculation that rivals were circling its foundry business and other assets.\nBy the middle of the year, however, Intel regained momentum through significant backing from the Trump administration, which converted CHIPS Act grants into an equity stake worth approximately $8.9 billion, or 10% of the company, making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. This was followed by a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, giving it roughly a 4% stake, as well as partnerships aimed at joint product development in data centers and PCs.\n\nThese moves indicated renewed confidence, positioning Intel as a key player in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing once again. Yet, a Reuters report today suggests a big potential setback, raising questions about whether Intel's revival is beginning to falter.\nA Promising Rebound Built on Execution Intel's recent progress has been notable, driven by strategic investments and a focus on revitalizing its core businesses. The Trump administration's equity stake provided essential capital and aligned Intel with national priorities for domestic chip production.\nWeeks later, Nvidia's $5 billion commitment further supported Intel's turnaround, with the two firms agreeing to collaborate on custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms and integrated system-on-chips for PCs. An Intel spokesperson emphasized that 18A technologies are \"progressing well.\"\n\nDespite these positive developments, the rebound has always hinged on Intel's ability to execute, particularly in its foundry business. The 18A process node has been central to its plans for regaining manufacturing leadership, as it is intended to enable high-volume production of advanced chips and attract customers.\nNvidia's Decision Raises Questions About 18A According to the Reuters article, Nvidia recently evaluated whether to manufacture its next-generation chips using Intel's 18A process but halted the testing and stopped moving forward. Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed this to Reuters, though Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nStory Continues\nThis development comes despite Nvidia's earlier investment and ongoing product collaborations, which explicitly did not include commitments to use Intel's foundry. Intel has previously noted strong interest in 18A, and the company continues to highlight progress on the node, with products like Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest ramping up toward production.\n\nThe reasons for Nvidia's decision remain unclear, but earlier reports indicated both Nvidia and Broadcom conducted tests on 18A. While testing is a standard step, not all evaluations lead to production commitments.\nIf technical or yield issues contributed to the halt, it could signal challenges for Intel in convincing major designers to shift volume from established leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel's foundry has faced scrutiny over quality and scalability before, though the company maintains that 18A is on track and sees interest shifting to the subsequent 14A node for even more advanced applications.\nBroader Implications for Intel's Foundry Strategy Winning high-profile customers has been a key goal for Intel Foundry, which has invested heavily to compete as a contract manufacturer. Deals with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) for custom chips on 18A have been announced, and Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) might go with Intel for its entry-level M-series chips in 2027, but volumes from such clients are relatively small compared to demands from AI leaders like Nvidia.\n\nNvidia halting the testing -- while not a definitive rejection -- underscores the high bar set for advanced nodes. Competitors continue to dominate high-end production, and Intel must demonstrate reliable yields and performance to secure larger commitments.\nKey Takeaway Investors should not read too much into Nvidia's decision to pause 18A testing at this stage, as qualification processes are lengthy and multifaceted. However, greater caution is warranted moving forward.\nMuch of Intel's turnaround depends on the success of the 18A process in delivering competitive manufacturing capabilities. If the node falls short of expectations in attracting major business from customers, it could complicate the company's path to foundry profitability and an overall recovery.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nASML\n\nKey Points Nvidia’s chips are still the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush.\nTSMC manufactures Nvidia’s chips with its best-in-breed foundries.\nASML’s lithography systems enable TSMC to produce those chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe artificial intelligence ( AI ) market has expanded rapidly over the past decade as more powerful chips and generative AI platforms have entered the market. Those AI services became practical tools that could quickly crunch, analyze, and predict trends for businesses and mainstream users.\n\nThe AI market could grow at a CAGR of 30.6% from 2026 to 2033, according to Grand View Research, as more organizations use AI to automate, accelerate, and optimize their operations. To capitalize on this expansion, investors should consider buying and holding these three top tech stocks for the next decade and beyond: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , TSMC (NYSE: TSM) , and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) .\nNvidia Nvidia is the world's top producer of discrete GPUs for data centers, which are used to process complex AI tasks. Most of the top AI companies -- including OpenAI, Meta , and Microsoft -- use its GPUs. It also locks in those clients with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a proprietary programming platform for its own chips.\n\nAs the producer of the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, Nvidia still has plenty of room to grow. It might face tougher competition from AMD 's cheaper GPUs, first-party AI chips from some of its top customers, and other types of AI accelerators -- but its first-mover edge, best-in-breed reputation, and sticky ecosystem will fuel its long-term growth. Tighter export curbs could throttle its shipments to China over the next few years, but it can offset that pressure with its growth in the U.S., Europe, and other Asian markets.\nFrom fiscal 2025 (which ended in January) to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share ( EPS ) to grow at a CAGR of 46% and 29%, respectively. Even though its stock has already soared nearly 23,000% over the past decade, it still looks reasonably valued at 25 times next year's earnings. Therefore, Nvidia should remain one of the simplest ways to profit from the AI boom over the next decade.\n\nTSMC Nvidia outsources the production of its top-tier GPUs to TSMC, the world's largest and most advanced contract chipmaker. TSMC is the only foundry capable of manufacturing Nvidia's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.\nTSMC also produces chips for other leading fabless chipmakers like AMD, Apple , and Qualcomm . It manufactures its most advanced chips in Taiwan, which is exposed to potential trade and military conflicts with China; however, it has been mitigating this risk by building more plants in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.\n\nStory Continues\nIn its latest quarter, TSMC generated 57% of its revenue from the high-performance computing (HPC) market, which includes Nvidia's data center GPUs. That segment is driving its near-term growth and reducing its dependence on the cyclical PC, smartphone, and automotive markets.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect TSMC's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 24% and 27%, respectively, as the AI market expands and its more cyclical markets stabilize. Those are strong growth rates for a stock that trades at 19 times next year's earnings, and it will remain a linchpin of the expanding semiconductor sector for the foreseeable future.\n\nASML TSMC couldn't manufacture its chips without the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML. ASML is the world's leading producer of lithography systems, which optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which produce the smallest and most densely packed chips.\n\nASML perfected its EUV technology over the past two decades, and the high costs of producing those massive systems prevented its potential competitors from gaining any ground. Its EUV systems currently cost $200-$400 million, require multiple planes and trucks to ship, and must be reassembled at the foundries by its own teams.\nASML's monopolization of that market makes it another linchpin of the semiconductor sector, and the world's most advanced AI chips couldn't exist without its cutting-edge technology. The export curbs against China (where it's barred from selling its higher-end systems) are throttling its near-term sales, but its growth across other regions should offset that pressure.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 18%, respectively, as it ramps up its shipments of its latest \"high-NA\" EUV systems for manufacturing even smaller and denser chips. Its stock isn't a bargain at 35 times next year's earnings, but its scale, guaranteed long-term growth, and pricing power justify that higher valuation.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "TSX futures edge lower as liquidity thins ahead of Christmas break\n\nLuke Juricic\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:42 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPTSE\n\nDX\n\nDX-PC\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nInvesting.com -- Canadian equity futures are drifting slightly lower on Wednesday morning as market participants head to the sidelines for a holiday-shortened session. The subtle retreat follows a historic milestone for the S&P/TSX Composite, which reached a record closing high on Tuesday, fueled by a meteoric rise in the metals and mining sectors.\n\nAs of 9:05 ET, S&P/TSX 60 Futures Index Standard Futures were down 2.4 points or 0.13%, mirroring a cautious tone in global markets. Trading volumes are expected to remain exceptionally thin today, as the Toronto Stock Exchange prepares to close early at 1:00 PM ET for Christmas Eve. Analysts warn that low liquidity could amplify price swings, though many investors appear content to lock in profits after a banner year for Canadian equities.\nRecord Territory: Tuesday Recap The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index finished Tuesday’s session up 58.63 points, or 0.18%, to settle at a new record of 32,058.73. The advance marked the fourth consecutive winning day for the index, which has now surged nearly 30% year-to-date.\nTuesday’s gains were driven almost exclusively by commodities:\n\nGold and Silver Miners: Outsized gains in the sub-indexes (up over 100% this year) continued as precious metals hit fresh peaks.\nEnergy: Resilience in crude prices provided a secondary floor for the index, even as domestic economic data surprised to the downside.\nThe bullish momentum successfully offset a disappointing report from Statistics Canada , which revealed that real GDP contracted 0.3% in October . The decline was wider than the 0.2% drop economists had anticipated, hampered by a 1.5% slump in manufacturing and a series of high-profile labor stoppages, including a nation-wide postal strike and teacher strikes in Alberta.\nGold Shatters $4,500 Barrier In a historic move on Wednesday, Gold Futures broke past the $4,500 per ounce resistance level. The yellow metal reached a peak of $4,554/oz in trade, extending a rally that has seen prices climb roughly 70% in 2025. Gold Futures now sit at $4,515.25/oz, a 0.2% gain.\nThe \"flight to safety\" is being propelled by a cocktail of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors:\n\nUS-Venezuela Tensions: Renewed friction between Washington and Caracas over oil shipments has heightened regional supply risks.\nFed Expectations: Despite robust US GDP data, investors remain firm in their belief that the Federal Reserve will pivot toward further rate cuts in 2026.\nCurrency Weakness: The US Dollar Index is hovering near 12-week lows, making dollar-denominated bullion more attractive to international buyers.\n\nStory continues\nEnergy & Commodities Watch\nOil prices remained relatively stable on Wednesday morning. Brent Oil Futures edged up 0.14% to $62.46 per barrel, while Crude Oil WTI Futures gained 0.3% to trade at $58.55.\nSupply risks remain the primary catalyst, as the Trump administration intensifies enforcement actions against vessels linked to Venezuelan crude. While Venezuela accounts for a small fraction of global supply, the potential for wider maritime interdiction has re-introduced a significant risk premium into energy markets.\n\nTech Spotlight: Intel Slumps on Nvidia Snub In corporate news, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) saw its shares tumble 3.3% in premarket trading. The move comes following reporting from Reuters saying that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has halted testing of Intel’s \"18A\" advanced manufacturing process.\nThe 18A node is considered the linchpin of Intel’s turnaround strategy to become a premier foundry for third-party chip designers. While an Intel spokesperson maintained that the technology is \"progressing well,\" the decision by Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, to step away from testing dealt a heavy blow to investor sentiment.\n\nLooking Ahead U.S. markets are also expected to see light activity today, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 Futures trading near flat after their own record-setting sessions on Tuesday. The New York Stock Exchange will join the TSX in an early 1:00 PM ET close today, and both will remain shuttered on Thursday for Christmas Day.\nRelated articles\nTSX futures edge lower as liquidity thins ahead of Christmas break\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Micron Technology and BigBear.ai\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:42 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nBBAI\n\nMU\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 24, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Intel Corp. INTC, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nForget NVIDIA: 2 AI Stocks Crushing It in 2025 with More Upside Ahead Shares of the most sought-after tech stock on Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp. , have surged 36.6% this year amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ongoing demand for NVIDIA's CUDA software platform, along with its competitive advantage in the AI hardware market, fueled growth. Demand for NVIDIA's Blackwell chips remains strong, and the company plans to ship H200 AI chips to China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nHowever, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions remain a risk and could pose a meaningful threat to NVIDIA's future growth trajectory. NVIDIA also faces intensifying competition from rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . and Intel Corp. , as data center capital expenditures continue to rise.\nTherefore, investors may look beyond NVIDIA at stocks that have outperformed it this year and still offer upside as the AI boom continues. Notable among them are Micron Technology, Inc . and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc . whose shares have gained 228.8% and 43.6%, respectively, this year. Let's take a closer look at why these stocks are compelling buys.\nReasons to Be Bullish on Micron Strong demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips is expected to help the company deliver strong quarterly results. These chips have the inherent capacity to reduce power consumption and process large volumes of data. With AI infrastructure rapidly expanding, demand for HBM chips has accelerated.\n\nBanking on rising AI-led demand for HBM chips, Micron expects its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $13.64 billion for the fiscal first quarter, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Analysts had projected revenues of around $12.88 billion.\nMicron expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter, with its cloud memory business unit expected to perform particularly well. Micron's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a solid 23.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nReasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai BigBear.ai's shares were adversely impacted at the beginning of the year due to the Trump administration's move to curb federal spending. Reduced funding may have affected BigBear.ai's sales, but its top-line performance is expected to improve going forward, supported by the definitive $250 million agreement to acquire Ask Sage.\n\nAsk Sage is a fast-growing generative AI platform that has seen broad adoption, with users including the U.S. Space Force and the Defense Health Agency. It is designed for secure AI deployment in restricted fields such as defense and national security, according to ir.bigbear.ai. Ask Sage serves 100,000 users across 16,000 government teams, and with its acquisition, BigBear.ai expects full-year sales to reach $125 million to $140 million.\nMoreover, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" could drive future growth for BigBear.ai, while the company's robust cash position provides ample resources to support its expansion. The company reached a significant milestone toward profitability in the third quarter, and its expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a stellar 73.1%.\n\nWhile BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Nvidia (NVDA) Crossed Above the 50-Day Moving Average: What That Means for Investors\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Nvidia (NVDA) is looking like an interesting pick, as it just reached a key level of support. NVDA recently overtook the 50-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.\nThe 50-day simple moving average is a widely used technical indicator that helps determine support or resistance levels for different types of securities. It's one of three major moving averages, but takes precedent because it's the first sign of an up or down trend.\n\nShares of NVDA have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 6.4%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, suggesting that NVDA could be poised for a continued surge.\nThe bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account NVDA's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 15 higher compared to none lower for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nInvestors may want to watch NVDA for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is planning roughly $23 billion in AI-related capital spending in 2026, betting heavily on computing power to fuel its next phase of growth.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nMost of that money will go toward the infrastructure behind Doubao, ByteDance's fast-growing AI assistant, along with tools that power advertising and content recommendations. A key part of the plan is a trial of about 20,000 Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) H200 chips, a roughly $400 million investment that would give ByteDance access to top-tier AI hardware at a time when such supply is tightly controlled. Reports suggest more than half of the budget could be dedicated just to AI processors.\nThat spending still trails U.S. giants like Meta ( NASDAQ:META ) and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ), but ByteDance's private status gives it flexibility to play the long game. Doubao's rapid rise in China shows why the company is leaning in.\nWhy it matters: ByteDance is signaling that AI is now core to its business, not an experiment, and it is willing to spend aggressively to stay ahead.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia and Bath & Body Works have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:34 AM PST 10 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSTR\n\nMARA\n\nBBWI\n\nRIOT\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 24, 2025 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Nvidia NVDA as the Bull of the Day and Bath & Body Works, Inc. BBWI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Strategy Inc. MSTR, MARA Holdings MARA and Riot Platforms RIOT.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day : I run screens and conduct research every day, looking for high-quality companies with strong growth profiles and reasonable valuations, and Nvidia consistently stands out. Few companies sit as squarely at the center of today's most important secular trend.\nDemand for Nvidia's GPUs appears either secular or, if cyclical, still early enough that a downturn is not yet a concern. Roughly half a trillion dollars is expected to flow into AI-related capital spending next year, and Nvidia's chips are estimated to account for roughly 20% of that investment. That scale underscores both the company's dominance and the durability of its demand backdrop.\n\nAfter several months of consolidation, Nvidia shares have begun to reaccelerate, recently breaking out from a well-defined technical pattern. At the same time, analysts have continued to raise earnings estimates, earning the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) . Improving clarity around US&ndash;China semiconductor trade policies has also removed a near-term overhang, reopening a source of demand that had previously been constrained.\nBelow, we outline the outlook for the world's largest publicly traded company and explain why Nvidia remains well positioned to continue leading the market going forward.\nNvidia Shares Bolstered by Strong Growth Forecasts Growth expectations for Nvidia remain exceptional. Sales are projected to rise roughly 63% next year and another 43% in 2027, reflecting an incredible $100 billion jump from one year to the next. On the bottom line, earnings are expected to climb 55.5% next year and 53% the following year, underscoring the company's powerful operating leverage.\n\nWhat also makes this growth profile compelling is valuation. Despite its dominance and momentum, Nvidia trades at about 39.5x forward earnings. With consensus estimates calling for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, the stock carries a PEG ratio of roughly 0.85, a level typically associated with undervalued growth stocks, not the world's most important AI supplier.\nIn other words, investors are not paying a premium commensurate with Nvidia's growth trajectory. If current forecasts hold, valuation support alone provides a cushion, while continued execution on revenue, margins, and ecosystem expansion offers meaningful upside.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia Stock Breaks Out Nvidia shares staged a decisive breakout this week, resolving higher from a well-defined descending bullish wedge, a pattern that typically signals trend continuation. After several months of consolidation, the stock has clearly regained momentum, suggesting selling pressure has been absorbed and buyers are regaining control.\n\nWith the breakout now confirmed, the technical setup points to a renewed push higher, and a retest of record highs in the near term would not be surprising. Importantly, this move is occurring alongside rising earnings estimates and improving fundamental visibility, reinforcing the signal and increasing the likelihood that the breakout proves durable.\nCan Investors Buy Shares in NVDA? Given the combination of accelerating earnings growth, reasonable valuation relative to its growth profile, and a confirmed technical breakout, Nvidia remains an attractive buy for investors with a medium- to long-term horizon. The stock has spent several months consolidating prior gains, allowing fundamentals to catch up to price, and that process now appears complete.\n\nWhile near-term volatility is always possible, particularly in a stock that has already delivered outsized returns, the underlying setup argues that pullbacks are more likely to be opportunities rather than warning signs. With earnings estimates still moving higher, demand visibility extending well into next year, and technical momentum turning decisively positive, Nvidia continues to justify its leadership position in the market and remains the core holding in the AI theme.\nBear of the Day: Bath & Body Works, Inc. appears to be facing a structural decline as sales, earnings power, brand relevance, and analyst expectations continue to trend lower. What was once a productive specialty retail model is increasingly under pressure in a more competitive, digitally driven landscape.\nStore traffic remains muted, and the company has struggled to resonate with younger consumers, leading to ongoing market share losses to competitors with stronger product innovation and more effective digital engagement. At the same time, margin visibility is deteriorating. Elevated promotional activity, persistent tariff exposure, and rising operating costs are compressing profitability, with few clear offsets in sight.\n\nManagement's revised outlook points to a longer and more challenging recovery. Softer top-line expectations, combined with continued SG&A deleverage, suggest earnings will remain constrained even if demand stabilizes. With promotional intensity likely to remain elevated, execution risk appears skewed to the downside over the next several quarters.\nReflecting these challenges, analysts have continued to downgrade the stock. Shares have been in a persistent downtrend for roughly four years, underscoring the market's lack of confidence in a near-term turnaround.\nBBWI Stock Drops Along with Earnings Estimates The earnings revision trend for Bath & Body Works has deteriorated meaningfully again over the past 60 days, pushing the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) . Analyst confidence has weakened sharply, with next quarter earnings estimates cut by 42% and next year estimates reduced by 31.5%, reflecting rising concerns around demand, margins, and execution.\n\nThe top line outlook offers little support. Sales are expected to decline 2.3% next year and a further 3% in 2027, signaling ongoing pressure on traffic. On the bottom line, earnings are forecast to fall 11.6% this year and 11.5% next year, suggesting that cost pressures and promotional intensity are overwhelming management's ability to protect profitability.\nThis combination, falling revenue, shrinking margins, and accelerating estimate cuts is particularly concerning. Sustained negative revisions tend to weigh heavily on stock performance, and without a clear catalyst to stabilize earnings expectations, BBWI remains fundamentally challenged in the near to intermediate term.\nShould Investors Avoid BBWI Stock? Given the ongoing deterioration in fundamentals, BBWI remains a stock to avoid. Earnings estimates continue to move sharply lower, revenue trends are negative, and margin pressure shows little sign of abating. In retail, sustained negative revisions are rarely a short-term issue, and BBWI's estimate trajectory suggests deeper structural challenges rather than a temporary slowdown.\n\nUntil the company can demonstrate a clear inflection in traffic, brand relevance, and profitability, and until earnings revisions stabilize, the risk-reward profile remains unattractive. With shares entrenched in a multi-year downtrend and analyst sentiment firmly negative, BBWI lacks the catalysts needed to justify new capital at this stage.\nAdditional content: Strategy's Bitcoin Accretion Continues: Is It Durable? Strategy Inc. continues to deepen its identity as the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 2025 marking a decisive acceleration in Bitcoin accretion. In 2025, the company has meaningfully stepped up its accumulation pace, expanding holdings to roughly 671,000 BTC, including a recent 10,645 BTC purchase in mid-December. With its Bitcoin ownership exceeding 3% of the global supply, Strategy's accumulation has evolved into an ongoing process rather than opportunistic trades.\n\nThat momentum is clearly reflected in key operating metrics. BTC Yield reached 26% year to date, while BTC Gain climbed to 116,555 BTC, marking a sharp rise from earlier quarters. Importantly, Bitcoin per share continued to rise even as new equity was issued, indicating that capital raises remain adding value on a per-share basis. These metrics suggest that Bitcoin accumulation is being executed with discipline.\nThe durability of this momentum is further supported by recent structural tailwinds. Regulatory clarity following IRS guidance on fair-value taxation reduces uncertainty for long-term Bitcoin holders, while the company's new S&P B- credit rating expands access to global high-yield capital markets. At the same time, growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin via ETFs and derivatives has improved liquidity and reduced volatility, creating a more supportive macro backdrop for treasury adoption.\n\nLooking ahead, management reaffirmed its target of a 30% BTC yield and $20 billion in BTC dollar profits for 2025, indicating confidence in maintaining this trajectory. While Bitcoin remains volatile, the company's expanded access to capital supports more sustainable compound growth.\nMSTR Faces Growing Pressure from Crypto Rivals MARA Holdings challenges MSTR with a fundamentally different crypto strategy. MARA Holdings blends Bitcoin production and accumulation, leveraging large-scale mining alongside strategic purchases. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, MARA Holdings held 52,850 BTC, supported by an energized hash rate of 60.4 EH/s, indicating scalable, long-term competitive pressure.\n\nRiot Platforms presents a growing threat to MSTR by monetizing Bitcoin through large-scale mining operations. RIOT strengths include cost efficiency and strategic expansion, and digital infrastructure supporting the Bitcoin network directly. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, RIOT held 19,287 BTC, produced 1,406 BTC and deployed a 36.5 EH/s hash rate. With $180.2 million in revenues and $104.5 million in net income, RIOT highlights growing competitive pressure on MSTR.\nMSTR's Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates MSTR has significantly underperformed both its sector and key competitors. Shares of Strategy have plunged 54.1% over the past year against a 15.7% gain in the Zacks Finance sector. Riot Platforms rose 23.4% during the same period, while MARA Holdings declined 49.7%.\nMSTR has a Value Score of F. It is currently trading at a Price/Book ratio of 0.9X compared to the sector's 4.28X.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSTR's 2025 earnings is pegged at $78.04 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The estimate also indicates a strong year-over-year recovery from a loss of $6.72 per share.\nMSTR stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Intel Shares Fall on Report Nvidia Halts Production Test\n\nJake Rudnitsky\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:14 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. shares fell in premarket trading Wednesday after a report said that Nvidia Corp. halted a test to use Intel’s production process to make advanced chips.\nNvidia recently tested the so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, Reuters reported, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nSpokespeople for Nvidia and Intel didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies are “progressing well.”\nIntel’s shares fell about 2.3% in early trading before markets opened in New York.\nIntel recently opened a new factory at its Ocotillo site in Arizona known as Fab 52 that’s the first to go into mass production with the 18A technique. The company says it’s the most cutting edge production technology developed and deployed in the US. Intel’s push to make advanced chips domestically is an attempt to challenge the global leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and reassert American leadership in the industry.\n\nNvidia agreed to invest $5 billion into Intel in September, following the US government’s decision to take a roughly 10% stake in the company. The investment by the world’s most valuable company and a key designer of chips for the artificial intelligence boom was seen as a boost for Intel, which has struggled to stem losses and catch competitors that have surpassed it in recent years. However, the deal didn’t include a commitment for Intel to make Nvidia chips.\n18A is a bid to return to making Intel’s best offerings in-house. The technology contains two new features that Intel says are breakthroughs for the industry.\nThe first relates to transistors, the microscopic switches that give semiconductors their function. Modern chips cram tens of billions of transistors into a small area. In order to make chips more efficient and use less energy, the ability to switch these transistors on and off becomes critical.\n\nThe 18A products will be the first to have transistors made with so-called gate-all-around technology, a technique that allows finer control over this process, Intel said. That will allow for chips with more transistors — and the ability to handle growing amounts of data — that consume less power.\nThe second innovation pertains to how the chips are powered. The ultimate promise is that chips can have more transistors and be more efficient.\n\nStory Continues\n(Updates with more detail on 18A process.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "These 6 stocks will lead the $1 trillion chip surge in 2026, BofA says\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAVGO\n\n^GSPC\n\nLRCX\n\nKLAC\n\nThe artificial intelligence boom isn't cooling off — it's getting bigger, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya contends.\nWhile AI skeptics have pointed to eye-popping valuations as a reason to run, Arya said the industry is only at the \"midpoint\" of a decade-long transformation, and it's being led by Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ).\n\nIn a report titled \"2026 Year Ahead: choppy, still cheerful,\" Arya forecast a 30% year-over-year surge in global semiconductor sales that will finally push the sector past a historic $1 trillion annual sales milestone in 2026.\nArya noted a strong belief in companies with \"moats that are quantified by their margin structure.\" In addition to Nvidia and Broadcom, he highlighted four other large-cap semiconductor companies — Lam Research ( LRCX ), KLA ( KLAC ), Analog Devices ( ADI ), and Cadence Design Systems ( CDNS ) — as his top picks for 2026.\n\"I often say that investing in semis is very simple,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call. \"You don't need any sell-side analyst to do that. Just take all your companies, sort them by gross margins, and buy the top five, and you're not going to be that wrong.\"\nBofA estimates that the total addressable market for AI data center systems will reach over $1.2 trillion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion opportunity.\nDespite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious because AI data centers are expensive. A typical 1 gigawatt facility requires upwards of $60 billion in capital expenditures, with roughly half of that going directly to hardware, per Bank of America.\n\nThat raises the question: Will the return on investment ever materialize?",

      "Content": "The 20-Year Signal: Preparing for the Predicted Reversal of AI-Fueled Stock Market Gains\n\nDavid Beren\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:45 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nThere is no question that artificial intelligence has transformed the stock market as we know it over the past three years, all but single-handedly driving the S&P 500 to record after record. Companies that are sitting at the forefront of this technology, like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), have delivered returns that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The Shiller CAPE ratio sits above 35, a level seen only twice before: the Great Depression and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\nThe S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022. The Mag 7 tech stocks now represent 30% of total S&P 500 market value.\nAfter the 2000 peak at similar CAPE levels, the S&P 500 fell 49% over 2.5 years and took 7 years to recover.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMost importantly, the AI technology is real, and so far, the enthusiasm for this technology has been mostly justified, all while the long-term potential (and dangers) seems incredible. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolios have grown in a massive way over the last 36 months. But, and there is always a but, beneath this celebratory growth, there is a warning signal that has emerged.\nThis indicator, which looks at the close relationships between stock prices and underlying economics, hasn't flashed at current levels in over 20 years, not since the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. The last time this signal appeared, it was followed by a multi-year bear market that erased roughly half of the market's overall value. While history doesn't always repeat itself, it does at least suggest that we need to look at these readings and consider, as investors, what the next smart move really is.\n\nAI Mania Drives Stocks to Historic, Record Highs The artificial intelligence revolution has, without question, captivated investors in a way that almost no other technology has. The belief that AI is going to and has already started to automate work, revolutionize manufacturing, and create entirely new industries is just scratching the surface of what investors are thinking about.\n\nFor companies that are in the AI world, all of this speculation and promise has led to explosive revenue growth. For example, NVIDIA's data center business has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in corporate America, and Microsoft's AI integration across basically its entire product lineup is driving enterprise adoption. In other words, this technology is actually driving real revenue.\n\nStory Continues\nThis technological transformation has driven stock prices to levels that would have seemed absurd three years ago. The S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022, and NVIDIA has seen its market cap grow by trillions. The Mag 7's technology stocks represent a whopping 30% of the entire S&P 500 market value, a level not seen since the 1990s. Valuations have also exploded as the forward P/E of the S&P 500 now hovers around 21 to 22, 40% above historical averages.\n\nThe optimism that is driving these valuation numbers is assuming that AI will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for years to come. More importantly, it also assumes that AI adoption won't have any obstacles to adoption in the coming years and that companies building AI infrastructure will continue generating returns to justify their current high stock prices and valuations.\nThis pattern of pricing in future success isn't new, as the late 1990s boom also seemed a trajectory where investors were basically paying today for profits they expected companies to deliver in the next five years. However, as the world knows, the technology of the internet boom from the 1990s succeeded, it's how you're reading this today, but many of the stocks crashed because valuations got too far ahead of any financial reality.\n\nA Rare Signal Not Seen in Two Decades: What the Indicator Means The warning signal that is flashing today is the Shiller CAPE ratio, a number that is an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio that measures stock prices relative to average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This metric attempts to smooth out short-term earnings volatility and give a longer-lens look at valuation extremes. As of December 2025, the Shiller CAPE sits above 35, a level that has only been seen twice in modern history: the Great Depression market crash and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\n\nThe last time the US saw the CAPE ratio reach these current levels was in early 2000, right before the stock-market crash. At that peak, investors were paying extreme premiums for stocks based on the expectation (think hope) that internet companies would continue to just deliver on their unprecedented growth. History reminds us that the reality of what took place was that these companies did not enjoy unstoppable growth and that the market declined 49% over a 2.5-year period, the NASDAQ fell 78%, and it took 7 years to recover.\nThe CAPE ratio's predictive power comes from understanding long-term perspectives, and unlike traditional P/E ratios that can be distorted by temporary earnings spikes or collapses, the CAPE ratio looks with a wide lens at a full decade of earnings. When this ratio does hit 30, it can be a historical signal that stocks are priced for perfection and have almost no room for disappointment.\n\nWhat makes the current signal particularly troubling is that it isn't just existing in a silo. Instead, it's appearing alongside three other late-cycle indicators like three consecutive years of double-digit S&P 500 gains, forward P/E ratios at 40-year highs, extreme concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks, and retail investor enthusiasm that feels eerily like the dot-com bubble. While no single indicator is going to be definitive, the combination of all three suggests that a major reversal could be on the horizon, and an entire generation of investors has never experienced what happens when valuations are this stretched.\nHistory's Verdict: A Reversal is Coming - How Smart Investors Respond History is pretty unambiguous about what can happen when an extreme CAPE reading is taking place. For one, you might be in a position that creates a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. At the 1929 stock peak, stocks fell 89% over three years, and again in 2000, you had the 49% S&P 500 drop over 2.5 years. What a drop might look like in the near future is unknown, but the pattern that occurred during these two previous instances of extreme valuations resolving through major corrections seems to be all too familiar to what we're going through now with AI.\n\nFor investors, this could be the strategic opportunity they have been waiting for rather than a situation full of panic. The mistake during previous bubbles wasn't recognizing that stocks were not expensive, but it was remaining fully invested at those prices and then panic-selling at the bottom. The smart approach today is about recognizing that current valuations create a situation where the downside potential far exceeds any upside of staying fully invested.\nBuilding a cash reserve now so investors can \"buy the dip,\" as the saying goes, is arguably the best move, to the tune of upward of 30% of a portfolio being liquidated for cash or put into short-term bonds. If the market does decline by 40-50% from current levels, this cash can be invested into companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA at valuations these companies haven't experienced in years. This could give investors a chance to double their position size.\n\nThe key here is going to be the right amount of discipline, as history shows that bear market pain isn't the actual decline itself, it's the psychology of trying to understand how to buy at the bottom. If the market falls 30%, there might be a voice going on that says it's going to 50% and if it falls 50%, total economic collapse might be the voice on the news. In other words, investors should have capital reserved for buying during these panics so they can ignore the noise and acquire quality companies at steep discounts and prepare for the next decade's best returns.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Talks reportedly broke down with Blue Owl Capital over plans to build a $10 billion data center in Michigan. The Larry Ellison-owned tech giant signed a huge deal with OpenAI this year. Oracle has borrowed heavily to build its AI infrastructure but its rising debt has concerned some investors. Nvidia aims to start shipping its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February. That's what three sources told Reuters, who added the firm said it plans to add new production capacity for the semiconductors. The Trump administration allowed sales of Nvidia's H200 chips to China this month. Although Beijing has yet to approve any purchases of it. SoftBank is reportedly racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by the end of the year. Sources said the Japanese investor has explored cash-raising schemes, including a sale of some investments. The company has already sold all of its $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia. Softbank agreed a deal to invest $300 billion in OpenAI this year in one of the biggest bets yet made by CEO Masayoshi Son. UPS-owned company Happy Returns is using AI to spot fakes in holiday boxless returns. The firm says nearly one in every 10 retail items returned for a refund in the U.S. is fraudulent. Its AI tool helps to find fraudulent returns by flagging suspicious packages, analyzing their contents, and sending them for final audit by humans. David Sobie is CEO of Happy Returns. “Retailers are under a tremendous amount of pressure, pressure from a cost perspective and pressure from a return fraud perspective. And so those are two areas that we're really trying to help them alleviate.\" And around 25,000 people have shown interest in joining the Trump administration's so-called Tech Force. That's according to a U.S. government official - Reuters couldn't independently verify the figure. Washington wants to hire staff with AI expertise in federal roles. The candidates will compete for 1,000 spots in the first Tech Force cohort. Recruits will spend two years working on tech projects inside federal agencies.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Finance and YCharts. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio . EPS = earnings per share. Data as of Dec. 23, 2025.\nNvidia: The dominant maker of AI chips and related tech Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), its flagship semiconductors, are considered the gold standard for training artificial intelligence (AI) models and deploying AI applications.\nThe company's data center platform had been performing well for quite some time. But demand began skyrocketing for its AI-enabling products -- its GPUs and high-performance networking products -- soon after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. This event demonstrated to company leaders and the general public the phenomenal capabilities of generative AI.\n\nIn late October at the company's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, D.C., CEO Jensen Huang said that management has \"visibility\" into $500 billion of demand for its key data center technology over the next five quarters . This demand of $100 billion per quarter, on average, is truly mind-blowing. As context, in its fiscal third quarter (ended late October), Nvidia's total revenue was $57.0 billion, of which $51.2 billion was from the data center platform.\nBroadcom: The leading maker of custom AI chips Broadcom develops semiconductors for various end markets and also develops infrastructure software.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's robust growth is being drven by strong demand for its custom AI-enabling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and Ethernet networking products, both for data centers. Its acquisition of software maker VMware in late 2023 is proving to be a shrewd move, as this business is also growing nicely.\n\nBroadcom is the top partner for big tech companies seeking custom ASICs. As the name suggests, these chips are designed for specific applications. These include internal uses and, in some cases, for availability in their cloud computing services. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs can be considered more general-purpose AI chips. There is a need for both GPUs and ASICs, so investors shouldn't be concerned that one of these types of chips will fully win out over the other.\nTSM: The world's largest chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest chip foundry. That means it produces chips of various types for companies that contract out all or some of the manufacturing of chips they design.\nTSM is the largest producer of AI chips worldwide, which has led to significant financial growth in recent years, driven by surging demand for these chips.\n\nTSM's customers include nearly every major chip company, such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which is Nvidia's main rival in the AI-enabling GPU market. Moreover, it also manufactures chips, including AI chips, for major tech companies that have designed their own chips. This includes Apple , widely considered the company's largest customer, though some Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to soon overtake Apple as TSM's top customer.\nAn added benefit for some investors is that TSM pays a decent dividend for a tech company. The dividend yield was 1.13%, as of the close of the market on Dec. 23.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\n\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\n\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory Continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE\nBefore heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms -- Walden International and Walden Catalyst -- did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO\nBorn in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\n\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\n\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\n\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\n\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL\nSo far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\n\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Nvidia Stock Is Up 31% in 2025, But Here's Another Super Semiconductor Stock to Buy in 2026, According to Wall Street\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 2:38 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nWSFX.BO\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Nvidia continues to experience incredible demand for its data center chips.\nMicron Technology supplies high-bandwidth memory for data centers, which Nvidia has integrated into its GPUs.\nMicron stock has tripled in 2025, but it still looks cheap.\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which are the main chips used to develop artificial intelligence (AI). The company is seeing more demand for its products than it can possibly supply, which is fueling a huge surge in its revenue and earnings.\n\nWith just one week left in 2025, Nvidia stock is sitting on a return of nearly 37%. But it has been trounced by another AI semiconductor stock, which is up by an eye-popping 229% this year: Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) . This company supplies memory and storage chips that are critical for AI workloads in data centers, computers, and even smartphones.\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 43 analysts who cover Micron stock, and the overwhelming majority think it's a buy heading into 2026. In fact, not a single analyst recommends selling. Here's why it could be a great addition to any portfolio for the new year.\nNvidia is one of Micron's many AI customers High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is needed to unlock the best performance from every data center GPU because it stores information in a ready state, which accelerates processing speeds. A low memory capacity can cause bottlenecks by forcing the GPU to pause its computations while it waits to receive more data, whereas a high capacity keeps data flowing constantly. This is especially important in data-intensive AI workloads.\n\nMicron's HBM3E data center solution offers 50% more capacity than the competition, while consuming 30% less energy. This is a winning combination for AI developers that want the best performance at the lowest cost, which is why Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are using it in their latest GPUs.\nMicron is now preparing to ramp up production of its new HBM4E solution, which could offer up to 60% more capacity with a further 20% improvement in energy efficiency. The company says that its entire supply is already sold out for the calendar year 2026. But this opportunity is only just starting to heat up. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra expects the market for data center HBM to almost triple in value by 2028, reaching $100 billion annually.\nWhile data centers are certainly Micron's biggest opportunity right now, many top manufacturers of personal computers and smartphones are integrating AI capabilities into their latest devices. This is fueling more demand for high-capacity memory in those markets, too.\n\nStory Continues\nDuring Micron's fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended Nov. 27, 2025), 59% of its customers' flagship smartphones needed at least 12 gigabytes of memory. That percentage more than doubled from the year-ago period.\nMicron's data center revenue is soaring Micron generated a record $13.6 billion in revenue during its fiscal 2026 first quarter, which was up 56% year over year. But the real growth story was beneath the surface of the headline number, because revenue from the company's cloud memory segment (where it accounts for data center HBM sales) doubled to $5.3 billion.\n\nSince Micron is experiencing so much demand for its chips, it had incredible pricing power during Q1, which led to improved profit margins across its entire business. As a result, the company generated earnings of $4.60 per share, which was a whopping 175% jump from the year-ago period.\nMicron's momentum is still picking up steam. According to its latest guidance, the company expects to generate $18.7 billion in revenue during the current fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ends Feb. 28, 2026), representing an increase of 132% year over year. In other words, Micron's top-line growth rate is poised to more than double from Q1.\nThe company also anticipates a blockbuster bottom-line result in Q2, with earnings of $8.19 per share potentially in the cards. That would be a mind-blowing 480% increase year over year.\n\nMicron stock looks cheap compared to Nvidia stock Out of the 43 analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal , 30 have given Micron stock a buy rating. Nine others are in the overweight (bullish) camp, while three recommend holding. Although one analyst has given the stock an underweight (bearish) rating, none recommend outright selling.\nThe analysts have an average price target of $308.11, suggesting that the stock could climb by 16% over the next 12 to 18 months. However, the Street-high target of $500 implies an even bigger potential return of 88%.\n\nI think both of those targets are realistic because Micron stock looks like a bargain right now, despite tripling in value so far in 2025. Based on the company's trailing 12-month earnings of $10.52 per share, its stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 25.2. That means it's significantly cheaper than Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/E ratio of 44.8 as I write this.\nAs I highlighted earlier, Nvidia uses Micron's data center HBM solutions in its latest GPUs, so if you expect Nvidia to continue selling truckloads of chips (which is likely), then it's only logical to be extremely bullish on Micron's business as well.\nI wouldn't recommend selling Nvidia stock , because it also looks attractive right now. But Micron stock could be an even better way for investors to play the AI boom in 2026 from a value perspective.\n\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now?

Few companies sit as squarely at the center of today’s most important secular trend.\nDemand for Nvidia’s GPUs appears either secular or, if cyclical, still early enough that a downturn is not yet a concern. Roughly half a trillion dollars is expected to flow into AI-related capital spending next year, and Nvidia’s chips are estimated to account for roughly 20% of that investment. That scale underscores both the company’s dominance and the durability of its demand backdrop.\n\nAfter several months of consolidation, Nvidia shares have begun to reaccelerate, recently breaking out from a well-defined technical pattern. At the same time, analysts have continued to raise earnings estimates, earning the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) . Improving clarity around US–China semiconductor trade policies has also removed a near-term overhang, reopening a source of demand that had previously been constrained.\nBelow, we outline the outlook for the world’s largest publicly traded company and explain why Nvidia remains well positioned to continue leading the market going forward.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia Shares Bolstered by Strong Growth Forecasts Growth expectations for Nvidia remain exceptional. Sales are projected to rise roughly 63% next year and another 43% in 2027, reflecting an incredible $100 billion jump from one year to the next. On the bottom line, earnings are expected to climb 55.5% next year and 53% the following year, underscoring the company’s powerful operating leverage.\n\nWhat also makes this growth profile compelling is valuation. Despite its dominance and momentum, Nvidia trades at about 39.5x forward earnings. With consensus estimates calling for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, the stock carries a PEG ratio of roughly 0.85, a level typically associated with undervalued growth stocks, not the world’s most important AI supplier.\nIn other words, investors are not paying a premium commensurate with Nvidia’s growth trajectory. If current forecasts hold, valuation support alone provides a cushion, while continued execution on revenue, margins, and ecosystem expansion offers meaningful upside.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia Stock Breaks Out Nvidia shares staged a decisive breakout this week, resolving higher from a well-defined descending bullish wedge, a pattern that typically signals trend continuation. After several months of consolidation, the stock has clearly regained momentum, suggesting selling pressure has been absorbed and buyers are regaining control.\n\nStory continues\nWith the breakout now confirmed, the technical setup points to a renewed push higher, and a retest of record highs in the near term would not be surprising. Importantly, this move is occurring alongside rising earnings estimates and improving fundamental visibility, reinforcing the signal and increasing the likelihood that the breakout proves durable.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nCan Investors Buy Shares in NVDA? Given the combination of accelerating earnings growth, reasonable valuation relative to its growth profile, and a confirmed technical breakout, Nvidia remains an attractive buy for investors with a medium- to long-term horizon. The stock has spent several months consolidating prior gains, allowing fundamentals to catch up to price, and that process now appears complete.\n\nWhile near-term volatility is always possible, particularly in a stock that has already delivered outsized returns, the underlying setup argues that pullbacks are more likely to be opportunities rather than warning signs. With earnings estimates still moving higher, demand visibility extending well into next year, and technical momentum turning decisively positive, Nvidia continues to justify its leadership position in the market and remains the core holding in the AI theme.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Sold Nvidia and Palantir and Piled Into One of Wall Street's Hottest Drug Stocks Ahead of 2026\n\nSean Williams, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:11 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Quarterly-filed Form 13Fs allow investors to track which stocks Wall Street's savviest money managers are buying and selling.\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller dumped his fund's stakes in AI darlings Nvidia and Palantir -- and profit-taking may not explain the entire story.\nMeanwhile, Duquesne's investment chief has scooped up shares of an inexpensive drugmaker for five consecutive quarters.\n10 stocks we like better than Teva Pharmaceutical Industries ›\n\nFor the better part of the last three years, no trend has garnered more attention on Wall Street than artificial intelligence (AI) . Empowering software and systems with the tools to make split-second decisions, all without the need for human oversight, is a technological advancement that can benefit most industries around the globe -- and the stock market's savviest money managers know it.\nNo later than 45 calendar days following the end of a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F details which stocks Wall Street's brightest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter.\nAs you can imagine, the stock market's AI darlings, graphics processing unit (GPU) titan Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) giant Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) , have been top-tier holdings for several fund managers. But this optimism isn't universal.\nDuquesne Family Office's billionaire boss, Stanley Druckenmiller, exited his fund's positions in Nvidia and Palantir well in advance of 2026 . Instead of focusing on AI, Druckenmiller has been busy piling into one of Wall Street's hottest drug stocks for five consecutive quarters.\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller showed Nvidia and Palantir to the door Since the beginning of 2023, Nvidia and Palantir have made their patient shareholders considerably richer. Nvidia became the first public company to reach the $5 trillion market cap plateau earlier this year, while shares of Palantir have climbed by more than 2,900%!\nThese near-parabolic ascents reflect the seemingly sustainable moats that both companies hold dear. Nvidia's Hopper, Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra GPUs have been superior, on a compute basis, to external competition. With AI infrastructure demand outpacing supply, and CEO Jensen Huang intent on bringing a new GPU to market annually, Nvidia hasn't had any trouble charging a premium price for its hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, Palantir's AI-driven Gotham and Foundry SaaS platforms lack one-for-one replacements at scale. Gotham assists the U.S. government and its allies in planning and overseeing military missions, as well as in collecting and analyzing data. The multiyear contracts Palantir has signed with the U.S. government ensure predictable double-digit sales growth and abundant operating cash flow.\n\nLa historia continúa\nDespite these sustainable moats, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller parted ways with both stocks. He jettisoned his fund's remaining stake of 214,060 shares of Nvidia during the September-ended quarter of 2024. As for Palantir, 769,965 shares were shown to the door in a nine-month stretch between July 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025.\n\nDruckenmiller dumping the faces of the AI revolution may represent nothing more than simple profit-taking. According to 13F aggregator WhaleWisdom.com, the average hold time for every security in Duquesne Family Office's fund, as of Sept. 30, was less than seven months. This demonstrates the willingness of its investment chief to take profits when the opportunity presents itself.\nThe concern is that there may be more to this selling activity than just a desire to cash in his chips.\nFor example, history tells us that every game-changing technological advancement over the last three decades, including the internet, genome decoding, nanotechnology, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse, has navigated an early stage bubble-bursting event. Although it's impossible to forecast when the music will stop, the common theme has been an overestimation by investors of the adoption rate and/or optimization of a new technology.\n\nWhile Nvidia's and Palantir's sales growth point to robust demand for their respective products and services, most businesses that are aggressively spending on AI have yet to optimize their solutions. In other words, companies deploying AI haven't figured out how to get the highest return out of their investment. It takes time for all technologies to mature and evolve. If an AI bubble forms and subsequently bursts, Nvidia and Palantir stocks would be in trouble.\nFurthermore, the valuations for Wall Street's favorite AI duo are suspect. Historically, price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 for companies at the forefront of next-big-thing innovations have been unsustainable over the long run. Though Nvidia, briefly, topped a P/S ratio of 30 in early November, it's Palantir's P/S ratio of 127, as of the closing bell on Dec. 19, which stands out like a sore thumb.\nDuquesne's billionaire boss has loaded up on shares of this drug stock ahead of 2026 At the other end of the spectrum, Duquesne Family Office's lead investor has continued to scoop up shares of brand-name and generic-drug developer Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE: TEVA) . Shares of Teva have soared by 191% since the beginning of 2024.\nDruckenmiller began loading up on shares of this drug stock during the second half of 2024 and simply hasn't stopped. Between July 1, 2024, and Sept. 30, 2025, 13Fs show:\n\nQ3 2024 : 1,427,950 shares purchased\nQ4 2024 : 7,569,450 shares purchased\nQ1 2025 : 5,882,350 shares purchased\nQ2 2025 : 1,089,189 shares purchased\nQ3 2025 : 625,000 shares purchased (16,593,935 total shares held)\nIn 15 months, Teva has become the third-largest holding by market value in the nearly $4.1 billion fund Druckenmiller oversees.\nOne reason for this optimism likely has to do with Teva working through a series of legal overhangs. In particular, the company resolved litigation in early 2023 with 48 states regarding its role in the opioid crisis. Quantifying this settlement and spreading it out over 13 years alleviated the company's financial concerns, allowing investors to refocus on Teva's innovative capabilities.\nSpeaking of innovation, CEO Richard Francis has made waves by shifting his company's focus toward novel drug development. While Teva continues to be a key player in the global generic drug market, the pricing power of generics hasn't been great for years. Developing brand-name therapies affords Teva improved pricing power and considerably higher margins. For instance, in 2025, tardive dyskinesia drug Austedo is expected to bring in more than $2 billion in global sales.\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical has also vastly improved its balance sheet over the last nine years.\nFollowing the buyout of generic drug company Actavis in August 2016, Teva's net debt surpassed $35 billion. But under the leadership of turnaround specialist CEO Kare Schultz, who preceded Richard Francis, the company lowered its annual operating expenses, sold off non-core assets, and significantly reduced its net debt. As of the end of the third quarter of 2025, Teva's net debt has been more than halved to $14.6 billion.\nLastly, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller was likely drawn to Teva's valuation amid a historically expensive stock market. Though it's trading at a still-reasonable 11 times forward-year earnings per share, as of this writing, Duquesne's billionaire boss began scooping up shares with Teva trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio as low as 5.\n\nShould you buy stock in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries right now?

On December 22, Reuters reported that Nvidia has told its Chinese clients that it aims to start shipping its H200 AI chips to China before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February.\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, the AI chipmaker will fulfil initial orders from existing stock, with shipments anticipated to total 5,000 to 10,000 chip modules. This is equivalent to about 40,000 to 80,000 H200 AI chips.\nMeanwhile, the company plans on adding new production capacity for the chips. Orders for the new capacity will open in the second quarter of 2026, the sources revealed.\nWhile Nvidia is gearing up to export its second-most powerful AI chips to its Chinese clients, uncertainty still looms as Beijing is yet to approve any H200 purchases and the said timeline is contingent on government decisions.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 10 Years?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's business model has become extremely overexposed to the generative AI hardware market.\nCan new tech trends like autonomous driving, robotics, and quantum computing boost diversification?\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe most resilient businesses constantly reinvent themselves, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is an excellent example of this phenomenon. Its ability to quickly dominate new technology opportunities is a big reason why it has soared to become the largest company in the world with a market cap of $4.4 trillion. And even though generative artificial intelligence (AI) is behind most of the recent expansion, the boom might not last forever. Let's explore what might come next for this legendary chipmaker.\n\nNvidia has a track record of reinventing itself Since its founding in 1993, Nvidia has reliably banked on new use cases for the graphics processing unit (GPU) -- a technology that it named and pioneered for its proficiency in parallel processing, which involves breaking down large tasks into smaller parts and working on them simultaneously. Parallel processing turned out to be extremely useful for rendering video game graphics. And in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Nvidia became a major player in the industry, supplying consumer GPU chips for PCs and even Microsoft 's early Xbox gaming consoles.\n\nNvidia boomed again in the 2010s when people realized that its GPUs were also extremely good at cryptocurrency mining . Cryptocurrency miners relied on the same PC-focused GPUs as gaming, and both growth drivers were included in the company's gaming segment, which was historically the bulk of revenue. However, things have changed.\nWith the growth of generative AI, Nvidia's once-vital gaming segment has become an afterthought, representing a measly 7.5% of the company's $57 billion in third-quarter revenue. The company is now massively dependent on its data center segment, where it sells large enterprise-focused GPU systems to help clients run and train AI large language models (LLMs). This business represented around 90% of Q3 revenue, which suggests Nvidia lacks diversification and is extremely overexposed to a potential slowdown in this particular market.\n\nThe generative AI boom might not last forever While AI-related demand continues to soar year over year, some cracks are forming in the foundation of this opportunity. For starters, many of Nvidia's customers are burning through mountains of cash -- the best example is OpenAI. The ChatGPT creator is estimated to have lost $11.5 billion in its most recent quarter alone. And analysts at Deutsche Bank think the situation could worsen with combined losses totaling $140 billion between 2024 and 2029. It's reasonable to assume that other LLM companies like Anthropic could be experiencing similar cash burn.\n\nStory Continues\nAs a hardware provider, Nvidia operates on the picks and shovels side of the AI equation, shielding it from the challenges faced by some of its clients. That said, over the long term, this will eventually become Nvidia's problem, too. If the LLM clients continue burning money, they could run out of the funds needed to continue buying Nvidia hardware.\nCompared to pure plays like OpenAI, Nvidia's hyperscaler clients like Amazon , Google , and Microsoft are in a better position to absorb AI losses because of their diversified business models. However, over time, their shareholders could push back at their current levels of GPU spending. Furthermore, these companies are turning into major rivals for Nvidia because of their investments in custom chip design.\n\nThis month, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI signed a deal with Amazon to use its chips for training AI workloads. This development follows a similar agreement with Google.\nWhat comes next for Nvidia? Nvidia's challenges seem to be reflected in its rock-bottom forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23. This valuation is low considering the company's strong growth, and it suggests the market is nervous about the sustainability of Nvidia's current business model. Over the next ten years, the company might have to reinvent itself yet again. The good news is that there are some compelling options.\n\nIn Q3, revenue in Nvidia's automotive and robotics segment grew 32% to $592 million. While this is a drop in the bucket compared to its total business, this could become a key growth driver if self-driving cars and humanoid robots become an important part of daily life.\nThe company is also working on quantum computing chips called quantum processing units (QPUs), which could help with things like materials science and drug discovery. That said, this all remains quite speculative, and investors may want to wait for more signs that Nvidia is diversifying its business model before considering a position in the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Could Investing $10,000 in Nvidia Make You a Millionaire?\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 3:37 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia has an edge in artificial intelligence (AI) as it rolls out integrated computing options.\nIt continues to grow at a fast rate and generate healthy profits.\nIt's unlikely to reproduce its past gains.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an incredible stock to own over its lifetime. Although it has become a household name for its artificial intelligence (AI) products in recent years, it has been developing powerful technology for decades. If you had invested $10,000 in its stock at different times, you could have been a millionaire or more today. For example, if you had invested $10,000 in Nvidia stock 10 years ago, you'd have $2.2 million by now, Dec. 22, 2025.\nCan Nvidia still make you a millionaire? Let's check it out.\nThe gateway to AI Nvidia has been building its technology empire for decades, honing its semiconductors to power systems that require high processing power and graphics, like gaming. It was already a star stock before AI transformed the world as we know it, but it was relatively obscure outside the investing community.\n\nThat focus put it into an excellent position to support the growth of generative AI, which requires the kind of power that Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) provide, although there are many competitors today, including other kinds of chips like Alphabet 's Tensor Processing Units (TPU) and Broadcom 's application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC). However, it's a lot more than GPUs these days, and it continues to stay ahead of the curve and launch new products and systems. Its clients are reliant on its CUDA (compute unified device architecture) software and vertically integrated program that creates a robust economic moat; users are already invested in its systems.\nThis ecosystem is Nvidia's edge, and this is where the company is investing. It has incredible opportunities in data centers, which are huge AI factories using a suite of Nvidia services. These generate the compute and inference power necessary to process the huge data loads that make AI happen.\n\nIt recently rolled out a line of quantum computing hardware, including supercomputers that harness the power of quantum processing units (QPU). These kinds of integrated and hybrid solutions, in which it excels and has an unparalleled program, are fast becoming Nvidia's niche.\nDespite new competition, it still can't keep up with consumer demand. Sales increased 62% year over year in the 2026 fiscal third quarter (ended Oct. 26), and management is expecting sales to increase 65% in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's why it continues to report incredible growth, quarter after quarter. And because it has such a lead in its space, it can price its products at a high gross margin, which translates into a healthy and growing bottom line; gross margin was 73.6% in the third quarter, and earnings per share (EPS) were up from $0.81 to $1.30.\n\nCan Nvidia keep up its growth? Turning $10,000 into $1 million implies growing it a hundredfold, or 10,000%. Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world today, worth $4.3 trillion. It doesn't seem possible for it to gain 10,000% at its stage today, even very far off into the future.\nStock gains typically follow percentage growth, and although Nvidia is still reporting impressive growth, it's hard to imagine it being able to sustain that momentum in percentage terms, even if it keeps increasing in dollar terms. For example, it has $187 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. At a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of even 30% over the next 10 years, which is well below where it's holding today, sales would surpass $2.5 trillion, which doesn't seem like a likely outcome; at some point, the growth rate must decline. As growth slows down, stock gains are going to as well.\n\nEven this year, Nvidia stock is up 35%. While that's still about double the stock market's gain, it's a steep deceleration from the past two years.\nI don't envision a $10,000 investment in Nvidia stock turning into $1 million at this stage, but it could still deliver market-beating results for the growth-oriented investor.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "SoundHound AI vs. GitLab: Which Stock Is the Better 2026 Rebound Candidate?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:26 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SOUN\n\nGTLB\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points SoundHound AI and GitLab both saw their stocks underperform in 2025.\nSoundHound has a big opportunity with voice-powered artificial intelligence (AI) agents.\nInvestors are overestimating the potential negative impact of AI on GitLab and underestimating its opportunity.\n10 stocks we like better than SoundHound AI ›\n\nThe stocks of SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) and GitLab (NASDAQ: GTLB) have both had a rough go in 2025. The former trades down more than 40% on the year, as of this writing, while the latter has lost more than 30% of its value.\nHowever, both stocks could be poised to rebound in 2026. Let's take a close look to see which one has the better opportunity to outperform next year.\nThe case for SoundHoundAI SoundHound's underperformance in 2025 has more to do with investors learning that Nvidia exited the position it took in the stock in Q4 2024 than it does with the company's actual performance. SoundHound has been growing its revenue rapidly, with it more than doubling through the first nine months of the year.\n\nThe company has established itself as a leader in voice artificial intelligence (AI) , as its \"speech-to-meaning\" and \"deep meaning understanding\" technology can understand someone's intent even before they are finished talking, allowing it to interact with people in a more natural and flowing way. This helped it gain strong traction in the automobile industry, where vehicle makers were looking for better AI voice assistants, as well as the restaurant industry.\nHowever, as we enter 2026, the company's biggest opportunity is with voice-powered AI agents. The company acquired a company called Amelia, which was strong in virtual agents, and has since combined the two companies' technologies to make a push with AI voice-powered agents. Amelia also brought with it a solid customer base in different verticals, such as retail, financial services, and healthcare.\n\nSoundHound is now pushing its AI agent technology with the rollout of its Amelia 7 platform. Amelia has some low- gross-margin customers, so this new platform is also an opportunity to improve the margins at Amelia's legacy customers.\nThe case for GitLab Like SoundHound, GitLab's stock performance in 2025 wasn't really reflective of its operating results. The company has grown its revenue by between 25% to 35% for each of the last nine quarters, showing its strong consistency.\nHowever, the company has been subject to the narrative that it will be an AI loser, with the notion that AI agents will replace coders. For those unfamiliar with GitLab, it runs a DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) platform, which is a secure environment for organizations to create software. The bearish argument is that with AI, organizations will reduce their number of programmers, which will hurt GitLab and its seat-based subscription model.\n\nStory Continues\nThus far, that hasn't been the case, with the company continuing to both add new customers and see strong growth with existing customers, as reflected in its 119% dollar-based net retention over the past 12 months. Any number above 100% reflects growth from customers who have been with the company for a year or more, after any churn.\n\nIronically, the bulk of this growth has come from seat expansions, which is exactly what bears are betting will start to deteriorate. It hasn't, but the stock nonetheless hasn't been able to shake the bearish case.\nHowever, the company has also been taking steps to protect itself if such a scenario unfolds. It recently introduced a hybrid seat-plus-usage-based model, which should also help drive growth. The company's solution has become more valuable with the introduction of its own AI tools, such as Duo Agent, and it is now much more of a comprehensive end-to-end software development life cycle (SDLC) platform that saves coders time and customers money.\nMeanwhile, the stock is very attractively valued, trading at a price-to-sales multiple of just 5.7 times fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027) analyst estimates for a company with high 80% gross margins and strong mid-20% revenue growth.\n\nThe verdict I think that SoundHound and GitLab can both nicely rebound in 2026. However, my pick to outperform is GitLab.\nI think the market is overestimating the potential negative impact of AI on GitLab and underestimating its opportunity. I think the platform is sticky (as evidenced by its net dollar retention), and that the new pricing model could be a nice growth driver, as will continued Duo Agent adoption, which nicely expands ARPU (average revenue per user).\n\nMeanwhile, there aren't going to be all these AI agents running around unchecked, as they too will need to be managed and audited within the confines of a centralized platform like the one offered by GitLab. The stock is too cheap, and I think the bear case fades away with another year of strong revenue growth.\nShould you buy stock in SoundHound AI right now?

Stocking stuffers tend to range from gift cards and gadgets to corny holiday-themed sweaters. But just imagine if you’d unwrapped $10,000 worth of Nvidia (NVDA) stock last December instead of a nice pair of socks.\nThat wouldn’t just be a lovely gift. It would be a gift that keeps on giving.\n\nMore News from Barchart Will Tesla Stock Lose Its ‘Elon Musk Premium’ After the SpaceX IPO? And You Should Sell TSLA Here?\n‘Top Pick’ Amazon Had a Dismal Year: What’s AMZN Stock’s Forecast for 2026?\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nNvidia is riding high on the back of the global artificial intelligence boom, and the company’s value has maintained a steady and impressive upward trajectory throughout the year.\nSo, how much would that gift be worth today? And more importantly, what does Nvidia’s performance in 2025 tell us about investor expectations moving into 2026?\nThe Math: What $10,000 of Nvidia at Christmas 2024 Would Be Worth Now Before we look at why this year was a watershed for Nvidia (and the entire semiconductor market), let’s crunch the numbers.\nNvidia’s shares were trading in the neighborhood of $140 each last Christmas. That means an initial $10,000 investment would have bagged you about 71.4 shares.\nNow, fast-forward to December 2025. Nvidia’s rally hasn’t slowed down. The company continues to beat earnings forecasts and remains dominant in the AI sector. The market is loving it.\n\nOn Monday morning, Nvidia’s shares were trading at $180.99. That would make your 71.4 shares from last year worth just over $12,922. You’re looking at a 29% gain.\nOK: That’s nothing like the rally Nvidia saw in 2024, and it doesn’t compare with the run we’ve seen from fellow AI wunderkind Palantir (PLTR) this year. But 29% is still nothing to scoff at, right?\nThe truth is Nvidia’s 2025 rally hasn’t been a smooth journey.\nWhat Has 2025 Looked Like for Nvidia? This has generally been a good year for Nvidia investors. But 2025 wasn’t without its ups and downs.\nIn 2024, the company executed a split that made its shares a lot more accessible to retail investors. But that liquidity didn’t just boost accessibility. It also expanded Nvidia’s investor base and created extra demand for shares. That meant less free float and more upward pressure on its share prices.\n\nNvidia’s sales teams were also dealing with high demand.\nEvery corporation wants a taste of AI right now. It’s become embedded in the infrastructure of enterprise computing, cloud services, and generative models everywhere. Over the past couple of years, Nvidia’s GPUs have emerged as the default hardware for a lot of large-scale models and inference workloads.\n\nStory Continues\nThat’s why its revenues from data center sales eclipsed every other business segment in 2025, driving consecutive earnings beats and pushing Nvidia to become the world’s most valuable company (for a little while, anyway).\nIt seems like a lot of investors just treated Nvidia shares as a proxy for AI exposure in 2025. And that confidence was only increased when management initiated a buyback program.\n\nBut Nvidia’s been a victim of market volatility this year. That has more to do with speculation surrounding a broader AI bubble rather than the company’s fundamentals.\nIn November, price action saw some big pullbacks. Michael Burry bought almost $200 million in put options against Nvidia, and he’s not the only one betting against the company’s value. That’s why 2026 may be a make-or-break year for shareholders.\nWhat’s on the Horizon for Nvidia in 2026? Now that 2025 is nearly in the rearview mirror, market chatter has already started for 2026. The key issue for Nvidia is the balance between AI adoption and saturation.\nEverybody agrees that AI adoption is real. But many investors like Burry are now debating its breadth and pace. To maintain its value and sustain sales, Nvidia needs industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services to accelerate their GPU deployments. If growth shifts to software layers over hardware, Nvidia is likely to be hurt.\n\nThen there’s competition dynamics. AI chip makers aren’t sitting still. If competitors generate meaningful gains, it’ll force Nvidia to accelerate its own R&D (or defend its pricing). The problem? Its margins are already under pressure.\nHigh-growth companies tend to see expanding margins as they scale up. But sustained investment pushes costs higher, too. There’s a good chance retail investors will get tired of Nvidia’s steep run, and then the narrative could shift to profit-taking instead of accumulation.\nThat wouldn’t necessarily be a bearish signal, but it would be a significant rotation dynamic leading to more price volatility.\nAt the end of the day, a $10,000 Christmas gift of Nvidia stock in 2024 would have generated good tidings in the here and now. Nvidia wasn’t just hype in 2025, and the company delivered measurable growth over the last 12 months.\n\nBut looking ahead into the New Year, the picture is a little bit fuzzier. The sentiment for 2026 is one of cautious optimism because AI isn’t slowing down. But the competition in this space is huge, and a lot of big-time investors are already pricing Nvidia’s next chapter. They’re actively betting against Nvidia and the wider AI boom.\nOnly time will tell if those bets pay off, because right now Nvidia is still looking like the Christmas gift that keeps on giving.\nOn the date of publication, Nash Riggins did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ).\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta ( META ) Reality Labs' new design studio .\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times , Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\nCook is steering a $4 trillion behemoth Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nStory Continues\nCook's decisions drove Apple's stock price ever higher. As a result, the company's market cap has increased from $1 trillion in 2018 to a whopping $4 trillion in 2025.\nRevenue has also continued its steady upward pace, with Apple reporting $416 billion in total sales for its fiscal 2025, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nApple is also reportedly preparing some of the biggest changes in years to its iPhone lineup in 2026. According to Gurman , the company will roll out a foldable iPhone, a first for Apple, in the latter half of the year.\n\nThat could help further goose already record iPhone sales. Apple is also reportedly preparing a new low-cost MacBook model, which would open up the company to a broader customer segment.\nAnd while it may not have the same margins as a high-powered MacBook Pro, a lower-cost MacBook could still help draw more customers to Apple's services, driving increased revenue over the long run.\n\nNew challenges ahead If Ternus is chosen to succeed Cook, he'll inherit an Apple at the peak of its power. While smartphone sales have slowed over time, the company is reaping the benefits of its massive install base, which still upgrades devices every few years and increasingly subscribes to Apple's various services.\n\nBut he'll also have to navigate his share of headaches. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting some kind of movement on Apple's AI strategy. And though the company is making progress on its AI rollout, it still needs to showcase its next-generation version of Siri.\nHe'll also have to prepare to take on the likes of Meta, Google, and Samsung ( 005930.KS ) in the smart glasses space. Meta already has two smart glasses on the market, and Google and Samsung are each working on their own intelligent eyewear.\nFor now, though, Cook is still Apple's CEO. We'll just have to see if that changes in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Which Tech Titan Will Win the Quantum Race (and Net You 100% Returns)?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:43 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points You can pick small quantum computing stocks if you want high-risk, high-reward plays.\nBut tech giants are safer plays, and Nvidia's AI chips are pivotal for the quantum build-out.\nNvidia's NVentures is buying stakes in various quantum companies as part of its strategy.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nBig tech's scramble to win the artificial intelligence (AI) race has taken some of the focus off quantum computing stocks and a potential upcoming boom. Last year, the Boston Consulting Group projected that quantum computing can create up to $850 billion of economic value by 2040. Tech giants have invested heavily in the space, with Google's Willow Chip being able to reduce errors exponentially.\nIt's unknown when quantum computing will have mainstream applications, but if this technology is perfected, it will be able to perform complex calculations and solve major problems that current computing can't. Quantum computing could result in major drug discoveries, encrypted codes getting solved, and business optimizations.\nQuantum computing means new chips and data centers. AI chips and data centers that handle AI workloads are not suitable for a quantum computing boom. That means many of the AI winners could also turn into quantum computing winners.\nSo, investing in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might be the best way to ride the quantum boom. Even with its current successes, Nvidia can still double from current levels if it gets quantum computing right. Let's see why.\nNvidia is already working on quantum Nvidia won't get caught behind other chipmakers in the upcoming quantum race. The company has established a reputation as the best AI chipmaker , and it's already set on becoming a leader in the quantum industry.\nNvidia recently announced NVQLink, which bridges the gap from AI chips to quantum computers. The company has already partnered with 17 quantum builders and nine scientific labs for this project. It's developing the software and digital infrastructure that will be necessary for a quantum boom.\n\nWhile Nvidia isn't developing a quantum chip right now, that may change as quantum computing gets closer to mainstream use. AI chips are already necessary for quantum infrastructure, but quantum chips are more advanced and are also needed. Quantum data centers will need both types of chips. Nvidia is already the clear winner on the AI side, and it has more money than its competitors to invest into research and development for quantum chips.\nNvidia is also investing in quantum computing companies Nvidia isn't just advancing its own quantum computing technology, but it is also buying stakes in quantum computing companies through NVentures. The company's venture capital arm invested in three quantum computing companies in the first half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nEven if Nvidia doesn't capitalize on quantum computing as much as expected, its investments can still pay off. Nvidia can also provide those companies with some of the resources they need to achieve higher returns.\nQuantum computing stocks like IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum show how much quantum computing investments can soar in a short time. All three of these growth stocks have rallied by more than 1,000% over the past three years. Those types of gains make it more plausible for Nvidia to double in value as quantum computing becomes a mainstream resource.\n\nNvidia wins regardless of which quantum computing companies win Nvidia isn't trying to create an innovative business that revolves around quantum computing. It's just selling picks and shovels in the middle of a gold rush. Nvidia produces the digital infrastructure and chips for companies that want to build out business models involving quantum computing.\n\nIf Nvidia wants to make quantum chips and additional tools for the industry, it can tap into a strong balance sheet and growing revenue. Nvidia generated $57 billion of revenue in its fiscal 2026's third quarter, up by 62% year over year. Net income came in at $31.8 billion, which represents a 59% increase. Nvidia makes more profits per quarter than the market caps of pure-play quantum computing stocks like IonQ.\nNvidia also closed out the quarter with $116.5 billion in total current assets. The AI chipmaker already has a lead in quantum since it has the best AI chips. However, it has plenty of capital ready to go if it wants to make a bigger push into quantum computing.\nSmaller quantum computing stocks may outperform Nvidia, but the latter already has a proven business model that brings in cold, hard cash.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $502,783 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,126,057 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 975 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Applied Digital Is Building the Compute Power That AI Needs. Could the Stock Surge Next?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: APLD\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Applied Digital is in the right place at the right time as AI spending ramps up.\nIts ability to achieve projects on time and on budget may help it win over the trust of big tech companies.\nA single deal could add billions of dollars to Applied Digital's balance sheet, and the company is in a position to sign several big deals.\n10 stocks we like better than Applied Digital ›\n\nArtificial intelligence is revolutionizing the world. AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT quickly became mainstream, with autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots on the way. All of these innovations require AI chips, which is why investors have been loading up on semiconductor stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom .\nThese AI chips work, but there's one big problem. They all require significant power to operate. AI models and innovations require gigawatts to operate, and traditional data centers aren't cutting it. Those buildings aren't optimized for AI workloads, and that's where AI data center providers like Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) come in.\nApplied Digital has roughly 4 gigawatts worth of data center capacity at the moment, and that could translate into billions of dollars in annual recurring revenue once it's all set up and deals have been established. Applied Digital has already entered three lease agreements with CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) , with the total revenue coming to approximately $11 billion over 15 years.\nThe leases cover 400 megawatts, and Applied Digital's 4 gigawatt pipeline suggests the company could support nine additional deals like the CoreWeave contract. Here's why Applied Digital could expand beyond CoreWeave and continue to win over tech giants.\nThe AI race is intense The key players in the AI race have all committed to spending more money on this technology. Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , and Meta Platforms are some of the top players in the industry. These companies generate billions of dollars in quarterly profits and view AI as the next internet boom.\nAI models, autonomous vehicles , and humanoid robots have the potential to change how people shop and interact with the world. Companies know the potential of AI and have already thrown a lot of money at Nvidia. Now, they are increasingly looking at the energy bottleneck that companies like Applied Digital solve.\n\nRight now, Applied Digital makes almost all of its AI revenue from CoreWeave. Other AI data center providers like Iren (NASDAQ: IREN) and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) have made deals with Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and other tech companies. It's fair to assume Applied Digital will land deals like that in the future, especially since it has proven to be a trustworthy option for CoreWeave.\n\nStory Continues\nApplied Digital is a leading data center builder Timelines are critical for maintaining a lead in the AI race, and Applied Digital is doing its part. The AI data center provider told investors that its 100 MW building at Polaris Forge 1 is nearing completion while remaining on time and on budget.\nFulfilling project benchmarks will help Applied Digital build more trust with tech giants. Applied Digital Chairman and CEO Wes Cummins also views it that way.\n\n\"We feel this third lease validates our platform and execution, positioning Applied Digital as a trusted strategic partner to the world's largest technology companies,\" Cummins said in the Q3 press release. \"With hyperscalers expected to invest approximately $350 billion into AI deployment this year, we believe we are in a prime position to serve as the modern-day picks and shovels of the intelligence era.\"\nApplied Digital's 4-gigawatt pipeline also puts it ahead of most AI data center stocks. Iren has approximately 3 gigawatts in its pipeline, while Cipher Mining has 3.2 gigawatts in its pipeline. Applied Digital has the lead, which will come in handy once data centers are built and tech companies scramble to sign big deals.\n\nNew deals can happen quickly and suddenly change the long-term view Applied Digital has a 15-year contract with CoreWeave for $11 billion that covers 400 megawatts. It's a big contract, but it's not the only one in the industry. Iren signed a five-year, $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft for 200 megawatts. Cipher Mining also signed a 15-year deal with Amazon Web Services for $5.5 billion, and that contract covers 300 megawatts.\n\nA single deal adds billions of dollars to an AI data center provider's revenue. These are long-term agreements that result in steady recurring revenue. When Applied Digital has all 4 gigawatts ready to go, it can support enough deals to make billions of dollars each year. The company may have only made $64 million in Q1 FY26, but revenue growth should compound quickly based on the CoreWeave leases and future deals. That development sets the stage for Applied Digital stock to continue its rally.\nShould you buy stock in Applied Digital right now?

      "Content": "What Is One of the Best Chip Stocks to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nDavid Moadel\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:26 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nBABAF\n\nBABA\n\nNVDA\n\nQuick Read Alibaba (BABA) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) MI308 AI accelerators.\nAMD stock looks compelling as Advanced Micro Devices recently demonstrated 35.6% year-over-year revenue growth and 61.2% income growth.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nOver the next decade, you'll surely want to own at least one artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock. You might assume that all you need is NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) stock and nothing else. However, even though NVIDIA is the market's darling, your best pick could actually be Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) stock.\nEven though it's a giant company, Advanced Micro Devices is an underdog in some respects. Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn't a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks.\nThis isn't to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we'll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential.\n\nIssues With AMD Stock One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn't pay a dividend. Consequently, you'll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit.\nMeanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices' valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x .\n\nIn addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock's price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices.\nThose are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here.\nBesides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don't have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let's perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices' financial health.\nBooming Sales, Zooming Profits Advanced Micro Devices' high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you'll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don't own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years.\n\nStory Continues\nAll in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company's results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025.\nImpressively, Advanced Micro Devices' net revenue grew 35.6% year over year, from $6.819 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $9.246 billion. Nearly half of that revenue stemmed from Advanced Micro Devices' Data Center segment; this suggests that the company continues to benefit from AI-associated sales.\n\nTurning to the bottom-line results, Advanced Micro Devices' net income surged 61.2%, from $771 in the year-earlier quarter to $1.243 billion. Also during that time frame, the company's cash and cash equivalents increased 27%, from $3.787 billion to $4.808 billion. So evidently, Advanced Micro Devices remains a cash-rich chipmaker that's on a powerful growth trajectory.\nMaking Headway in China While U.S. chip sales are crucial to Advanced Micro Devices' business model, it definitely appears that the company is making headway in China's chip market. To be more specific, Alibaba ( NASDAQ:BABA ) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices' MI308 AI accelerators.\n\nThis is important because investors need to think globally, not just locally, over the next 10 years. China is a major chip market, and Advanced Micro Devices has a long-term growth opportunity there.\nAdvanced Micro Devices made a savvy move in designing its MI308 chips to be compatible with export restrictions. Furthermore, the company has secured export licenses for these chips and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. on approved sales in China.\nAlso, it's a positive sign that Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently met with Chinese Commerce ​Minister Wang ‌Wentao in Beijing. They \"exchanged views on the company's business ⁠development in ​China and ​strengthening cooperation with China,\" according to the ‍ministry.\n\nSure, NVIDIA is also making headway into China's chip market. At the same time, however, NVDA stock may have already priced in the company's progress in this region.\nIn contrast, Advanced Micro Devices' growth story in China is still developing and the market needs time to recognize this. Give it a few years, and you should see AMD stock reflect strong chip sales in both the U.S. and China.\nGive AMD Stock a Chance In the final analysis, there's no need to overload your portfolio with AMD stock. Just holding a moderately sized share position for 10 years will, most likely, put you in a profitable position without undue risk.\nWhile Advanced Micro Devices doesn't pay a dividend and appears overvalued at first glance, I still encourage you to give the company a chance. If AI chip sales remain strong and Advanced Micro Devices keeps on growing its sales and profits, there's an attractive reward-to-risk profile here for buy-and-hold investors.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected. If you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, take 5 minutes to learn more here .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The narrative leans on powerful margins and a premium future earnings multiple. Curious how those moving parts combine into one bold valuation call? The full breakdown reveals the exact assumptions driving that fair value line.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $235 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, slower AI spending or tougher export rules could compress margins and delay growth and may challenge the idea that today’s price still offers clear upside.\nFind out about the key risks to this NVIDIA narrative.\nAnother Lens on Value While the narrative sees NVDA as 21.8% undervalued, our price to earnings work paints a more cautious picture. The current 45x P/E is richer than the US semiconductor sector at 36.7x, though still below peers at 60.3x and a fair ratio of 58.3x. This leaves room for both upside and de rating risk if sentiment turns.\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own NVIDIA Narrative If you see the numbers differently or want to dig into the details yourself, you can shape a full Nvidia story in just minutes with Do it your way .\n\nStory Continues\nA great starting point for your NVIDIA research is our analysis highlighting 2 key rewards and 2 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\nLooking for more investment ideas?

Nowadays, many investors find themselves having that thought about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- me included. And when you look at its performance over the past decade, it's very easy to see why.\nIn the past 10 years, Nvidia's stock is up an eye-popping 22,420%, meaning a $1,000 investment made a decade ago would be worth over $225,000. Talk about a return on investment.\nNvidia has been on the stock market since January 1999, but the bulk of its gains since then have come in the past few years, thanks to the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. For a while, Nvidia's main business was supplying graphics cards for video games. However, the company realized that the same technology was useful for processing massive amounts of data, and it's now arguably the most important supplier of computing power.\n\nIf you're interested in investing in Nvidia, it's not too late. However, I wouldn't expect its gains over the next decade to compare with those from this past decade. It still has long-term market-beating potential, but expecting the gains to replicate is asking a lot.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Google is less than $200B away from surpassing Apple as the world’s second-largest company.\nGoogle holds four of the top 10 AI models on LLMArena. OpenAI’s best model ranks eighth.\nMeta is negotiating billions in purchases of Google’s TPUs. Anthropic already bought 1 million TPUs from Google instead of buying from Nvidia (NVDA).\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) as the world's second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street.\nThere are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI \"replacing\" the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals.\n\nLet's take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026.\nGoogle is firing on all cylinders Google was supposed to \"die\" after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can.\nThen, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI \"Bard\" rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in \"code red\" mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards.\n\nIf you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI's sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each.\nIf you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI's GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn't spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) have gone into net debt.\nWhy Google's search business will never be replaced If Google's rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated.\nAs for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with.\n\nIn contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it.\nNvidia's AI GPUs at risk? Software isn't Alphabet's only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia's near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient.\nMeta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth \"billions of dollars,\" with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia's coffers instead.\n\nThe threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google's AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating.\nCould Google become the biggest company in 2026? I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world's largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030.\n\nNvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Applied Digital vs. CoreWeave: Better Stock to Own in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 9:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CRWV\n\nAPLD\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points CoreWeave and Applied Digital both had strong performances in 2025.\nDemand for CoreWeave's AI cloud services is through the roof.\nApplied Digital, meanwhile, is providing the specialized buildings and access to power for neocloud providers.\n10 stocks we like better than Applied Digital ›\nWhile Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) and CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) both saw their stocks go on roller-coaster rides in 2025, they were also two of the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) stock winners this year. The two companies also have close ties, as CoreWeave is a big customer of Applied Digital.\nLet's examine which stock could be set to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for CoreWeave CoreWeave is a next-generation neocloud company. Neocloud operators differ from traditional cloud computing companies in that they are specialized to handle large language model (LLM) training and running AI inference. CoreWeave has a close relationship with Nvidia that gives it access to its newest high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Its main business is essentially renting out GPUs as a service, but it also provides storage, high-speed networking, and managed services.\n\nCurrently, cloud computing demand for AI services is through the roof, and CoreWeave is spending aggressively to try to keep up with demand. It plans to more than double its capital expenditures (capex) next year. The company is currently using an 80/20 joint venture model to grow rapidly while having control over its spending. However, demand is so high that the company has reportedly had to turn away business, including an estimated $40 billion to $50 billion from Microsoft .\nAs long as CoreWeave's data center projects remain on schedule, the company should see hypergrowth in 2026. Citigroup has recently said its checks indicate that the company's capacity is already sold out for 2026, and it's already in discussions with customers for booking out early 2027.\n\nWhile the stock has had a strong run after its initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year, it is still more than 50% off its all-time high hit in the spring. That suggests the stock has plenty of opportunity to run.\nThe case for Applied Digital While CoreWeave operates next-generation data centers, Applied Digital helps build and manage them. It's essentially the builder and landlord. Notably, these are specialized buildings designed to handle the intense heat and power requirements of AI data centers.\nApplied Digital not only handles building the physical shell, but it also designs the cooling systems and provides the power. One of the biggest bottlenecks with building out AI infrastructure is the lack of power; however, that is where Applied Digital shines. The company was previously a Bitcoin miner, so it already had campuses with access to cheap, stable power. Meanwhile, it has said that companies with access to power but without its high-end data center building expertise are increasingly turning to it to team up.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's primary business is colocation, where companies like CoreWeave lease out space and gain access to power at its facilities using their own hardware. In fact, it has an $11 billion contract with CoreWeave for such services. However, it will also rent out GPUs to companies that prefer not to own their own servers.\n\nApplied Digital has close ties to Macquarie , which is helping fund its campus expansion. The company completed phase 1 of the first building at its Polaris Forge 1 campus in North Dakota in late October and its second phase in November, giving CoreWeave access to the first 100 megawatts of power of its 400 megawatt deployment. It also recently signed a $5 billion lease with a customer for its future Polaris 2 campus.\nThe verdict Both CoreWeave and Applied Digital are set to see hypergrowth in 2026 and beyond. Meanwhile, the two companies are pretty intertwined at the moment. That makes it a tough call as to which will outperform next year, but I give the edge to Applied Digital, as access to cheap power is such a valuable resource in today's environment.\n\nShould you buy stock in Applied Digital right now?

Will Political Hurdles Derail the Plan?\n\nKara Greenberg\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 8:57 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Takeaways Nvidia reportedly hopes to sell its H200 AI chips in China as soon as February, after winning President Donald Trump's approval in exchange for a 25% revenue-sharing agreement.\nHowever, the chip's export to China could still face challenges in the U.S., as well as in China, injecting uncertainty into expectations around sales.\n\nNvidia finally won President Donald Trump's approval to sell its H200 AI chips in China, but will it be able to seal the deal?\nThe company looks to sell the chip in China as soon as February, Reuters reported Monday, after President Trump greenlighted the chip earlier this month in exchange for a 25% revenue-sharing agreement. But uncertainty over whether U.S. lawmakers or China's government will allow the sales has weighed on investor confidence that the sales will happen.\nThe H200 chip, which is a generation behind Nvidia's Blackwell line , had been banned for sale to China on national security concerns, and its export to the country still faces vocal bipartisan opposition in the U.S., along with potential challenges in China.\n\nWhy This Matters for Investors Caught in the crosshairs of U.S.-China relations, exports of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China remain restricted. The chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom has argued that limiting China's access could hurt America’s competitiveness by driving Chinese firms to develop stronger products.\n\nSince Trump announced the H200 deal in early December, U.S. lawmakers ‌from both parties have pushed back with demands for more oversight and bills that could block sales. On Friday, House Republicans introduced a bill that would allow Congress to block advanced AI chip exports, a day after House Democrats proposed a bill that would prohibit sales of America's most advanced chips to China and other countries of concern.\nChinese officials also have yet to approve H200 sales in the country, with analysts warning China's government could discourage firms from buying the chips, as it has with the H20 , a weaker chip that Trump approved for export earlier this year.\nIn a note to clients Monday, analysts at Jefferies voiced some skepticism about whether the chip would be allowed, and that if it is, whether it could come with additional requirements for Chinese firms or a limited quota system.\n\"We do expect there is considerable opportunity for [Nvidia] if they are permitted to re-enter the market, but at this point it still seems unlikely to happen,\" Jefferies said following the announcement earlier this month.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia shares were up 2% in late-morning trading Tuesday. The stock has gained 40% in 2025, handily outpacing the performance of major stock indexes, but has lost 12% of its value since hitting an all-time high in late October.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "An X-Ray View of the Magnificent Seven\n\nJohn Dorfman\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:38 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBy John Dorfman December 22, 2025 (Maple Hill Syndicate)\nFor the past three years, a huge share of the stock market's action has been in the Magnificent Seven , a small group of super-successful, super-popular stocks.\nThere are signs of fatigue in this leadership group. But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

Now, I I'm sure you saw the photos of Waymo getting stuck in San Francisco with the power outage. And my first thought was, I this is everything that could go wrong with a Tesla Robo-taxi.\n00:27 Dan\nLook, my view is 2026 is going to be probably the most important year, I'd say maybe in its history for Musk and Tesla. Because look, the autonomous chapter now comes to Tesla.\n00:46 Dan\n30 cities where we see robo-taxis, you know, ultimately in the United States. Are there going to be issues? Are there going to be speed bumps? Could there be delays here and there? Yeah, I mean, obviously you saw the blackout in terms of Waymo and San Francisco. But look, I think next three to four years, 20% of vehicles are going to be autonomous. And I think that ultimately is where it's heading. And that's why I think when it comes to physical AI plays, the best physical AI plays in the world are Nvidia and Tesla.\n01:31 Speaker A\nHow much value, Dan, are you assigning to Tesla's robotics initiatives?\n01:41 Dan\nA trillion is what conservatively we view. I mean look, if you, S, if you own Tesla here, you're not owning it for what deliveries look like on Jan 2nd, right? I mean, you're owning it for autonomous Robo-taxis. and we talk about bull case 3 trillion, base case 2 trillion. Now look, if I showed you a year ago where numbers were going to go for Tesla this year, you would have thought the stocks 200, 250 bucks. The reality is that investors are looking through deliveries and near-term numbers to understand what the autonomous chapter is going to ultimately bring. because I could argue numbers could be up 4 or 5X when you look out over the next four, five, six years. I think that's the way that to to view a name like Tesla.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Right present, insiders don't seem very confident in either stock.Even if the transactions went through, analysts still believe both companies are attractive investments. They claim this is because there is still a lot of need for chips for AI and data centers.

      "Content": "Is SoundHound AI Stock a Buy Now?\n\nChris Neiger, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 6:53 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SOUN\n\nCMG\n\nNVDA\n\n005380.KS\n\nKey Points SoundHound is unprofitable, and some of its core expenses are rising quickly.\nThe company is burning through cash as it tries to carve out a niche in conversational AI.\nSoundHound's stock is expensive, and investors are probably better off avoiding it for right now.\n10 stocks we like better than SoundHound AI ›\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has captured the attention of artificial intelligence (AI) investors over the past few years because of the company's impressive conversational AI technology. The company has attracted an impressive customer list, including Chipotle and Hyundai, and an initial investment from Nvidia gave the company even more credibility in a sea of other AI stocks .\nBut recently, SoundHound stock has lost its luster. Nvidia sold its stake, and some investors grew concerned about the company's lack of profits, resulting in SoundHound's share price tumbling 43% over the past year. While the recent pullback may seem like a good buying opportunity, here's why investors shouldn't bet on SoundHound AI stock just yet.\n1. The company is unprofitable and expenses are rising SoundHound recently reported its third-quarter results, with the company's revenue rising 68% to $42 million. That was more than the $40 million in revenue that Wall Street had estimated for the quarter, which gave investors some assurance the company was on the right track.\nBut one glaring problem is that SoundHound is still significantly unprofitable and costs are rising. The company reported a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.03 in the quarter, a slight improvement from its loss of $0.04 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nHowever, even with this improvement, it's important to note that SoundHound's expenses are still rising. If we look at SoundHound's third-quarter non-GAAP expenses, which don't include a $66 million non-cash change in liabilities related to acquisitions, there are still considerable rising costs:\nSpending Category\nQ3 2024\nQ3 2025\nYear-Over-Year Increase\nResearch and development\n$19.5 million\n$22.8 million\n17%\nSales and marketing\n$8.4 million\n$16.4 million\n95%\nGeneral and administrative\n$17 million\n$24.3 million\n43%\n\nSource: SoundHound AI.\nWith SoundHound's costs rising so quickly, the company's increasing sales become less impressive, and it's clear the company likely isn't close to being profitable any time soon.\n2. It's burning through cash SoundHound AI is in a highly competitive market, and it's burning through cash to be there. In the first nine months of 2025, SoundHound's free cash flow was negative $78.7 million, which was worse than its negative free cash flow of $76.3 million in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's concerning that, despite SoundHound's rising sales, the company's free cash flow is moving in the wrong direction. The company is failing to achieve operational leverage, as each new dollar it earns costs roughly the same as it did before.\nIt's unclear how long SoundHound will be able to sustain its massive spending to grow the company before it either has to cut back on spending, substantially increase revenue, or raise additional capital. While SoundHound has $269 million in cash and no debt, continued aggressive spending will eventually hurt the company if its losses don't narrow.\n\n3. SoundHound AI's stock is too expensive If all of that weren't enough of a red flag for buying SoundHound AI, its stock is also overpriced. The company's shares have a price-to-sales ratio of about 30 right now, which is very expensive considering the average P/S ratio in the technology sector is about 9.\nAn overpriced AI stock isn't exactly a rarity these days, but plenty of other technology companies are betting big on AI right now and are also profitable. I think it's challenging to justify SoundHound AI's overpriced shares, given its continued spending, increasing expenses, and the company's prolonged path to profitability.\n\nShould you buy stock in SoundHound AI right now?

COR.\n4 Stocks Trading Near 52-Week Highs with More Upside Potential Investors generally consider a stock's 52-week high a good criterion for an entry or exit point. Stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.\nMoreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculation is not absolutely baseless, not all stocks hitting a 52-week high are necessarily overpriced.\n\nInvestors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.\nStocks such as NVIDIA , Ralph Lauren , Expedia and Cencora, Inc. are expected to maintain their momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to determine whether there is scope for further upside.\nHere, we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The technique borrows from the basics of momentum investing and bets on \"buy high, sell higher.\"\n52-Week High: A Good Indicator Many times, stocks that hit a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.\nOvervaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach this level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions, which encouraged investors to bet on these stocks, could keep them motivated if there are no tangible negatives. In other words, the momentum might continue.\n\nAlso, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their underreaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.\nHere are our four picks out of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen:\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of AI and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA's Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. This Zacks Rank #1 company's networking business, including NVLink and Spectrum-X, is also contributing to growth by enabling faster and more efficient data movement within AI clusters. These add-ons make NVIDIA's full-stack approach more appealing to enterprises and governments building AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nThe continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with more than 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicle space. We expect NVIDIA's revenues to witness a CAGR of 31% through fiscal 2026-2028.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #1 stock has returned 25.5% in the past six-month period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.77%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA's fiscal 2026 earnings has moved north by 4% to $4.64 per share over the past 60 days.\nRalph Lauren continues to benefit from its iconic brand portfolio, constant product innovations and disciplined execution of its Next Great Chapter strategy. The company is accelerating its digital transformation by enhancing personalization, strengthening data-driven decision-making and delivering seamless omnichannel experiences.\nRalph Lauren is optimizing distribution, strengthening wholesale partnerships and enhancing its retail network to reinforce its premium positioning. The company has been experiencing significant growth in its digital channels across key regions. Leveraging advanced analytics, RL customizes product recommendations, optimizes pricing and sharpens its regional marketing strategies to drive stronger consumer engagement and profitability.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 stock has returned 34% in the past six-month period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.82%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RL's fiscal 2026 earnings has moved north by 3% to $15.41 per share over the past 60 days.\nExpedia 's strong brand portfolio, comprising Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, Travelocity, ebookers and Wotif Group, to name a few, offers a full range of travel and advertising services to travelers, suppliers and business partners. The company benefits from a strong platform model that enhances customer insights, strengthens supplier ties and helps grow revenues.\nExpedia looks like a compelling buy for 2026 following strong third-quarter 2025 results. The company's $7.57 adjusted EPS beat estimates, and gross bookings grew 12%. The company raised its full-year 2025 guidance to 7% bookings growth and doubled EBITDA margin expansion projections to 200 basis points, demonstrating operational excellence.\n\nExpedia's December 2025 acquisition of Tiqets strengthens its B2B segment, which delivered its 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth at 26%. With AI integration enhancing efficiency, hotel bookings surging 15%, and room nights growing 11%, this Zacks Rank #1 company's diversified platform positions it to capitalize on robust travel demand and expanding profit margins throughout 2026.\nThis stock has surged 74.4% in the past six-month period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.53%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EXPE's 2025 earnings has moved north by 6.8% to $15.09 per share over the past 60 days.\nCencora is navigating a pivotal growth phase, balancing robust revenue expansion with structural margin challenges. Specialty expansion, notably through RCA and OneOncology, strengthens its clinical and distribution footprint and boosts higher-margin opportunities. The company recently agreed to acquire a majority of the remaining equity interests in OneOncology — a physician-led national platform that supports independent oncology practices — from TPG and other shareholders for $3.6 billion.\n\nCOR issued its fiscal 2026 adjusted EPS outlook to be in the $17.45-$17.75 range, implying 9-11% growth. Ongoing investments in digital infrastructure, analytics, productivity programs, and strategic growth areas such as specialty distribution and MSO platforms are expected to enhance operational efficiency, deepen customer integration and sustain long-term competitive advantage.\nThis Zacks Rank #2 stock has returned 16.3% in the past six-month period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.36%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for COR's fiscal 2026 earnings has moved north by 1.4% to $17.62 per share over the past 60 days.\nGet the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

      "Content": "The S&P 500’s Rare 40-Year Valuation Warning: Economic Slowdown Is Confirmed by Federal Reserve\n\nDavid Beren\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:55 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered what can only be described as a strong year to date, extending a rally that has rewarded investors for staying the course through inflation, rate hikes, and geopolitical uncertainty. On the surface, by all accounts, the market looks healthy as stocks continue climbing and corporate earnings remain strong. Similarly, optimism around artificial intelligence and an easier monetary policy has kept an appetite for the stock market intact.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 now trades at 22.4x forward earnings. This valuation has only occurred twice in the past 40 years.\nFederal Reserve research shows tariff policies will reduce annual GDP growth by 0.3% to 0.5% over the next two years.\nProfit margins are near historical highs with limited expansion room while earnings forecasts for 2026 remain modest.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnderneath all of this performance, however, there is something of a growing concern as the same market producing double-digit gains is now trading at approximately 22.4 times forward earnings, a valuation number the country has only seen twice in the last 40 years. At the same time, you have new Federal Reserve research indicating that tariff policies will slow economic growth in a fairly substantial way over the next two years.\nWhen these extremes collide, it's cause for concern, but when combined with weakening fundamentals, history suggests that investors need to pay closer attention, even if the market appears to be mostly calm.\nThe Market Paradox: High Gains Amidst Tariff Uncertainty As you look at the 16% S&P 500 gain year to date, it not only reflects a level of continued optimism but also highlights that there are several key areas worth watching. At the top of any list has to be artificial intelligence, which continues to drive a ton of enthusiasm for technology stocks, particularly for names like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ).\n\nAdditionally, you have the Federal Reserve and its efforts to shift from rate hikes to rate cuts, which is helping to improve the situation for equity investments by making future earnings more valuable and reducing the competition from stocks and bonds, where people shifted money when interest rates were high.\nIf you have invested in the market, so far, so good, as you have been able to enjoy the financial benefits of a 16% market increase. The market has, as it often does, rewarded those who go full force ahead, all while punishing those who were too cautious and missed out on these returns.\n\nStory Continues\nStill, you can't ignore that the Federal Reserve's recent indicators around the impact of tariffs are going to give a whole lot of investors a reality check in the not-too-distant future. The Fed's analysis indicates that tariff policies could reduce annual GDP growth from anywhere between 0.3% and 0.5% over the next two years. On paper, this might sound small, but the resulting loss in growth is substantial. What's worse is that this isn't a speculative conclusion. It's based entirely on comprehensive economic modeling according to the Fed, so it's going to happen, it's just a matter of when.\n\nOnly Seen Twice: The 22.4x Forward Earnings Warning Unsurprisingly, the S&P 500's current forward P/E ratio of 22.4 as a red flag puts the market in the uncomfortable spot of being among the most expensive valuations in the last four decades. Considering that the historical average sits between 15 and 16, this current number is 40% higher, which leads to investors having to pay more for the same dollar of earnings than they have in the past.\n\nMore notable is that this scenario has only played out twice in the last 40 years, during the late 1990s tech boom and the 2021 pandemic stimulus period. If you are a student of financial history, you know that neither instance ended well for investors who bought at peak valuations, as the tech bubble crashed 49% between 2000 and 2002, while the 2021 pandemic peak was followed by a 25% decrease.\nWhile there is cause for concern, it's also necessary to highlight that high valuations do not automatically mean that economic conditions are not strong. If earnings are growing rapidly, which they are, and business conditions are improving, investors can make a justification for paying a premium for future growth. The flag here is that none of these conditions exist right now, including profit margins expanding, so earnings forecasts for 2026 are pretty modest. Profit margins, in particular, are close to historical highs, so there isn't a lot of room for expansion, and according to the Fed, business conditions are about to get worse.\n\nThe 22.4 forward P/E reflects an optimism for investors that doesn't really align with any reality the Fed is describing. It assumes continued strong earnings growth and stable margins, and when those assumptions break or uncertainty increases, valuations are going to reset lower as investors decide they no longer want to pay premiums for companies that have falling fundamentals.\nTariff Impact: Fed Study Predicts Slowed Growth and Market Headwinds The Fed's research on tariff impacts is likely to be the clearest warning sign about what could potentially happen next year with the economy. From its study, we learned that both the direct and indirect effects of tariffs across multiple sectors are going to slow US economic growth in a measurable and meaningful way in the next 24 months.\n\nAs data and detail-heavy as this all is, the math is pretty clear as tariffs increase input costs for manufacturers and force companies to either absorb the cost, impacting margins, or pass the expense onto consumers, which reduces overall demand. It won't surprise anyone to consider that both scenarios likely result in economic compression. If there is a higher input cost, there is less capital for companies to expand, hire, etc., and higher consumer prices reduce overall purchasing power, especially for middle and lower-income households that spend a lot of money on the exact kinds of goods that tariffs will hit hardest.\nThe research also highlighted the uncertainty that is going to impact overall business planning, even before tariffs have been fully implemented. Companies are undoubtedly going to keep delaying capital expenditures if there is even a hint of concern over clarity as to what trade rules could look like in six months. What's worse is that supply chain managers can't commit to long-term contracts when tariff policy shifts weekly. All of this comes together as slowed investment for companies as hiring plans are put on hold and any expansion projects get delayed, perhaps indefinitely.\n\nFor the stock market, any instance of slower economic growth is going to translate into weaker earnings. Corporate revenue is tied directly to economic activity, and even if GDP growth falls from 2% to 1.5%, which may not sound like a lot, it has a big impact. When sales fall, so too do profits, and when profits start to disappoint, stock prices are going to directly reflect investor concerns. Arguably, the biggest takeaway for investors is that the Fed's research all but confirms that the economics surrounding stock prices is about to weaken, perhaps significantly. This is going to translate to the kind of headwind that even the momentum of a few large-cap names can't overcome.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

TSMC stood out again, growing revenue 41% from a year earlier and lifting its market share to 39%. The gains were fueled by a faster ramp in 3nm production and near-full utilization of 4nm and 5nm lines, largely tied to AI chip demand from Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), AMD ( NASDAQ:AMD ), and Broadcom.\n\nWarning!

      "Content": "What is the China upside potential for Nvidia and AMD?\n\nVahid Karaahmetovic\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 3:16 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nInvesting.com -- Recent reports around a potential resumption of GPU sales to China have reopened the debate over how much upside U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD could see if export approvals materialize.\nAccording to Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold, assessing the exact outcome is challenging as several moving parts remain. But in an optimistic scenario, Leopold estimates AMD could generate roughly $500 million to $800 million in incremental revenue, translating into about $0.10 to $0.20 of non-GAAP EPS upside.\n\nFor Nvidia, the potential is materially larger, with an estimated $7 billion to $12.5 billion in additional revenue, or about $0.15 to $0.30 of non-GAAP EPS upside in 2026.\n“Questions remain regarding whether the Chinese government will allow or discourage its cloud operators from purchasing advanced GPUs, as well as how the U.S. government’s export license fee will be accounted for,” Leopold wrote.\nFor AMD, market speculation has centered on China-compliant accelerator orders tied to Alibaba, with reports pointing to 40,000 to 50,000 MI308 units. At the midpoint, Leopold notes that “a $15,000 chip could equate to $675M in sales,” likely spread across multiple quarters.\nHowever, uncertainty remains around approval timing, ramp linearity and whether China enforces restrictions on American AI semiconductors.\n\nThe required 15% payment to the U.S. government introduces accounting complexity around pricing and accounting.\nWhile modest relative to AMD’s total revenue base, momentum could build as roadmap execution continues and China-compliant offerings gain traction, Leopold said.\nNvidia faces a similar dynamic, with speculation focused on a limited resumption of H200 GPU shipments to large Chinese hyperscalers and internet companies.\nEven modest volumes could be meaningful, as “tens of thousands of units” at estimated average selling prices (ASPs) of $20,000 to $25,000, and up to roughly 350,000 to 500,000 units over time, could drive billions of dollars in incremental revenue.\nLeopold stresses that China remains a relatively small part of Nvidia’s overall data center business, with growth primarily driven by U.S. hyperscalers, sovereign AI and enterprise customers as newer platforms ramp through 2026.\n\n“We continue to view AI infrastructure as a multi-trilliondollar opportunity over the next decade, with Nvidia well positioned to sustain industry-leading growth, margins, and dominant share in data center accelerators, and we reiterate our Strong Buy rating,” he wrote.\nRelated articles\nWhat is the China upside potential for Nvidia and AMD?\n\nStory Continues\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Investors viewed the luxury electric vehicle (EV) maker as a potentially bold new challenger to Tesla , poised to ride the wave of EV adoption. The company's ambitious vision, cutting-edge technology, and sleek designs had captured attention.\nHowever, things haven't gone as planned. After an initial surge in 2021 that saw the stock reach impressive heights, momentum has faded, and Lucid's stock is now down 98% from its all-time high. The optimism that once surrounded the company has waned as investors focus on execution, competition, and evolving EV adoption rates.\nAs Lucid Group looks to regain its footing and get back on track, here's what investors should know about it before buying.\nLucid's growing vehicle lineup Lucid Group manufactures luxury EVs, targeting an affluent customer base. The company aims to establish itself as a premium brand in the competitive automotive industry by committing to delivering a high-quality driving experience.\nIts top-selling vehicle is the Lucid Air Sedan, the best-selling EV sedan in the U.S., outpacing the Tesla Model S. The automaker also offers the Lucid Gravity, an electric SUV with seating for up to seven adults and an EPA-estimated driving range of 450 miles.\n\nFurthermore, management confirmed that the high-volume Midsize Platform, which aims to compete with popular models like the Tesla Model 3, remains on track to begin production in late 2026. This is Lucid's mass-market product and is a crucial step in enabling Lucid to scale production and improve gross margins.\nLucid is making moves in the robotaxi space In other news, Lucid announced an initiative to accelerate its path to full autonomy in a collaboration with Nvidia . This partnership positions Lucid to deliver one of the world's first privately owned passenger vehicles with Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE AV platform.\n\nAlso, Uber Technologies announced a $300 million investment in Lucid Group. This investment is part of Uber's plan to launch driverless rides in the San Francisco Bay Area late next year, using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro's self-driving technology. This move puts Lucid's vehicles in direct competition with other robotaxi services. Uber plans to put 20,000 or more Lucid's self-driving SUVs on the road over six years.\n\nLa historia continúa\nHere's what Lucid investors need to watch While this news is positive for Lucid Group, the company continues to burn cash as it scales up. The good news is that revenue is up 45% from last year. The bad news is that it continues to lose significant money. Through Sept. 30, the EV maker has an operating loss of $2.4 billion, up slightly from the prior year. This was against a total revenue of $834 million.\nNot only that, but the current regulatory environment isn't favorable to EV manufacturers, either. The Trump administration is resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards to levels achievable by conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles. This action reverses what the Trump administration said was the Biden administration's \"unrealistic fuel economy targets that effectively resulted in an electric vehicle mandate,\" potentially reducing the regulatory push to shift consumers to EVs.\n\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Lucid Group to Underweight from Equal Weight and sharply cut its price target. This decision was based on a more cautious industry outlook, with the analyst stating that the electric vehicle \"winter\" will remain through 2026.\nMore progress is needed Lucid Group is making progress on its large-scale EV product and autonomous driving capabilities. However, the company continues to burn cash and could face headwinds in the near future. Changing regulations and shifting consumer preferences could lead to an \"EV winter\" according to Morgan Stanley, which would weigh on Lucid over the next year or so.\n\nLucid has earned praise for its vehicles, thanks to their industry-leading range, luxury design, and technology. That said, the company is still losing money, which should make investors hesitant. I'd like to see improvements in its efficiency and bottom line before purchasing the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lucid Group right now?

As of this writing, Nvidia's stock is up around 30%, while Alphabet has turned in a 60% gain.\nLet's see which stock is poised to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Nvidia Where artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending heads, Nvidia's stock is likely to follow. The company is the dominant player in the space with its graphics processing units (GPUs), and while competition has increased, no one is close to unseating the king. It still has a wide moat with its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code has been written, while its recent acquisition of SchedMD will only help widen its software moat.\nMeanwhile, its NVLink interconnect system helps prevent vendor mixing and matching because it's a proprietary system that lets its GPUs quickly pass along data and pool memory, allowing an AI cluster to act as a single powerful unit.\nMeanwhile, the setup for the company looks attractive heading into 2026. All the major cloud computing companies have discussed ramping up data center capex spending next year, which bodes well for it. At the same time, the U.S. just gave it the green light to start selling its H200 chip to commercial Chinese customers, reopening a big market for it. In addition, large customer OpenAI is close to closing $100 billion in new funding, which should help it with its aggressive AI data center buildout.\n\nOn top of that, Nvidia's stock is attractively valued, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 23 times 2026 analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 0.7 times. Positive PEGs below 1 are generally viewed as undervalued.\nThe case for Alphabet Alphabet's biggest advantage is that it is the one major hyperscaler (owner of large data centers) that isn't largely reliant on Nvidia. The company developed its own custom AI chips over a decade ago, and today most of its internal workloads are run on its tensor processing units (TPUs). That has given the company both a cost advantage with its cloud computing business, as well as with training its Gemini large language model (LLM) and running AI inference.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Cloud has been a huge growth driver for Alphabet, and that should only continue in 2026 as the unit has been capacity-constrained. Alphabet has been spending aggressively, which should result in Google Cloud's growth accelerating. Alphabet also made an under-the-radar move the past couple of years with its chips that could lead to big growth.\n\nTPUs were originally designed for Google Cloud's TensorFlow framework, but Alphabet shifted its chips to be more framework agnostic, including supporting the popular PyTorch framework. This move allows it to rent out its TPUs to other companies. Anthropic is one of the first companies to jump on this opportunity, agreeing to deploy $21 billion in TPUs. Morgan Stanley has estimated that for every 500,000 TPUs deployed, Alphabet will generate around $13 billion in annual revenue. It's currently projecting the company will rent out 5 million TPUs in 2027 and 7 million in 2028.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has trained its top-tier Gemini model on its TPUs, while it also runs inference with them. This gives it a significant cost advantage over competitors like OpenAI, allowing it to continue investing more money in its model and further improve it.\n\nIt also has the advantage of being able to integrate Gemini throughout its products, making them better. It essentially has what can be referred to as a \"surface advantage,\" bringing AI to the places where people already are, rather than relying on stand-alone apps and third-party integrations. These advantages should just continue to grow and drive revenue in 2026 and beyond.\nThe verdict I think Nvidia and Alphabet should both have strong years in 2026. Both stocks are attractively valued with forward P/Es of 23 times and 27 times, respectively, and both should produce strong revenue growth.\nHowever, of the two, I think Alphabet's stock will once again outperform in 2026. It has a more durable business (it's less cyclical and doesn't rely on heavy customer capex spending), and I think the network effects of its model will really start to shine through next year, powering the stock higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Stock Market News for Dec 23, 2025\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nGOOGL\n\nNVDA\n\nXLU\n\n^DJI\n\nU.S. stock markets closed higher on Monday to start the Christmas week. Wall Street generally remains positive in the last two truncated trading weeks of any year with muted volumes. This year, market participants&rsquo; confidence has received a boost from renewed momentum in the artificial intelligence (AI) trade. All three major stock indexes ended in positive territory.\n\nHow Did the Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) advanced 0.5% or 227.79 points to close at 48,362.68 Notably, 20 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while 10 finished in negative territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 23,428.83, rising 0.5% or 121.21 points on the strong performance of AI bigwigs.\n\nThe S&P 500 gained 0.6% points to finish at 6,878.49. Six out of 11 broad-sectors of the broad-market index ended in positive territory while four ended in negative territory and one remained unchanged. The technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) rose 2.2%. On the other hand, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) fell 1.3%.\n\nThe fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 5.6% to 14.08, marking its lowest closing since Dec. 13, 2024. A total of 14.57 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 16.9 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.15-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.\n\nAI Trade Continues to Thrive The AI saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\n\nGoldman Sachs and Bank of America projected that AI infrastructure capex spending will cross $1 trillion in 2028. JP Moran and Citigroup forecast this figure to total $5 trillion cumulative in 2030. Research firm McKinsey & Co. estimated that global AI-powered data center infrastructure capex will reach around $7 trillion by 2030.\n\nFour of the &ldquo;magnificent 7&rdquo; stocks have decided to invest a massive $380 billion in 2025 as capital expenditure for AI-infrastructure development. This marks a significant 54% year-over-year increase in capital spending on the AI ecosystem. Moreover, these companies have also said that AI capex is likely to increase handsomely in 2026.\n\nLatest Developments on AI Space The Trump administration has decided to allow the generative AI chipset behemoth NVIDIA Corp. NVDA to sell its high-end H200 AI chips to some &ldquo;approved customers&rdquo; in China. Reuters reported that NVIDIA is considering shipment of H200 chips to China from mid-February 2026. The H200 chip is two generations behind NVDA&rsquo;s current Blackwell Ultra processors.\n\nReuters reported that the initial shipment will consist of around 40,000 to 80,000 H200 chips. Several investment banks have estimated that the resumption of sales in China could bring back around $10 to $20 billion in revenues per calendar year for the company.\n\nAlphabet Inc. GOOGL has decided to acquire data center and energy infrastructure company, Intersect, for a consideration of $4.75 billion in cash. In addition, Alphabet will assume the debts of Intersect. Alphabet expects the deal to bring more data center and generation capacity online faster.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said, &ldquo;Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive U.S. innovation and leadership.&rdquo;\n\nThe stock prices of NVIDIA and Alphabet rose 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively. NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Could This Be the Next Stock to Join the Likes of Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon in the $1 Trillion Club?\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:09 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Oracle is building hundreds of data centers to meet demand for computing capacity from artificial intelligence developers.\nThe company's order backlog is over $500 billion, but investors are worried that it won't all convert into revenue.\nOracle was a stone's throw away from joining the $1 trillion club just a few months ago.\n10 stocks we like better than Oracle ›\n\nThe U.S. economy has a history of producing the world's most valuable companies. United States Steel became the first $1 billion enterprise on the planet in 1901, and 117 years later, in 2018, iPhone maker Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion milestone.\nEight other U.S. companies have since joined Apple in the trillion-dollar club, including Nvidia , Alphabet , Amazon , and Tesla . It looked as though Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) was set to join them back in September as its market capitalization peaked at $940 billion, but following a 41% decline in its stock price since then, the company is now valued at just $550 billion.\nRecent stock price performance aside, artificial intelligence (AI) developers are lining up to rent access to Oracle's data center infrastructure, which is fueling a surge in the company's revenues. Could it be only a matter of time before this tech titan charts a path back toward $1 trillion?\nA leader in AI infrastructure Most AI development happens inside large, centralized data centers fitted with tens of thousands of advanced parallel processors -- many of them graphics processing units ( GPUs ) supplied by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . It can cost billions of dollars to build a single data center, and since most businesses don't have that kind of money to dedicate to such endeavors, they rent computing capacity from specialized operators like Oracle instead.\n\nOracle's data center infrastructure is among the best in the industry. It uses proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology that moves data between chips and devices more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since most AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, even minor increases in processing speed can result in major cost savings over time.\nOracle's data centers also offer significant scale, enabling developers to tap into clusters of over 131,000 GPUs, which is enough to handle even the most advanced AI workloads.\nMoreover, it's bringing capacity online at a rapid pace. As of the conclusion of its fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ended Nov. 30), Oracle had 147 data center regions up and running with 64 more in the pipeline. OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are just a few of the tech juggernauts using Oracle's infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nOracle's cloud infrastructure revenue is soaring Oracle generated $16.1 billion in total revenue during its fiscal 2026 second quarter, which was a modest 14% increase from the prior-year period. But revenue from its cloud infrastructure segment, specifically, soared by 66% to a record $4.1 billion.\nThe cloud infrastructure unit could be growing its sales even faster, but Oracle simply can't build data centers fast enough to meet demand. That's why the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) rocketed by a whopping 438% year over year to $523 billion during the quarter. RPO is like an order backlog, because it reflects the value of signed contracts with customers for services that haven't been delivered yet.\n\nAround $300 billion of Oracle's RPO is reportedly from one customer, OpenAI, which creates concentration risk. OpenAI is still a fairly young company, and it doesn't have anywhere close to $300 billion in cash on hand. Unless it becomes a raging financial success, this enormous commitment might never convert into revenue for Oracle.\nSkepticism about this deal is part of the reason Oracle stock has plummeted in the past few months. The company has around $108 billion in debt, and it's taking on even more to fund the construction of more data centers. The possibility that one of its top customers might never have the money to rent all of the capacity it has requested is spooking investors.\nWill Oracle join the $1 trillion club? Oracle generated earnings of $5.32 per share over the last four quarters on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, which gives its stock a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.1. That is a premium to the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so even though Oracle stock has tumbled, it still isn't cheap.\nFrom its market cap of about $550 billion today, Oracle's stock would have to soar by 82% for the company to join the $1 trillion club. If we assume Oracle's P/E ratio remains exactly where it is right now, the company would have to nearly double its earnings per share to justify that type of share price gain. If its P/E ratio declines further, it will have an even steeper mountain to climb.\n\nOracle's AI business is growing at a lightning-fast pace right now, so there's a good chance the company will join the $1 trillion club at some point, but it probably won't be the next member inducted. Several other U.S. companies are much closer to the mark: Walmart has a market cap of $911 billion, and JPMorgan Chase is also in range at $872 billion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now? Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "2 Artificial Intelligence ETFs to Confidently Buy Heading Into 2026\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:27 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks like Nvidia and Palantir propelled the broader market higher during 2025.\nAI is likely to remain a dominant theme for the stock market in 2026, but picking the winners and losers won't be easy.\nAI-focused exchange-traded funds can take the guesswork out of investing in the revolutionary technology.\n10 stocks we like better than Tidal Trust II - Roundhill Generative Ai & Technology ETF ›\n\nWith 2025 rapidly drawing to a close, this might be a good time for investors to make adjustments to their portfolios in preparation for the new year. The artificial intelligence (AI) industry has been a major source of stock market returns this year, and anyone who hasn't owned a slice of key players like Nvidia and Palantir Technologies probably underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 .\nBut there's a simple solution for those investors as we head into 2026. Two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest exclusively in the booming AI sector are the Roundhill Generative AI and Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) and the iShares Future AI and Tech ETF (NYSEMKT: ARTY) . They take the guesswork out of picking winners and losers, so here's why they could be great additions to any diversified portfolio for the new year.\nThe case for the Roundhill Generative AI and Technology ETF The Roundhill ETF invests exclusively in companies developing the infrastructure, platforms, and software behind the AI revolution. The fund is actively managed, meaning Roundhill's team regularly adjusts its portfolio to produce the best returns.\nThe ETF currently holds just 49 stocks, and its top five positions alone account for 26.7% of the value of its entire portfolio. Although such a high degree of concentration can lead to volatility, those five stocks are among the leaders in the AI race:\nStock\nRoundhill ETF Portfolio Weighting\n1. Alphabet\n7.53%\n2. Nvidia\n6.11%\n3. Microsoft\n5.13%\n4. Meta Platforms\n4.28%\n5. Palantir Technologies\n3.67%\n\nData source: Roundhill. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Dec. 21, 2025, and are subject to change.\nThose five stocks have delivered an average return of 56% in 2025, so they helped propel the Roundhill ETF to a year-to-date gain of 47%. For some perspective, the S&P 500 is up just 17%:\nAlphabet is coming off two straight quarters of accelerating revenue growth in its Google Search business, almost entirely thanks to new AI-powered features like AI Overviews. Revenue growth in its Google Cloud segment is also accelerating, as the platform works to fill a staggering $155 billion order backlog from customers waiting for more of its AI data centers to come on line.\n\nStory Continues\nMany of those data centers are powered by Nvidia's chips, which are the gold standard for developing AI models. But Alphabet isn't the only company lining up to buy them -- Microsoft and Meta Platforms are also two of the chipmaker's top customers. Meta uses them to advance its open-source Llama AI models; Microsoft uses them to deploy its Copilot AI assistant, and it also sells computing capacity to businesses through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nActively managed funds typically come with high costs. The Roundhill ETF has an expense ratio of 0.75%, whereas many of the passive index funds issued by Vanguard, for example, offer expense ratios as low as 0.03%. Fortunately, investors have been well compensated for those costs so far thanks to the Roundhill ETF's blistering returns since its inception in 2023.\nThe case for the iShares Future AI and Tech ETF The iShares ETF invests in AI companies from the U.S. and around the world. It gives investors exposure to the entire AI value chain, including infrastructure, software, and services. The ETF holds 51 stocks, and below are its top five positions, which represent 23% of the value of its portfolio:\nStock\niShares ETF Portfolio Weighting\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n5.48%\n2. Vertiv Holdings\n5.25%\n3. Nvidia\n4.28%\n4. Advantest Corp\n4.06%\n5. Broadcom\n3.96%\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Dec. 18, 2025, and are subject to change.\nDespite having a similar focus to the Roundhill ETF, the composition of the top five holdings in the iShares ETF is quite different. It places a heavier emphasis on suppliers of data center infrastructure and chips, which have been central to the AI boom over the last few years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is one of Nvidia's biggest competitors in the market for AI data center chips. The company is preparing to launch a new lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs) in 2026 called the MI400 series, which could lead the industry in terms of performance.\nBroadcom is another major player in this space. It supplies an alternative to GPUs called AI accelerators, which are popular among hyperscale customers because they are fully customizable. Broadcom is also a top supplier of networking equipment, which helps regulate how fast data travels among chips and devices in AI workloads.\nThen there is Vertiv, which is a crucial service provider for data center operators. It offers cooling, power management, and networking solutions, and its stock has soared more than tenfold since the AI boom started gathering momentum in early 2023.\n\nThe iShares ETF has an expense ratio of 0.47%, but with a return of 28% this year, it's crushing the S&P 500 even after accounting for fees. AI is likely to remain a key driver of stock market returns in 2026, and investors can get all the exposure they need to this booming industry by adding the iShares and Roundhill ETFs to their diversified portfolios.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tidal Trust II - Roundhill Generative Ai & Technology ETF right now?

In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In the last decade, the hardware giant has evolved from a company best known for gaming GPUs into a trillion-dollar club member that's leading the AI infrastructure buildout.\nConsidering that 10 years ago, Nvidia had a roughly $17 billion market cap, you'd probably expect a $10,000 investment made in it then to be worth a small fortune today.\nBut just how much it would be worth might make you do a double-take.\nA gain of over 22,000% If you had invested $10,000 in Nvidia 10 years ago and held on through all the flat, rocky, and exhilarating years that followed, your current investment would be worth well over $2.2 million.\nTo put that into perspective, if you had invested the same amount in any of the other six Magnificent Seven stocks -- Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , and Tesla -- your returns would have been impressive, but nowhere close to what the chipmaker delivered.\nNvidia has earned its crown. For investors who believe AI spending will continue to climb, the stock remains a top pick to consider buying.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

(NASDAQ: NBIS ) is one of the Stocks That Will Go To The Moon in 2026 . On December 17, Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS) announced the launch of Nebius AI Cloud 3.1, thereby enhancing the company’s full-stack AI cloud performance.\nManagement noted that Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 focuses on next-gen NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra compute, operational transparency, developer tools, and strengthened security. Version 3.1 builds upon the foundations of Nebius AI Cloud “Aether”. Moreover, the company is also deploying NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra infrastructure internationally. Thereby making it Europe’s first cloud with production deployments of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 and NVIDIA HGX B300 systems. These systems run on an 800 Gbps NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand interconnect that has the potential to double throughput for distributed workloads.\nIn addition, the release also features new management tools, including Capacity Blocks and a real-time Capacity Dashboard. Management noted that these upgrades allow customers to view GPU availability across data center regions. Management expects the latest version to lower barriers for AI developers, which will help Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS) expand its appeal in the biotech and SaaS AI applications.\n\nNebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS) builds full-stack AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters, cloud platforms like Nebius AI Cloud, and developer tools to support global AI workloads from training to inference.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NBIS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "This Nuclear Stock Could Turn $1,000 Into $100,000\n\nSteven Porrello, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:25 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OKLO\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Oklo is a pre-revenue nuclear start-up that needs a NRC license to turn its idea into profits.\nThe company's microreactors could be a billion dollar idea if data center demand stays hot.\nTo grow one-hundred-fold, Oklo would have to become a trillion dollar company, which would likely only happen over a long period.\n10 stocks we like better than Oklo ›\n\nEarly investors in Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) who held on to their shares through the flat and rocky months of 2024 have seen a triple-digit gain since last year.\nIndeed, after losing more than 50% on its first day of trading (May 10, 2024), Oklo stock has rebounded more than tenfold, beating heavyweight AI favorites, like Nvidia , Palantir , Alphabet , and Microsoft , plus the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the same period.\nPut differently: If you had invested $10,000 in Oklo near the end of its May 10 debut, you would have about $100,000 right now. At one point in October, that same holdings would have been worth well over $200,000.\nWith a 280% gain on the year, Oklo may seem like old news. And yet if you believe in the future of artificial intelligence (AI), this stock's incredible run may only be the beginning.\nCan Oklo turn $1,000 into $100,000? Oklo isn't your average nuclear company.\nThe Sam Altman-backed start-up is designing a microreactor (\"Aurora powerhouse\") that can supply on-site power to remote areas.\nUnlike traditional nuclear power plants, which are expensive and can take a decade to finish building, Oklo's Auroras are factory-built and can be deployed faster than large reactors. That makes them ideal for data center operators, who often build in rural areas where grid power would be severely strained by their electricity needs.\n\nBut here's something to consider: If Oklo turns $1,000 into $100,000, it would join the trillion-dollar club. That's a pretty tall order for any start-up, let alone one that will operate in the utilities sector.\nWhile a one-hundred-fold gain isn't impossible, it would likely take years, if not decades, to happen. Meanwhile, the utilities sector is expected to grow only about 5% annually. Even if Oklo can turn on its first plants, it would need to scale beyond that utility sector growth.\nAt this point, I'd size an Oklo position small; if its reactors work, it could matter over the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oklo right now?

Large companies , such as Nvidia and Alphabet, are enjoying strong gains, while companies like Palantir Technologies and CoreWeave are attracting investor attention and gaining at even faster rates.\nIt remains to be seen whether this trend will continue in 2026, but it appears likely. If you have $1,000 available to invest and are looking for a top AI stock to buy right now, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is a no-brainer.\nThe foundation of all AI What sets Taiwan Semi apart from almost any other AI stock is that it manufactures the chips designed by other companies. It's the manufacturer for the brand names, the foundation of their development. It's not the only game in town, but it developed the industry, and it's the biggest: It's been responsible for around 85% of semiconductor start-up product prototypes, and it has a 34% market share in the foundry business, which enables the fabrication of semiconductors.\n\nIt has contracts with nearly all the chip designers that are changing the world through AI. These are names like Nvidia, Alphabet, and Advanced Micro Devices . These companies are continually developing more powerful chips, and their trusted partner, Taiwan Semiconductor, is experiencing strong growth as a result.\nAs hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft pour billions of dollars into data centers and AI development, they require more chips. Regardless of which chipmaker they're working with, they're likely to count on TSMC as a partner at some point.\nThe company has expanded its operations and now has a U.S. presence in Arizona. The very first chip that came off the line was an Nvidia Blackwell chip in October, marking a significant win for both companies. It's already investing $165 billion in Arizona alone, and it's looking to expand into new U.S. facilities over the next few years, setting itself up for many years of growth. This is an important development, not only because it expands the company's capabilities, but it also allows it to get around the tariffs that have been so challenging for many companies doing business in the U.S. recently.\n\nStory Continues\nMore than AI Aside from its client diversification, which is an excellent feature, it's also diversified by industry. It's benefiting from the tailwinds of AI growth, but it has been around a lot longer than the recent AI craze. It manufactures chips for various types of technology, including smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and AI. It works with 500 companies, and its semiconductors power 12,000 different products.\n\nHowever, AI is definitely giving the company a big boost. High-performance computing, which includes AI products, accounted for 57% of total revenue in the third quarter. Total revenue has increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% since going public in 1994. That is an outstanding performance, and it has accelerated recently; revenue was up 40.8% year over year in the third quarter. However, its highest-growing industries are Internet of Things (IoT) and smartphones.\nA stock price that's ready to jump A great stock is one that you can buy any time; the earlier the better. Taiwan Semiconductor has tremendous growth drivers and opportunities, making it a no-brainer choice for long-term growth.\nHowever, December appears to be an auspicious time to buy shares, as the stock has remained relatively stable over the past few months and is up 46% year to date. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings in January, and the stock is likely to jump on positive results, giving you the chance to buy in before the next rise.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Could AMD Finally Close the Gap on Nvidia AI Dominance?\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market.\nExisting infrastructure and software reinforce Nvidia's dominance.\nDespite competitive challenges, AMD has earned business from key clients.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nThroughout its history, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has developed a reputation for closing or at least reducing the competitive gap with rivals. This was true when it challenged Intel 's supremacy in prior decades and, more recently, its clashes with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\n\nThis includes its rivalry with Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, and its upcoming releases have captured the attention of industry analysts. The question for investors is whether it is on the verge of catching up to Nvidia and ending its dominance. The more likely outcome is that AMD will narrow but not close the gap, and here's why.\nThe state of the AI accelerator market Indeed, the semiconductor industry appeared caught off guard when it became clear that Nvidia's AI accelerators powered OpenAI's game-changing GPT-4 AI platform in 2023. Nvidia was so far ahead of rivals that even now, Nvidia holds an estimated 80% of this market, according to a Susquehanna analyst.\n\nMoreover, closing the gap hinges on more than just processing power. Nvidia has its CUDA software platform, which has an army of loyal developers. That makes switching away from that architecture difficult.\nAdditionally, Nvidia offers rack-scale solutions that integrate with both its accelerators and CUDA. That presents an additional challenge to prospective competitors.\nNvidia is also growing faster. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2026, Nvidia reported 62% revenue growth. Its data center segment, which designs the accelerators and constitutes 89% of Nvidia's revenue, increased revenue by 65% during the same period.\nAMD's overall growth is also impressive, but not as rapid in either respect. In the first nine months of 2025, AMD's revenue rose by 36% year over year. Also, its data center segment makes up 46% of overall revenue, and during the period, the segment's revenue rose by 29%, slower than the overall gain.\n\nAMD's efforts to strike back Nonetheless, as bleak as that sounds, AMD bulls should remember that that is only one quarter, and data center segment growth is likely to improve along with its technology.\nDespite lagging behind, AMD has made headway in this market. The company has built strategic partnerships with OpenAI and Meta Platforms , and its accelerators support clouds for Microsoft 's Azure and Oracle 's Oracle Cloud. Moreover, Dell , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , and others have built servers with AMD's technology.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking forward, investors have focused on AMD's upcoming MI450 accelerator. The company has also claimed that the MI450 will surpass the performance of Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin accelerator.\nAdditionally, AMD relies on open-source software and can work with other tech ecosystems. That could wear away at Nvidia's software-driven competitive advantage as the industry grows.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia has struggled to keep up with demand, and AMD has traditionally sold its competing product at a lower cost. This gives companies all the more reason to consider AMD over Nvidia. Hence, if the MI450 can match or surpass the Vera Rubin, AMD could make significant competitive inroads.\nWill AMD close the gap with Nvidia? In the foreseeable future, investors should expect AMD to reduce but not completely close the competitive gap with Nvidia.\nIndeed, AMD has made significant efforts to catch up and has won business from several high-profile customers. If the MI450 matches or exceeds expectations, it could threaten AMD's dominance.\n\nUnfortunately for AMD, Nvidia is the established player in the AI accelerator market, and most companies are tied into its ecosystem. That means if AMD becomes the superior product, many of Nvidia's customers would likely be unable to switch to AMD without a tremendous disruption.\nUltimately, such conditions could be enough to stoke more rapid stock price increases for Advanced Micro Devices stock than Nvidia as the smaller company plays catch-up. However, investors should expect Nvidia to remain the leader in the AI accelerator industry for some time to come.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

Here's why both are better buys than Nvidia today.\nAlphabet's AI comeback Alphabet is the conglomerate that owns Google, YouTube, Android, Waymo, and other technology properties. It is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, with billions of users across multiple product lines.\nThe stock was deemed a potential AI loser after ChatGPT came out and rapidly began taking market share of search and AI queries, with Alphabet falling flat-footed after the launch. Now, with the launch of updated Gemini AI models for text, images, and video creation (among other things), Alphabet is steadily gaining market share back from OpenAI and ChatGPT.\n\nIts stock has begun to perform because of it. Alphabet stock is up 60% year to date (YTD), which is more than double the returns of Nvidia. It is growing revenue at 15% year over year in constant currency, and with expanding profit margins. The durability of Google Search and YouTube, fast growth at Google Cloud, and long-term plays with Gemini and Waymo's self-driving cars should help Alphabet keep compounding its earnings power for years to come.\nAmazon's dual engines Alphabet's growth path in 2026 is clear. Amazon's will be determined by management's ability to wrangle costs that spiraled out of control during the pandemic years, which is a headwind still impacting the business.\nAmazon's cloud computing division -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- grew revenue 20% year over year last quarter, with a fat 36% operating margin over the last 12 months. Cloud computing is benefiting from the AI infrastructure expansion, with Amazon specifically helped by the likes of its partner Anthropic, a start-up growing incredibly quickly that Amazon is also an investor in. OpenAI is in talks with Amazon about a $10 billion investment that would likely flow back through to AWS cloud computing spending.\n\nStory Continues\nYou have a 36% operating margin at AWS. In retail, Amazon is still growing strongly, with double-digit growth in the last few years in North America and internationally. Advertising, third-party seller services, and subscription revenue now generate $279 billion in trailing revenue, or 40% of Amazon's total revenue. These segments have high profit margins and have been growing faster than the overall Amazon retail business.\n\nAnd yet Amazon's retail operations in North America only have a 6.6% operating margin. This could be looked at as a failure or a future path to profit expansion. Amazon has been trimming its ranks through layoffs, which should help margins expand throughout 2026 and beyond. If retail can keep up this operating leverage, along with the fast growth at AWS, then Amazon's profitability will explode in 2026.\nThe math: Why Amazon and Alphabet will be worth more than Nvidia Today, Alphabet generates $128 billion in operating income, Nvidia $110 billion, and Amazon $80 billion. Nvidia's revenue is currently growing much faster than both of these businesses, but that could come to a grinding halt if the AI infrastructure buildout slows down in 2026.\nNvidia's revenue growth doesn't have to go negative in order for earnings to fall, as it is currently implementing huge price increases for its products that are generating incredibly high profit margins. Plus, its stock trades at a more expensive earnings ratio than both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nIf Nvidia's revenue growth slows down in 2026 while Alphabet and Amazon keep chugging along, then Nvidia's earnings will likely fall along with its high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. That could lead both stocks to finish 2026 with market caps larger than Nvidia.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

Technology shares continued their rebound from late last week, with Nvidia, up 1.5%, providing the biggest lift to the S&P 500. Reuters reported the company has told Chinese clients it aims to start shipping its second-most powerful AI chips to China before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February. Among other sectors, financials, materials and energy also posted strong gains. Sam Stovall is chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \"We've just finished up the mid-December low when investors tend to unload their unprofitable trades, therefore being able to do some tax loss harvesting. And now they're putting their money back to work in areas that they feel have some potential for at least the near term.\" Among other stock moves, shares of Micron Technology rose 4%, extending gains from last week when the chipmaker's strong forecasts re-ignited optimism around AI-related shares. Shares of Tesla gained 1.5% and touched an intraday record high after CEO Elon Musk's 2018 pay package was restored late Friday by the Delaware Supreme Court. The ruling made Musk the first person to be worth about $700 billion, and came two years after a lower court struck down the compensation deal as \"unfathomable.\" And shares of Warner Bros Discovery rose 3.5% after Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said he'd personally guarantee more than $40 billion of equity financing for Paramount Skydance's offer to acquire the company. Paramount's stock rose more than 4%, while shares of Netflix, a rival bidder for Warner Bros, fell more than 1%.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Futures strength carried into the session, and the market held its gains as muted volatility kept investors focused on staying positioned rather than pressing new bets.\n\nLeadership remains concentrated in AI and semiconductors, which continue to drive the Nasdaq Composite. Strength in names such as Nvidia, Micron, and Oracle helped the index regain ground from its early-December pullback, reinforcing the market’s reliance on a narrow group of growth leaders to sustain momentum.\n\nBuyers stayed active even as the calendar turned toward year-end. Coinbase’s move into prediction markets and the $7.4 billion buyout of Janus Henderson showed that capital is still being deployed late in the year. That activity helped support sentiment as liquidity thins and market leadership remains concentrated. Investors will be watching upcoming economic releases and year-end liquidity closely for signs that AI-driven leadership can sustain the rally into the final stretch of the year.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.\nIn a bullish factor, Fed Governor Stephen Miran said Monday, “If we don’t adjust policy down, then I think we do run risks” of a recession.

      "Content": "The Case for Nvidia Stock Hitting $275 in 2026\n\nSristi Suman Jayaswal\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:57 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation’s (NVDA) rise has been extraordinary. Once a small graphics chip maker, it now powers data centers, artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and next-gen vehicles, becoming one of Wall Street’s most influential technology leaders. But the AI chip stock’s story has felt like a rocket ride with a few sharp air pockets along the way.\n\nNot long ago, NVDA briefly touched the rarefied $5 trillion market-cap club, powered by blistering revenue growth and near-total dominance of the AI chip market. Then came the pullback. The stock cooled as whispers of an AI bubble grew louder, and investors questioned how long this breakneck infrastructure spending could last. For a company this big, even perfection can feel priced in.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nWill Tesla Stock Lose Its ‘Elon Musk Premium’ After the SpaceX IPO? And You Should Sell TSLA Here?\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nBut as 2026 approaches, analyst Dan Ives and his team foresee a tech world – and its investors – caught between excitement and anxiety. The AI revolution hints at a once-in-a-generation leap forward, yet the trillions required to fuel it naturally raise questions. Still, that scale of investment also signals a fourth industrial revolution taking shape, with the U.S. firmly setting the pace.\nThe analyst believes this crossroads makes 2026 an inflection year. With tech stocks projected to rise by over 20%, Nvidia’s dominance, expanding demand drivers, and potential China access underpin a bullish $275 case. With that setup, let’s get into the details.\nAbout NVIDIA Stock Santa Clara-based Nvidia hardly needs an introduction. Once celebrated as the king of gaming graphics, it quietly reinvented itself as the backbone of modern computing. Its GPUs now power data centers, AI, robotics, and immersive digital worlds. The CUDA software platform locked developers into a powerful ecosystem, turning Nvidia into an industry standard rather than a supplier. With a market capitalization of nearly $4.4 trillion, Jensen Huang’s company has become the engine of the AI economy.\n\nThat dominance has translated into a turbulent but rewarding stock journey. Shares of the AI chip maker have surged throughout the year, pausing only to catch breath. Despite a recent pullback, the stock remains up strongly, reflecting investors balancing long-term confidence with short-term caution. After rising to the high of $212.19 on Oct. 29, NVDA retreated about 15.5%, yet it still commands a powerful uptrend across longer horizons, up 36.8% year-to-date (YTD) and soaring 27.7% over the past six months alone.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart shows momentum cooling, not collapsing. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which pushed beyond the overheated 80 zone during October’s euphoric high, has eased back to around 52. That reset signals excess optimism being worked off, allowing the stock to stabilize rather than unravel. Volume has normalized alongside price, reinforcing the sense of consolidation rather than distribution.\n\nThe MACD oscillator remains bullish. The MACD line remains above its signal line, confirming that the broader trend still favors buyers. Although the histogram has narrowed, suggesting slower acceleration, downside pressure remains contained. In practical terms, the bulls are still in control, even if they have eased off the throttle.\nNvidia’s valuation may look expensive at first glance, with the stock trading around 41.09 times forward adjusted earnings, well above most peers. Still, it sits below its own historical average, which adds some perspective. For a company delivering strong double-digit earnings growth and holding enviable margins, that premium feels more justified.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia’s forward PEG ratio of about 1.03x is below both the sector average and its long-term median, suggesting the valuation, while elevated, is still supported by real growth rather than hype.\nNvidia Beats Q3 Projections Nvidia’s third-quarter update felt more like another chapter in its AI-driven ascent. On Nov. 19, the stock climbed nearly 3% as the company delivered results that comfortably cleared Wall Street’s bar and paired them with upbeat guidance. Revenue surged 62.5% year-over-year (YOY) to $57.01 billion, outpacing expectations, while adjusted earnings climbed 60.5% to $1.30 a share, reminding investors that scale has not slowed Nvidia’s momentum.\n\nAt the heart of the story was the data center business, still the company’s growth engine. Sales there jumped 66% annually to $51.2 billion, powered by insatiable AI demand. Networking added its own spark, with revenue soaring 162% to $8.2 billion as NVLink, InfiniBand, and Spectrum-X Ethernet gained traction. Gaming remained steady, posting 30% growth, while automotive quietly advanced with a 32% annual rise.\nManagement’s tone was just as confident. CFO Colette Kress cited Blackwell Ultra as the top-selling chip, while CEO Jensen Huang noted cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. Addressing concerns about an AI bubble, CEO Huang struck a confident tone on the earnings call. He emphasized that Nvidia is not just another accelerator vendor, but a full-stack platform spanning pre-training, post-training, and inference. Backed by over two decades of investment in CUDA-X, the company also leads in scientific computing, engineering simulations, computer graphics, and advanced data processing, giving Nvidia a breadth few competitors can match. With the management guiding Q4 revenue to about $65 billion, +/-2%, Nvidia’s growth narrative looks firmly intact.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts tracking Nvidia forecast its Q4 fiscal 2026 revenue to be $65.6 billion, and EPS is anticipated to grow 69.4% YOY to $1.44. For the full fiscal 2026, the bottom line is projected to increase 50.5% annually to $4.41 per share before rising by another 54% to $6.79 in fiscal 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock? Dan Ives views the technology sector as entering a decisive phase ahead of 2026. In Wedbush’s top technology outlook, he expects the sector to rise more than 20% as AI investments move deeper across software, semiconductors, and infrastructure. Strategic developments, including a potential AI partnership between Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) reinforce the scale of this transition. For Nvidia, Ives remains particularly confident.\n\nHe sees Nvidia as the world’s leading AI chip provider, with demand drivers still underappreciated by the market and added upside from improving access to China. In Wedbush’s view, 2026 represents an inflection point for the AI buildout, and Nvidia stands out as a primary beneficiary. Ives’ $275 price target suggests NVDA could rally by as much as 51.9%.\nOverall, analysts are bullish about NVDA’s growth prospects, giving the stock a consensus rating of “Strong Buy.” Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, 44 advise a “Strong Buy,” while two suggest “Moderate Buy,” one advises a “Hold,” and only one suggests a “Strong Sell.”\nThe average analyst price target for NVDA is $255.56, indicating potential upside of 39.13%. Evercore ISI’s Street-high target price of $352 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 91.63% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The dollar halted a three-day advance.\nOil rallied while gold and silver jumped to all-time highs amid geopolitical tensions.\n“Everything is shaping up for a festive end to the year,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “This week is being driven by technical tailwinds, a bit of stimulus optimism, and self-fulfilling prophecy, all of which are setting up a strong year-end and a solid start to next year.”\nHackett noted that the last two weeks of the year are typically the best on the calendar since 1950.\nThe so-called Santa Claus rally, which includes the last five trading days of December and the first two of January, has been positive roughly 80% of the time, by an average of 1.6% since 1928, he added.\n\nStory Continues\n“When this pattern is heavily discussed, it can become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Hackett said. “An important caveat, however, is the consistent theme of the past five years that historical patterns have provided little direction, with last year delivering a negative return.”\nYet Hackett said that market action is encouraging, including healthy breadth, shifting leadership, and greater discernment by investors around valuations.\n“The trend is our friend, 2026 looks to have a strong start, and a potential Santa Claus rally is back on the table, which would leave us ending the year at new highs,” said Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates.\nBuoyed by tech, the long-term valuation ratio of the S&P 500 is now at an all-time high. This metric has exceeded previous peaks that preceded major drawdowns, such as in the summer of 2000 before the dotcom crash, or in January 2022 when the market started to price a surge in interest rates.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\n\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets on a bottom sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from rate cuts until there’s a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\nEquity investor sentiment was bullish for a third straight week, although the gap over more pessimistic views has narrowed slightly, according to Deutsche Bank AG strategists.\nThe team including Parag Thatte said aggregate equity positioning declined last week, but remains modestly overweight.\nMeantime, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Ben Snider noted the bank’s baseline macro outlook is “supportive for small-cap upside in early 2026.”\n“We do not believe markets are fully pricing the likely strength of the US economy next year, and small-caps typically outperform during cyclical rallies,” they wrote.\n\nSell-side strategists across major firms have issued year-end targets for the S&P 500 that are clustered the tightest in almost a decade. With the highest forecast from Oppenheimer & Co. at 8,100 and the lowest from Stifel Nicolaus & Co. at 7,000, the gap in their annual outlook is just 16%.\nSuch lockstep views are generally considered a contrarian signal — when everyone’s leaning the same way, the imbalance often rights itself. They also come at a time when market risks are visible. Still, strategists on average see more gains for stocks in 2026, even after three straight years of double-digit returns.\nThe not insignificant amount of good news already priced in includes: an accommodative Fed that will cut rates at least once, if not twice; S&P 500 earnings to grow by about 14%; and a fiscal bump from the recently passed tax law, noted Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers.\n“It seems like folly to think that these would not benefit stocks,” he said. “One must consider whether simply meeting those expectations will be sufficient. If not, then we could see disappointment even amidst a good investment climate.”\nBofA’s Moynihan Says AI’s Economic Benefit Is ‘Kicking In More’\n“Can the market hold up if AI enthusiasm and a dovish Fed aren’t helping it?” said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report. “The answer is yes, but only as long as economic growth stays solid.”\nEssaye noted that there was a data deluge last week, and the net result was that economic data and inflation remain “Goldilocks enough to help support stocks.”\n\nAn S&P 500 valuation metric that adds in consumer sentiment suggests stocks are better positioned for gains next year than a more conventional price-earning multiple measure might indicate, according to veteran investment strategist Jim Paulsen.\nHe says that both price-earnings ratios and consumer confidence are “abnormal,” with today’s S&P 500 price-earnings multiple higher than 94% of the time since 1960, while consumer sentiment is at its first percentile since then.\nThe unusually-high PE multiple might be alarming if it weren’t for the accompanying exceptionally low sentiment, he says, writing that “until the Emotion-Adjusted PE rises to a concerning level, investors may be best served by remaining bullish.”\nUS PREVIEW: Third-Quarter GDP to Prove Resilient Despite Tariffs\n“Economic data will start to hit the wires tomorrow, but for now, traders are taking their cue from the general sense amongst participants that there’s little standing in the way for a Santa Claus rally to manifest,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn the run-up to Tuesday’s reading on the economy, Bloomberg Economics estimates the US likely grew more than 3% in the third quarter, supported by robust consumer spending and modest investment gains — defying headwinds from tariff-related uncertainty.\nWhile the upcoming datapoints will provide a relevant contribution to investors’ understanding of the trajectory of the real economy, they don’t necessarily hold the needed weight to recast the outlook for 2026, according to said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets.\n“As the final trading days of 2025 arrive, the US rates market remains decidedly range-bound with little on the immediate horizon to suggest that will change before the next payrolls report,” he said. Those figures are due to be released on Jan. 9.\nThe past week featured two influential economic releases for Fed policy: employment and inflation, noted Magdalena Ocampo at Principal Asset Management.\n“Taken together, the latest economic readings are likely to give doves in the Fed the upper hand, though uncertainty remains with one more inflation and employment report due before the Fed’s next meeting in January 2026,” she said.\nFor now, she expects two rate cuts next year, likely in the first half, and, provided unemployment doesn’t spiral, Ocampo says a resilient economy, cooling inflation and easier policy should be supportive for risk assets in the year ahead.\nCorporate Highlights:\nAlphabet Inc. has agreed to buy clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash, plus existing debt, marking one of the largest deals by the tech giant to dramatically expand its data center footprint for AI.\nNvidia Corp. has told Chinese clients it aims to ship its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nMeta Platforms Inc.’s Threads will launch podcast previews, or the ability to upload snippets of shows that play directly in user feeds, as part of a broader effort to encourage podcasters and their fans to spend more time on the social network, according to a person familiar with the plans.\nTarget Corp., Whole Foods Market and Walmart Inc. will be added as defendants in lawsuits against baby formula maker ByHeart for selling a product potentially contaminated with spores that cause infant botulism.\nNetflix Inc. refinanced part of a $59 billion bridge loan with cheaper and longer-term debt, bolstering the financial package underpinning its bid for Warner Bros.

      "Content": "3 Reasons I'm Not Buying Nvidia Stock Headed Into 2026\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:26 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points The stock has risen about 35% year to date.\nCompetition is still far behind, but that doesn't mean some hyperscalers aren't finding workarounds to reduce their dependence on Nvidia.\nSome other tech stocks with AI exposure may be better buys.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nAfter a transformational 2024 for Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business and its stock, momentum has persisted as the AI (artificial intelligence) boom accelerated. The year has confirmed Nvidia's leadership position in AI chips as its data center segment has grown to represent the majority of its business, and demand for its most powerful products continues to exceed supply.\n\nThere's a lot to like about the tech company , which designs graphics processing units (GPUs) and related systems that power AI computing. In fact, Nvidia has seen its growth reaccelerate in its most recent quarter.\n\nBut has the stock soared too high, making shares unattractive even though the business is firing on all cylinders?\nI think so.\nHere are three reasons I'm not interested in buying Nvidia at its current price.\nCustomer concentration risk Highlighting the explosive demand for its products, Nvidia's revenue grew 62% year over year in its third quarter of fiscal 2026 (the quarter ending Oct. 26, 2025) after 56% year over year growth in fiscal Q2.\nThat kind of growth, however, depends heavily on a small group of customers. In its quarterly report for fiscal Q3, Nvidia said one direct customer accounted for 22% of total revenue, another represented 15%, and two more customers each exceeded 10%. Even more, this concentration risk has been rising; for the year-ago quarter, the company disclosed its three biggest customers at 12% apiece.\n\nAnd Nvidia warned in its fiscal third-quarter update that it also generates a substantial portion of its sales from a limited number of indirect customers, or customers who primarily purchase Nvidia's products through distributors and system integrators.\n\"We generate a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of indirect customers,\" Nvidia explained in its fiscal third-quarter 10-Q filing, \"some individually representing 10% or more of our revenue.\"\nCompetition is intensifying Additionally, while Nvidia is still a clear leader across essentially every high-value technology behind AI, including related CPUs, GPUs, networking, and even some critical software used to run this hardware, it's not stopping some of Nvidia's biggest customers from looking for workarounds for some aspects of their AI businesses.\n\nStory Continues\nAlongside its use of Nvidia GPUs, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has used Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) internally for years. And the generative AI company Anthropic is betting on these Alphabet TPUs, too.\n\"We are investing in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners,\" said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in the company's third-quarter earnings call, \"and we are excited that Anthropic recently shared plans to access up to 1 million TPUs.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has pushed its Trainium line along a similar path. In fact, Anthropic is also a Tranium customer.\n\nThis Amazon AI chip business is seeing explosive growth.\n\n\"Trainium2 continues to see strong adoption, is fully subscribed, and is now a multibillion-dollar business that grew 150% quarter-over-quarter,\" said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in the company's most recent earnings call. \"Today, Trainium is being used by a small number of very large customers, but we expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium3.\"\nThe valuation is steep The final reason I'm not buying Nvidia shares headed into 2026 is valuation. Shares of a price-to-earnings ratio of about 45 as of this writing. This is well above the valuations of more diversified tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft -- all of which have significant exposure to AI alongside their proven core businesses that have grown at robust rates for years. The price-to-earnings ratios of these three tech companies currently stand at 30, 32, and 34, respectively. I'd rather put my money on these less cyclical tech giants entering 2026 than on Nvidia, which has an uncomfortable level of customer concentration and is facing rising competition from deep-pocketed tech giants.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Why One Fund Added $4.2 Million to Park Hotels Even Though the Stock Has Slid 27%\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:21 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PK\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Pennsylvania-based Matthew 25 Management reported its PK position increased by 373,500 shares in the third quarter.\nThe position was up $4.22 million in value compared to the previous quarter.\nAs of September 30, Matthew 25 reported holding 475,000 PK shares valued at $5.26 million.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nPennsylvania-based Matthew 25 Management disclosed a purchase of 373,500 additional shares of Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) for approximately $4.22 million during the quarter ended September 30, according to a filing published November 12.\nWhat Happened According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated November 12, Matthew 25 Management Corp increased its holdings in Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:PK) by 373,500 shares during the most recent quarter. The total position reached 475,000 shares with a reported market value of $5.26 million at quarter-end.\n\nWhat Else to Know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: NVDA: $81.72 million (25.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AMZN: $31.56 million (9.7% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: MELI: $30.38 million (9.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: TSM: $19.13 million (5.9% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: TSLA: $16.32 million (5% of AUM)\nAs of Monday, shares were priced at $10.80, down 27% over the past year and well underperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 16% in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of Monday)\n$10.80\nMarket capitalization\n$2.16 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$2.54 billion\nDividend yield\n9%\n\nCompany Snapshot Park Hotels & Resorts operates 40 premium-branded hotels and resorts, generating revenue primarily from lodging, hospitality services, and ancillary real estate activities.\nThe business model centers on owning and managing a geographically diverse portfolio of hotel properties, with income streams from room bookings, event hosting, and related services.\nIt targets business and leisure travelers in prime city center and resort destinations, focusing on high-traffic, premium locations.\n\nPark Hotels & Resorts Inc. is one of the largest publicly traded lodging REITs in the United States, with a portfolio exceeding 24,000 rooms across major urban and resort markets. Its scale and focus on premium locations provide a competitive edge in the hospitality sector.\nFoolish Take Park Hotels sits at an interesting intersection right now: RevPAR is sliding, margins are compressing, and reported results show a net loss. But the underlying asset base hasn’t disappeared, and the company is leaning hard into liquidity and capital flexibility to ride out the downturn.\n\nIn the third quarter, Park reported adjusted EBITDA of $130 million, down from last year, as comparable RevPAR fell 6.1% year over year. Management was blunt about softer leisure and government demand, but also flagged a projected 12% increase in fourth-quarter group revenue pace. That forward visibility matters for a REIT whose cash flow is highly sensitive to occupancy and pricing swings. The company also expanded its revolver to $1 billion and secured up to $800 million in delayed-draw term loans, lifting total liquidity to roughly $2.1 billion.\n\nThis also matters with context. This fund’s largest holdings are growth-heavy names like Nvidia, Amazon, MercadoLibre, and Tesla. Park Hotels looks nothing like those positions. Instead, it functions as a cyclical ballast, offering asset-backed optionality and a roughly 9% dividend yield at recent prices. The risk is obvious, but so is the asymmetry if travel stabilizes faster than expected.\n\nStory Continues\nGlossary 13F: A quarterly report filed by institutional investment managers disclosing their equity holdings to the SEC.\nAssets Under Management (AUM): The total market value of investments managed on behalf of clients by a fund or firm.\nNet buy: When the total purchases of a security exceed total sales during a period, increasing the holding.\nDividend yield: Annual dividends paid by a company divided by its share price, expressed as a percentage.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\nREIT: Real Estate Investment Trust; a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate.\nMarket capitalization: The total value of a company's outstanding shares, calculated as share price times shares outstanding.\nPremium-branded: Refers to properties or products associated with higher quality, reputation, and pricing within their sector.\nStake: The ownership interest or amount of shares held in a company by an investor or fund.\nFiling: An official document submitted to a regulatory body, such as the SEC, containing required financial or operational information.\nQuarter-end: The last day of a fiscal quarter, used as a reference point for financial reporting.\nAncillary real estate activities: Additional business operations related to property, such as event hosting or related services, beyond core lodging.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Interface Stock Is Up 14% but Here's Why This Fund Just Cut $2.4 Million\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TILE\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nMELI\n\nKey Points Pennsylvania-based Matthew 25 Management sold 200,000 shares of Interface in the third quarter.\nThe estimated net position value change from the previous period was $2.38 million.\nAs of September 30, the fund reported holding 225,000 TILE shares valued at $6.51 million.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nPennsylvania-based Matthew 25 Management reduced its stake in Interface (NASDAQ:TILE) by an estimated $2.38 million, according to a November 12 SEC filing.\nWhat Happened\nAccording to a November 12 SEC filing , Matthew 25 Management Corp sold 200,000 shares of Interface (NASDAQ:TILE) from its portfolio during the third quarter. The value of the reduction was about $2.38 million from the previous period. The fund’s remaining position stands at 225,000 shares valued at $6.51 million at quarter end.\nWhat Else to Know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: NVDA: $81.72 million (25.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AMZN: $31.56 million (9.7% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: MELI: $30.38 million (9.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: TSM: $19.13 million (5.9% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: TSLA: $16.32 million (5% of AUM)\nAs of Monday, shares of Interface were priced at $27.98, up 14% over the past year and slightly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 16% in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nMarket Capitalization\n$1.63 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.37 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$113.47 million\nPrice (as of Monday)\n$27.98\n\nCompany Snapshot Interface produces modular carpet tiles, resilient flooring, rubber flooring, and luxury vinyl tile products, with additional offerings in antimicrobial compounds and installation systems.\nThe company generates revenue through direct sales to end-users and indirect distribution channels, complemented by project management and maintenance services.\nIt serves commercial, institutional, and residential clients globally, with a focus on offices, healthcare, education, hospitality, and retail sectors.\n\nInterface is a global leader in modular flooring, leveraging a diversified product portfolio and broad geographic reach to serve commercial and institutional markets. The company’s strategy emphasizes innovation in sustainable flooring solutions and value-added services, reinforcing its competitive position. Scale, brand recognition, and a multi-channel distribution model underpin Interface’s ability to capture demand across key end markets.\nFoolish Take What makes this move worth watching is not the sale itself but the timing. Interface just delivered one of its strongest quarters in years, with third-quarter revenue up nearly 6% to $364.5 million and GAAP earnings per share jumping 63% year over year to $0.78. Margins expanded meaningfully too, with adjusted gross margin climbing more than 230 basis points, and management raised full-year guidance. On the surface, this looks like exactly the kind of setup that would keep long-term holders comfortable.\n\nBut portfolio management is about opportunity cost. Interface shares have rallied off prior lows and are now up roughly 14% over the past year, even as broader demand indicators in commercial construction remain uneven. For a fund whose top positions include mega-cap growth names like Nvidia, Amazon, and MercadoLibre, trimming a smaller, more cyclical holding after a solid run can be less about doubt and more about discipline.\n\nInterface still has a compelling story around pricing power, sustainability leadership, and balance sheet improvement, with net leverage now well under one times EBITDA.

Shares of cloud security and performance company Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) jumped 2.6% in the afternoon session after investor enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence sector regained momentum, fueled by gains in industry leaders like Nvidia and Micron.\nThis \"AI-boost\" acted as a primary catalyst, helping the S&P 500 approach the historic 7,000 level during the shortened holiday week. This upward trend built upon Cloudflare’s robust fundamental performance. In its most recent quarter, the company reported $562.03 million in revenue, a 30.7% year-over-year increase, with earnings per share rising to $0.27.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $201.76, up 3.1% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Cloudflare? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Cloudflare’s shares are quite volatile and have had 19 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 20 days ago when the stock gained 4.2% on the news that Barclays initiated coverage on the company with an Overweight rating and a $235 price target.\n\nThe new rating suggested strong confidence in the cloud security company's future. Analysts at the firm highlighted Cloudflare's vast network, which supported a significant portion of the internet, as a major strength. They projected that the company's revenue was positioned to grow between 27% and 30% annually through 2028. This growth was expected to be fueled by a diverse range of products and an expanding share of the market. The price target of $235 represented a notable premium over the stock's previous closing price.\nCloudflare is up 79.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $201.76 per share, it is still trading 20.3% below its 52-week high of $253.30 from October 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Cloudflare’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,331.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

Plus, get a 1% bonus if you transfer your investments and keep them there until December 31, 2025.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) traded significantly lower over the past month as the former high-flying AI server maker faces intense scrutiny regarding its accounting practices and delayed financial filings. The company is fighting to regain investor trust after a tumultuous period that saw its valuation severely reset amid fears of a potential delisting.\nAgainst that backdrop, we ran Super Micro Computer through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI’s GPT. The goal was not to chase a sensational long-term target, but to see how a data-driven model handicaps the next 60 days for a stock that has become shorthand for the entire AI trade.\nWhat the AI model is actually predicting The agent was asked to generate a near-term outlook for Super Micro Computer, using recent price action and a focused set of technical indicators. At the time of the run, SMCI traded at $30.13. For the period from Dec. 17 through Dec 31, the model’s base-case projection came out to:\nAverage predicted price: $30.75\nImplied move: slightly lower over the next month\nSignal snapshot: The technical indicators (MACD and RSI) both skewed negative\n\nThe model is saying that, given current momentum and volatility, the most likely path is a modest grind lower from current levels rather than a dramatic reset. Still, broader AI price prediction says that Super Micro Computer could hit $176 by 2030, which illustrates the massive long-term upside baked into the current valuation if it continues its AI server dominance.\nThe key driver behind the AI model’s bearish short-term view is the recent cooling in the AI infrastructure trade, often triggered by tempered outlooks from key players like Oracle and Broadcom. Super Micro Computer is a critical supplier of specialized, high-performance servers, particularly those optimized for NVIDIA’s latest GPUs.\nWhile demand remains massive, the company has a record order backlog, the market has recently focused on short-term challenges. Namely, a temporary dip in revenue growth and significant gross margin compression were reported in the recent quarter, which has intensified concerns about pricing power amid rising competition.\n\nStory Continues\nThe single biggest factor weighing on the stock is the shrinking gross margin, which recently went down. This signals the high cost of scaling production rapidly and the intensifying competition from larger, established server makers and rising Asian rivals. The model’s negative forecast for the next 14 days is a technical reflection of this fundamental pressure. The market is effectively demanding proof that Super Micro can maintain its design advantage and market share in specialized server and liquid cooling solutions without continually sacrificing profitability. Until management can demonstrate a clearer path to margin recovery, the stock is likely to remain under pressure.\n\nThe negative skew in both the MACD and RSI confirms the short-term downward bias. A declining MACD suggests the selling momentum is strengthening, with the short-term average falling below the long-term one.\nThe RSI, currently near the low 30s, is approaching “oversold” territory, which suggests the stock is suffering from strong selling pressure. This dual negative signal implies that the stock’s recent four-day losing streak could continue into the new year, aligning with the model’s predicted decline.\nDespite the near-term technical weakness, Super Micro's long-term bullish case rests on its deep strategic integration with NVIDIA and its leadership in advanced thermal management, particularly Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC). AI data centers generate immense heat, and SMCI’s liquid cooling solutions are critical for managing the power and thermal demands of next-generation chips like the NVIDIA Blackwell.\n\nBy selling full, rack-scale solutions, its Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) strategy, rather than just individual servers, Super Micro aims to capture more value per customer, a strategy that is expected to drive margin recovery as production scales.\nWall Street, for now, is still leaning into that growth. Across major platforms, analysts maintain a Hold consensus with 12-month price targets clustering in the mid-$40s to mid-$50s. Some of the more aggressive firms see upside into the low-$60s if Super Micro Computer maintains its dominant share in AI rack-scale and liquid-cooled servers. Even the median targets imply a 45% to 55% upside from current levels, a bullish outlook that starkly contrasts with the AI model’s cautious 14-day prediction.\nThe AI forecast can be viewed as a short-term temperature check on how quickly the market might be willing to reopen the multiple after a shakeout, not a verdict on whether Super Micro Computer's run is over.\nImage: Shutterstock\nThis article ChatGPT Super Micro Computer Stock Will Close At This Price In The Next 60 Days originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

Oil and gold rallied as the dollar fell.\nEquities erased their December losses, with the S&P 500 set for an eighth straight up month - the longest winning run since 2018. About 400 of its shares rose Monday as the gauge approached a record. Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. led megacaps higher. A gauge of smaller firms climbed nearly 1.5%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working.

Their expectations of a further rally are outweighing concerns over rich valuations. The Federal Reserve path is also being closely watched, with two rate cuts priced for next year.\nFed Governor Stephen Miran told Bloomberg Television the central bank risks sparking a recession unless it continues lowering rates next year.\nThe S&P 500 hovered near 6,875. The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose two basis points to 4.17%. The dollar halted a three-day advance. Bitcoin rose to around $89,000.\nOil rallied while gold and silver jumped to all-time highs amid geopolitical tensions.\n“Everything is shaping up for a festive end to the year,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “This week is being driven by technical tailwinds, a bit of stimulus optimism, and self-fulfilling prophecy, all of which are setting up a strong year-end and a solid start to next year.”\nHackett noted that the last two weeks of the year are typically the best on the calendar since 1950.\nThe so-called Santa Claus rally, which includes the last five trading days of December and the first two of January, has been positive roughly 80% of the time, by an average of 1.6% since 1928, he added.\n\nStory Continues\n“When this pattern is heavily discussed, it can become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Hackett said. “An important caveat, however, is the consistent theme of the past five years that historical patterns have provided little direction, with last year delivering a negative return.”\nYet Hackett said that market action is encouraging, including healthy breadth, shifting leadership, and greater discernment by investors around valuations.\n“The trend is our friend, 2026 looks to have a strong start, and a potential Santa Claus rally is back on the table, which would leave us ending the year at new highs,” said Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates.\nBuoyed by tech, the long-term valuation ratio of the S&P 500 is now at an all-time high. This metric has exceeded previous peaks that preceded major drawdowns, such as in the summer of 2000 before the dotcom crash, or in January 2022 when the market started to price a surge in interest rates.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\n\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets on a bottom sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from rate cuts until there’s a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\nEquity investor sentiment was bullish for a third straight week, although the gap over more pessimistic views has narrowed slightly, according to Deutsche Bank AG strategists.\nThe team including Parag Thatte said aggregate equity positioning declined last week, but remains modestly overweight.\nMeantime, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Ben Snider noted the bank’s baseline macro outlook is “supportive for small-cap upside in early 2026.”\n“We do not believe markets are fully pricing the likely strength of the US economy next year, and small-caps typically outperform during cyclical rallies,” they wrote.\n\nSell-side strategists have issued year-end targets for the S&P 500 that are clustered the tightest in almost a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With the highest forecast from Oppenheimer & Co. at 8,100 and the lowest from Stifel Nicolaus & Co. at 7,000, the gap in their annual outlook is just 16%.\nSuch lockstep views are generally considered a contrarian signal — when everyone’s leaning the same way, the imbalance often rights itself. They also come at a time when market risks are visible. Still, strategists on average see more gains for stocks in 2026, even after three straight years of double-digit returns.\n“Can the market hold up if AI enthusiasm and a dovish Fed aren’t helping it?” said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report. “The answer is yes, but only as long as economic growth stays solid.”\nEssaye noted that there was a data deluge last week, and the net result was that economic data and inflation remain “Goldilocks enough to help support stocks.”\n\nAn S&P 500 valuation metric that adds in consumer sentiment suggests stocks are better positioned for gains next year than a more conventional price-earning multiple measure might indicate, according to veteran investment strategist Jim Paulsen.\nHe says that both price-earnings ratios and consumer confidence are “abnormal,” with today’s S&P 500 price-earnings multiple higher than 94% of the time since 1960, while consumer sentiment is at its first percentile since then. The unusually-high PE multiple might be alarming if it weren’t for the accompanying exceptionally low sentiment, he says, writing that “until the Emotion-Adjusted PE rises to a concerning level, investors may be best served by remaining bullish.”\nUS PREVIEW: Third-Quarter GDP to Prove Resilient Despite Tariffs\n“Economic data will start to hit the wires tomorrow, but for now, traders are taking their cue from the general sense amongst participants that there’s little standing in the way for a Santa Claus rally to manifest,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn the run-up to Tuesday’s reading on the economy, Bloomberg Economics estimates the US likely grew more than 3% in the third quarter, supported by robust consumer spending and modest investment gains — defying headwinds from tariff-related uncertainty.\n“The incoming economic data is second-tier at best, a fact that further reinforces the notion that rates will stay in an all-too-familiar territory as 2026 quickly approaches,” said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets.\nCorporate Highlights:\nAlphabet Inc. has agreed to buy clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash, plus existing debt, marking one of the largest deals by the tech giant to dramatically expand its data center footprint for AI.\nNvidia Corp. has told Chinese clients it aims to ship its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nMeta Platforms Inc.’s Threads will launch podcast previews, or the ability to upload snippets of shows that play directly in user feeds, as part of a broader effort to encourage podcasters and their fans to spend more time on the social network, according to a person familiar with the plans.\nOpenAI has squeezed better margins out of its paid products this year, as it races to maintain its pole position in artificial intelligence, according to a report in The Information.\nTarget Corp., Whole Foods Market and Walmart Inc. will be added as defendants in lawsuits against baby formula maker ByHeart for selling a product potentially contaminated with spores that cause infant botulism.\nNetflix Inc. refinanced part of a $59 billion bridge loan with cheaper and longer-term debt, bolstering the financial package underpinning its bid for Warner Bros.

      "Content": "Will More Circular Deal-Making Be in the Cards for Nvidia in 2026?\n\nJoey Frenette\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:40 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Circular dealmaking among tech firms, like Nvidia, is expected to continue through 2025.\nEnterprise AI adoption may accelerate if evidence of strong ROI emerges in the future.\nAmazon is reportedly considering a $10B investment in OpenAI.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe circular nature of the deals and partnerships we've seen across the AI space may make some skeptics and those worried about a looming AI bubble burst a bit woozy. Undoubtedly, it seems like a new deal is coming in every couple of weeks. And if each new announcement or rumor has you on pause, you're definitely not alone.\nAnd while adding more dominoes to the row might make for a more spectacular implosion at some point down the road, investors might wish to take a step back and reconsider what every new deal means and whether it really is a sign that we're headed for a repeat of the events that unfolded in the late-1990s.\nAll these deals seem to fuel the AI bubble fears With Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) most recently reported to be considering a big $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the web of deals across big tech titans seems to be getting bigger and more interlinked. Does that mean the risks are higher?\nPossibly. But adding more dominoes to the row might not be all too big of a deal if there's nobody who nudges one of them anytime soon. As always, timing is such a hard thing to get right. If you don't get the timing right, you may as well be wrong about the bubble situation.\n\nAnd while AI bubble talks are probably going to be the talk of the town in 2026, I think investors might be better off sticking with individual value names rather than dismissing all stocks until that big crash comes. Indeed, timing the market, even when valuations are on the higher end, might not be all too beneficial.\nSo, in my view, the question of whether we're in a bubble or not might matter a whole lot less if you're diversified and ready to ride through a storm.\nCould the circular AI deals keep happening, even as investors give a thumbs down? Whether it's OpenAI or Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) that keeps its foot to the deal-making pedal, I don't think investors should hit the panic button just yet, especially as many others are already acting as though AI has run into a brick wall. While increased collaborations between tech titans and innovative startups could make it harder to track systemic risk, I do think that such circularity stands to accelerate efforts while reducing waste.\n\nStory Continues\nUndoubtedly, raising the bar on risk isn't exactly what retail investors want from the big tech titans they hold shares in. But the more elevated risk profile, I believe, also accompanies greater potential rewards if things go right. In essence, the bear case gets more bearish while the bull case might get that much more bullish. At the end of the day, large-scale AI and ambitious goals (think reaching artificial general intelligence, or AGI) are profound challenges that require group effort.\n\nAs a builder of the most powerful GPUs out there, Nvidia stands out as a firm that should keep making deals where possible to keep advancing the technology. So, should investors expect more circular dealmaking in the new year?\nTime will tell, but I'd say it's probable, especially as enterprise adoption of AI looks to pick up, should more evidence of monetization arise.\nRight now, it's unclear if the return on investment will be there. And while we might not know what the ROIs will be in the near future, I do think that there's a chance that if evidence of a decent ROI suddenly comes flowing in, an AI adoption floodgate might just open, unlocking another wave of growth for the firms across the AI stack.\nThe bottom line Of course, we can only speculate for now, but it seems like many analysts see more circular deals in the new year. And as the king of AI chips, Nvidia is likelier than not to be involved, as too are leading model makers like OpenAI. So, in short, expect more of the same in the AI scene.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "This Nvidia Rival is More Expensive Than Nvidia. Is it Worth the Price?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia is the top maker of AI chips, and this business has driven billion-dollar revenue growth.\nThe company faces a competitor that’s made great progress in recent years.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nAs the artificial intelligence (AI) story unfolds, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has so far been the leading character. This is because the company makes the key tool that's spurred all of the action: AI chips. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) fuel critical tasks like the training of AI models so that they later can go on to work for us.\n\nNvidia's leadership in the AI chip market and its development of an entire suite of related products and services have helped the company generate record revenue in recent years, with its latest annual sales figure coming in at $130 billion, and the stock price has soared. Over the past three years, Nvidia shares have climbed more than 900%.\nBut Nvidia isn't alone in the AI chip market, and a certain rival has made significant progress in recent years. I'm talking about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) . The company has put the focus on serving AI, and like Nvidia, has seen its revenue and stock price take off. In fact, right now, AMD actually is more expensive than Nvidia as it trades at a higher valuation. Is it worth the price? Let's find out.\nFirst to market Nvidia was first to market with its GPUs for AI , and that has helped it build leadership. But in recent years, AMD has prioritized the development of accelerators for AI, and its work is bearing fruit. The company introduced its Instinct GPUs for data centers in late 2016 and has since added to this collection.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are known as the fastest around, and the company's extensive menu of compatible products makes it easy for a Nvidia customer to stick with the company year after year. The market leader has remained a step ahead when it comes to performance, particularly in the area of inferencing, or the powering of AI models as they go through the \"thinking\" process to solve problems.\nBut AMD's GPUs have delivered growth because they also are very powerful and pricing is competitive. And this has helped supercharge revenue growth. In the recent quarter, revenue climbed 36% to a high of $9.2 billion, thanks to demand for AI processors and accelerators. And the pace of quarterly earnings gains over the past three years offers us reason to be optimistic about AMD's growth.\nBenefiting from infrastructure spending AMD doesn't have to unseat Nvidia to succeed in the AI market -- considering Nvidia's prediction for $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the coming five years, there's room for more than one player to win. Data centers often order material from a variety of players, even if they favor Nvidia's platforms.\n\nStory Continues\nAll of this is great news for AMD. But the one element that I've looked at with concern in recent months is the stock's valuation -- particularly in relation to that of Nvidia. Today, trading for more than 50x forward earnings estimates, it's priced at a premium compared to its bigger rival. As shown in the chart below, Nvidia trades for 37x forward earnings estimates.\nNvidia's growth vs AMD's growth Meanwhile, Nvidia's growth has been consistently higher than that of AMD. For example, in the third quarter, Nvidia's revenue jumped 62% to a record $57 billion. And this showed an acceleration of growth, since Nvidia's revenue rose 56% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, Nvidia's plan to update its GPUs on an annual basis should keep growth going -- the company spoke of enormous demand for both its Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra platforms, each released over the past year. Next year, the plan is to launch the Rubin system, and that may be a catalyst for revenue and share price gains.\n\nAMD also continues to innovate, but it may be extremely difficult for the company to step ahead of Nvidia. As I mentioned earlier, the positive point is that the chip designer doesn't have to beat Nvidia to succeed in this market. And AMD's revenue trends over the past few years and recent results are fantastic. But I wouldn't pay more for the company today than I would for Nvidia -- so I would put AMD on my watch list for now and look for opportunities to eventually buy on the dip.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "SoftBank Races to Secure $22.5 Billion OpenAI Funding by Year-End\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 9:58 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: SFTBF\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nTMUS\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nSoftBank Group ( SOBKY ) is pushing to finalize a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by year-end, according to Reuters sources, as Masayoshi Son sharpens the company's focus on artificial intelligence. To assemble the capital, SoftBank has already exited its entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and reduced its holding in T-Mobile US by $4.8 billion, while significantly slowing activity at the Vision Fund. Sources said most new investments above $50 million now require Son's direct approval, underscoring how central the OpenAI deal has become to SoftBank's strategy.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SOBKY.\nIs SOBKY fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe group is also lining up additional funding levers that could support the commitment. SoftBank is preparing the IPO of PayPay, now expected in the first quarter of next year after delays tied to the U.S. government shutdown, with sources indicating the listing could raise more than $20 billion. At the same time, the company is exploring sales of part of its stake in Didi Global ahead of the ride-hailing firm's planned Hong Kong listing. As of Sept. 30, SoftBank reported parent-level cash of 4.2 trillion yen and retained a roughly 4% stake in T-Mobile US, providing flexibility alongside potential margin loans backed by its Arm Holdings stake.\n\nThe funding is seen as important for OpenAI as it ramps up spending on model training and infrastructure amid intensifying competition from Alphabet. SoftBank agreed in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, with the bulk of the funds contingent on the startup's transition to a for-profit structure, completed in October, and OpenAI expects the remaining capital to arrive by the end of 2025 under the contract terms. Both companies are also investors in Stargate, a $500 billion AI data-center initiative, as tech groups including Meta Platforms commit unprecedented sums to computing capacityan environment that could offer long-term opportunity, while also raising investor questions about returns across the AI buildout cycle.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Tencent is reportedly the end customer, meaning it can access top tier AI computing power without the chips ever being used inside China, where Blackwell remains restricted.

A spokesperson told Seeking Alpha that approved firms are allowed to operate cloud infrastructure outside restricted countries, adding that overseas cloud demand supports U.S. technology leadership.\nWhy it matters: this is a reminder that the AI chip battle is increasingly playing out in the cloud, where borders matter less than data center locations.

The U.S. chipmaker expects to deliver 5,000 to 10,000 modules, equivalent to about 40,000 to 80,000 H200 chips, sourced from existing inventory.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe shipments would be the first since Washington eased restrictions on AI chip sales to China, allowing exports with a 25% tariff. The policy shift marks a reversal from prior limits under the Biden administration, which had barred advanced chip sales citing national security risks.\nNvidia has informed Chinese clients that it will open new production capacity for H200 orders in the second quarter of 2026, though the plan still requires Chinese regulatory approval. The H200, part of Nvidia's Hopper line, remains widely used across AI data centers despite being succeeded by the company's newer Blackwell chips.\nThe company's move comes as Chinese technology firms, including Alibaba Group and ByteDance, seek access to high performance processors amid a domestic shortage. Approval from Beijing would provide them with significantly more powerful AI computing capabilities than current local alternatives.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radars.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares haven’t performed well lately. They are up by 30.9% year-to-date, but since October end, the stock is down by 12.6% amidst worries about an AI bubble and competition in the AI chip industry. However, the weakness hasn’t stopped analysts from expressing optimism about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares. One such example came on December 19th when Tigress Financial kept a Strong Buy rating and raised the share price target to $350. As part of its rationale, the financial firm pointed out that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top investment choice in AI and enjoys a comfortable position across the data center stack. It added that the firm was also making inroads into other markets, such as autonomous driving. Tigress’ optimism followed Bernstein’s coverage on December 15th when the firm reiterated an Outperform rating and a $275 share price target for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock. Cramer’s been highly enthusiastic about the firm throughout 2025, but in this appearance, he advised caution:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "3 Soaring Stocks to Hold for the Next 20 Years\n\nRick Munarriz, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBABA\n\n^GSPC\n\nNU\n\nKey Points Shares of Nvidia, Alibaba Group, and Nu Holdings have more than doubled the S&P 500's 16% return in 2025.\nDespite their recent gains, all three stocks are positioned to continue beating the market.\nNvidia may have the world's largest market cap, but ceilings can sometimes be retractable roofs.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nStocks are rallying this year, and naturally, some names are faring better than others. It may be tempting to pass on some of the top stocks of 2025 as big gainers in 2026 and beyond, but that could be a huge mistake. Winners keep winning.\nThe market is up 16% this year. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) , and Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) have at least doubled the S&P 500 's year-to-date gain. I think these are three soaring stocks that could serve you well over the next two decades. Let's take a short look a their long-term potential.\n1. Nvidia: Up 35% in 2025 They say that the bigger they are, the harder they fall. Owner of the country's largest market cap for most of the time since the summer of last year, Nvidia certainly fits the bill as the biggest U.S. exchange-listed stock. If I can revisit the old adage, I would say that the bigger they are, the harder they enthrall.\n\nNvidia became the first company to ever cross a market cap of $5 trillion two months ago. It has since retreated to $4.4 trillion, but don't get caught up in how high a market price tag can go. Focus on Nvidia's growth potential, its forward valuation, and how this generational wealth builder might be cheaper than you think.\nThe Nvidia story has been told often and better than I could ever tell it. In a nutshell, it's a chipmaker that made breakthroughs with graphics cards, initially appealing to video gamers. Nvidia would introduce the first single-chip graphics processing unit (GPU) 26 years ago. Flash forward to now, and GPUs and other high-performance chips are at the heart of crypto mining and more importantly, cranking out artificial intelligence (AI) results.\n\nGrowth has been spectacular as the world clamors for its AI chips to fuel data centers. After back-to-back years of triple-digit revenue growth, Nvidia's top line is still expected to increase at a healthy 63% pace for the current fiscal year that ends next month. Business is expected to continue decelerating in the year ahead, rising at a still-impressive 49%. The bottom line is expected to rise even higher, increasing by 60% next year.\nDespite the stock's stellar run -- it's a 13-bagger over the past five years -- the shares are surprisingly cheap. You can buy Nvidia for just 24 times forward earnings. Bears will argue that today's growth isn't sustainable, but it's not as if the company is operating at full strength. It's currently dealing with revenue- and margin-gnawing trade restrictions in China that have been holding back its true potential.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Alibaba Group: Up 78% Nvidia's challenges in China could be an opportunity for one of the world's largest e-commerce companies. Alibaba is in a great place. It operates China's leading business-to-consumer platform and consumer-to-consumer marketplace. The two businesses account for 45% of Alibaba's consolidated revenue, but generated 113% of its consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in fiscal 2025.\n\nAlibaba is using those two cash cows to bankroll investments, including international e-commerce and the development of AI chips. Throw in a cash-rich balance sheet, and Alibaba is able to self-fund some exciting long-term bets and still be able to aggressively participate in share buybacks.\nHow cheap is Alibaba? You can buy it for 20 times trailing earnings and 16 times what it's expected to earn in the new fiscal year starting in April. It's not growing at a very exciting pace, but it has a deep bench of future growth catalysts that deserves a strong premium to the market.\n3. Nu Holdings: Up 58% Let's keep globetrotting with the parent company of Brazil's Nubank. Nu Holdings has emerged as one of the world's fastest-growing fintechs and providers of digital banking services. It launched just 11 years ago, but more than 60% of Brazil's adult population already has either a Nubank credit card or an active account with the company.\n\nRevenue and adjusted net income rose 39% and 38%, respectively, in its latest quarter. Nu has also expanded into Mexico and Colombia, giving it two markets still early in their growth trajectories. Like Nvidia and Alibaba, you can buy this very profitable hot stock at a discount to its growth. Nu Holdings stock is trading for a reasonable 19 times forward earnings.\nSure, you could've bought Nvidia, Alibaba, and Nu at a much lower price earlier this year. The stories have only gotten better, and these should continue to be market beaters in the coming years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Oil and gold rallied as the dollar fell.\nEquities erased their December losses, with the S&P 500 set for an eighth straight up month - the longest winning run since 2018. Over 400 of its shares rose as the gauge approached a record. Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. led megacaps higher. A gauge of smaller firms climbed 1.5%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working.

Their expectations of a further rally are outweighing concerns over rich valuations. The Federal Reserve path is also being closely watched, with two rate cuts priced for next year.\nFed Governor Stephen Miran told Bloomberg Television the central bank risks sparking a recession unless it continues lowering rates next year.\nThe S&P 500 hovered near 6,875. The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose two basis points to 4.17%. The dollar halted a three-day advance. Bitcoin climbed to around $90,000.\nOil rallied while gold and silver jumped to all-time highs amid geopolitical tensions.\nBuoyed by tech, the long-term valuation ratio of the S&P 500 is now at an all-time high. This metric has exceeded previous peaks that preceded major drawdowns, such as in the summer of 2000 before the dotcom crash, or in January 2022 when the market started to price a surge in interest rates.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets on a bottom sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from rate cuts until there’s a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\nEquity investor sentiment was bullish for a third straight week, although the gap over more pessimistic views has narrowed slightly, according to Deutsche Bank AG strategists.\nThe team including Parag Thatte said aggregate equity positioning declined last week, but remains modestly overweight.\nMeantime, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Ben Snider noted the bank’s baseline macro outlook is “supportive for small-cap upside in early 2026.”\n“We do not believe markets are fully pricing the likely strength of the US economy next year, and small-caps typically outperform during cyclical rallies,” they wrote.\n\nSell-side strategists have issued year-end targets for the S&P 500 that are clustered the tightest in almost a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With the highest forecast from Oppenheimer & Co. at 8,100 and the lowest from Stifel Nicolaus & Co. at 7,000, the gap in their annual outlook is just 16%.\nSuch lockstep views are generally considered a contrarian signal — when everyone’s leaning the same way, the imbalance often rights itself. They also come at a time when market risks are visible.

That's according to three people familiar with the matter speaking to Reuters. Nvidia has reportedly also told Chinese clients that it plans to add new production capacity for the chip. Although significant uncertainty remains. Beijing has yet to approve any H200 purchases. And the sources added that the timeline could shift depending on government decisions. Nvidia and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The planned shipments would mark the first deliveries of H200 chips to China after Donald Trump said this month that Washington would allow such sales with a 25% fee. It comes as China pushes to develop its domestic AI chip industry. Local firms have yet to match the H200's performance, raising concerns that allowing imports could slow domestic progress. Reuters reported this month that Chinese officials held emergency meetings to discuss the matter and are weighing whether to allow shipments.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia dominated the headlines in 2025 — these were its 15 biggest events of the year\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:01 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nSSNLF\n\n005380.KS\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nIt’s difficult to think of any single company that had a bigger impact on Wall Street and the AI trade in 2025 than Nvidia ( NVDA ).\nInvestors scrutinized CEO Jensen Huang’s every move, whether that was his meetings with President Trump or a night out with the heads of Samsung and Hyundai for fried chicken and beer.\n\nNvidia’s revenue soared in 2025, bringing in $187.1 billion, and its market capitalization continued to climb, briefly eclipsing the $5 trillion mark, before settling back in the $4 trillion range.\nThere were plenty of major highs and deep lows throughout the year, but these 15 were among the biggest moments of Nvidia’s 2025.\nJan. 6: CES 2025 Nvidia rang in the new year with a series of product announcements ranging from a new pint-sized AI chip to more powerful gaming cards at CES 2025. Huang’s keynote touched on an array of topics, including physical AI, otherwise known as robots; desktop-based AI systems; and a litany of AI software updates that set the stage for the company’s 2025.\n\nJan. 27: The DeepSeek moment Nvidia had an incredible year by seemingly every measure, but it started out with a shock. In January, DeepSeek released its R-1 model, which the company claimed it trained using less than state-of-the-art processors. That sent the AI trade into a meltdown, with the company shedding nearly $600 billion from its market cap in a single day.\nDespite the initial blowup, fears that AI companies would no longer need high-powered chips seem to have been overblown. That’s because training AI models and running them are two different operations, and according to Nvidia, running models with more powerful chips improves overall performance.\nMarkets eventually settled down as more companies agreed with the assumption, but Nvidia’s stock price didn’t return to pre-DeepSeek levels until June.\n\nMarch 18: Nvidia reveals Blackwell Ultra chips at GTC Nvidia’s annual GTC event, held in San Jose, used to be a moderately sized tech conference. But this year’s GTC was far different . Huang’s keynote filled the SAP Center, home of the San Jose Sharks hockey team, and Nvidia took over a large swath of downtown San Jose, which included an enormous collection of food tents and stalls that covered the 2.3-acre Plaza de César Chávez.\nDuring his speech, Huang debuted Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra chip, the successor to its Blackwell GPU, and the GB300 superchip, which combined two Blackwell GPUs and one of Nvidia’s Grace CPUs.\nThe CEO said the offerings were built for the age of “AI reasoning” and said models like DeepSeek’s R-1 would run far better on Nvidia’s latest and greatest.\n\nStory Continues\nApril 2: 'Liberation Day' Trump’s decision to implement a series of tariffs on countries and goods on April 2, which he called “Liberation Day,” sent the stock market into such a nosedive that the president had no choice but to walk some of them back just a week later.\nNvidia wasn’t immune to the drop. The company saw its stock price decline from $110 on April 2 to $94.31 on April 4. Shares returned to pre-\"Liberation Day\" numbers by April 9, but continued to waffle until breaking out of their slump on April 25.\nApril 15: H20 effectively banned Nvidia’s April didn’t get much better when the Trump administration implemented new chip restrictions that called for Nvidia to receive a license to ship the H20 chip to China , effectively banning sales of the processor to the country.\nNvidia designed the GPU to meet restrictions set up during President Joe Biden’s administration. Trump, however, blocked the China-specific chip on security grounds. The company ended up writing down $4.5 billion in charges related to the H20 in Q1 and took an additional $4 billion in Q2.\n\nJuly 9: Nvidia hits $4 trillion Despite taking a hit from the DeepSeek meltdown and Trump’s China ban, Nvidia stock continued to perform, and in July the company became the first to see its market capitalization pass the $4 trillion mark .\nNvidia topped $1 trillion in 2023 and took just three years to add another $3 trillion, thanks to its leadership position in the AI chip market.\nJuly 14: Nvidia can sell H20 in China again In July, the on-again-off-again relationship between Washington and China was back on, with Nvidia announcing that the Trump administration had assured the company that it would allow sales of H20 chips to China .\nHuang successfully made the case that America would benefit from selling its technologies to China and risked falling behind if it completely cut itself off from the market, convincing Trump to allow Nvidia to sell to the country again.\n\nAug. 11: Nvidia to pay 15% cut on China sales Although the White House assured Nvidia it would approve the sale of its chips to China, the administration later announced that it would take a 15% cut of the sales . The same rule applied to Nvidia rival AMD ( AMD ).\nDespite the potential revenue haircut, investors on Wall Street weren’t too bothered by the announcement, figuring that 85% of the revenue from sales to the country was better than the 0% Nvidia was bringing in before.\n\nSept. 22: Nvidia says it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI In September, Nvidia announced it would invest upward of $100 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI . The partnership would let OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) build out 10 gigawatts or more of data center capacity, allowing it to train and run its GPT models.\nNvidia’s deals have raised eyebrows among analysts who warn that such circular investments, where a company (Nvidia) invests in a customer (OpenAI) and uses that cash to purchase chips from the investor (Nvidia), artificially boost AI spending.\nNvidia has faced criticism for a similar deal with CoreWeave ( CRWV ). Nvidia invested in the company, which then turned around and bought Nvidia chips. Such deals have driven at least part of the discussion around an AI bubble.\n\nOct. 17: Nvidia’s first Blackwell chip built in US The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has made reshoring chip manufacturing a national imperative. And while Nvidia doesn’t build its own chips — it outsources that to TSMC — it did celebrate that company’s completion of the first Blackwell chip built in the US in October .\n\nOct. 29: Nvidia hits $5 trillion Nvidia’s market capitalization hit $5 trillion in late October , just a few months after crossing the $4 trillion mark.\nThe exuberance came as the company announced a number of new deals with companies like Uber at its first GTC event in Washington, D.C. It also followed word that Huang would meet with Trump in South Korea ahead of the president’s meeting with Xi Jinping to discuss a trade deal.\nThe hope was that Trump and Xi would reach an agreement to allow Nvidia to sell its chips in the country, but a deal never materialized.\n\nOct. 30: Viral fried chicken photo with leaders of Samsung and Hyundai Huang’s star exploded throughout 2025, so much so that in October, reporters and onlookers swarmed a South Korean fried chicken restaurant to catch a glimpse of him dining with the heads of Samsung and Hyundai. An image of the trio subsequently went viral .\nNov. 19: Nvidia to ship chips to the Middle East Nvidia received authorization to ship the equivalent of more than 60,000 Blackwell chips to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in November as the company continued to vie for the opportunity to sell its processors to a wider array of countries.\nThe company has pushed the concept of sovereign AI throughout 2025, saying that it allows countries around the world to get access to their own AI data centers without having to rely on other nations.\nBut China hawks said the move could give the US adversary access to Nvidia chips, due to that country’s close relationship with the UAE.\n\nNov. 25: Nvidia’s Google tweet Nvidia has faced threats from its own customers, including Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Amazon ( AMZN ), building their own chips to power their AI platforms, but in November, a report that Google could provide Meta ( META ) with its own tensor processing units (TPUs) for the social media giant’s data centers seemed to spook Nvidia.\n\nThe company sent out a viral tweet in response to the story, congratulating Google on its chips’ performance, but pointed out that its own GPUs were a generation ahead of Google’s and noted that it’s the only chip that can run all AI models .\nDec. 9.: Nvidia H200 approved for China After a year of will he, won’t he, Trump wrote in a post on the Truth Social platform that he was greenlighting the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China . The H200 is two generations behind Nvidia’s current Blackwell Ultra processors.\nTrump said that Xi responded positively to the deal, which, if fully approved by the countries, could provide a boost to Nvidia’s bottom line.\nStill, there’s no guarantee that the arrangement won’t fall apart. Nvidia has become a negotiating chip for the two countries, just as Apple was before, and could see its chips banned again.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

(NASDAQ: CSCO ) is included among the 13 Top Tech Stocks Paying Consistent Dividends .\nImage by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay\nOn December 17, Morgan Stanley lifted its price target on Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) to $91 from $82 and kept an Overweight rating on the stock. The firm said the AI trade widened beyond semiconductor stocks in 2025, giving a boost to infrastructure companies. Optical networking has been a clear beneficiary. The analyst expects that trend to carry into the first half of 2026. However, looking further out, the analyst noted that investors will “need to get more selective for full year returns given multiples.”\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)’s long-standing strength in networking is becoming more relevant in the age of artificial intelligence, especially as agentic AI gains traction. Products like Nexus HyperFabric bring together Cisco’s networking capabilities with Nvidia’s computing and AI software, allowing companies to build infrastructure tailored for AI workloads. Cisco is also pushing into security, describing its Hypershield platform as a fully distributed, AI-native cybersecurity solution.\nThose efforts are showing up in the numbers. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) posted 5% year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2025, with sales reaching $56.7 billion for the year ended July 26. Growth picked up in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, ending October 25, when revenue rose 8% to $14.9 billion.\n\nManagement expects that momentum to continue. For fiscal 2026, Cisco is forecasting revenue between $60.2 billion and $61 billion.\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) develops and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and a range of technology services used by enterprises, service providers, and governments worldwide.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The renewed momentum follows two standout Shanghai debuts earlier this month, where Moore Threads Technology Co. advanced 425% on its first trading day and MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai Co. rose 693%, signaling strong domestic demand for companies positioned as future national champions. Some investors suggest that, over time, these firms could evolve into credible competitors to established global players such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), particularly as China accelerates efforts to build a self-sufficient AI hardware ecosystem.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAttention is now shifting to the next wave of listings, especially in Hong Kong, which may serve as a broader test of international investor confidence. Shanghai Biren Technology Co., viewed as one of China's more promising GPU developers, has filed for a Hong Kong IPO after receiving approval to issue up to 372.5 million new shares and is expected to begin sounding out investors this month for a deal of about $600 million, despite its inclusion on Washington's entity list in 2023. Baidu Inc.'s AI chip unit Kunlunxin is also considering a Hong Kong listing at a valuation of at least $3 billion, reflecting its strategic role in supporting Baidu's growing demand for data-center computing power.

Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.\n\nOpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro , Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet , and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.\n\nOpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4 , an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog . It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.\nOpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported , citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.\nOpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\nOpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”\n\nOpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May . The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.\n\nChatGPT users have generated over 700M images so far More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap . The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.\n\nOpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.\n\nOpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays In a series of posts on X , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote.\n\nMarch 2025 OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.\n\nOpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images . The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.\n\nOpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said .\n\nOpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.\n\nOpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported , citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.\n\nChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.\n\nOpenAI announces leadership updates Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products , according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.\n\nOpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels . The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch .\n\nOpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information . One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\n\nOpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”\n\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs : a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1 OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X , that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing . He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nOpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product . The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API , which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’ OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information . One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nChatGPT can directly edit your code The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools , including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025 . ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.\n\nFebruary 2025 OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X , Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’ OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nJanuary 2025 OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”\nChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders . For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’ OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.\n\nFAQs: What is ChatGPT? How does it work? ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI .

He added that, given current levels, we would be buyers here.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nRasgon noted Nvidia stock is up roughly 30% year to date but has stalled since July. That pause pushed forward valuation down to just under 25 times earnings, after a roughly 27% multiple contraction this year. By one measure, the stock sits in the bottom 11% of its historical valuation range.\nThe analyst pointed out Nvidia now trades at about a 13% discount to the broader semiconductor index, a rare relative cheapness that has appeared only a handful of days over the past decade.\nRasgon acknowledged investor worries about a slowdown in AI spending, longer-term capex plans and competition from custom chips. He said those concerns may be overstated and that demand for GPUs remains healthy.\nUpcoming product catalysts such as Rubin and the longer-term Blackwell opportunity could refocus attention, Rasgon added. Events like CES and GTC may also help reset expectations for Nvidia's roadmap and address questions around China sales.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI Chips Are Driving a Foundry Boom. Why TSMC Is Winning the Most\n\nNauman Khan\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:33 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nGlobal semiconductor foundry revenue rose about 17% year over year to roughly $84.8 billion in the third quarter of 2025, supported by strong demand for artificial intelligence chips built on advanced manufacturing nodes, according to a research note from Counterpoint Research.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( NYSE:TSM ) widened its lead, with market share edging up to about 72%. The gains followed higher output of its 3-nanometer process and solid utilization of 4- and 5-nanometer capacity, used heavily by AI accelerator customers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), and Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ).\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with INTC.\nIs INTC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTSMC's foundry revenue grew more than 40% from a year earlier, outpacing the broader market. Counterpoint said most rival foundries posted slower growth, with non-TSMC players collectively expanding revenue by about 6%, reflecting softer orders after earlier tariff-related demand but some support from China's subsidy programs.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts said capacity limits at advanced nodes and constraints in advanced chip packaging, known as CoWoS, may cap sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Full-year 2025 foundry revenue growth is estimated at around 15%.\nCounterpoint expects the pure-play foundry segment to grow at a faster pace, helped by continued shipments of AI GPUs and custom AI chips. Texas Instruments ( NASDAQ:TXN ), Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ), Infineon (IFNNY), and Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) maintained mid-single-digit market shares.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Discovery ( WBD ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Clearwater Analytics ( CWAN ). Watch the video above to hear the headlines driving interest in these stocks.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:04 Speaker A\nWelcome back to Morning Brief presented by Robin Hood. Now, time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Warner Brothers Discovery, Nvidia, and Clearwater Analytics.\n00:13 Speaker A\nFirst up is WBD and Paramount Skydance, the takeover battle ratcheting up yet again this morning as Paramount Skydance amended its offer. Here are the key updates.\n00:23 Speaker A\nLarry Ellison, of course, the father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison will personally guarantee more than $40 billion in equity financing for the deal.\n00:33 Speaker A\nHe also agreed not to revoke the Ellison Family Trust, and Paramount raised the termination fee on the deal to $5.8 billion. That matches the number from Netflix.\n00:43 Speaker A\nWhat do these moves do? They basically resolve some concerns that WBD's board had had regarding Paramount's original offer, but Paramount did not raise the overall offer price from $30 a share.\n00:53 Speaker A\nNext up, Nvidia. The stock is higher ahead of the opening bell as the company is reportedly gearing up for shipments of its chips into China next year.\n01:01 Speaker A\nReuters is reporting that the chip giants in talks with clients to start shipping out its H200 chips by mid-February. Despite these plans, there's still of course plenty of uncertainty. Beijing has not approved any purchases yet.\n01:14 Speaker A\nAnd finally, Clearwater Analytics. It's a merger Monday on Wall Street. Shares of the software company Clearwater, they are going private, soaring on news that they're going private.\n01:23 Speaker A\nPrivate equity firms, Premiera and Warburg Pincus are leading the group in the deal. It's valued at $8.7 billion.\n01:31 Speaker A\nAnd Clearwater shareholders will get $24.55 a share in cash. That's a 47% premium from its share price on November 10th. That's the last trading day before the first reports of deal talks.\n01:43 Speaker A\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Oil and gold climbed as the dollar fell.\nEquities erased their December losses, with the S&P 500 set for an eighth straight up month - the longest winning run since 2018. Nvidia Corp. rose as Reuters reported the firm has told Chinese clients it aims to ship its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working.

Their expectations of a further rally are outweighing concerns over rich AI valuations. The Federal Reserve path is also being closely watched, with two US cuts priced for next year.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets a bottom will be achieved sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from any more rate cuts until there is a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced one basis point to 4.16%. The dollar halted a three-day advance.

Discovery Inc.\nParamount Skydance Corp. amended its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., including by offering a personal financial guarantee by Oracle Corp.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( YM=F ) also added around 0.5%, with the major US gauges eyeing a third straight day of gains.\n\nTech stocks are continuing to recover from a volatile streak, which came as investors wavered between dueling pressures: worries about AI bubble versus fear of missing out on an AI boom. But faith in the AI trade surged again late last week, thanks largely to positive developments for Oracle ( ORCL ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ).\n\nInvestors are now looking for tech to maintain the momentum, as they gauge the prospects for a Santa Claus rally . Stocks are entering the final stretch of 2025 trading within striking distance their record highs, after a surprise drop in inflation and lukewarm labor market data left bets on 2026 interest-rate cuts mostly intact.\nElsewhere, geopolitical tensions helped lift gold ( GC=F ) and silver ( SI=F ) to fresh record highs , while crude oil ( CL=F , BZ=F ) futures also gained as the US ramped up its blockade of Venezuela. The Coast Guard chased a third oil tanker off the country's coast, after seizing a second carrier on Sunday.\nLooking ahead, this week brings the release of piecemeal economic data delayed by the US shutdown. Most land on Tuesday, with the highlights a first look at third quarter GDP and updates on the PCE price index for July, August, and September.\nUS stock markets will shut early on Wednesday for the Christmas Eve start of holidays, and will be closed all of Thursday for Christmas Day.\nLIVE 10 updates\n\n35 mins ago Grace O'Donnell\n\nStocks rise to begin holiday-shortened week Stocks rose to kick off the holiday-shortened week as investors looked to move past a shaky start to December in hopes that a seasonal Santa Claus rally might materialize.\nThe Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) rose 0.6% while the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) climbed 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) opened 0.4% higher as the major indexes looked to extend their win streak to a third day.\n\nGold ( GC=F ) and silver ( SI=F ) gained 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively, adding to monthly gains.\nCrude oil prices also increased after the US intercepted a third Venezuelan oil tanker. West Texas Intermediate ( CL=F ), the US benchmark, gained 2.25% to trade around $57 a barrel, and Brent ( BZ=F ), the global benchmark, rose 2.2% to around $61 per barrel.\n\nToday at 2:04 PM UTC Jake Conley\n\nCintas launches second takeover bid for UniFirst Workplace services giant Cintas Corporation ( CTAS ) has launched a second takeover bid for rival UniFirst ( UNF ) with an acquisition offering at $275 per share.\nShares in Unifirst soared by more than 27% in premarket trading following news of the $3.96 billion offer. Cintas slipped by roughly 1.3%.\n\nCintas' offer, at $275 per share, comes roughly 11 months after the company ended talks with UniFirst on an acquisition offer at an identical per-share price. Cintas said at the time that it was unable to engage in \"substantive\" conversations with UniFirst's board.\nCintas' January offer had been valued at roughly $5.2 billion, but shares in UniFirst have plunged by more than 20% through the year after Cintas pulled its original acquisition offer.\n\nToday at 1:46 PM UTC Jake Conley\n\nLarry Ellison plans to personally guarantee $40B for Paramount offer for WBD Larry Ellison, the centibillionaire founder and chairman of Oracle ( ORCL ), has agreed to personally backstop $40.4 billion in equity financing for Paramount Skydance's ( PSKY ) proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ).\nParamount shares spiked by more than 3% in premarket trading, while WBD rose around 3.8%.\n\nIn a securities filing Monday morning, Paramount Skydance — led by Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison — said the elder Ellison had agreed to backstop the financing to assuage fears from WBD that Paramount is too undercapitalized to be able to get an acquisition across the finish line.\nParamount has proposed a $30 per share, all-cash acquisition of both Warner Brothers' studios and streaming division and its linear network division, in a deal valued at $108.4 billion.\nParamount's Monday announcement said the Ellison family trust owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock, and that Larry Ellison had agreed not to revoke the trust or transfer assets while negotiations remain open.\nWBD has in recent weeks become the target of a multi-round bidding war between Paramount and Netflix ( NFLX ) for the storied film studio and collection of broadcast networks.\nPrior to Paramount's announcement on Monday, WBD had rejected the company's acquisition offer, appearing to tip the scales in favor of Netflix's proposal that would see the streaming giant absorb WBD's streaming and studios division.\nWBD's broadcast and linear TV division would continue with plans to be spun off into a separate public company, under the terms of the Netflix offer.\n\nToday at 1:15 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nRocket Lab stock continues to gain on $816 million contract, Electron launch Rocket Lab ( RKLB ) stock extended a nearly 18% gain on Friday, rising another 4% in premarket trading, after securing a $816 million contract to build satellites for the US Space Force and successfully launching its Electron rocket for the 21st time this year.\nThe latest contract with the US Space Development Agency (SDA), announced last Friday, marked Rocket Lab's largest single contract to date and brings its total contract value with the SDA to $1.3 billion.\nAnd the launch of its Electron rocket on Sunday for a Japan-based Earth imaging company called iQPS set a record for the number of successful launches in a year for the company.\nThe twin developments boosted the stock to all-time highs. Over the past five days, Rocket Lab's stock is up about 15%, putting its year-to-date gains at 176%.\n\nToday at 12:41 PM UTC Jenny McCall\n\nGood morning. Here's what's happening today.

The US Coast Guard boarded the Centuries tanker in the Caribbean on Saturday, which was laden with about 2 million barrels of Venezuelan crude. It was also in pursuit of the Bella 1, which was en route to the Latin American nation.\n\nWashington has been stepping up pressure on Nicolás Maduro’s government, with Trump aiming to choke off its key revenue stream. The US has designated the regime as a foreign terrorist organization, accusing it of involvement in drug trafficking. Venezuela still has the world’s largest crude reserves, but its exports, most of which go to China, now account for less than 1% of global demand.\nThere were also heightened risks to supplies from another member of the OPEC+ producer group, after Ukraine hit an oil tanker from Russia’s shadow fleet in the Mediterranean Sea with drones for the first time. That followed strikes on Lukoil PJSC facilities in the Caspian Sea.\nThe geopolitical situation has helped put a floor under oil prices, which have dropped by about a fifth this year. The declines have been driven by an oversupply as both OPEC+ and the group’s competitors raised production will demand growth slowed.",

      "Content": "Nvidia Plans H200 AI Chip Shipments to China Ahead of Lunar New Year\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:18 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nNvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) has told Chinese clients it is aiming to begin shipping its second-most powerful AI chips to China before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, according to people familiar with the discussions. The company plans to fulfill early demand from existing inventory, with initial shipments potentially totaling between 5,000 and 10,000 chip modules, equivalent to roughly 40,000 to 80,000 H200 AI chips. Nvidia has also indicated that it intends to add new production capacity for these chips, with orders for that capacity expected to open in the second quarter of 2026, suggesting a longer-term effort to support demand if approvals are granted.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe proposed shipments remain contingent on regulatory decisions, as Beijing has not yet approved any H200 purchases and timelines could still shift. The discussions follow a policy change after US President Donald Trump said Washington would allow H200 sales to China with a 25% fee, prompting an inter-agency review of export license applications. This approach represents a shift from the previous US stance that barred advanced AI chip sales to China on national security grounds. Reuters has reported that Chinese officials have held emergency meetings to assess whether to permit the imports, including proposals that could require each H200 purchase to be paired with a set ratio of domestic chips.\n\nThe H200, part of Nvidia's Hopper architecture, remains widely used in AI workloads despite being overtaken by the company's newer Blackwell platform, and supply has been constrained as Nvidia prioritizes other product lines. For Chinese technology groups such as Alibaba and ByteDance, access to H200 chips could provide processors estimated to be about six times more powerful than the H20 models Nvidia previously designed for China. At the same time, Chinese policymakers appear to be weighing whether allowing these imports could slow domestic AI chip development, leaving the outcome dependent on government decisions rather than market demand alone.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Only Seen Twice in 153 Years: History’s Clear Warning for the Stock Market in 2026\n\nDavid Beren\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nIt should go without saying that the S&P 500 has been riding high over the last few years and has delivered one of the most impressive runs in market history. Over the past three years, the index has surged a whopping 80%, driven in part by artificial intelligence, falling interest rates, and ongoing corporate earnings growth. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolio balances have reached levels that might have seemed all but impossible to achieve a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 surged 80% over three years. This has occurred only twice before in 153 years.\nPrevious instances (1920s and 1990s) both preceded market crashes of 49% to 89%.\nThe S&P 500 forward P/E sits around 21 to 22. This is roughly 40% above historical averages.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnfortunately, any exceptional performance like this in the market comes with something of a warning label. A three-year gain of this kind of magnitude with the S&P 500 has only occurred twice in the last 153 years of stock market performance. The first, the 1920s bull market, and the late 1990s tech boom both ended in devastating fashion with the Great Depression and the dot-com bust.\nThankfully, history doesn't always guarantee repetition, but it does signal that a pattern could be forming in the sense that markets performing this well for this long could be a giant warning sign for investors. As 2026 gets closer, understanding what happened in the last two instances now just feels like understanding basic risk management.\nThe S&P 500's Ultra-Rare 3-Year Surge: What History Predicts If you look closely, the 80% gain over the last three years roughly translates to anywhere between a 21% and 27% annualized return, which is more than double the S&P 500's long-term average of approximately 10% in gains. The rarity of this occurrence cannot be overstated, considering it has only happened twice in the 153 years, with the 1927-1929 bull market rising 95% and the tech boom between 1995 and 1998 increased 85%.\n\nIf you're seeing giant warning signs today, it's because you know that what is taking place in the market today, performance-wise, is eerily familiar to what has happened before. In the 1920s, you had a market that boomed because of cars becoming more readily available, on top of electrification taking place across cities and non-cities alike. It was the promise of a new era, and the 1990s boom was driven by something similar, as the internet was being heralded as something that was going to transform everything we knew about technology, communication, and just about everything in between.\n\nStory Continues\nThe 80% surge between 2023 and 2025 is following the same pattern, and this is what is causing warning bells to go off. Unsurprisingly, AI is being heralded as the transforming technology, and valuations have expanded significantly as a result. This all feels very much like 1999, and AI is being labeled as the kind of technology that will change everything, just as the internet was heralded as something transforming, and electricity absolutely did transform everything. This all comes together with a clear message in that when the stock market delivers this kind of three-year performance, it precedes major reversals.\n\nAnalyzing the Historical Precedents for 2026 During the 1927 to 1929 surge, the market continued to climb well into September before it all came crashing down in October. The initial 48% decline happened between October and November, but the real impact was felt from the end of 1929 all the way toward the end of 1932, when the total market collapse took place, dropping the market by around 89% in total. Crazily enough, it would take 25 years before the market would return to its 1929 highs.\n\nFast forward to the 1995-1998 surge, the market continued to climb higher and higher through 1999 before it peaked in March 2020. The rest, as they say, is well-known history, as the dot com crash erased 49% of the S&P 500's value in just 2.5 years. The Nasdaq fell 78% and its overall recovery would take another seven years before returning to its starting levels.\nThe takeaway here is that there is a consistent pattern that was followed in both of these cases, in that the market didn't crash immediately after a three-year surge. The market rally actually, and surprisingly, as you look back, continued for an extra year, delivering even more gains before a severe decline. In 2026, the cautionary tale is that history suggests either the market delivers this year as one full of gains or one that shows indicators of a reversal. Suffice it to say, neither scenario paints a pretty picture, as even if investors get one more year of gains, the crash starts and wipes all the gains out.\n\nIs an AI Bubble Forming? The Biggest Risk Heading into 2026 If you have been watching the current level of AI enthusiasm, and who hasn't been, the parallels between today and previous tech bubbles are almost impossible to ignore. We are already seeing just how transformative AI can be, something that echoes what the country saw during the electrification of the 1920s and the internet in the 1990s. Sadly, real technology, no matter how transformative, doesn't always prevent bubbles. If anything, it actually enables a bubble to take place by trying to justify massive corporate valuations.\n\nThe biggest takeaway right now is that the signs of a bubble transformation are present, and they are present across multiple indicators. Valuations for AI-centric stocks are assuming nearly flawless execution and sustained growth continuing for years into the future. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) are all investing billions, tens of billions into AI infrastructure without a clear signal of what the return could be. As a result, the S&P 500's forward P/E is sitting around 21 to 22, approximately 40% above historical averages.\nIf you are a retail investor, and many of us are, this is something to be very aware of, as is options trading, which has seen its volume surge in AI stocks. Reddit, in particular, has come alive with discussion, especially on places like r/WallStreetBets, in a way that feels almost too familiar if you were on message boards during the dot-com era in 1999. On top of social media conversation, you also have companies adding \"AI\" anywhere they can in their core descriptions or even their company names to try and boost valuations. This closely mirrors when companies added \".com\" to their company names in the late 1990s to try to jump on a similar trend.\n\nThe bottom line is that any catalyst for a stock reversal could come from slower-than-anticipated AI adoption or even disappointing returns from AI investments. Add to all of these concerns over an economic slowdown resulting from tariffs, or even inflationary concerns, depending on how the Fed handles interest rates. This all comes together in what could be a perfect storm for either a massive buying shift or a major selling rally, and any instance of the latter is going to feed on itself as panic selling grabs hold until the bottom falls out.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

On December 17, reports emerged indicating NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is planning a $1.5 billion investment to establish the largest server farm in Israel. The company is reportedly in advanced talks with real estate firm Mega Or DC to lease a data center currently under construction in the Mevo Carmel industrial zone.\nThe new server farm is to be located close to another Nvidia farm built in partnership with Shoval Paz and will house the Blackwell Processors. The proposed server farm will span about 30,000 square feet and consume about 64 megawatts of power. NVIDIA is to install a more advanced supercomputer at the site, exceeding the capabilities of Israel-1\n\nThe massive server farm will become Nvidia’s largest research center outside the US. It will also rank among the largest in the Middle East. It will be dedicated to the company’s most advanced technologies, including Blackwell-based systems and integrated Grace Blackwell platforms.\nOn December 11, Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities reiterated that Nvidia is a Buy and stuck with a $275 price target. According to the analyst, the company boasts a competitive edge and growth potential, as its generational GPUs are considered well ahead of competitors’. Likewise, strong partnerships with Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic also provide substantial visibility into demand and supply.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and sells high-performance Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and System-on-a-Chip (SoC) units, evolving from a gaming graphics leader to a powerhouse in Artificial Intelligence (AI), data centers, professional visualization, and automotive tech, providing essential hardware (like GPUs) and software (like CUDA) for complex computing, AI training, and accelerated workloads across many industries.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be the World's Largest Company by Year-End 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:21 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet has a comprehensive AI stack, owning nearly every component of the AI ecosystem.\nIts impressive growth has a long runway to continue as AI adoption spreads.\nThe stock's very reasonable valuation leaves plenty of room to overtake Nvidia's valuation in time.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) investment cycle, where companies are investing billions of dollars in data centers and other infrastructure, has propelled AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to its position as the world's largest company by market capitalization .\nIt's a remarkable feat, and it took the stock price rising nearly 1,000% in just three years to accomplish it. But it's difficult to stay atop the mountain, and a formidable challenger is looming. Initially, investors thought artificial intelligence would threaten tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nHowever, Google's parent company has seized the opportunity and become arguably the most complete AI stock on the market today.\nSo, this Fool is calling it now: Alphabet, not Nvidia, will be the world's largest company in 2026. I state my case below.\nEnvious competitive positioning as the full-stack AI player The AI landscape is still in its early chapters. A lot will happen over the next decade or two, so it's not easy to make many predictions with much confidence. That said, Alphabet could have the strongest argument for a leading role in AI's future.\nIt wouldn't be a stretch to call Alphabet the world's most prominent internet company. It's known for its dominant Google search engine, but in reality, Alphabet's empire casts a far longer shadow. Its chief assets include:\n\nYouTube, the largest streaming platform.\nGoogle Chrome, a leading web browser.\nAndroid, a leading smartphone operating software.\nGoogle Workspace, a collection of internet apps with over 3 billion users.\nThese assets provide Alphabet with key insights and data on most of the world's web users, a crucial resource for developing and training its AI models. Additionally, Alphabet's Google Cloud is the world's third-largest cloud computing services platform, and the company has created custom AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), for its data centers.\nIn other words, Alphabet owns a comprehensive AI ecosystem that gives it a significant competitive advantage over most other AI companies, which typically own only pieces of an ecosystem.\n\nPlenty of growth still to come Some AI hyperscalers have had to take on substantial debt to fund their data center investments. Not Alphabet, which has primarily funded its investments with profits thanks to its various established businesses that generate cash flow like few companies on the planet can.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, Alphabet's core businesses continue to thrive. Revenue from digital advertising through Google and YouTube grew by roughly 15% year over year in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Google Cloud revenue increased by 34% as AI usage drives cloud demand.\nAssuming AI adoption continues to spread throughout society, especially among consumers using AI apps, that growth doesn't seem likely to slow down anytime soon. That's before considering Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary, which continues to expand into new markets and is now seeking funding to accelerate its growth efforts.\n\nAll in all, Wall Street analysts estimate Alphabet will grow its earnings at an annualized rate of 16% over the next three to five years.\nThe stock's valuation is reasonable and has room to run Nvidia certainly has strong growth prospects as well, but some of its customers, such as OpenAI and Oracle , are facing scrutiny for how they will fund their massive AI commitments. In other words, it appears that Nvidia's growth is more fragile because it relies on a small number of customers. For Alphabet, AI adds additional upside to its established cloud and digital ads businesses.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's market cap of $4.3 trillion is just 16% higher than Alphabet's. Alphabet currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, using full-year earnings estimates, a reasonable price tag for high-teens annualized earnings growth, especially for a world-class company with multiple highly profitable businesses.\nThat leaves room for the stock to continue higher through 2026 if Alphabet's businesses continue to perform well. If confidence in Nvidia's growth dips, I could see Alphabet overtaking it.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "These AI Stocks Could Still Deliver Big Upside in December and Beyond\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Nvidia still can't keep up with demand for its data center GPUs.\nAfter a tepid stock performance in 2025, Amazon is looking to bounce back in 2026.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator chips are growing in popularity with hyperscalers.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nAlthough we're nearly at the end of a year during which the S&P 500 gained a strong 16%, there are still plenty of stocks that look like top-tier buys. Some of the biggest names in the market have retreated from their recent highs, and I think investors should consider scooping them up before 2026 arrives. At the top of my last-minute shopping list are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) .\nNvidia Nvidia has been the poster child for the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout since it began. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the computing power for the vast majority of AI workloads today, but investors are worried about two things.\nFirst, they are concerned that there is a general bubble in the AI space. However, with all of the hyperscalers having announced that 2026 will be another year of record-setting capital expenditures, I don't see that thesis as valid. Second, some are worried that Nvidia's dominance in the AI accelerator chip niche is slipping. While there have been several promising product launches from its competitors, Nvidia's GPUs are still the top option. In its earnings release for its fiscal 2026 third quarter, which ended Oct. 26, CEO Jensen Huang stated that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs.\n\nThis is a company that brought in $57 billion in revenue during Q3, and it's clear that it could have made more if it had more chips to sell, so it's hard to say Nvidia's dominance is slipping with a straight face.\nWith Nvidia's stock price down nearly 20% from its all-time high and Wall Street analysts expecting the chipmaker's revenue to grow by 48% next year, I can think of few better buys heading into 2026.\nAmazon Amazon stock is essentially flat for the year. However, some recent events have me bullish about it as we prepare to enter 2026.\nFirst, its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, delivered 20% revenue growth rate in Q3 -- its best rate in years -- showing that it's resurging as the go-to place to bring workloads online. Second, growth in Amazon's advertising service business is also reaccelerating. This segment has become a major part of the company's business over the past few years.\nI think Amazon's stock will come roaring back in 2026, and it will be on the backs of these two important business units.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Broadcom is up by an incredible 40% or so year to date. However, it was previously even higher: The stock sold off heavily after a poorly received earnings report.\nIn its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ended Nov. 2, revenues grew by 28% as diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose 37%. Its AI semiconductor business was a bright spot, with revenue rising 74% year over year. Management expects this trend to continue into Q1, forecasting that its AI semiconductor revenue will more than double. That all sounds impressive, but the stock sold off in part due to revenue timing.\n\nBroadcom told investors that some of its customers wouldn't be purchasing some of their custom AI chips until 2027 and beyond. That was a letdown for investors, and many headed for the exit. As a result, Broadcom's stock is down by more than 20% from its all-time high.\nFollowing the sell-off, Broadcom's stock now trades for about 32 times expected forward earnings.\nConsidering the monster AI-related growth the company expects over the next few years, I think this is a great price to pay for Broadcom's stock. Its AI semiconductor revenue will continue to rise throughout 2026, which will eventually get the market excited about the stock again. But until it does, the stock looks like a great value.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Nvidia and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe planned shipments would mark the first deliveries of H200 chips to China after U.S. President Donald Trump said this month that Washington ​would allow such sales with a 25% fee.\n\nReuters reported last week that the Trump administration had launched ‌an inter-agency review of license applications for H200 chip sales to China, making good on his pledge to allow the sales.\nThe move represents a major policy shift from the Biden administration, which banned advanced AI chip sales to China citing national security concerns.\nThe H200, part of Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper line, remains widely used in AI despite being superseded by the firm's newer Blackwell chips. Nvidia has focused production on Blackwell and ⁠its upcoming Rubin line, making H200 supply scarce.\nTrump's decision comes ​as China pushes to develop its domestic AI chip industry. ​Local firms have yet to match the H200's performance, raising concerns that allowing imports could slow domestic progress.\n\nChinese officials held emergency meetings earlier this month to discuss the matter ‍and are weighing whether to ⁠allow shipments, Reuters reported this month. One proposal would require each H200 purchase to be bundled with a set ratio of domestic chips, according to the report.\nFor Chinese technology giants such as ⁠Alibaba Group and ByteDance, which have expressed interest in buying H200 chips, the potential shipments would provide access to processors roughly ‌six times more powerful than the H20, a downgraded chip Nvidia designed for China.\n(Reporting by ‌Reuters newsroom.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Stock Price by the End of 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's GPUs are still the best computing option available.\nThe company has delivered incredible growth in 2025.\nThe stock price is reasonable for Nvidia's valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have had an excellent run in 2025, rising just shy of 30%. However, the stock has pulled back in recent weeks due to concerns of a potential artificial intelligence (AI) bubble. This weakness could be a great buying opportunity, as the AI buildout still looks like it's going full steam ahead, despite what the market wants.\n\nTo estimate what kind of returns we can get by buying Nvidia's stock now, we need to come up with a price target for Nvidia's stock for the end of 2026. Let's do some analysis on its growth and valuation. If Nvidia hits the growth laid out, it's going to be a great stock to own in 2026.\nNvidia's computing units offer advantages over other offerings Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , accelerated computing units that can perform multiple tasks in parallel. This makes them great for heavy workloads, like processing gaming graphics, engineering simulations, drug discovery, and mining cryptocurrency.\nHowever, its biggest use case by far is artificial intelligence . AI requires unprecedented levels of computing power, and companies are scrambling to build out as many data centers as possible and fill them with computing units to train and run AI models.\n\nNvidia's GPUs have been the most popular computing unit option by far since the AI arms race began in 2023. The reason for its success is tied to both the power of its GPUs and the technology stack that supports them. Its chief rival, AMD , may have had competing GPUs, but the supporting technology wasn't as good, so it fell behind.\nAnother rising competitor is the AI hyperscalers themselves. Many are tired of paying a premium price for Nvidia's GPUs, so they are partnering with companies like Broadcom to design a custom AI chip in-house. These can be worthy competitors to Nvidia's GPUs when the workload is properly configured, but if it isn't, the GPU is a far better option.\nNvidia's GPUs are still the overall best broad-use computing unit in the AI realm. The GPUs are so popular that Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang stated in the Q3 earnings release that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. In Q3 FY 2026 (ended Oct, 26), it sold $51.2 billion in data center products, which mostly encompass cloud GPUs. For a company to sell more than $50 billion worth of products and still run out of product is incredible.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Nvidia is pushing for more production capacity, which will drive growth throughout 2026. But how much can investors expect?\nNvidia's success relies on the spending habits of others The biggest factor in Nvidia's success isn't its own products; it's how much AI hyperscalers are willing to spend. They spent a record amount on data center capital expenditures in 2025, and all have informed investors to expect more growth in 2026.\nThis bodes well for 2026, but it's only the beginning. Nvidia sees the AI buildout growing for multiple years beyond next, with annual data center capital expenditures expected to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's a 38% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) at the low end of that projection, and that coincides with Wall Street's projections as well.\n\nNext year, Wall Street analysts expect revenue growth of 48%. Considering that Nvidia trades for 36 times forward earnings right now, I'd say it's fairly valued for the incredible growth it's putting up. As a result, I think it's reasonable for Nvidia to grow at about the same pace as its revenue.\nTo be a bit conservative, I'll price in 30% growth, that way Nvidia's valuation continues to moderate as well. If it can deliver 30% returns, the stock will be priced at about $221. That's a strong gain for one year, making Nvidia an excellent stock to buy now and hold throughout 2026 and beyond.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer discussed recently. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a California-based electric vehicle company. The firm’s shares saw quite a bit of action last week after Goldman Sachs increased its share price target on December 12th. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s shares closed 12% the day of Goldman’s coverage. After Goldman Sachs, Evercore ISI joined in and reiterated an Outperform rating and an $18 share price target on December 15th. Evercore explained that Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) appears to be heading in the right direction with its autonomous driving platform. The investment bank added that the firm’s decision to build its in-house chip could accelerate autonomous driving and reduce long-term costs, particularly due to a lower reliance on NVIDIA’s products. The latest analyst coverage for Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) came after Baird raised the share price target to $25 from $14 and bumped the rating to Outperform from Neutral. As per Baird, the R2 upgrade cycle, coupled with custom chips, paints an optimistic picture for the firm. However, Cramer disagrees with the analysts as he briefly commented:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RIVN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

According to sources, it's through an array of cash-raising schemes, including a sale of some investments. They added it could tap its undrawn margin loans borrowed against its valuable ownership in chip firm Arm Holdings. The bet on OpenAI is among the biggest yet by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son. The Japanese billionaire wants to improve his firm's position in the race for artificial intelligence. To come up with the money, Son has already sold SoftBank's entire $5.8 billion stake in AI chip leader Nvidia. As well as offloading $4.8 billion of its T-Mobile stake, and slashing staff. Son has slowed other dealmaking at SoftBank's Vision Fund to a crawl. And two of the sources speaking to Reuters said any deal above $50 million now requires his explicit approval. SoftBank's push to marshal funds offers a window into the strain faced even by the world's biggest dealmakers. They're scrambling to finance ambitious AI data center projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars. SoftBank declined to comment. It secured a deal to invest in OpenAI at a $300 billion valuation in April. Since then, the valuation of OpenAI has risen dramatically. And the company is in talks to raise additional funding from investors, including Amazon.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

He said those concerns may be overstated and that demand for GPUs remains healthy.\nUpcoming product catalysts such as Rubin and the longer-term Blackwell opportunity could refocus attention, Rasgon added.

Given that so many themes are disruptive, it is easy to be blindsided by industry outsiders invading your sector.\n\nTo help our clients gain a competitive advantage, The analyst has developed its Strategic Intelligence Solution, a single, integrated global research platform that provides an easy-to-use framework for tracking all strategic issues-or themes-impacting all companies across all industries. Reading this report is the first step towards making better business decisions in 2026.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nThe global AI market will reach $642 billion in 2029, up from $131 billion in 2024, supported by a growing ecosystem of integrators, start-ups, and tech giants. To accelerate enterprise integration, pre-packaged AI agents have been developed for a wide range of applications, such as earnings analyzers, video script generators, and customer profile builders. In 2026, dozens of companies will enter the market to provide industry-specific agentic AI solutions. Despite this momentum, enterprise adoption in the coming year will continue to be held back by uncertainty about whether these tools can add demonstrable business value. Agentic AI is capable of delivering far more value than existing generative AI (GenAI) tools due to its greater autonomy and methodical approach to reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. The next step is crafting these agents for high-value use cases that merit substantial long-term investment.\nIn 2026, quantum computing will make tangible inroads in finance and pharmaceuticals. Longstanding collaborations between quantum vendors and companies in these sectors will begin to produce operational benefits. In pharma, quantum-accelerated molecular simulations will increasingly be used to improve precision modeling, accelerate targeted and personalized drug discovery, and cut time and cost from development. Evidence of this trend includes the results of the partnership between AstraZeneca, IonQ, Nvidia, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), which showed a 20x speedup in hybrid quantum-classical simulations of chemical transformations. In finance, quantum computing will be deployed more broadly in risk modeling, options pricing, algorithmic bond trading, and optimization tasks. Real-world pilots will shift toward production use, encouraged by pioneering success stories such as HSBC's work with IBM to apply quantum computing to real-world bond trading. 2026 will be the year quantum moves from experimental promise to early commercial impact in finance and pharmaceuticals.\nNvidia has a nearly 90% market share in AI chip design. Despite successfully riding the Gen AI tidal wave thus far, Nvidia faces growing threats from competitors. OpenAI, which has almost wholly depended on Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) until now, has diversified its supply, making multibillion-dollar deals with Broadcom and AMD. OpenAI is purchasing 10 gigawatts (GW) of custom AI accelerators from Broadcom and 6GW of GPU capacity from AMD. Diversifying its chip supply is an astute move by OpenAI, driving market competition that will ultimately lower chip prices and incentivize new, more competitive chip designs. Nvidia's market share will slip in 2026 as its competitors gain ground.\n\nStory continues\nReport Scope\nThis report identifies the top 20 tech-related themes that will impact every industry in 2026.

      "Content": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering NVIDIA Corp's Intrinsic Value\n\nGuruFocus News\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2025-12-22, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $125.00. It's currently trading at a price of $180.99. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -44.79%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$4\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 47.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n262.67\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n491.67\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n125.00\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $98.31. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -84.1%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The value that neocloud companies offer to major AI players\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: AVGO\n\nCRWV\n\nMU\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMicron Technology ( MU ) stock continues to pop after boasting strong fiscal first quarter earnings results driven by demand around high-bandwidth memory chips for AI data centers. As more companies invest into large-scale AI infrastructure buildouts, what does this all mean for the broadening AI trade and even neocloud operators?\n\nFreedom Capital Markets Managing Director Paul Meeks talks about the three chip companies he still has at the top of his list and the upside that neocloud companies like CoreWeave ( CRWV ) could offer some of the bigger players, such as Nvidia ( NVDA ).\nAlso catch Paul Meeks explain how much higher he sees Micron's stock going.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Julie\nHow does this sort of change the dynamics in the memory market? I mean, as you mentioned, it's an oligopoly, there are two other players. We've seen memory prices go crazy, not even the high bandwidth kind, the overall kind that goes into all kinds of devices. So what are some of the sort of knock-on effects in the industry that you're watching and other names that you're watching?\n00:24 Paul\nSo I continue to like the people that are benefiting from the uh spend. I recently initiated coverage with Coreweave, which is one of the neo clouds with a $100 price target. But believe it or not, I think there's upside in Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi, some of these companies that when I get push back, what people will say, how can you possibly recommend Nvidia after it's done so well for all these years. Well, it's because I see even more greatness ahead of them. And you know, some of these stocks, Julie, have come down quite a bit in the last couple of weeks. I think it's a good buying opportunity for several of the names.\n01:21 Julie\nUm I'm curious about the the neo clouds in particular Paul, because there have been some questions about that business model, right? That if you were, you know, renting space from someone else, if you're trying to go out to the smaller providers, um as your clients, that maybe you're a little more vulnerable if there are chinks in the armor of this whole um AI thesis. What do you think about that?\n02:02 Paul\nanother excellent question. The way I look at it is you have to look at these contracts that they are signing very carefully. In the case of Core Weve, we have five and six-year deals with well-funded folks like Microsoft and Meta. and they are paying 15 to 25% of total contract value upfront. So there's some initial cash flow. And so I think that even though some of these companies are levered and Cory mind you is highly levered, that they have a nice runway and I think that over the next couple of years their plans are set and they're funded by the most well-funded companies almost on planet Earth.\n03:00 Paul\nAnd the other thing that's interesting about Core Weve, it has an interesting deal with Nvidia, which is also a 6% shareholder in which if Core Weve has any surplus capacity between now and April of 2032, it'll be socked up by Nvidia. So, some people will say that's a quote-unquote circular deal, but I actually like that deal a lot. And so I do think there's upside. Yes, it's speculative, yes, they're highly levered, but I think that this is all under control as long as the spending from the big boys continues. And I think all these companies when they announce their results in January or February, will confirm at least the 2026 capital expenditure spend.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia and Palantir Stock: One Is Set to Rise and the Other to Fall in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's hardware has been widely used in the AI buildout.\nPalantir's software has commercial and government clients.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) have been two of the faces of the artificial intelligence (AI) investment trend since it began in 2023. Each has delivered incredible shareholder returns, rising more than 2,600% (Palantir) and nearly 1,100% (Nvidia) since 2023. Each company has also had a phenomenal 2025, with Palantir and Nvidia rising 134% and 27%, respectively.\nAfter those great runs, it wouldn't be a surprise if both of these stocks take a break. However, I think one of them is poised to deliver phenomenal returns in 2026, while the other is set to fall.\nEach is tackling a different part of the AI realm Palantir and Nvidia aren't competitors, as they are in completely different parts of the AI world. In fact, they recently teamed up to offer prebuilt models on Nvidia's hardware technologies. Nvidia's contributions to the AI buildout have been its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) . These devices have been the preferred computing unit for nearly every AI hyperscaler due to their incredible power and flexibility. Although other companies are starting to catch up to Nvidia, it's still the leader in AI computing hardware.\n\nPalantir is a software play. Its AI-powered data analytics software platform has delivered valuable insights to clients. Its biggest advancement in the past few years is its AIP platform, which allows clients to make use of generative AI. By deploying AI agents, a company can automate tasks to improve efficiency. This popular product has found adoption by both government and commercial clients.\nPalantir's year-over-year commercial growth for the third quarter was 73%, while the growth of its government division was 55%. Although it grew more slowly, the government division generated $633 million in revenue while the commercial division came in at $548 million. Combined, they delivered 63% growth. That's an impressive quarter for Palantir, but there's a monstrous size difference between it and Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's Q3 for its fiscal year 2026 (ended Oct. 26) saw similar growth. Its revenue rose 62% year over year, but Nvidia's revenue stream is more than 50 times larger at $57 billion. There's a clear massive demand for AI computing power, and Nvidia is thriving on that. In fact, the company believes that global data center capital expenditures will rise to between $3 trillion and $4 trillion by 2030, up from $600 billion in 2025. The AI buildout is far from over, and both Nvidia and Palantir are slated to deliver further growth.\n\nLeer más\nWith both companies growing at incredible rates, it's hard to determine which is doing better. However, there's another part of the analysis investors must consider.\nOne company's stock is incredibly overvalued Finding excellent companies is one part of investing; the other is not overpaying for them. When you compare the valuations of these stocks, it's clear that one is priced far higher.\nAt nearly 250 times forward earnings, Palantir's stock is nearly 7 times more expensive than Nvidia's. That's a huge problem, as the stock has baked in a ton of growth that must occur over the next few years. Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock may not be cheap by any measure, but if the company can keep up its growth rate, it can easily justify a price tag of 36 times forward earnings.\n\nThe reality is that Palantir's stock is likely overvalued and due for a hefty pullback soon. Nvidia's stock has already pulled back from recent highs, and it could be primed to rise in 2026. I think Nvidia is the far better buy here.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "What Is One of the Best AI Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2026 and Beyond?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet's core business is thriving.\nIt may consider selling its custom chips to outside clients.\nThe company has emerged as a leader in generative AI.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIdentifying which artificial intelligence (AI) stock has the most potential in 2026 and beyond is no simple task. If your time frame after 2026 is only a few years, then an AI infrastructure company like Nvidia may be the best option. If your time frame runs for a decade after 2026, you may be better off with a software company like Palantir .\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a combination of these two options, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is one of the best AI stocks to buy and hold.\nAlphabet has had a stellar year, rising around 60% so far in 2025. I don't expect that performance to repeat in 2026, but I still think it has market-beating potential.\nIts core business is thriving Alphabet's primary business is the Google Search engine. At the start of 2025, a large majority of investors assumed that generative AI technologies would replace Google. However, Alphabet saw the writing on the wall and made swift changes.\nThe biggest innovation was the integration of AI-powered Overviews in Google Search. These provide nearly every search result with a generative-AI summary at the top of the page, giving the user a hybrid experience.\n\nFor many, these will be the most AI capabilities that they need. For others, Google's generative AI model, Gemini, has emerged as a top option in the space.\nIn one year, Gemini has risen from the laughingstock of the AI world to one of the best. Its improvements were so impressive that they forced OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, to declare a \"code red\" at the company. That's a long way from where Gemini was viewed entering 2025, and the change in fortunes for both the Google Search business and the progress of Alphabet's generative AI model can be thanked for its stock performance.\nAnother area that boosted Alphabet's stock was the performance of its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which is building out excess computing capacity to rent to those who cannot build their own data centers. Within Google Cloud, Alphabet provides access to its custom tensor processing units (TPUs), which can outperform graphics processing units (GPUs) when the workload is properly configured.\nThese computing units have been Alphabet's secret weapons in training its cutting-edge generative AI models, and locking access to them behind one of its other business units is genius. However, management may be exploring alternative territory.\n\nStory Continues\nReportedly, the company is considering selling its TPUs to Meta Platforms outright instead of requiring it to rent access to them via Google Cloud. That's a step in a different direction and could result in a new revenue stream that investors haven't accounted for. The AI computing market is huge, and if Alphabet can secure a sliver, it could provide serious growth.\n\nTime will tell if this business venture pans out, but Alphabet is doing incredibly well as a company. It's also spending responsibly, which is something that not every company can say.\nAlphabet has plenty of cash to fund its build-outs One of the growing concerns in the AI realm is a potential bubble forming around building AI computing capacity. There are questions about how AI hyperscalers will fund it, which is a perfectly acceptable question to ask of a company like OpenAI. However, Alphabet has plenty of cash flow to continue building data centers as it pleases.\n\nThe two metrics that inventors in this realm should familiarize themselves with are operating cash flow and free cash flow. Operating cash flow is all of the cash that a business produces, which can be used to fund capital expenditures (capex). Free cash flow subtracts capex, which shows the remaining cash a business has to repurchase shares, pay down debt, or fund dividends.\nAlphabet has plenty of cash to continue spending on AI data centers if it chooses, which is a great position to be in. While it is spending a lot of its cash on build-outs, it has plenty left before it risks dropping into negative figures. That's a huge advantage the company has over nearly any other competitor in the AI race, and it's the primary reason I think Alphabet is one of the best AI stocks to buy in 2026 and hold for several years after.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Should You Worry About an AI Bubble in 2026? Evidence is Piling Up, and Here's What it Shows.\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Investors see AI as the next game-changing technology, and this has helped many AI stocks soar.\nBut in recent weeks, some investors have started to worry about the possibility of an AI bubble forming.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nInvestors always are on the lookout for the next big thing. And over the past few years, this has been artificial intelligence (AI). The technology has promised to transform processes and operations as well as spark game-changing discoveries -- and the idea is that all of this could lead to massive earnings growth across the corporate world. Some companies, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon , already are generating billions of dollars in revenue thanks to AI.\n\nAnd that's why investors have piled into these players, driving the S&P 500 to what soon may be three straight double-digit annual gains. But in recent times, some investors have worried about the enormous spending levels at certain AI companies, as well as the high valuations of stocks. This has led to a pullback among AI stocks and other growth companies.\nNow, as you think of what's ahead in 2026, should you worry about an AI bubble? The evidence is piling up, and here's what it shows.\nThe AI boom so far First, let's consider what's unfolded so far in this AI boom . Companies have understood that by applying AI to their operations, they may gain in efficiency or set themselves up to make new discoveries. This has prompted them to turn to sellers of AI products and services for the tools they need to harness the power of AI. Players like Nvidia sell the world's top chips, and cloud businesses from Amazon Web Services to Microsoft 's Azure offer these and other systems to customers.\n\nCompanies aiming to use AI also might turn to software players with platforms that allow them to apply the technology to their businesses -- Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), offering software that aggregates and analyzes data, is a perfect example of this. And then you'll find others, such as SoundHound AI , that specialize in developing one particular area of AI -- in this case, it's voice AI that can be used to take orders at a restaurant or for communications with your car.\nAll of these companies, selling AI products and services, have seen explosive revenue growth, but they've also had to heavily invest to keep up with demand and continue innovating.\nInvestors' big concern As mentioned, AI players across the board have seen their share prices soar in recent years due to optimism about AI-driven growth. But investors have started to worry that, in some cases, future earnings won't justify the spending and stock prices we're seeing today.\n\nStory Continues\nThe S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio, a measure of stock prices in relation to earnings over a 10-year period, has climbed to a high it's only reached once before throughout its history. And that other time was before the dot-com bubble burst.\nSo, stocks clearly have become expensive, and this is something that happens before a bubble deflates. But before declaring that a bubble is here, it's important to consider additional clues. An important one is that companies driving the AI revolution aren't small or new players, as was the case during the dot-com boom. Today, companies with the financial strength to invest, such as Nvidia or Meta Platforms , are leading the charge. Meta has the resources to invest in growth and continue paying a dividend to shareholders. And cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft have been profitable for years.\nAnother element to consider is that major players have been growing revenue and net income quarter after quarter, and demand for their AI services has been extremely strong. Palantir is a great example of this.\nOf course, there still is the risk that AI won't take off to the extent that analysts expect, and that certain companies will have spent too much considering the actual revenue opportunity.\nAn AI bubble? So, what does all of this evidence suggest about the possibility of an AI bubble in 2026? It shows us a few things. First, the fact that this boom is led by market-powerhouses with long track records of profitability makes it less fragile than the dot-com boom. Second, the earnings growth and level of demand for AI remain positive signs for the future. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang recently said today's situation doesn't look like a bubble.\n\nOne risk is that certain companies may overspend, though I would expect a tech giant to carefully pace spending and monitor demand so that any overspend wouldn't be catastrophic. And, as I said above, it's true that valuations have reached high levels -- some companies may grow into their valuations, while some may not.\nAll of this suggests that, in 2026, we might not see an actual AI bubble bursting -- but we could start to see the emergence of AI winners and losers. And while even the strongest AI players may experience turbulence here and there, they should go on to deliver growth over time.\nFor you as an investor, to win in such an environment, it's key to buy quality players that have the financial strength to develop and grow, pick them up for good prices, and hold on for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Chinese Chipmakers Race to IPO After Back-to-Back Listings Surge\n\nBloomberg News\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:47 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Chinese chipmakers are rushing to the IPO market, raising funds that are key to the nation’s goal of technological self-reliance and winning the global race on artificial intelligence.\nThe surge in listings is coming on the back of two blockbuster trading debuts that signaled insatiable demand for future national champions that analysts say could one day even rival the likes of Nvidia Corp. While some of these firms are already domestic industry leaders, they remain an obscurity to many international investors, making their share sales in Hong Kong a crucial test of confidence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nNYC’s Adams Challenges Mamdani Rent Freeze With Board Picks\nAirbnb’s NYC Comeback Dashed After Bill Easing Restrictions Dies\nEarlier this month, AI chipmaker Moore Threads Technology Co. saw its stock jump 425% on the first day of trading in Shanghai, followed by the 693% gain for MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai Co.’s listing.\n“China is catching up very quickly in the chip war. It wouldn’t surprise me if in 2026 or 2027 we have a DeepSeek moment for chips where a low-cost competitive chip is being produced by China,” said Matt Toms, head of cash equity execution for Asia-Pacific at Barclays. “This would be disruptive for Nvidia and their supply chain.”\n\nToms was referring to the Chinese startup that upended the AI industry earlier this year with low-cost models that offered comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots. Republican lawmakers on a US House committee have recently asked the Pentagon to list a group of firms including DeepSeek as Chinese military companies.\nHere is a list of Chinese AI chip firms seeking stock listings:\nBiren Technology\nFounded in 2019, Shanghai Biren Technology Co. focuses on areas such as graphics processing units and cloud computing, and is considered one of the most promising domestic contenders to Nvidia.\nBiren filed its listing documents with Hong Kong’s stock exchange earlier this month, after receiving the Chinese securities regulator’s approval to issue up to 372.5 million new shares there. The AI chipmaker is slated to start gauging investor interest this month for an initial public offering worth around $600 million.\nBiren was added to Washington’s so-called entity list in 2023, which prohibits the sale of US technology without a special license.\nKunlunxin\nAlso in the pipeline is internet giant Baidu Inc.’s AI chip division known as Kunlunxin, which is considering a listing in Hong Kong.\n\nStory Continues\nKunlunxin, which makes chips that power servers in data centers, is valued at least $3 billion. It was created in part to sate Baidu’s enormous appetite for computing power to run its online businesses.\nIluvatar CoreX\nShanghai Iluvatar CoreX Semiconductor Co. is another potential Chinese competitor for Nvidia. The Centurium Capital-backed firm also has filed listing documents to seek a Hong Kong listing.\nThe firm is considering an IPO that could raise $300 million to $400 million, Bloomberg News reported in August.\n\nFounded in 2015, the company raised 1.2 billion yuan ($170 million) in a funding round in 2021 led by Centurium and Cedarlake Capital. Another round in 2022 included Beijing Financial Street Capital and Hopu and raised 1 billion yuan.\nEnflame Technology\nShanghai Enflame Technology Co., which is seeking an onshore IPO, was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices Inc. employees in 2018.

      "Content": "Meet the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Pays More Dividends Than Any Other S&P 500 Company. Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

      "Content": "2 Monster Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBROS\n\nKey Points Nvidia has created a wide moat and is poised to continue to be one of the biggest AI winners over the next five years.\nDutch Bros is one of the best growth stories in the consumer space.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nAs 2025 continues to wind down, the market is on track for another strong performance. Growth stocks once again led the way, which has been the case for much of the past decade. Meanwhile, there is no reason to think that this trend will not continue.\nLet's look at two growth stocks to buy and hold for the next five years.\n1. Nvidia When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) remains one of the best stocks to continue to hold. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, given their parallel processing power, but it is the ecosystem it's built around these chips that will help drive its growth in the coming years.\n\nThe company's moat starts with its CUDA software platform, which it created nearly two decades ago to allow developers to easily program its chips. The company smartly gave it away for free and pushed it into universities and research labs that were doing early work on AI. Today, most foundational AI code is written on CUDA, and a generation of developers has been trained on its platform.\nMeanwhile, the company's recent acquisition of SchedMD should only increase its software moat, as it provides it with an AI orchestration layer called Slurm that helps coordinate which GPUs perform which tasks and when. While Slurm is open-source, by having control of this layer, Nvidia will be able to more tightly integrate it with its ecosystem to optimize the performance of its chips.\n\nThe company also has a networking moat with its NVLink interconnect system, which lets its GPUs pool memory and transfer data directly between each other, letting its chip clusters essentially act as one powerful unit. It also made a sneaky good investment in Intel , where the two companies are also partnering to bring Intel's central processing units (CPUs) into its NVLink framework, which could help freeze out rival Advanced Micro Devices , which is the leader in data center CPUs and the No. 2 GPU player.\nAs AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia's moat continues to put it in a position to be the biggest winner.\n2. Dutch Bros AI and tech are not the only areas to find intriguing growth stocks. The consumer space is another great place to look, and on that end, Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) is one of the best growth stories over the next few years.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Oregon-based coffee shop operator has been hitting on all cylinders, nicely growing same-store sales while expanding into new markets. Last quarter, in a difficult consumer environment, the company posted a 5.7% jump in comparable-restaurant sales, as transactions grew 4.7%. Company-owned shops performed even better, with same-store sales up 7.4%. The growth is being powered by menu innovation, brand marketing, and mobile order-ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has a big opportunity to further drive growth through the introduction of hot food items. The company has been getting less than 2% of its sales from food, compared to around 20% for rival Starbucks . This has hurt its morning daypart sales, as many customers don't want to make two stops.\nHowever, Dutch Bros will roll out hot food items to three-quarters of its locations that can support the offerings after a successful test, with shops that piloted the food items seeing a 4% sales lift. And once these items are more widely available and the company puts more marketing behind them, it wouldn't be surprising if the impact becomes even bigger.\nMeanwhile, Dutch Bros is still in the early innings of expansion, with under 1,100 stores. It plans to have more than 2,000 locations by 2029, and sees the opportunity to eventually support around 7,000 stores in the U.S. Its shops are small and cheap to build out, so it also gets a quick payback on its investment.\n\nBetween store expansion and same-store sales growth, Dutch Bros is a stock to own for the next five years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Arya added that the price target is based on the assumption that we are potentially in a memory upcycle.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat do other analysts think about MU stock?

      "Content": "Is Micron Technology a Millionaire-Maker Stock?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 12:17 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Generative AI has led to a spike in demand for computer memory hardware.\nThis is creating shortages, enabling Micron to increase growth and margins.\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology ›\nThe generative artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend has allowed many older technology companies to rise from relative obscurity. And with its shares up by a whopping 170% year to date, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is an excellent example. Like the industry leader Nvidia , it serves the pick-and-shovel side of AI, supplying hardware that other companies will need to create consumer-facing software and services.\n\nLet's dig deeper to see if it still has millionaire-maker potential.\nWhy is Micron booming? While the AI hardware narrative tends to focus on graphics processing units (GPUs), which do the brunt of the work of running and training large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, there are other computer components that make the technology possible. Micron's high-bandwidth memory devices, such as DRAM and NAND flash, play a crucial role.\n\nThe vast libraries of AI training data need to be stored somewhere. Furthermore, these algorithms rely on powerful working memory to access data in real time and answer users' questions. Micron is America's largest computer memory specialist, so it was only a matter of time before investor capital began flowing in. And the stock's growth isn't just based on hype. Operational results are also showing significant progress.\nFiscal fourth-quarter revenue surged 49% year over year to $37.38, driven by an explosion of demand from data center clients, which tend to focus on AI-related workloads. Micron is also seeing a sustained rise in gross margins (which are up from 35.3% to 44.7% year over year) as its product mix shifts toward higher-end memory products, which can command better pricing. There is still potential for continued improvements.\n\nCan Micron's boom continue in 2026? Historically, computer memory has been a highly cyclical industry prone to boom-and-bust cycles. This trend occurs because the products are generally commoditized and poorly differentiated from each other while having high fixed production costs and slow manufacturing lead times. When demand is high, producers invest in expanding their production capacity, leading to a glut when supply outstrips demand and pricing strategies become a race to the bottom.\nThese are fundamental characteristics of the industry. And unfortunately for Micron, there is no reason to believe that things will change anytime soon. That said, generative AI is already sparking a massive boom cycle for memory hardware that is very likely to continue in 2026 and beyond.\n\nStory Continues\nReuters reports that the ravenous generative AI demand is leading to shortages all across the computer memory industry as producers shift production capacity to higher-demand products. This trend means Micron may be able to command higher prices across its product line (which includes memory for devices ranging from smartphones to automobiles) as demand begins to outstrip supply.\n\nFurthermore, analysts at Wells Fargo believe DRAM industry revenue could double in 2026, setting the company up for a huge amount of profit it can return to shareholders.\nIs Micron a millionaire-maker stock? With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 14, Micron stock is still remarkably cheap, despite its legendary rally in 2025. And memory hardware shortages could help the company maintain its outstanding momentum. While Micron probably won't make you a millionaire (because the current memory boom probably won't last forever), it looks poised for continued market-beating performance in 2026 and beyond.\n\nThe company will likely return a large portion of its growing profits to shareholders through its buyback program, which it resumed last year. While buybacks can feel less tangible than cash dividends, they are a better way to reward shareholders because they come with tax advantages. Dividends are taxed as ordinary income, while stock price appreciation is not taxed until you sell.\nFurthermore, a buyback strategy could help smooth out the inherent cyclicality of Micron's business model by reducing the number of shares outstanding relative to future earnings.\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now?

On December 18, Tigress Financial lifted the price target on the company’s stock to $350 from $280, while maintaining a “Strong Buy” rating on the company’s stock, as reported by The Fly. The firm tagged NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s position as the premier AI investment, possessing dominant full-stack data center leadership as well as accelerating adoption throughout autonomous driving, healthcare, and other high-growth verticals.\nFurthermore, the firm specifically highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s healthcare franchise and cited this as a powerful and underappreciated growth driver, which reinforces the appeal as a long-duration AI infrastructure investment. The firm also hinted at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s healthy balance sheet and cash flow that continue to support the company’s balanced capital allocation strategy.\n\nIn a different update, on December 15, the company announced the NVIDIA Nemotron™ 3 family of open models, data, and libraries that are designed to power transparent, efficient, and specialized agentic AI development throughout industries. The Nemotron 3 family of open models, in Nano, Super, and Ultra sizes, introduces the most efficient family of open models possessing leading accuracy for building agentic AI applications.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) highlighted that Nemotron 3 Nano is capable of delivering 4x higher throughput than Nemotron 2 Nano. Also, it delivers the most tokens per second for multi-agent systems at scale through the breakthrough hybrid mixture-of-experts architecture.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

You need a 'strong stomach': Dan Ives' strategy\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: PLTR\n\nCRWV\n\nAMD\n\nIVES\n\nMETA\n\nIn the AI trade, you \"can't just bet on one company,\" Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research, Dan Ives, tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting the importance of diversification for AI investors.\nWatch the video above to hear more about Ives' AI thesis and the 30 stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF ( IVES ).\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThere's another stock I want to ask you about, and that is CoreWeave, which as you know, has sold off pretty sharply. Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Palantir vs. Nvidia\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 10:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Palantir and Nvidia have each seen earnings soar in recent quarters thanks to their AI strengths.\nTheir stocks have advanced more than 2,000% and 900%, respectively, in three years.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have helped investors take major steps along the path to wealth in recent years. Investors placed bets on the potential for this hot technology to revamp the way many things are done -- and as a result, supercharge the growth of companies.\n\nTwo players in particular have attracted investors' attention, and they are Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . The former is a software company that's helping its customers harness the power of AI, and the latter is the world's leading AI chip designer. Both of these companies have seen earnings soar in recent years, and the stock prices have followed. Over the past three years, Palantir stock has jumped 2,400% and Nvidia has advanced more than 900%.\nBoth of these tech companies are well-positioned to benefit as this AI story continues to unfold, making them great stocks to own. But which one is the best AI stock to buy now? Let's find out.\nThe case for Palantir Palantir has been around for more than 20 years, but the AI boom represented a real turning point. The company, throughout most of its history, relied on government contracts for steady growth, but in recent times, demand from commercial customers has taken off. This is thanks to Palantir's focus on AI . The company launched its AI-driven product, Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), two years ago, offering customers a way to immediately apply AI to their needs.\n\nAIP helps customers aggregate their data and use it in various ways -- this could involve making decisions, developing new ways of operating, and more. Demand has been high among both government and commercial customers, leading to revenue growth in the double digits for each business. Commercial customer count, contract value, and overall profit also have been on the rise -- and the company has continued to increase full-year guidance.\nThe AI market is forecast to reach into the trillions of dollars in a few years, and Palantir is well-positioned to benefit -- that's because this company makes it easy for customers to get in on AI while barely lifting a finger.\nThe case for Nvidia When you think of AI, you probably immediately think of Nvidia. That's because this company has built an AI fortress over the past few years -- it's not only the leading AI chip designer , but it also offers a wide range of related products and services for every AI need.\n\nStory Continues\nAll of this has helped Nvidia generate double- and triple-digit earnings growth in recent quarters and years -- with revenue and net income reaching record levels. In the latest full year, Nvidia's revenue soared in the triple digits to more than $130 billion.\nThe company has committed to updating its famous chips, or graphics processing units (GPUs), on an annual basis, a move that should keep it ahead of rivals. And demand for its latest releases has been spectacular -- we saw this with the release of the Blackwell architecture about a year ago and the launch of update Blackwell Ultra a few months ago.\n\nNvidia predicts that AI infrastructure spending could reach as much as $4 trillion by the end of the decade. The company could be a big winner in such a story because, as data centers build out, they need high-powered chips.\nPalantir or Nvidia? Before we answer the question, let's take a look at valuation. In the case of Palantir, it's been extremely high for quite some time, but it's important to remember that the company is in the early days of its growth story -- and this metric only considers earnings estimates a year from now and not farther down the road.\nIn Nvidia's case, we can more easily look at valuation and see that there is a window of opportunity here. The stock is trading for 36x forward earnings estimates, down from as much as 50x a year ago.\nMeanwhile, as mentioned, Nvidia is particularly well placed to benefit from AI infrastructure spending.\n\nSo, right now, Palantir is a solid stock to buy and own -- but Nvidia, for the dip in valuation and the upcoming AI infrastructure opportunity, is the best stock to buy now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?

      "Content": "Controversial Nvidia rival may finally IPO\n\nMoz Farooque\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 10:19 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CESY.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) rival Cerebras Systems is eyeing another shot at going public, and this time, the timing seems deliberate.\nAccording to Reuters , the AI chip startup is set to refile for a U.S. IPO as early as next week, with a target debut in Q2 2026 .\nWhat’s interesting is that the eye-opening move comes months after Cerebras pulled its previous filing. The decision was based on a national security review linked to a foreign investor, along with growing scrutiny on where U.S. AI technology ends up.\n\nTo be fair, this isn’t a story that’s unfamiliar in any way.\nYou have another fast-growing AI semiconductor business that’s looking to capitalize on surging demand. However, with Cerebras, the picture gets slightly more complicated.\nThe financials we’ve seen are dated, and the company’s growth appears to be heavily concentrated in a single customer, with a regulatory backdrop that remains unclear.\nSo, this IPO hinges less on clever chip design and more on whether public-market investors are comfortable with the risks that come with it.\nCerebras isn’t just another GPU company Cerebras takes a more novel approach than Nvidia does with its GPUs.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nInstead of linking thousands of chips, it develops a single, wafer-scale processor , which is essentially one massive chip, that’s about the size of an dinner plate.\nIn doing so, its latest WSE-3 packs quite the punch, with nearly 4 trillion transistors and 900,000 cores onto a single piece of silicon.\nThat gives Cerebras a significant edge, especially in handling massive AI models that can be trained on a single system or spread seamlessly across multiple GPUs, thereby reducing complexity and bottlenecks.\nThat design prioritizes less versatility and more robust performance.\nCerebras’ IPO is coming back with a bigger price tag Cerebras Systems is apparently getting ready to test the public markets again.\nRelated: Cathie Wood trims $11.2 million in longtime favorite stock\nAccording to Reuters , the AI chip startup is targeting a Q2 2026 debut , as it looks to ride the red-hot demand for specialized AI silicon.\nIt’s important to note that this is a comeback attempt.\nCerebras withdrew its previous IPO filing in late 2025 , following a whopping $1+ billion funding round with U.S. national-security reviews linked to Abu Dhabi’s G42 .\n\nStory Continues\nNow it's coming back with a bang and targeting a much higher price. Cerebras was valued at a massive $8 billion in 2024 , and reports suggest that the valuation has “nearly doubled” since , with IPO discussion moving into the tens of billions .\nWhat investors will be weighing:\nWhether the G42 review is behind the company.\nIf “ tens of billions ” is a justified price tag for an unproven niche AI hardware player.\nWhat the IPO signals about AI investing, even if Nvidia’s lead remains intact.\n\nThe complication behind Cerebras’ IPO plans Cerebras’ planned IPO hasn’t been without its controversies.\nRelated: Bank of America sets AI stocks to buy list for 2026\nFront and center is its connection to the G42 , with the Abu Dhabi–based AI firm investing a massive $335 million , leading to a U.S. national-security review.\nThe concerns were primarily due to the use of non-U.S. intermediaries to route advanced American AI technology toward China.\n\nReuters specifically pointed to concerns over G42’s links with Huawei in the past, and the review played a critical role in delaying Cerebras’ IPO plans.\nAlso, G42 was Cerebras’ primary customer.\nIn the first half of 2024, Cerebras reported $136.4 million in sales , skyrocketing 1,474% year over year.\nHowever, nearly $119.1 million, or 87% , came from G42. Moreover, the company disclosed that discounts linked to G42’s high-volume orders weighed down gross margin to 41.1% from 50.5% .\nSince then, though, Cerebras has obtained CFIUS clearance , and G42 is no longer listed as an investor, a change that should prove critical when we have the latest financials.\nNvidia still leads despite growing competition Nvidia still dominates the AI accelerator market, with an estimated 80–90% share .\nRelated: Eli Lilly’s pill solves the biggest problem with weight loss\nHowever, the size of the opportunity continues to draw challengers from virtually every corner of the tech space.\nEstablished chipmakers and cloud giants continue to seek alternatives as customers seek greater diversification in terms of supply and cost.\n\nAMD is clearly the most credible near-term rival, led by its potent MI300 and upcoming MI400 accelerators, supercharged by deals from OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.\nIntel is looking to re-enter the race and make its mark with Gaudi2, along with its future Falcon Shores platform.\nQualcomm is also planning to launch data-center AI accelerators in 2026–27 , while hyperscalers like Google , Amazon , and Meta are also building in-house chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia.\nOn top of that, China has mounted a response too, on the back of tariffs and other export controls. Startups, including Moore Threads , Biren Technology , and Cambricon Technologies, are all looking to replace Nvidia domestically, while Huawei , Baidu , and Alibaba are manufacturing custom silicon.\nEurope’s cautionary tale is Graphcore , which was once valued at a whopping $2.8 billion before being acquired by SoftBank for nearly £400 million back in 2024.\nRelated: Wall Street manager sends blunt message on economy in 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

      "Content": "Mark Cuban Says He Keeps a Large Part of His Portfolio in Cash — Here’s Why\n\nPeter Burns\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 8:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIf you regularly tune in to the blogs, podcasts and videos of popular personal finance influencers, you’ll hear a lot of advice that they all seem to agree upon. One area of overlap is that you should invest a certain portion of your income. While this is solid financial advice, some finance experts, like entrepreneur Mark Cuban, think a large portion of your portfolio should be in cash.\n\nHere are some of the reasons for keeping cash on hand .\nFinancial Opportunities When it comes to investing, few can match the accomplishments of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett . Over the years, Buffett has made a name for himself as a top investor who preaches patience and holding for the long term. However, Buffett doesn’t just invest; he also holds a lot of cash.\nToward the end of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway’s cash reserves reached $325 billion, doubling the amount of cash it had at the end of 2023. Having cash on hand gives Buffett the upper hand in terms of flexibility. When a stock’s price dips and he determines it’s undervalued, other companies might not have the liquidity to buy it up on the spot. However, Buffett’s cash reserve allows him to jump at the chance and maximize his profits.\n\nNot everyone runs a multinational conglomerate like Berkshire Hathaway, but holding cash can still give you the chance to take advantage of opportunities that may later arise. Whether it’s an undervalued stock, a property or a rare watch, if you have enough cash on hand, you won’t need to rush to sell any other investments to acquire it.\nLearn More: I Got Rich Investing — These Lessons for Beginners Could Lead To $1 Million Net Worth\nFor You: 6 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nMarket Volatility Buying low and selling high may be the most common investing advice out there. However, market volatility isn’t always great . Cuban, a successful entrepreneur, investor and TV personality, always keeps a large portion of his portfolio in cash because, whether it be political unpredictability, a global event or a new innovation, he isn’t a fan of losing money and doesn’t want to take big risks.\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2025, Nvidia’s stock dropped 17%, dropping its market cap by almost $600 billion — the largest plunge for a U.S. company in history. While the company quickly rebounded, Cuban didn’t feel right about buying in as he thought there was still too much uncertainty. Other market-shaking events, such as President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements, have also kept Cuban from investing. By keeping his money in cash, he’s been unaffected by the market swings and can stay confident about preserving his wealth .\n\nStory Continues\nEmergencies There are also reasons to keep a lump sum of cash available that don’t involve investing, such as building up an emergency fund .\nRachel Cruze, a personal finance expert and co-host of the popular “Ramsey Show,” is a big proponent of saving enough to cover three to six months’ worth of expenses in case something terrible happens. If you get laid off, face a medical emergency or have your car break down, you’ll be happy you built up that emergency fund.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nNearly 1 in 3 Americans Hit by a Costly Holiday Scam, Norton Survey Shows -- How To Avoid This\nHere's What the Average Social Security Payment Will Be in Winter 2025\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\nThe Easiest Way to Score $250 for Things You Already Do\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Mark Cuban Says He Keeps a Large Part of His Portfolio in Cash — Here’s Why\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean.

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock To Buy in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Alphabet is finally getting some recognition from investors for its AI accomplishments.\nThe search-engine giant has ample opportunities to benefit from increased AI spending.\nWhile the stock has gotten a bit expensive, it looks poised to fly higher in the long-run.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has served as an unprecedented bellwether for technology stocks over the last three years. In particular, semiconductor stocks including Nvidia , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , and Broadcom were all ushered into the trillion-dollar club thanks to the AI revolution.\nAs investment in AI infrastructure continues to unfold, I think it's likely that chip stocks will remain sound investment choices. But as 2026 approaches, I see a different tech titan taking center stage: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nLet's dig into how Alphabet has built an AI fortress poised to dominate the future. From there, I'll explore the company's valuation trends and make the case for why now is a great time to buy Alphabet stock hand over fist.\nIt's been a quiet three years for Alphabet...until now The AI revolution kicked off almost exactly three years ago when OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT. ChatGPT quickly captured the imaginations of people all over the world with its ability to answer virtually any question instantly.\nThe dramatic rise in popularity among large language models (LLMs) caused some on Wall Street to pose the idea that traditional search tools like Google were headed for doom. Think of the business stakes at hand here: Why would advertisers continue paying a premium on platforms like Google and YouTube when everyone's attention was flocking to chatbots?\n\nWhile Alphabet's advertising business did show some signs of stalling, the company's cash cow remained somewhat resilient. For a couple of years, revenue from Google and YouTube wasn't as robust as it once was, but it also wasn't plummeting at an alarming rate.\nWhat many investors were overlooking, however, was Alphabet's other ventures. At the beginning of the AI revolution, Google Cloud was operating at an annual revenue run rate of about $29 billion. Meanwhile, this segment of Alphabet's business was unprofitable.\nFast forward to today, and Google Cloud is now on pace for more than $50 billion of annual sales while boasting positive operating income. What's even more interesting is that Google Cloud has won major deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic -- the two LLMs that were once seen as the ultimate existential threat to Google's relevancy.\n\nStory Continues\nBesides the success of its cloud division, Alphabet has also successfully launched its own LLM -- called Gemini. According to management, Gemini has over 650 million monthly active users (MAUs) while search queries are increasing threefold quarter over quarter.\nWhy 2026 could be epic for Gemini For most of the AI revolution, I think the consensus view around Alphabet was one of uncertainty. While not everyone bought into the extinction of Google narrative, it's fair to say that it took some time for Alphabet to prove its AI ambitions were bearing fruit.\nOne of the biggest catalysts the company has going into next year is an extension of Google Cloud through commercializing custom hardware. Specifically, Alphabet's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), known as tensor processing units (TPUs), have seen some early traction with Apple and Anthropic.\n\nWhile TPUs aren't going to dethrone Nvidia's GPU business anytime soon, I think Alphabet is on the cusp of unlocking a new wave of growth in the cloud infrastructure market that's currently dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\nAlphabet stock could soar to new highs next year As of this writing, Alphabet's forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio is hovering around 28 -- its highest level during the AI boom.\nNormally, I tend to stay away from momentum stocks. More times than not, by the time a company reaches a record high, it's dicey to buy the premium and expect shares to move materially higher.\nThis is a rare instance where I think the opposite is true. Alphabet's current price increase reflects two factors: An appreciation for the company's current operating performance and a bullish outlook that Alphabet will keep up its strong performance.\n\nAlphabet's ecosystem -- from search, cloud computing, consumer electronics, custom hardware, and more -- is a major differentiator compared to its mega cap peers. The company has a unique flexibility stitched into its DNA -- benefiting from AI across its various assets and subsidiaries during any market cycle. These dynamics position Alphabet as a particularly durable business for the long run.\nAs investments in AI infrastructure are expected to continue rising going into next year, I expect Alphabet to benefit from these tailwinds more so than any one singular chip designer or software developer.\nWith this in mind, I think Alphabet will continue to show signs of accelerating revenue and profit margin expansion across its entire business next year -- which should lead to even more buying from shareholders. Against this backdrop, I see Alphabet as the best opportunity in the AI landscape as 2026 approaches.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

President Trump announced the news in the Oval Office in January, flanked by the respective companies’ leaders, including Oracle chair Larry Ellison — a move that sent the stock soaring .\n\nAI optimism continued to push Oracle shares higher following its quarterly earnings reports in June and September , with AI-driven deals set to push cloud segment revenue to $166 billion in 2030. The stock’s surge in September briefly made Ellison the world’s wealthiest person .\nBut AI euphoria quickly gave way to doubt. Investors became increasingly concerned over the rising use of debt to fund tech firms’ AI spending, just as the payoff of that spending remains hotly debated. Those concerns are evidenced in the budding demand for Big Tech credit default swaps (CDS) — financial contracts that act as insurance by letting investors bet on the likelihood that a company will default on its debt.",

Management noted that they have released Nemotron 3 Nano, which is the smallest of the three models, with the other two larger versions expected to be released in the first half of 2026. Although NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known for making and providing chips to other companies that make AI models. However, with China’s DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and Alibaba Group Holdings open-source models taking over the market, the company has started to release its open-source models too.\nMoreover, the report also noted that Meta platforms is said to be shifting towards closed source models, which will leave NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as one of the biggest players in the said offerings.\nThat said, Wall Street remains bullish on the tech giant.

      "Content": "Intel stock soared in 2025. But the chipmaker still has a long road ahead.\n\nLaura Bratton\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBY\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nFor Intel ( INTC ), 2025 was an eventful year, but not one that necessarily changed its narrative .\nThe storied American chipmaker got a new CEO and won massive investments from the US government , Nvidia ( NVDA ), and SoftBank ( SFTBY ). Those developments helped push the stock up 86% for the year, ahead of gains for the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks and Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). At the same time, Intel's crucial manufacturing segment still lacks a major external customer — something it needs to make the cash-bleeding business viable.\n\n\"Intel's exiting the year with some optimism that they will be a relevant chip manufacturer in the US at some point in time ... and that was definitely an uncertain statement at the start of the year,\" MorningStar analyst Brian Colello told Yahoo Finance.\nAt the same time, he noted, \"There wasn't the massive sort of deal that really establishes Intel, either, in manufacturing.\"\n\nThe company's technology is largely responsible for the digital revolution and Silicon Valley's reputation as a global innovation hub: Intel invented the world's first microprocessors, or computer chips, and the x86 architecture, a critical blueprint for designing computer chips. Its co-founder Gordon Moore created Moore's Law, a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. The company has continued to make its own computer chips, even as the rest of the industry has gone \"fabless\" — outsourcing manufacturing to firms like Taiwan's TSMC ( TSM ).\n\nBut years of missteps and poor investment decisions put Intel's manufacturing segment behind TSMC, which in turn caused its products to lose their edge to competitors. As its chips — CPUs for servers, laptops, and desktops — have lost market share to rivals AMD and Arm ( ARM ), its manufacturing business has been stripped of the scale it needs to remain viable.\nFour years of an aggressive turnaround effort by former CEO Pat Gelsinger to revive Intel's manufacturing arm by opening it to outside customers sent investors fleeing. The massive amount of spending required to reboot the foundry, along with its uncertain success, spooked Wall Street.\nThe arrival of Lip-Bu Tan , who was named chief executive in March following the board's ousting of Gelsinger in late 2024, began to renew faith in the company's potential turnaround. While Intel's strategy remains mostly unchanged under Tan, analysts explained, investors have applauded his sober tone, cost-cutting measures, and wide-ranging industry connections.\n\nStory Continues\nThat tepid faith transformed into confidence when the US government made a rare $9 billion investment in the company — albeit funds Intel was supposed to get anyway from the Biden-era CHIPS Act — following Tan's tiff with President Trump over the CEO's business ties to China.\nOnshoring semiconductor manufacturing has been a focus of the US government since the pandemic highlighted the risk of a tech supply chain reliant on Taiwan. Escalating tensions with China, including the threat of a Taiwan invasion, have further intensified the sense of urgency.\n\n\"Semiconductors are not only economically important, they're actually important from a national security perspective,\" Technalysis analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \"Intel has by far the largest infrastructure in place as a true, real American company.\"\nMany critics believe the broader US turn toward state capitalism under Trump, exemplified by the Intel investment, raises questions about national security and the government's conflicting interests. But analysts say the US government's 10% stake in Intel could lead to various positive outcomes for the company, such as Intel having a say in trade policy that affects semiconductors. More importantly, the US could step in to incentivize or force a major company like Apple to use the chipmaker's foundry.\n\nA $2 billion investment from SoftBank and $5 billion from Nvidia further boosted investor sentiment on Intel stock. The cash infusion helped stem the company's steep losses as it figures out a path forward. Notably, though, the Nvidia deal didn't include an agreement for Intel's foundry business to manufacture the AI giant's chips.\n'Everything hinges on 14A' Intel's biggest potential customers for its foundry business — Nvidia, Apple ( AAPL ), and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) — are also, to some degree, competitors of its products arm and have longstanding relationships with TSMC. Not to mention, TSMC is building $165 billion worth of manufacturing capacity in the US, diminishing the geopolitical argument for those companies to use Intel to produce their chips.\nTo win those customers, Intel will need to prove that its latest generation manufacturing processes are up to snuff. The chipmaker's 18A process, a massive technological feat initially marketed to outside customers, is now being used primarily to make Intel's own products. Whether those products — Intel's upcoming Panther Lake chips for PCs and Clearwater Forest chips for data centers — succeed could help convince companies to use its next-generation processes called 18AP and 14A, analysts said.\n\nAlready, rumors have circulated that Apple could use Intel's manufacturing, specifically its 18AP process, for its lowest-end computer chips.\nIntel has 12 to 18 months to secure a big external customer for 14A in order for that process to continue as planned, BNB Paribas analyst David O'Connor estimated.\nHe called the process \"the crux of Intel being successful on the foundry business or not, or potentially even exiting manufacturing long term.\"\n\"Everything hinges on 14A and the success of that,\" O'Connor said.\nOther analysts gave longer timelines for when Intel would see a turnaround.\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said, \"It took 10 years to break it. Why would it take less than 10 years to fix it?\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Bluesky @laurabratton.bsky.social.

This has investors searching for the next Broadcom, as who wouldn't want those incredible one-year returns?\n\nThe secret to Broadcom's rise is tied to the custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips it's developing. These compete directly against Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are incredibly costly due to their impressive performance and flexibility. Broadcom's custom AI chips can outperform Nvidia's GPUs at a lower price point when the workload is set up properly, giving them a huge advantage at the cost of flexibility.\nDesigning custom AI computing units is going to become more popular, as Nvidia's chips are far too expensive not to explore this avenue. While many companies are choosing to partner with Broadcom, others are opting to do it themselves. One of these companies is hiding in plain sight, and its recent release is incredibly promising.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has dived into designing its own AI chip, and the results have been phenomenal. This innovation could provide Amazon with the growth it needs to be a monster stock pick over the next few years, making it an excellent investment today.\nAmazon's new device provides incredible performance Amazon's new computing chip is known as Trainium3. It is built on cutting-edge 3nm (nanometer) chip architecture and delivers impressive performance at a lower price point. Compared to previous generation Trainum2 servers, they offer 4 times the computing performance while improving energy efficiency by 4 times as well. That helps reduce operating costs and run time, which allowed several generative AI clients to reduce training and inference costs by up to 50%, including Anthropic.\n\nThose are huge boosts for Amazon, and it could attract new clients to its servers. One of those is OpenAI, which is reportedly considering using Amazon's Trainium3 chips in exchange for a $10 billion investment. This could be the first of many companies flocking to Amazon's training servers, as cost is starting to become a large bottleneck in the artificial intelligence investing realm.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors want to see real innovation in exchange for their dollars, and companies may need to stretch their funding to achieve better results. Switching from GPUs to alternative computing units like Amazon's is one way to do that, and it could grow in popularity in 2026.\nDepending on how popular this product is, Amazon could become the next Broadcom. We'll see success tied to Amazon's cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), if it has any boost in 2026. Fortunately for Amazon and its investors, it's already looking up.\n\nAWS is critical to Amazon's success Despite AWS accounting for only 18% of Amazon's total revenue, it represents 66% of its operating profits. That's because AWS' margins are far better than the base e-commerce business, so as AWS goes, so will Amazon.\nIn Q3, AWS posted its best growth rate in multiple years, rising at a 20% pace. This indicates that more workloads are coming online at AWS, which is an excellent sign for 2026. If Amazon can continue this momentum in 2026, combined with the rise of Trainium3 workloads, Amazon's stock could dramatically rise in 2026.\n\nWhile I doubt it can duplicate Broadcom's 50% rise this year, I think Amazon is prepped to be a market-beating stock, especially after its underperformance this year. Amazon is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing AI workload, and with the rest of its business also producing strong results (advertising in particular), I think Amazon has what it takes to be a top stock pick in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Stocks enter final stretch of 2025 just off record highs: What to watch this week\n\nJake Conley · Breaking Business News Reporter\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:41 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nORCL\n\n^GSPC\n\nMU\n\nStocks rallied on Friday to cap a mixed week for the major averages in what served as the final full trading week of 2025.\nFor the week, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) rose about 0.4%, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) fell about 0.7% and the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) closed little changed.\n\nAll three major indexes will enter the final seven trading sessions of 2025 within 3% of their record highs.\nIn the week ahead, those investors still around during the holidays will turn their attention to the prospects of a \" Santa Claus rally ,\" while a few pieces of economic data out on Tuesday will clean up some of the lagging data delayed as a result of the government shutdown.\nTuesday morning's read on consumer confidence from the Conference Board should be the key focus, with one of 2025's defining narratives centering on the K-shaped economy that has emerged among American shoppers.\nMarkets in the US will be open for half a day on Wednesday and closed on Thursday for Christmas. Many international markets will remain closed on Friday as well.\n\n'Consumers will likely still feel saltier' American consumers are heading into the holidays with a bit less joy than last year.\nWhile data from the University of Michigan released Friday showed a moderate uptick in consumer sentiment in December versus November, at 52.9 the index is 28.5% below last December's reading.\nSimilarly, housing sales ticked up for the third month in a row in November, but 2025 sales are looking likely to finish the year at a 25-year low, according to data from the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\"Consumers are loud and clear that they believe that the outlook for the economy has soured quite a bit since the beginning of the year,\" said Joanne Hsu, the director of the survey of consumers for the University of Michigan.\nWhile consumer spending has by and large held up throughout the back half of the year, according to Bank of America, US households in the upper third of incomes are driving more than half of that spending; around a quarter of households are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\"The ‘K-shaped’ economy makes for a fragmented consumer,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. \"The affluent are fine, if not thriving, while lower-income households struggle with high rent payments, rising delinquencies, and job uncertainty.\"\n\nPerhaps another reason why Thursday's inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics arrived as such a surprise.\nAt a 2.7% headline increase in prices over the last 12 months, the November reading came in significantly below expectations. The reading should give the Federal Reserve the vote of confidence it needs to cut rates again next year, building on a total 75 basis points' worth of cuts in 2025, said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The Fed will be heartened to see total and core CPI slow\" as the report \"bolsters the case for more interest rate cuts in 2026,\" Adams said in an email.\nEven so, \"Consumers will likely still feel saltier about inflation than the upbeat headline would suggest, since the prices of many essentials outside of shelter continue to rise rapidly,\" he said.\n'All but giving the green light' Traders wait all year for the \"Santa Claus Rally,\" which covers the final five trading days of one year and the first two of the next as one of the market's best-performing weekly windows.\nOn Friday, markets showed signs of meeting history's expectations. And, notably, so did Big Tech stocks.\nOracle ( ORCL ) stock, which has dropped almost 40% since its highs in September on worries over its AI commitments, rose more than 7% on Friday after news broke that the company is the lead buyer in a cohort of American partners buying TikTok from its Chinese owner ByteDance.\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) shares also rose Friday after reports from Reuters said the Trump administration is reviewing plans for Jensen Huang's chipmaking giant to sell its second-most-powerful H200 chips to Chinese buyers.\nMicron's ( MU ) earnings report this week, and the stock's more than 10% rally in response , also settled some investor fears over the state of the AI and the broader market heading into the final handful of trading days in 2025.\n\n\"Lukewarm US labour market data, a surprise drop in US inflation figures, and a notionally dovish Fed is providing support for equity prices,\" Capital analyst Kyle Rodda wrote in a note to clients.\n\"Despite the Fed all but giving the green light for a Santa Rally, justifiable fears about valuations is keeping the handbrake on the market and holding it back from record highs.\"\nStill, most strategists on Wall Street remain positive on the market outlook heading into next year, with the economic growth and earnings backdrop also offering reasons for investor enthusiasm outside of the AI trade, which has become a crutch for many over the last few years.\n\"2025 has been a good example of the early optimism phase [of the macroeconomic cycle] where many equity markets ... have seen valuations rise with earnings,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a client note.\n\"We believe that the optimism phase will continue in 2026.\"\nEconomic and earnings calendar Monday Economic data: Chicago Fed national activity index, September (-0.20 expected)\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nTuesday Economic data: ADP Weekly employment change, week ended Dec. 6 (16,250 previously); Personal consumption, third quarter (+2.7% expected); Core PCE index, quarter-on-quarter, third quarter (+2.9% expected); Durable goods orders, October preliminary reading (-1.5% expected, 0.5% previously); Industrial production, month-on-month, November (+0.1% expected, +0.1% previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, December (-15 previously); Conference Board consumer confidence, December (92.0 expected, 88.7 previously)\n\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nWednesday Economic data: MBA mortgage applications, week ended Dec. 19 (-3.8% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ended Dec. 20 (223,000 expected, 224,000 previously)\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nThursday Markets closed for Christmas.\nFriday Economic data: No notable economic data.\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nLa historia continúa\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This Quiet AI Company Could Be the Next Big Winner\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SOUN\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points SoundHound AI has rapid revenue growth but steep losses.\nMost of its Q3 loss was due to a one-time accounting charge.\nSoundHound has some similarities to Palantir from three years ago.\n10 stocks we like better than SoundHound AI ›\nThe dramatic rise in tech stocks over the last two years has made a lot of investors wealthier -- and that's something to celebrate! But when we're done patting ourselves on the back for a job well done with Nvidia , Alphabet , and Palantir Technologies , it's time to look for the next big thing.\n\nThat's because it's easier to have dramatic gains when you're starting with a smaller market capitalization . Palantir had a market cap of less than $50 billion when I first bought the stock in 2022, and its current $431 billion market cap now makes it one of the largest companies in the world.\nIts stock has gained 2,210% since July 2022. And if it were to gain another 2,210% in the next three years, it would have a market cap of $10 trillion -- more than twice as large as the current market leader, Nvidia.\nObviously, that's not happening. To find an artificial intelligence (AI) stock with the potential for a Palantir-size gain over the next three years, we need to examine one that still has significant growth ahead. One that I'm considering right now is a stock I've been skeptical about in the past: SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) .\nWhat is SoundHound AI? SoundHound operates an AI platform that allows users to have conversations to use voice-enabled services and apps. Voice-enabled products have been around for a long time -- for example, automated customer-service phone numbers and voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa. However, the early iterations of this technology were clunky enough to create significant user frustration.\n\nSoundHound, which went public in 2021, primarily worked in the automotive and restaurant industries before taking a significant step forward in 2024 with its $80 million acquisition of Amelia AI, an AI agent that is customizable for internal use or public-facing applications.\nThe acquisition pushed SoundHound's corporate client base to more than 200 customers. However, the company still hasn't been able to turn a profit, and investors may have signaled this year that they're becoming concerned about the stock: Shares are down more than 40% this year.\nPart of the problem may be the company's third-quarter earnings report, which showed a sharp net loss of $109.3 million, versus a loss of $21.7 million a year ago. The loss wiped out its impressive $42 million in revenue, which was up 68% from a year ago.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, $66 million of the loss was due to a noncash, nonoperating accounting charge related to previous acquisitions. The adjusted net loss was $13 million, which was an improvement from a year ago. And most importantly, the business ended the quarter with zero debt and cash on hand of $269 million.\n\nIn addition, SoundHound is increasing its client base, including by the following:\nA deal to integrate SoundHound Chat AI into \"double-digit millions of AI-enabled smart devices\" developed by an unnamed Chinese company.\nAn agreement with an Italian commercial-vehicle company to install voice AI in its fleet.\nExpansions of the scope of contracts with three top financial services institutions.\nAn agreement with a U.S. regional hospital system to deploy the Amelia platform.\nA deal to supply a national full-service restaurant chain with voice-ordering technology.\nAn agreement with a telecommunications provider that offers TV and internet in 20 U.S. states.\nWhat should you expect from the stock? Analysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance are unanimous in their prediction that SoundHound stock will move higher in the next year. The mean price target of $17.19 is 53% higher than the current stock price; the low price target of $15 is 33% higher.\nSoundHound may not replicate Palantir's rapid growth, but I see many similarities between the two companies. Three years ago, in the second quarter of 2022, Palantir was losing money, too -- it posted a net loss in the quarter of $179.3 million as it was building out its platforms.\n\nManagement has expanded SoundHound's business model to include a variety of functions, including customer service, sales, marketing, operations, and IT service management. The company has enabled more than 10 billion personalized automated voice conversations annually.\nAs companies strive to become more efficient and increasingly reliant on AI solutions to streamline their products while still personalizing customer interactions, SoundHound AI's growth is expected to continue. Clearly, I've misjudged this company with my aforementioned skepticism.

      "Content": "Will Nvidia's Stock Double in 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's GPUs remain the most popular computing option on the market.\nThe AI hyperscalers plan to spend record amounts in data centers again in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had a lackluster 2025 compared to 2023 and 2024. In both of those years, the stock more than doubled, but in 2025, it's only up about 30%. That's still outperforming the broader market, but not by as much as you may think, considering Nvidia's excellent growth and results.\nLooking ahead to 2026, the trends that prevailed during the previous three years are still ongoing, which could set Nvidia up for an excellent 2026. But will it be enough for the stock to double?\nNvidia's success is tied to the spending habits of others Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , which are accelerated computing units that can process multiple calculations in parallel. These computing units are the muscle behind most of the transformative artificial intelligence technology we experience today. Nvidia has a strong grip on the data center computing market. In Q3 FY 2026 (ended October 2026), Nvidia's data center revenue totaled $51.2 billion -- up 66% year over year. Two of Nvidia's biggest competitors are Advanced Micro Devices , which also makes GPUs, and Broadcom , which collaborates directly with AI hyperscalers to design custom AI computing chips. In their most recent quarters, AMD grew data center revenue at a 22% to $4.3 billion, and Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue increased 74% year over year to $6.5 billion. While Broadcom may be growing faster than Nvidia, it's still much smaller. AMD is both smaller and growing far slower than Nvidia, which is a poor position to be in.\n\nWhile investors may be worried about Nvidia's dominance waning, they shouldn't. Nvidia is clearly the best option available for, and the results back that up. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs, highlighting the incredible demand for computing.\nThat demand isn't expected to die down anytime soon. After record-setting capital expenditures in 2025 by the AI hyperscalers, they have all informed investors that 2026 will be a year of further growth. This bodes well for Nvidia's future, allowing it to extend its strong growth into another year.\nHowever, Nvidia doesn't think this buildout will stop in 2026. They estimate that global data center capital expenditures will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's up significantly from the $600 billion in 2025.\n\nContinua a leggere\nShould AI spending continue to trend in this direction, Nvidia's stock will continue to outperform the market, making it an excellent stock to own. But will it be enough for the stock to double in 2026?\nA double from Nvidia would be a tall task If we assume that Nvidia will grow at about the same pace as data center capital expenditures are expected to grow through 2030, that would assign a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46% at the high end. That's well short of the 100% growth needed to ensure an Nvidia double, so the remaining slack must be picked up by an increase in Nvidia's valuation.\nAt less than 38 times forward earnings, Nvidia's stock isn't cheap.\nHowever, considering Nvidia's projected growth rates, I'd argue that it isn't expensive either. As a result, any further valuation increase should come solely from business performance. This isn't expected to provide 100% growth, so I doubt Nvidia stock will double in 2026. If it did, the company would be worth nearly $10 trillion by market cap.\n\nStill, Nvidia remains an excellent stock pick due to all of the money being spent on AI data centers. We've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with AI, and there's still a long runway of growth. Nvidia will be there to supply the computing power needed to fuel this buildout, making it a great stock to own in 2026, even if it's unlikely that it will double.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe launch marks Moore Threads' latest bid to challenge foreign rivals like Nvidia, and comes close on the heels of the company's blockbuster initial public offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on December 5.\nZhang Jianzhong, founder and CEO of Moore Threads, pictured in November 2023. Photo: Handout alt=Zhang Jianzhong, founder and CEO of Moore Threads, pictured in November 2023. Photo: Handout>\nThe company's shares have gained more than 480 per cent since their debut, closing at 664.1 yuan on Friday.\n\nZhang claimed that Huashan's performance exceeded that of Nvidia's Hopper series, which includes the H100 and H200 chips, in computing power, memory bandwidth and capacity, but did not provide specifications for the chips.\nThe sale of Nvidia's H100 and H200 - popular choices among global tech firms for AI training - to China was banned until recently by the US government, which cited national security concerns.\nWashington, in a surprising move, recently approved the sale of the H200 chips to China in a move to balance export control, economic interests and national security concerns. But Beijing has yet to approve its domestic sale.\nZhang, 59, an Nvidia veteran and former China market general manager who left to found Moore Threads in 2020, acknowledged that local AI developers had previously hesitated to use domestic chips to train their AI models, fearing subpar outcomes.\n\"But now we can confidently say that if you previously used Hopper [chips], switching to our new product for your large language models will yield better results,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\nMoore Threads also launched Lushan, a new chip focusing on high-performance graphics processing, which could be a boon for China's high-end gamers.\nZhang claimed that the Lushan chip provided 15 times higher gaming performance for triple-A games, an unofficial designation for games with large budgets and long development times.\n\nThe two chips were scheduled to go into mass production next year, Zhang said.\nThe chips were built on Huagang, Moore Thread's next generation of graphics processing unit architecture, which provided a 10 per cent better performance compared with the previous generation, he said.\nOther products announced at the event included a KUAE computing cluster that supports the interconnection of tens of thousands of chips for training large AI models.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) , the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Of the 64 analysts surveyed by S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) in December who cover Nvidia, 60 rated the stock as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\"\nSurging demand for the company's chips has driven Nvidia's share price up by around 30% this year. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock reflects a potential upside of 44% – an impressive gain. However, another artificial intelligence (AI) stock could soar even more than that in 2026, according to one Wall Street analyst.\nOn the rise? In November, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis raised his price target for ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON) from $68 to $80. This represents a 47% increase from the chipmaker's share price at the market close on Dec. 18, 2025.\nLipacis's outlook also suggests a significantly better performance for Onsemi than it has delivered in 2025. The stock is down by a double-digit percentage year-to-date.\n\nGranted, not every Wall Street analyst is as upbeat about Onsemi as Evercore ISI. The average price target for the stock reflects a potential upside of only 9%. Lipacis's $80 price target for Onsemi is the highest on Wall Street.\nAlso, fewer than half of the analysts surveyed by S&P Global (15 out of 34) rated Onsemi as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\" Eighteen analysts recommended holding the stock, while one advised investors to sell it.\nWhy ON Semiconductor could soar in 2026 While Nvidia makes GPUs used in servers that host AI systems, Onsemi develops intelligent power and sensing technology. The company's products are used in data centers, automobiles – especially electric vehicles (EVs), industrial facilities, energy infrastructure, and other applications.\nThe company has significant growth opportunities. Onsemi estimates its total addressable market to be $44 billion, with this market expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 18%.\n\nOnsemi's launch of its new vertical gallium nitride (vGaN) power semiconductors could help the company capture a larger share of its addressable market. The chips enable higher operating voltages and faster switching. As a result, they can reduce energy loss by up to 50%. These attributes should make the company's vGaN semiconductors especially attractive to customers operating AI data centers.\n\nStory continues\nThe recent acquisition by Onsemi of Aura Semiconductor's Vcore power technologies could also boost growth next year. Onsemi CEO Hassane El-Khoury said in the company's third-quarter earnings call that Vcore should help \"close key gaps\" in the solutions offered for next-generation AI data centers.\n\nWill this AI stock really soar by 47% in 2026? Evercore ISI's view about Onsemi seems too bullish to me. The company definitely has some work to do. Onsemi's Q3 revenue fell 12% year over year. Its diluted earnings per share sank by 32%.\nManagement expects to increase revenue by a CAGR of 10% to 12% by 2027. While that's three times the growth of the semiconductor industry, it's not all that impressive. By comparison, analysts project that Nvidia's revenue will increase by 48% next year.\n\nAlso, the fastest-growing areas of Onsemi's addressable market are projected to be in EVs and charging stations for EVs. But U.S. EV adoption is slowing, according to BloombergNEF. This slowdown is attributed to factors including the rollback of national fuel-economy targets, the removal of specific provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that promote EVs, and the potential restriction of California's ability to establish state-specific air quality standards.\nThe good news is that Onsemi's valuation is reasonable. Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18.5. But is this forward earnings multiple low enough to attract investors en masse? Probably not.\nI think that the consensus Wall Street view of a modest gain for Onsemi in 2026 seems more realistic than Evercore ISI's projection of a 47% surge. For what it's worth, though, I suspect analysts' predictions that Nvidia will soar by 44% could also be overly optimistic.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ON Semiconductor right now?

      "Content": "What Is the Best Quantum Computing Stock Billionaire Investors Are Buying Right Now?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nGOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points The most popular quantum computing stocks include pure plays like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum.\nSeveral \"Magnificent Seven\" companies are also exploring the benefits of quantum artificial intelligence (AI).\nInstitutional investors poured into Alphabet stock during the third quarter.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWhen it comes to investing in quantum computing stocks, it's natural for pure plays like IonQ , Rigetti Computing , or D-Wave Quantum to surface first in the conversation. What investors may not fully realize, however, is that a number of megacap tech companies are also exploring the advantages of quantum artificial intelligence (AI).\nFor instance, cloud hyperscalers Microsoft and Amazon have each designed their own quantum chips. Meanwhile, Nvidia offers a suite of software platforms that can be used in hybrid environments featuring classical and quantum computing.\nWhen it comes to the best quantum computing stock, though, billionaire investors seem to have a clear winner. According to 13F filings from the third quarter, a number of high-caliber institutional investors have been pouring into Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\n\nStanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office initiated a position in Alphabet, buying 102,200 shares.\nIsrael Englander's fund, Millennium Management, increased its position in the company by 66%, adding 1.4 million shares in the third quarter.\nKen Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, bought 1.2 million shares during the third quarter, increasing his stake by 200%.\nPhilippe Laffont's Coatue Management increased its stake in Alphabet by 259%, purchasing 5.2 million shares.\nMost notably, Warren Buffett added the company to Berkshire Hathaway 's portfolio during the third quarter, buying 17.8 million shares worth roughly $4.3 billion.\nLet's explore how Alphabet is quietly disrupting the quantum computing landscape. From there, I'll also break down how the technology fits into the company's broader ambitions in the AI market.\nHow is Alphabet investing in quantum computing? Google Quantum AI is the laboratory responsible for leading Alphabet's quantum computing efforts.\nThe company's Willow chip focuses on building scalable, error-correcting systems that specialize in solving complex problems that today's supercomputers simply cannot process.\nIt also released Cirq, a software tool kit that allows developers to research and refine quantum algorithms.\n\nThe real reason billionaires love Alphabet Alphabet is far more than an internet business. While advertising revenue from Google and YouTube is the company's crown jewel, management has quietly integrated new AI services across its entire business.\n\nStory Continues\nToday, users can leverage Alphabet's large language model (LLM), Gemini, on the Google Search homepage, as well as through the company's Android devices.\nGoogle Cloud is also one of the fastest growing and most profitable segments of Alphabet's business, proving it can compete with incumbents like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. A potentially lucrative component of Google Cloud that is yet to be fully launched is the commercialization of Alphabet's custom chips, called tensor processing units (TPUs).\n\nCompanies including Apple and Anthropic have already trained AI models using TPUs, and rumor has it that Meta Platforms is eyeing these custom chips for its next-generation of AI products.\nAlphabet has masterfully stitched AI across the broader fabric of its ecosystem -- in search, advertising, cloud computing, consumer electronics, hardware, and even autonomous driving through Waymo.\nIn technical terms, Alphabet has vertically integrated its various assets, positioning it to remain resilient during just about any economic cycle and making its revenue and profitability profile especially durable.\nWhy Alphabet stock looks like a screaming buy heading into 2026 The takeaway from the details above is that quantum computing represents yet another piece of the foundation in Alphabet's broader AI pyramid. It's not commercially available today, but I see Google Quantum as a pillar of Alphabet's next wave of AI products that can be seamlessly integrated within the company's existing architecture.\nAs the graph above illustrates, Alphabet stock has been soaring lately. As a result, the company's valuation has become quite extended. While a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29 isn't exactly cheap, I still see the stock as a compelling buy right now.\nTo me, the caliber of institutional capital flowing toward it at the moment is unrivaled. Despite the momentum, I see Alphabet's valuation as reasonable relative to the company's long-term upside.\n\nIn my view, the combination of the company's existing AI ecosystem and the upside of quantum computing make it unique in an otherwise frothy and fiercely competitive market. For these reasons, I see Alphabet as a screaming buy as 2026 approaches.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "1 Big Reason Why Today's Value Investors Won't Find Tomorrow's Nvidia\n\nJon Quast, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 7:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Nvidia had an above-average valuation right before the stock went up by 3,000%.\nInvestors must not neglect to look toward the future when investing in stocks.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nIn his 1992 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, said, \"We think the very term 'value investing' is redundant.\" In other words, seeking value is the only way to invest. Given Buffett's affinity for value investing and his incredible success over the years, many investors seek to emulate his approach to stocks.\nUnfortunately, most value investors miss the forest for the trees. And I'll explain how by using Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- the best-performing large-cap stock of the past decade -- as an example.\nYes, I know it's a cherry-picked example. But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way. It's important to recognize the misconception that holds investors back from life-changing opportunities.\nWhy value investors missed Nvidia Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks. And cheapness is measured by comparing the value of the company with something from its financial results, including profits.\nLet's say a company is valued at $50 billion and only has $50 million in net income. This stock would be valued at 1,000 times its earnings. In other words, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (a popular valuation metric) would be 1,000. Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.\nIn 2019, Nvidia's market cap, the value of the company, was around $100 billion. But its average P/E ratio for the year was 35, as the chart below shows.\nThe average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is somewhere around 25. Anything above that has an above-average valuation and is considered expensive by value investors. Nvidia in 2019, therefore, would have been too pricey to buy.\nValue investors believe that the best value stocks to buy trade at a P/E ratio below the average. And often, value investors think that the cheaper a stock is, the better.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has gone on to outperform virtually every other publicly traded company since the start of 2020, despite having an above-average P/E ratio. In short, value investing, as traditionally approached, prevented some investors from buying one of the greatest stocks of our time.\nHow to improve the value mindset There's another important quote from Buffett that needs to be considered here. In the same letter, he wrote, \"Growth is always a component in the calculation of value.\" In other words, value investors must look ahead when looking for a bargain.\n\nStory Continues\nHerein lies the problem with value investing as it's usually done: The P/E ratio (and others) measures past results. But investors must buy stocks today, looking ahead to what the business results could be tomorrow.\nReturning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019. But the P/E ratio didn't reflect the company's superb future earnings growth. As the chart below shows, the stock price is up nearly 3,000% in the last five years, but its earnings per share (EPS) are up even more than that.\nNvidia has earned $100 billion in net income over the past year. The stock traded at 35 times trailing earnings in 2019, which looked expensive. But for those with foresight, the entire value of the company then was equal to its profits right now, which is about as cheap as a stock could possibly be.\n\nOn a personal note, I missed Nvidia stock in 2019, not because of its pricey P/E ratio, but rather because I didn't foresee earnings growth of this magnitude. I didn't believe that the current build-out for AI infrastructure would be so big and last for so long. And in a traditionally cyclical space, I worried that overestimating demand would lead to lower margins at Nvidia.\nI was dead wrong, and that underscores why investing is hard. Looking at a P/E ratio or a market cap is easy. Predicting where the world is going, how a company is positioned, and what that means financially is a tall order. It's why even the best investors often make mistakes.\nThe takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability. The best stocks for the next 10 years might not look like value stocks right now. But they will be a tremendous value in hindsight.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Should You Buy Nvidia Before Jan. 6, 2026?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia has delivered gains to investors this year and over time.\nThe company has built a leading position in the area of AI, and that’s driven enormous growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has proven its status as an artificial intelligence (AI) winner over a variety of time periods -- from the short term to the long term. For example, it's climbed about 30% just this year and has soared 1,200% over the past five years. This is thanks to Nvidia's top AI chips, which have conquered the AI market -- they're the fastest around, and this is very valuable for tech giants aiming to win in the AI race.\n\nAll of this makes Nvidia a great buy for any investors interested in betting on the future of AI. But the big question often is: When should you buy? Sometimes, investors look to potential stock price catalysts, such as an earnings report or an event that may renew excitement about the company -- and push the stock price higher. One such occasion is right around the corner, set to begin on Jan. 6. Should you get in on Nvidia beforehand? Let's find out.\nNvidia's rivals First, though, let's consider why Nvidia has drawn this much attention -- after all, it's not the only AI chip designer around, as it competes with players including Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom . And even some of Nvidia's own customers, like Amazon , are producing their own chips, so they compete with the chip giant to some degree.\n\nBut, as mentioned, Nvidia sells the world's highest-performance chips as well as an entire portfolio of products and services -- making it almost a one-stop place for AI customers to shop for all of their needs. This has translated into spectacular growth for the company, with revenue and profit reaching record levels quarter after quarter.\nAnd, with AI spending forecast to reach into the trillions of dollars over the coming five years, Nvidia may have plenty of bright days ahead.\nNow, let's consider what's happening as of Jan. 6, and that's a massive consumer electronics show known as CES. It's the opportunity for tech giants to show off their latest innovations as well as make new product announcements.\nThe spotlight on Nvidia Attendees may visit an Nvidia showcase daily from Jan. 6 through Jan. 8 at the event to see more than 20 demos and speak with experts from the company. Nvidia has scheduled special sessions on physical AI, as well as AI in manufacturing, drug discovery, and more. Lenovo 's Tech World also will be unfolding during CES, and Nvidia chief Jensen Huang will be one of the speakers at the event.\n\nStory continues\nSo, could all of this represent a catalyst for Nvidia's stock? I wouldn't expect a major new announcement from Huang since the company recently reported earnings -- on Nov. 19 -- so may not have an update in such a short period of time. And since the focus is on consumer electronics, Huang may not choose this moment to talk about subjects such as Nvidia's presence in China. (After several months of halted sales there due to export controls, the U.S. recently said Nvidia could start selling its H200 chip to China.)\n\nA reminder of Nvidia's AI strengths Still, Nvidia probably will talk about the role of its chips in areas such as robotics and drug discovery, reminding attendees and investors that the potential of the company's products and services doesn't end with the training of AI models. Nvidia's chips will fuel the application of AI to real-world problems, meaning the company's growth could continue at high levels well into the future.\n\nIt's possible that any details about this growth opportunity -- the actual use of AI -- could generate some excitement among investors and push the stock higher. But, as I mentioned, I wouldn't expect significant news from Nvidia, so any gains may be small or even temporary.\nNow, let's get back to our question: Should you buy Nvidia before Jan. 6 to get in on any potential pop in the stock? Not necessarily. As I said, Nvidia isn't likely to deliver game-changing gains during or after this event, so whether you buy the stock today or after the show won't make much difference over the long term.\nThat said, Nvidia still makes an excellent buy for investors looking for an AI winner -- and the great news is you can get in on this stock at your leisure and don't have to rush in at one specific moment to score a win over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMU\n\nAVGO\n\nAMD\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock has underperformed its peers in the semiconductor space this year.\nThe company's valuation is becoming cheaper despite its historic operating performance.\nNvidia has a number of catalysts going into 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWhen it comes to leading semiconductor stocks, investors don't need to look much further than companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Broadcom , Advanced Micro Devices , Micron Technology , and of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nWhile Nvidia has been the headline act for much of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, shares have lagged its chip peers throughout 2025.\nAs 2026 draws closer, growth investors may be wondering if Nvidia remains a good buy , or if now is the time to rotate capital away from the world's most valuable company and seek new opportunities.\nWhat should Nvidia investors be on the lookout for in 2026? For the last three years, Wall Street's primary focus surrounding Nvidia is the performance of its data center business. This segment accounts for the bulk of Nvidia's revenue and profits, as it captures demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPU).\nThroughout the AI revolution, investors have paid close attention to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's commentary around the company's Hopper and Blackwell GPU architectures. While Blackwell remains an important catalyst for Nvidia, investors should start to pay closer attention to guidance around the upcoming Rubin chips. So far, investors have already gotten a small preview of demand for Rubin.\n\nFor instance, Huang recently noted that Nvidia has a total order backlog of around $500 billion for Blackwell, Rubin, and accompanying networking products. Of note, a portion of this revenue has already been booked, with an estimated $300 billion expected to be recognized during 2026.\nIn addition, Anthropic recently signed a $30 billion compute capacity agreement with Microsoft . As part of the deal, Anthropic will be leveraging clusters of Blackwell and Rubin chips.\nAt a macro level, Goldman Sachs estimates that hyperscalers including Microsoft, Alphabet , Amazon , and Meta Platforms will spend roughly $500 billion on AI capital expenditures (capex) next year. Taking this one step further, McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion opportunity over the next five years.\nAgainst this backdrop, investors should monitor how these secular tailwinds fueling accelerated investment in infrastructure continue to impact Nvidia, being aware that rising infrastructure will impact Nvidia well beyond its core data center operation.\n\nStory Continues\nThroughout next year and beyond, Nvidia's opportunities in adjacent markets, including next-generation CPUs and accelerated computing operating systems, should begin to come into focus as well, thanks to some savvy partnerships with Intel and Palantir Technologies .\nNvidia's valuation trends are getting interesting In the table, I've summarized Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, as of the end of each quarter over the last year.\nMetric\nCurrent\n3Q25\n2Q25\n1Q25\n4Q24\nPrice-to-sales (P/S)\n23.3\n30.2\n29.6\n20.7\n26.4\nForward price-to-earnings (P/E)\n23.4\n31.5\n57.4\n24.8\n28.1\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\nThere are two anomalies that stick out from the data.\nFirst, Nvidia's valuation multiples experienced notable compression during the company's first fiscal quarter of 2025 (ended April 30). This was driven by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, as well as fear that a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek could pose a threat to U.S. dominance in the AI landscape.\n\nThe second theme that's beginning to become more noticeable is that Nvidia's P/S and forward P/E ratios are hovering around the same levels as their prior lows earlier this year. Once again, I think this contraction revolves around fear more than anything else. Specifically, investors are concerned about rising competition from AMD and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from Broadcom.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy heading into the new year? While rising competition in the chip space is a very real thing, I don't see Nvidia necessarily losing its grip anytime soon. AI infrastructure is expected to be a multitrillion-dollar market that lasts several years. Buying into the idea that the hyperscalers will migrate away from Nvidia's GPUs overnight is unrealistic.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is becoming cheaper by the day despite the company operating at historic levels and signing new deals and partnerships -- effectively broadening its total addressable market (TAM) beyond data center services and simultaneously bringing new levels of business visibility as the AI infrastructure era kicks off.\nI think now is a great time to buy the dip and capitalize on the chip king's ongoing sell-off. Investors with a long-term time horizon could use the recent depressed price action to add to a core buy-and-hold position. Given these dynamics, I see Nvidia as a no-brainer heading into the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "CoreWeave Stock Soars: Time to Buy?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 12:11 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRWV\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points CoreWeave is riding a surge in demand for AI compute.\nThe company must spend and borrow heavily to keep up with its soaring backlog.\nThe stock's valuation leaves very little room for execution missteps.\n10 stocks we like better than CoreWeave ›\nCoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) shares jumped on Friday, after Citigroup analysts gave the AI (artificial intelligence) computing stock a buy rating and a 12-month price target of $192 -- far ahead of where the stock is trading now (even after its nearly 23% jump on Friday).\n\nWhile CoreWeave bulls undoubtedly appreciate the big move higher, nothing has changed in the underlying business. CoreWeave's core problem remains: It will likely need to spend an extraordinary amount of capital before it can prove it can produce substantial and durable profits that live up to its valuation.\nThe tech company, which runs data centers packed with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and sells that computing power to AI labs and hyperscalers that want to train and run large and powerful AI models, has seen explosive demand. Of course, the challenge is translating that demand into revenue and, ultimately, into profits.\nDemand keeps outrunning capacity CoreWeave's latest quarter shows both the pull and the limits of its business expansion. In its third-quarter 2025 update, CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator pointed to record-breaking revenue and a near-doubling of its revenue backlog sequentially. Revenue for the period came in at $1.365 billion, up 134% year over year, while revenue backlog stood at an astounding $55.6 billion as of Sept. 30 (up from $30.1 billion just three months earlier.\n\nWith a backlog that is far in excess of its quarterly limits, the company will undoubtedly strive to grow as fast as it possibly can. But there are limits to how fast a company can grow -- especially in a capital-intensive business like AI infrastructure.\nIndeed, growth is already cooling from an extreme pace. CoreWeave's revenue growth decelerated from 207% year over year in Q2. That does not automatically mean something is wrong, but the slowdown matters because investors will likely value this business on how long its breakneck pace of growth can persist. In addition, this deceleration highlights some of the risks to the timeline of CoreWeave's buildout.\nSpending and debt CoreWeave's income statement shows why investors should stay cautious even after the stock's momentum late last week. The company posted third-quarter operating income of $51.9 million; but it still reported a net loss of $110.1 million. Interest expense is the big culprit: CoreWeave's net interest expense for the quarter was $310.6 million -- up from $104.4 million in the year-ago quarter as the company takes on debt to finance its expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd CoreWeave's financing burden is not going away anytime soon. Growing into its backlog will require a lot more hardware and power. CoreWeave reported $1.9 billion of capital expenditures in the third quarter alone, and it guided to $12 billion to $14 billion of capital expenditures for full-year 2025.\n\nOf course, debt isn't the only way to raise money. But when the company isn't securing debt to finance its buildout, it is diluting shareholders through equity sales. Either way, there are risks to shareholder returns involved.\nHighlighting just how capital-hungry CoreWeave is, the company has secured $14 billion in debt and equity transactions year to date.\nTime to buy? For CoreWeave, execution is what matters. The company will need to bring new sites online on schedule, filling them with contracted demand, and do so without its cost of capital rising faster than its operating income.\nWe're already seeing some risks in execution. In its third-quarter update, management flagged that a third-party data center developer fell behind schedule, negatively affecting the company's fourth-quarter outlook.\n\nOf course, we can't rule out the possibility that CoreWeave will turn into a long-term winner in the fast-growing AI infrastructure space. For now, the company's soaring backlog suggests customers are desperate for capacity from the company. Still, risks seem to be building just as fast as revenue.\nSo, is the growth stock a buy today? With shares trading at a price-to-sales ratio of almost 10, even as interest expense is soaring and the company remains unprofitable, I personally think that waiting for a more attractive entry point makes sense. Sure, there's no guarantee we'll see a more attractive entry point. But instead of buying into the hype, I'd rather patiently wait for a potentially lower price that better balances risks with the potential reward.\n\nShould you buy stock in CoreWeave right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Is All Set to Hit a $5 Trillion Market Cap in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \" Magnificent Seven \" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\nAI is set to accelerate Microsoft's growth There is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.\n\nStory Continues\nFrom cloud computing to personal computing to productivity tools, Microsoft has infused AI across all of its business segments. The good part is that its AI tools are gaining traction among customers. For example, Microsoft management remarked on the company's October earnings conference call that Copilot, its chat-based AI assistant, is now being used by 90% of the Fortune 500 companies.\n\nEven better, Microsoft says that a \"large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more seats.\" Even coders and cybersecurity specialists are using Microsoft's Copilot to enhance productivity and improve the effectiveness of their tools. So, it won't be surprising to see Microsoft cornering a bigger share of the office productivity tools market in the long run, as compared to its current share of 30%.\nOn the other hand, the demand for Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure is outpacing supply. This explains why Microsoft intends to double its data center capacity over the next couple of years to support the rapidly growing demand from customers looking to build AI tools on its platform.\nIt is worth noting that Microsoft's commercial remaining performance obligations (RPO) stood at a massive $392 billion at the end of the previous quarter, up by 51% from the prior year. This metric refers to the total value of contracts yet to be fulfilled. The size of Microsoft's RPO is larger than the $294 billion revenue it recorded in the trailing 12 months. Additionally, its RPO grew at a faster pace than the 18% revenue jump Microsoft recorded last quarter, indicating that it is winning new business at a faster rate than it is fulfilling existing contracts.\n\nAs such, don't be surprised to see Microsoft's growth accelerating in 2026, putting the tech giant on track to attain a $5 trillion market cap.\nHere's how it can reach that milestone Microsoft currently has a market cap of $3.6 trillion. So, it needs to appreciate by another 41% from current levels to reach the $5 trillion milestone. Analysts expect a 16% jump in Microsoft's revenue in the current fiscal year to $327 billion, followed by a 15% increase in the next one to $376 billion.\n\nHowever, Microsoft's massive RPO and the pace of growth in this metric indicate that it could outpace those expectations. Assuming Microsoft's revenue grows by 20% in the next fiscal year to $392 billion (from this year's estimated revenue of $327 billion) and it trades at 13 times sales at that time, in line with its current price-to-sales ratio, its market cap will land at just over $5 trillion.\nSo, this AI stock seems poised to deliver healthy gains in the coming year, which is why investors may consider adding it to their buy list for the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

      "Content": "Why Micron Stock Can Continue to Soar\n\nJon Quast, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:39 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points The data center boom and the push toward agentic AI are giving Micron a tailwind unlike any it's ever experienced.\nAs with Nvidia in recent years, strong customer demand is lifting profit margins beyond belief.\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology ›\nIt took computer memory company Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) 20 years to regain the highs it had achieved during the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century. But since finally hitting a new all-time high again in 2021, Micron's stock has continued to soar. It is up nearly 400% in just the last three years.\nWith the shares soaring to new highs, investors are clearly enthusiastic. But on Dec. 17, the company reported financial results for its fiscal first quarter of 2026. And it turns out that investors actually may not be enthusiastic enough.\nThe business trends are so favorable for the company right now that investors may be underappreciating its potential over the next three to five years. And it's why Micron stock could still enjoy some more upside from here.\nThe big-picture trend Investors tend to be cautious about buying Micron Technology stock because it's a historically cyclical business. The chart below illustrates the fluctuations from 2005 to 2020.\nIf the boom-and-bust financials continue, then this entire discussion falls apart. However, a significant trend is currently underway that may finally help Micron's stock break free from its historical cyclicality.\nThe secular trend is artificial intelligence (AI), of course. Investors have heard plenty about it in recent years, but there is a lot of work still to be done to build out the AI infrastructure needed to achieve the goals laid out by tech giants.\n\nThese major tech companies are building new data centers and filling them with graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia . These GPUs supply the computing power needed to do useful things with AI. However, there is much more to the AI technology stack than just GPUs.\nIt has thus far centered on generative AI. In these applications, the models find generalities from large data sets and use them to create new things. But generative AI is starting to take a back seat to agentic AI. And this is fueling new hardware needs in data centers.\nThe shift to agentic AI -- where it is working on behalf of the user in a more active and personalized way -- requires more computer memory than before. And it's why computer memory businesses have more demand than they can handle right now.\n\nWhy Micron is suddenly a hot business For the first quarter, Micron's revenue was up a stunning 57% year over year and more than 20% just from the previous quarter. And this isn't a one-off; it could be the new normal.\n\nStory Continues\nFor the fiscal second quarter of 2026, management is guiding for revenue of $18.7 billion. If it hits this target, it would be a 132% year-over-year increase, within reach of its all-time fastest growth that occurred back in the dot-com bubble.\nOne of the things driving this growth is demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM). The AI trend doesn't only need memory, it also needs fast memory. And Micron is a market leader in HBM.\n\nAccording to management, the HBM market is expected to triple from 2025 through 2028. In other words, demand for Micron's hottest product should soar over the next three years. Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that the company has already sold out its supply for 2026, and discussions with its customers for subsequent years' orders are also underway.\nIn past cycles, it has had too much supply when demand tapered off, leading to lower profit margins. But that's been true of many semiconductor players, including makers of GPUs. This time, the AI trends have sustained GPU demand far better than many expected.\nNvidia's chart below demonstrates what can happen when demand exceeds supply by a large margin for a long time: Its profit margins are 60% higher than its 10-year average.\nDon't look now, but a similar trend appears to be underway with Micron. In the first quarter, the company achieved a profit margin of 38%. For perspective, its 10-year average profit margin is 14%, according to YCharts. And for the second quarter, management expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.19. That's more than the company has made in most years of its existence.\n\nIf revenue continues to grow over the next three years, as management has commented, the company could enjoy unprecedented profitability. For this reason, I believe Micron stock can keep soaring, even after jumping by so much in recent years.\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now? Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Should You Buy Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks In 2026?\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft have struggled in the last few months, bringing their valuations down with them.\nOther AI stocks like Amazon still look cheaper at today's prices.\nCyclicality risks should keep investors away from Nvidia stock in 2026. Amazon looks like a better buy.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence ( AI ) trade began to sputter in late 2025. Stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are flat since August of this year after seemingly going up at an insatiable rate for three straight years. Similar results have occurred for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shareholders, with its stock actually down over the last six months.\nInvestors have begun to lose faith in the growth-at-any-cost mindset among these AI start-ups even though underlying revenue growth is still strong for the sector.\nDoes that make now a perfect time to buy AI stocks for 2026? Let's take a look at the numbers and find out.\nHigh multiples and fast-growing businesses Stagnant share prices have helped some of the fundamentals for these AI stocks catch up to their share prices. Last quarter, Nvidia's revenue grew 62% year over year to $57 billion, with net income up 65% to $31.9 billion. Microsoft's revenue was up 18%, with 24% growth in operating income.\nAI companies are still paying big paychecks to buy Nvidia's advanced computer chips or to utilize them in AI data centers run by cloud providers such as Microsoft. OpenAI is the leader in AI spending, with commitments in the hundreds of billions of dollars across various sources. A lot of this spending will go to Nvidia computer chips.\n\nStill, even with soaring earnings, both Microsoft and Nvidia (two of the largest companies in the world by market cap) do not have dirt cheap earnings ratios. Nvidia has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 44, while Microsoft's is 34. If earnings keep growing quickly, these ratios will come down in a hurry, but it puts high expectations on future growth.\nMore exposure to AI and cyclicality than others Booming spending in any industry can lead to supply gluts. This has happened in the computer chip space many times throughout history, as well as in other infrastructure build-outs like telecommunications and railroads.\nDon't ignore this risk with the AI winners like Nvidia. There is a major downside risk to Nvidia's earnings power if the company's revenue growth declines along with its profit margin, a double whammy to net income.\n\nSome stocks are more exposed to the AI trade than others, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, or Oracle . Others have been less aggressive on spending or winning contracts, such as Amazon , and are therefore less at risk to an AI or computer chip spending downcycle. With a P/E ratio of 31, Amazon's valuation is lower based on its trailing earnings as well.\n\nStory Continues\nDon't ask whether you should buy AI stocks Investors shouldn't ask whether they should buy AI stocks, as there are dozens, if not hundreds, of stocks exposed to the AI trade, all with different stories and valuations. You have direct beneficiaries such as Nvidia that may be a risky bet right now, or even wilder companies like CoreWeave , laden with debt.\n\nDon't ask if you should buy AI stocks. Ask which AI stocks you should buy today. Amazon looks like a good candidate at today's prices because of its lower P/E ratio, dual growth engines from cloud computing and e-commerce, as well as its growing relationship with start-up Anthropic. Amazon has not gotten as much enthusiasm from Wall Street in 2025, which just might make it a good pick for 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "A Signal Seen Only Once Before: History’s Forecast for the S&P 500’s Next Move\n\nDavid Beren\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 7:19 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nWith the S&P 500 delivering double-digit growth in both 2023 and 2024, we're on track to do something similar as we head into the last week of December 2025. For investors who have been enjoying these gains, this feels a little bit like validation for their willingness to hold on in what has been easily considered a volatile market.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio crossed 40 for only the second time in history. The first occurrence was at the 1999 dot-com peak.\nAfter the CAPE ratio exceeded 40 in 1999, the S&P 500 declined 37% over the next two years.\nThe S&P 500 has delivered three consecutive years of double-digit returns totaling 26% in 2023 and 23% in 2024.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIf you are on the sidelines, you very well might be feeling like you have missed out on one of the best market runs in recent history. No matter which of these two sides you are on, there is something hidden underneath all of this celebration, as a rare market signal has come to the surface. Having only appeared once before, it carries a warning that every investor needs to understand.\nWhile history doesn't always repeat itself, it does sometimes follow very similar patterns, and this means you should be well aware of what happened the last time the market sustained this kind of strong momentum.\nAI and Easy Rates: The Engine Behind Double-Digit S&P 500 Gains Almost without question, the primary fuel for this multi-year period has been a sense of overwhelming optimism around artificial intelligence and a shift toward an easier interest rate environment. Investors have been pouring capital into mega-cap technology leaders like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA) and betting that AI is going to fundamentally reshape global productivity in the very same manner that the internet did almost two decades ago.\n\nThis sense of enthusiasm has driven the S&P 500 to a 26% gain in 2023 and a similarly strong return of 23% in 2024. With just over a week left of trading days in 2025, the double-digit ascent three years in a row is all but a sure thing. Beyond the conversation around AI, the Federal Reserve's pivot toward lower interest rates has also acted as something of a significant tailwind for stock valuations. By proactively cutting rates three times since 2024, the central bank of the United States has lowered borrowing costs and has helped reinforce the argument around a \"soft landing\" scenario for investors.\n\nStory Continues\nThis combination of innovation in the tech space and supportive liquidity has created a market that has essentially ignored what would otherwise be traditional headwinds. Instead, it's pushing indexes to record highs even as concerns about valuation, especially in the tech space, begin to surface in the broader financial community.\n\nThe Once-in-a-Lifetime Market Signal and Investor Problem The extraordinary run investors have been enjoying has now resulted in a market signal that has only been seen once before. This signal is that the S&P Shiller CAPE ratio (Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings) has crossed the 40 threshold. This metric, which measures the index's price against its average inflation-adjusted earnings over the last ten years, provides a smoothed-out view of market valuation.\n\nThe only other instance in history that we have seen a similar situation was at the very peak of the dot-com bubble in 1999. Between 1995 and 1999, the S&P 500 posted five consecutive years of returns exceeding 20% annually. Understandably, investors were thrilled, and technology, similar to how AI is being viewed today, transformed the economy, and valuations didn't matter because the old rules no longer applied, again, very similar to today.\nIf you are an everyday investor, this signal could be cause for concern as the market is currently trading at its second-highest valuation level in over 150 years. Ultimately, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio sitting near 23x, significantly above the 25-year average of 16.3x, the market is considered to be effectively priced for perfection. When valuations are this stretched, even a minor disappointment in corporate earnings or a Fed policy shift can trigger a sharp downturn. This results in investors being in somewhat of a precarious position where they must decide if the risk is worth the reward.\n\nThe problem really isn't that the market is overvalued by any single metric, and markets can stay expensive for years. The problem is that after three consecutive years of double-digit gains, we're in a market scenario that has very little room for any errors.\nAnalyzing the Precedent: What History Says Comes Next For better or worse, history does give us a pretty clear and almost sobering forecast of what has typically followed such an extreme valuation peak. After the Shiller CAPE ratio passed 40 toward the end of 1999, the S&P 500 entered a multi-year decline, and the market lost roughly 37% of its value between December 1999 and December 2001.\n\nHistorical averages also show that once the market records a monthly CAPE ratio above 39, the index has typically declined an average of 4% over the next year and as much as 30% over a three-year horizon. On the plus side, there are some analysts who believe the current bull market still has some runway to keep growing due to the robust AI infrastructure spending and healthy corporate margins. Still, all of the signals point to a sense of overwhelming caution.\nIn every prior instance where the Shiller CAPE has topped 30, it was eventually followed by a significant drawdown that ranged from 20% to as high as 89%, both of which are not good for investors. It's for this reason that the modern investor should heed this signal as a reminder that the underlying technology around AI might be truly transformative, but that the price being paid for this future is entering a market zone that has historically been preceded by some of the most difficult market periods for equity returns.\n\nWhat Investors Should Do Right Now Does this mean a crash is inevitable in 2026 or 2027? Not necessarily, as market conditions today are different in pretty substantial ways from years prior. Most importantly, corporate earnings are stronger and more broadly distributed, while AI is actually generating real revenue and not just the promise of revenue. Separately, the economy, while slowing, hasn't fallen into recession.\n\nUltimately, the comparison isn't trying to predict an exact repeat of 1999, but about recognizing that the same kind of momentum as that period creates very specific risks. This said, for investors that are heavily concentrated in mega-cap tech stocks, now is the time to diversify. The stocks that have been leading this current rally are also some of the most vulnerable if there is a sentiment shift.\nThe idea would be to take some profits that have been made out of tech and rotate them into dividend-paying stocks, international equities, or defensive sectors that can reduce exposure without abandoning the idea of growth entirely. Any concerns should be especially true for retirees, who should be particularly cautious as locking in some gains and shifting toward income-generating assets will protect against the desire to panic sell down the road.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "This Glorious Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Has Crushed Nvidia and Broadcom With 147% Returns in 2025. It Can Jump by 111% in 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nCIEN\n\nKey Points Ciena is taking off due to growing demand for high-speed data transmission in data centers.\nIts latest results demonstrate that it's on track to achieve healthy revenue and earnings growth.\nThe stock's valuation suggests it has room for more upside despite rising impressively in 2025.\n10 stocks we like better than Ciena ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are among the leading names in the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware space. Their chips are deployed in massive numbers by cloud computing companies, hyperscalers, and AI companies for AI model training and inference.\nNot surprisingly, both Broadcom and Nvidia have been witnessing remarkable growth lately. Nvidia reported an impressive 62% jump in revenue last month for the third quarter of its fiscal 2026 (ended on Oct. 26, 2025) to $57 billion. Even Broadcom just reported a solid 28% year-over-year increase in revenue for its latest quarter, driven by a terrific year-over-year jump of 74% in AI revenue.\nThese solid results explain why their shares are up nicely in 2025. While Broadcom stock has jumped 47% this year, Nvidia is sitting on respectable gains of 32%. The good part is that both companies still have a lot of room for growth, but their expensive valuations could limit their upside in 2026.\nHowever, there's one AI infrastructure play that's significantly cheaper than both Nvidia and Broadcom, despite soaring a stunning 147% this year: Ciena (NYSE: CIEN) . Let's see why this company could continue to outperform Nvidia and Broadcom in 2026.\nCiena's growth is set to accelerate in 2026 While Broadcom and Nvidia make AI processors that help train large language models (LLMs) and run AI inference applications, Ciena's optical networking components and software ensure that their chips can perform optimally. After all, Ciena's products, which include routers and switches, ensure high-speed data transmission over fiber networks.\n\nIts offerings are used in data centers, telecom networks, and cloud computing to move massive amounts of data quickly over long distances. This explains why Ciena has been witnessing healthy growth lately. The company released its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results (for the three months ended Nov. 1) on Dec. 11.\nCiena reported a 20% increase in revenue from the year-ago period to $1.35 billion. Its non-GAAP earnings jumped by a much stronger pace of 68% from the year-ago quarter, driven by an improvement in the top line as well as a stronger mix of software sales. More importantly, Ciena is expecting its revenue growth to accelerate in the current quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nIt anticipates a 30% year-over-year increase in revenue at the midpoint to $1.39 billion. Ciena management remarked on the latest earnings conference call that it is now experiencing stronger demand for its networking products from Meta Platforms , which is going to contribute toward the bigger jump in its top line.\n\nMeta is going to deploy Ciena's solutions in \"multiple new data centers.\" Ciena management also added that it is \"engaged in advanced technical discussions with additional hyperscalers\" to supply its data communications products in their data centers. So there is a possibility of Ciena's revenue growing at a faster pace than the 24% increase that it is currently expecting for fiscal 2026 to $5.9 billion.\nThe company's top line jumped by 19% last year, and the guidance for the first quarter suggests that it could easily overhaul its full-year forecast. Importantly, Ciena can sustain the acceleration in its growth in the long run as well. That's because AI data centers reportedly require five times more optical connections as compared to traditional data centers.\nThe size of the AI data center market is poised to grow at an annual rate of 27% through 2032. This explains why analysts have become more bullish about Ciena's prospects.\nThey are forecasting its top-line growth to filter down to the bottom line as well, and expect the company to witness stronger earnings growth thanks to a potential improvement in its margin profile.\nThe strong growth in the company's top and bottom lines could send the stock soaring in 2026 and beyond. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising to see it outperforming both Nvidia and Broadcom in the new year as well.\nThis networking stock could keep crushing the AI infrastructure stalwarts We have already seen that Ciena's fiscal first-quarter revenue is on track to increase by 30% from the year-ago period. Though the company's fiscal 2026 revenue growth guidance of 24% is lower than what it expects to achieve in the current quarter, there is a chance that it could exceed expectations for the full year.\n\nCiena received $7.8 billion worth of orders in the previous fiscal year, which exceeded its annual revenue of $4.8 billion by a big margin. It ended fiscal 2025 with a revenue backlog of $5 billion, pointing out that this figure \"supports a large share of our fiscal 2026 revenue expectations.\" Ciena's impressive backlog and its negotiations with other hyperscalers suggest that the company is on track to exceed the $5.9 billion revenue estimate for fiscal 2026.\nAssuming it can consistently maintain a 30% growth rate throughout the year, its top line could hit $6.25 billion (based on the fiscal 2025 revenue of $4.8 billion). Ciena is currently trading at just 6.4 times sales, which is significantly lower than the two other AI stocks discussed in this article.\nThe U.S. technology sector trades at an average price-to-sales ratio of 8.7. If the market rewards Ciena with a premium valuation owing to its accelerating growth, and it trades at even 10 times sales after a year, its market cap could jump to $62.5 billion (based on the $6.25 billion revenue it could generate this year).

      "Content": "The Ultimate Stock to Buy for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 6:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points When it comes to making chips, all major computing companies turn to Taiwan Semiconductor.\nIts chip fabrication business provides the critical production capacity needed by the industry.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is launching a new technology that could solve the energy crisis.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nFinding the ultimate stock to buy for 2026 is no easy task. First, you have to address whether the stock will come from an AI-related field or not. There are growing fears of an AI bubble forming, but those fears are negated by real money being spent by the AI hyperscalers, who are racing to build out as much computing capacity as possible. I think one of the best stocks to buy for 2026 comes from this industry, and it's a key supplier.\nWhile I'll entertain an argument of whether Nvidia 's dominance is slipping, what isn't up for debate is how much is being spent on AI infrastructure. After setting records in 2025, the AI hypercalers look to be setting a new record on data center capital expenditures again in 2026. There are several companies positioned to take advantage of that buildout, but none is in a better spot than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a neutral party in the AI arms race Taiwan Semiconductor is a chip fabrication business and sells its production capacity to various companies in the chip realm. Taiwan Semiconductor is regarded as the top company in its industry, which is why nearly all of the major computing unit designers partner with Taiwan Semiconductor. It doesn't matter if the computing unit being purchased is from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , or Broadcom ; chances are, it has a chip from TSMC in it.\n\nThis places Taiwan Semiconductor in a neutral position, as it benefits from increased spending regardless of which computing unit is the most popular. The trends are clearly in favor of increased data center spending, and that trend isn't expected to slow down anytime soon.\nNvidia believes that the global data center capital expenditures will rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. Not all of that money will flow toward computing, as there are also construction and land costs to consider. AMD offered a similar projection, as they believe the compute market will be worth $1 trillion by 2030. This bodes well for Taiwan Semiconductor, as it will be providing the chips to power most of these data centers.\nHowever, one issue that may hamper the growth of the industry is power capacity. It's no secret that we could be headed for an energy shortage in the near future, and doing everything possible to consume less energy to maximize computing performance is critical.\n\nStory Continues\nTaiwan Semiconductor understands this, which is why its latest technology is focused on improving energy consumption. Its next generation of chips, 2nm (nanometer), promises to consume 25% to 30% less energy when configured for the same speed as its 3nm predecessor. That's a huge jump in efficiency, and may be what's needed to keep the AI buildout going.\n\nThese chips are entering production right now and will boost Taiwan Semiconductor's finances throughout 2026. However, Taiwan Semiconductor is also doing incredibly well right now.\nTSMC provides incredible performance at a low price In its most recent quarter, Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue rose at a 41% pace in U.S. dollar terms, placing it among the fastest-growing big tech stocks. With the AI buildout not expected to slow down anytime soon, Taiwan Semiconductor should be able to keep this growth rate up for several years.\nDespite its strong growth, the stock really doesn't have a premium price tag assigned to it.\nAt 23 times next year's earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor doesn't carry a premium price tag. It is priced lower than its peers, with AMD trading at 32 times next year's earnings, Broadcom at 25, and Nvidia at 24.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is reasonably priced and is slated to deliver impressive growth over the next few years. As a result, I think it's the ultimate stock to buy now, as it's set to benefit regardless of which computing unit the AI hyperscalers are using. All it needs to succeed is for the AI hyperscalers to continue spending heavily, and they are primed to do just that.\n\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Did Nvidia Just Lose Its Spot as Wall Street’s AI Chip Darling? JPMorgan Says This ‘Overall Top Pick’ Is Better.\n\nJustin Estes\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAMD\n\nIf someone asked you to name a large AI chip manufacturer, you’d probably say Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), or maybe Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Your first thought probably wouldn’t be Broadcom (AVGO).\nBut Broadcom is actually a giant in the AI hyperscaler space with a $1.6 trillion market cap. Up 54% over the past year, the company has found defining success by pursuing only seven to 10 main customers who need billion-dollar buildouts rather than chasing many small $10 million contracts.\n\nMore News from Barchart 5 \"Best of the Best\" Dividend Stocks to Own in 2026\nThis 1 Lesser-Known Stock Is Set to Dominate with Nvidia and Broadcom in 2026\nNike, Tilray, and Palantir: Their Unusually Active Put Options Will Boost Your Wallet After Christmas\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nThat strategy is paying off in a major way. Broadcom reported an AI order backlog of $73 billion to be delivered over the next six quarters, with management expecting that figure to continue growing as new orders roll in.\nJPMorgan recently raised its price target on the stock and maintained its “Overweight” rating, calling the recent dip a buying opportunity. So what exactly does Broadcom do, and why are Wall Street’s biggest investors loading up on shares?\nWhat Does Broadcom Do? Broadcom has achieved its success through category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company operates two primary business segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.\nOn the semiconductor side, Broadcom is the leader in custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) designed specifically for data center AI workloads.\n\nASICs are specialized chips built to exact specifications for hyperscalers such as Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which need massive computing power.\nThe infrastructure software segment, which includes the VMware acquisition, provides enterprise software for planning, developing, automating, managing, and securing applications across different platforms.\nWith roots in the technical heritage of AT&T/Bell Labs, Lucent, and Hewlett-Packard/Agilent, Broadcom combines more than 60 years of innovation with global scale and engineering depth. The company serves the world’s most successful tech companies by focusing on technologies that connect our world.\nCEO Hock Tan explained the strategy at the Goldman Sachs technology conference: Broadcom is laser-focused on about seven customers building large language models and racing toward what he calls “super intelligence.” These companies are collectively spending around $30 billion annually on AI compute infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nRather than pursuing thousands of enterprise customers who might spend $10 million each on merchant GPUs, Broadcom sees its biggest opportunity in providing custom chips and networking infrastructure for these hyperscalers building AI at unprecedented scale.\nWhy Did JPMorgan Upgrade Broadcom Stock? JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur pointed to the continued surge in capital expenditure by hyperscalers and the consequent rise in demand for ASIC chips as key drivers for Broadcom’s growth.\nBroadcom reported Q4 2025 revenue of $18.02 billion, up 28% year over year. The semiconductor segment jumped 35% to $11.07 billion, while the high-margin infrastructure software segment grew 19% to $6.94 billion.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, Broadcom’s revenue hit $63.9 billion, a 24% increase driven overwhelmingly by AI, which saw revenue grow 65% year-over-year to $20 billion.\nBut here’s where it gets really interesting: Broadcom forecasts its AI business will hit $8.2 billion in Q1 2026 alone, marking roughly 100% year-over-year growth. And Tan revealed that his compensation package tied to 2030 targets includes achieving AI revenue over $120 billion — a sixfold increase from the $20 billion generated in fiscal 2025.\nOne customer prospect turned into over $10 billion in orders expected in the second half of fiscal 2026—a major driver behind this is that Broadcom designs and manufactures Google’s custom TPU chips, a specialized ASIC built specifically for AI tasks rather than general-purpose computing (GPU). Google’s latest TPUv7 chip is performing better than expected and attracting major customers like Anthropic and Meta, with Anthropic alone committing to potentially 1 million units.\n\nWall Street Doubled Down Many investors have been trying to make the most of the AI trade, but when AVGO dipped over 27% in Q1 2025 — hitting a yearly low of $138 in April — that was a green light for some of Wall Street’s most famous money managers.\nThese investors spotted what Michael Burry later articulated in his new Substack: while 40%-50% of hyperscaler spending goes to Nvidia GPUs with “ever shorter product cycles,” Broadcom is positioned differently.\n\nBurry specifically named Broadcom alongside Google, Amazon, and Microsoft as “very well-funded” and capable of challenging Nvidia’s dominance.\nMajor Q1 2025 buyers included:\nJeremy Grantham (GMO): Bought over 1.5 million shares despite calling AI a bubble. His fund holds a $291 million position in Broadcom versus just $21 million in Nvidia — nearly 14x more exposure to AVGO than NVDA.\nRenaissance Technologies: Purchased over 2.4 million shares, massively increasing its stake. Regarded as the most successful hedge fund of all time, Renaissance’s bet signals strong conviction in Broadcom’s differentiated positioning.\nTwo Sigma Advisors: Bought around 2.5 million shares, bringing its total position to 3.9 million shares — the largest holding since Q3 2024 when Broadcom traded at just $159 versus Q1’s average of $211.\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio): Added 280,000 shares, betting that Broadcom’s custom ASIC strategy offers structural advantages over commodity GPU manufacturers.\n\nThe stock has since recovered to around $330. While Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting hit other AI stocks, Broadcom’s $73 billion backlog of multi-year contracts with just 7-10 customers provides revenue certainty that short-cycle GPU sales can’t match.\nIs Broadcom a Buy? Broadcom stock has pulled back from December highs near $415 to around $330. If you’ve been on the sidelines, here are three bullish indicators worth considering:\n1. The structural moat is different. While Nvidia sells commodity GPUs facing shorter product cycles and growing competition, Broadcom has locked in $73 billion in backlog with just 7-10 hyperscaler customers through multi-year custom chip contracts. These aren’t off-the-shelf components that competitors can easily replicate.\n\n2. Wall Street’s smartest money doubled down. Renaissance Technologies, Jeremy Grantham, Two Sigma, and Ray Dalio all bought aggressively when the stock dipped in Q1. Grantham holds 14 times more Broadcom than Nvidia despite calling AI a bubble, betting that custom ASICs offer better risk-adjusted returns than merchant chip sales.\n3. Broadcom (mostly) dodged the Burry selloff. Michael Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting triggered the recent tech selloff, but he specifically named Broadcom as well-positioned to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. The company’s custom chip focus sidesteps the depreciation and replacement cycle concerns hitting pure-play GPU manufacturers.\nThe stock trades at 61x earnings, but with 100% AI revenue growth and signed contracts providing multi-year visibility, Broadcom offers a differentiated AI infrastructure play built on structural advantages rather than pure momentum and hype.\nOn the date of publication, Justin Estes did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

However, viable alternatives are starting to pop up that could challenge Nvidia's dominance. If Nvidia's empire starts to crack, two stocks could soar in its place.\nI think both are excellent buys for 2026 and are primed to soar, even if Nvidia can maintain its superiority.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) , but it doesn't manufacture them. Instead, it farms out that work to a handful of other companies. In the chip manufacturing world, that work primarily goes to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) . Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest chip foundry by revenue , and it has achieved this position through continuous technological innovation and strong production yields.\n\nMany of Nvidia's competitors also source their chips from Taiwan Semiconductor, so if Nvidia's dominance slips, Taiwan Semiconductor will be OK. Additionally, if Nvidia maintains its incredible grip on the artificial intelligence computing market, TSMC will continue to do great. For Taiwan Semiconductor to succeed as an investment, AI hyperscalers need to continue spending at their current rate. If they do, Taiwan Semiconductor will be well-positioned to soar in 2026, as it trades at a discount to the fabless chip companies.\nThe three primary computing unit providers in the AI arms race are Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Nvidia is the largest of all of them, and happens to be the cheapest. But none of these three is cheaper than Taiwan Semiconductor.\nTaiwan Semiconductor trades for 29 times forward earnings. That's a hefty discount to its peers, despite benefiting from the same tailwinds pushing these other stocks higher. I think this low starting valuation will play in its favor during 2026 and will be a key reason why it outperforms Nvidia in 2026.\n\nBroadcom Broadcom is taking a different approach to the AI computing problem than its peers. Instead of creating a broad-purpose GPU like AMD or Nvidia, it's partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to build custom AI accelerators. These computing units aren't designed to handle a wide variety of workloads like a GPU is. Instead, it's designed specifically around the workload that it will see. By doing this, Broadcom can maximize performance while decreasing costs, albeit at the expense of flexibility.\n\nStory Continues\nThese computing units are surging in popularity, and Broadcom's financials reflect that. In Q4 (ending Nov. 2), its AI semiconductor revenue rose 74% year over year. For reference, Nvidia's data center division, which encompasses the GPUs primarily used for AI computing, increased revenue at a 66% pace. Broadcom is growing as a popular option to partner with, and I'd expect that trend to accelerate during 2026.\n\nHowever, Broadcom doesn't just make custom AI accelerator units. It has a whole host of other business units that develop mainframe software and hardware, virtual desktops, cybersecurity solutions, and numerous other products. These divisions slow down Broadcom's overall growth rate, as evidenced by Broadcom's net revenue only rising 28% in Q4.\nThis could be what holds Broadcom's stock back from outperforming in 2026, but if the investment community is excited about Broadcom's AI prospects, it could soar past Nvidia. For Q1, Broadcom expects AI revenue to come in at $8.2 billion -- indicating a double over last year's total. This shows that Broadcom's AI growth rate is accelerating while others are moderating. Investors love to see accelerating growth, and if there is still appetite for AI investment, Broadcom's stock could soar past Nvidia's, especially if Nvidia starts to lose market share to more of Broadcom's custom AI accelerators.\n\nI think both of these companies will do great in 2026, but I also wouldn't count Nvidia out, either. Owning all of these stocks may be a smart idea, as the AI buildout is far from over.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Could This Be the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Right Now?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Nvidia is growing rapidly and shows no signs of slowing.\nNvidia believes global data center capital expenditures could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout since its start in 2023. There have also been other top performers, such as Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) , which provides artificial intelligence -powered software.\n\nAdditionally, there are the AI hyperscalers that are powering much of the AI computing capacity built out. And even more in the weeds are utility companies delivering the energy needed to power AI, as well as the construction companies building the data centers .\nThe AI investment realm is incredibly wide, and several companies are benefiting from the massive spending spree by the AI hyperscalers. But of all these various companies involved in the AI race, which is the best one to buy now?\nSometimes, the answer is obvious and right in front of you. I think Nvidia is among the best AI stocks to buy right now.\nNvidia is making money right now If you break down each of the AI sectors mentioned above, there are three cohorts. First are the companies that are making money right now. These include the construction companies and computing power providers like Nvidia.\nSecond are the companies that are growing into the AI demand, which include companies like Palantir and energy companies. While both cohorts have experienced strong growth so far, there is still plenty more to come as AI adoption ramps up.\n\nLast are companies that are set to benefit from AI in the future, which include the AI hyperscalers. These businesses are the big AI spenders, and their investments may or may not pay off in the long run.\nAs an investor, I'm focused on the companies that are making money right now. Nvidia is among the best in this category, which makes it an excellent AI stock to buy right now.\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which have powered a large chunk of the AI workloads so far. GPUs can process multiple calculations in parallel, making them perfectly suited for tasks like AI that require extreme computing power.\nNvidia isn't the only GPU provider in the world; there are others with competing products. There are also GPU alternatives that can compete with GPUs in one area but fail as soon as the computing workload isn't optimized for the custom chip. This makes Nvidia's GPUs the most powerful and flexible computing units available, which is why they are the most popular.\n\nStory Continues\nThey are so popular that Nvidia has actually sold out of cloud GPUs. Considering that Nvidia's sales were $57 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026 (ended Oct. 26), that's an incredible statement to be sold out. Furthermore, revenue was up 62% year over year, so demand is still rising. Nvidia will continue to push its component providers as fast as possible to accelerate production, as the AI buildout will wait for no company.\n\nThe AI buildout is slated to ramp up in the next few years Although a massive amount has already been spent on data centers, we're just beginning the ramp-up. In 2025, AI hyperscalers spent record amounts on capital expenditures, mostly going toward data center construction. However, these companies have all informed investors that 2026's expenses will be greater than 2025's by a significant margin.\n\nAnd that's just one year in a long-term trend, as Nvidia believes that global data center capital expenditures will rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's incredible growth and shows that the companies involved in the data center buildout realm are slated to experience monster growth over the next few years.\nWith Nvidia already being a successful investment in the past, I think it's primed to continue winning. The stock is also fairly cheap and trades for less than 24 times next year's earnings. That's far cheaper than many of its big tech peers, which should ease investors' concerns for overpaying for Nvidia's stock.\nNvidia's stock is currently down by around 15% from its all-time high, making now a great time to buy shares.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This ETF Trounced the S&P 500 in 2025. Here's Why It Could Do It Again Next Year\n\nJeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 11:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nSMH\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nSPY\n\nKey Points The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has been a top performer over the last decade, and is up about 40% this year.\nPaced by Nvidia, Taiwan Semi, and Broadcom, its holdings are delivering strong revenue growth.\nThe ETF trades at a premium to the S&P 500, but that seems deserved.\n10 stocks we like better than VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF ›\n\nInvesting in an S&P 500 ETF like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF or the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: SPY) can be one of the best financial decisions you make in your lifetime.\nAfter all, the S&P 500 has historically returned an annual average of 9% a year, and the broad-market index even beats most hedge funds most years. With its holdings diversified among the top 500 U.S. stocks, and a quarterly rebalancing to make sure that the collection stays up to date, the S&P 500 has a proven formula to deliver long-term gains.\nHowever, an S&P 500 index fund isn't necessarily the best-performing ETF in a given year, and several ETFs have outperformed in 2025. In fact, one has delivered more than double the S&P 500's gains this year. That's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) , which is up 39.5% year-to-date through Dec. 17. The chart below shows how the semiconductor ETF's performance this year compares to the S&P 500.\nIn the third year of the AI boom, semiconductor stocks, led by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , have continued to surge, so perhaps it's not a surprise that the SMH has beaten the S&P 500 by such a wide margin. Let's take a closer look at the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and why it's a good candidate to outperform the S&P 500 again this year.\nWhat's in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF The ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, which is designed to track the overall performance of the semiconductor production and equipment sector.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF's top three holdings include Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , three stocks that have been among the biggest winners in the AI boom and continue to set the pace for the sector.\nAll three stocks are growing briskly heading into 2026. The chart below shows how fast revenue growth has been for all three companies over the last year.\nAs you can see, all three of these stocks, which make up more than a third of the ETF, are delivering strong growth, and two of the three of them reported accelerating revenue growth in their most recent quarters. Those results seem to push back on the narrative of an AI bubble , and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said as much in the company's most recent earnings report, saying he sees AI at a tipping point, implying that demand and usage were about to accelerate.\n\nStory Continues\nWhy the VanEck Semiconductor ETF could beat the S&P 500 next year The strength of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF will depend on the AI boom, but the same could be said for the S&P 500.\nThe SMH does trade at a premium to the S&P 500, but it's not by as much as you might think. The semiconductor ETF currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 38.6, which compares to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF at 28.5.\n\nEven with that premium, the risk/reward in the VanEck ETF looks attractive considering the growth rates of its top three holdings and other major holdings like Micron and Advanced Micro Devices .\nThe buildout of AI data centers is continuing, and demand for semiconductors, which are becoming an essential component in everything from medical equipment to automobiles, will keep growing.\nThe ETF is vulnerable to an AI bubble, and valuations could eventually catch up to the semiconductor sector, but as Jensen Huang believes, the facts on the ground seem to point in the opposite direction. That's a good reason to bet on its outperformance next year as well.\nShould you invest $1,000 in VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF right now?

      "Content": "Here Are My Top 10 Stocks for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 10:50 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points The AI buildout trend is expected to continue at full speed.\nCloud infrastructure companies are expected to thrive due to increased AI demands.\nSeveral stocks that had disappointing performances in 2025 could bounce back in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWith 2025 nearly over, it's a good time for investors to think about which companies they might want to add to their portfolios in 2026. A market pullback can happen at any time, so having a shopping list ready to go is a smart idea.\nHere are my top 10 stock picks for 2026. I'm fairly confident that each of them will outperform the market next year.\n1. Nvidia This is just a list of stocks -- it's not in ranked order. However, if it were in ranked order, there's a good chance that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) would still be No. 1. The chipmaker has been the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout since it began in 2023, and that trend shows no signs of stopping in 2026.\n\nHyperscalers are slated to spend record amounts on capital expenditures in 2026. Most of that money is going toward constructing data centers and filling them with computing equipment, such as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia projects that by 2030, global data center capital expenditures will total $3 trillion to $4 trillion. If that forecast proves accurate, Nvidia will be a top stock to own in 2026 and several years beyond.\n2. AMD AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has played second fiddle to Nvidia in the GPU market for many years, but it could start closing the gap. AMD's offerings are far more competitive than they were just a few years ago, and management believes it can capture more of the market for the new AI workloads coming online.\n\nThe company projects that its data center revenue growth rate will rise to a 60% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. In Q3, its data center growth rate was 22%. If it can accelerate its growth to that 60% level, AMD will be a winning stock pick in 2026.\n3. Broadcom Chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is taking a different approach to AI computing. Instead of offering general-purpose GPUs like AMD and Nvidia, it's partnering with hyperscalers to design custom AI accelerators that are optimized to handle the needs of their workloads. These application-specific integrated circuits can provide better performance at lower costs, but at the cost of reduced flexibility. Many cloud giants are willing to make that trade, and Broadcom's growth is accelerating as a result.\nIn the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2025 (which ended Nov. 2), Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue rose 74% year over year, and management expects that growth rate to accelerate to above 100% in its Q1 fiscal 2026.\n\nStory Continues\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom are all fabless chip companies: They design chips, but outsource the manufacturing of them to specialists like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) . It is by far the world's largest chip foundry by revenue, and with its industry dominance, that likely won't change anytime soon.\n\nAs long as high AI infrastructure spending continues, Taiwan Semiconductor will be a great investment, as it's a neutral player in the AI realm. That spending is expected to rise again in 2026, boding well for Taiwan Semi.\n5. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is becoming a force to be reckoned with in the AI realm. Originally, its generative AI model, Gemini, was viewed as inferior to its rivals. But now, it's seen as one of the leaders in the space.\nFurthermore, Alphabet has a thriving base business (Google Search), as well as a strong cloud computing offering in Google Cloud. It's hard to find a weak spot in Alphabet's business right now.\n\n6. Meta Platforms Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) tumbled after it reported its Q3 results, with the market apparently reacting unfavorably to its high capital expenditure plans. However, that response ignores how strong the base business was in the quarter. Meta's revenue rose by 26% year over year, thanks to the effects of AI on its platforms.\n\nThis growth will likely persist throughout 2026, and investors will come back around to Meta stock once they realize that all the other tech giants in its megacap cohort are spending just as heavily on AI as Meta is. The stock's current discount is a great buying opportunity, and investors should take advantage.\n7. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has performed poorly in 2025: It's only up about 3% so far this year. However, that wasn't because Amazon's business struggled. Its revenue rose at a 13% pace in Q3, led by its strong advertising division and cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services.\nBoth of these businesses are expected to thrive in 2026. With each accounting for a significant chunk of Amazon's profits, that bodes well for the stock's chances of regaining its momentum.\n\n8. PayPal PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) stock has fallen by around 30% in 2025. However, it hasn't been as bad a year for the payment processing giant's business as that result would suggest.\nPayPal delivered strong diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth in 2025, and that trend could continue in 2026, particularly if it continues its share buybacks. PayPal's stock is dirt cheap at 11.5 times forward earnings, making it an attractive stock to buy.\n9. The Trade Desk The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) has had a disappointing year as well, with its stock falling by around 70% so far. When it switched to its AI-powered ad-buying platform, Kokai, its platform migration was poorly executed, leading to problems for its clients. This caused some clients to pull back on their spending with it, and it lost business to Amazon.\n\nHowever, The Trade Desk is still in a great spot and is expected to grow revenue in 2026 at a 16% pace, according to Wall Street analysts. Combine that with its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20, and you have a recipe for a stock that could outperform in 2026.\n10. MercadoLibre Last but not least is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) , a Latin American e-commerce and fintech giant that has posted year after year of successful quarters. The stock is up by around 20% for the year, but down by more than 20% from the high it hit in July.\nMercadoLibre is the dominant e-commerce company in Latin America, and its growth is far from over. Previous pullbacks in MercadoLibre's stock over the past few years have proven to be excellent buying opportunities, and the current one looks no different.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Technology stocks extended gains from Thursday, helping the S&P 500 and Nasdaq finish the week higher. Chipmaker Micron Technology's strong forecasts re-ignited optimism around AI-related shares, which had recently come under pressure over lofty valuations and funding concerns. Micron shares rose 7% to reach a record high on Friday and Nvidia added roughly four percent as the U.S. launched a review that could allow the first shipments to China of Nvidia’s second-most powerful AI chip. Anna Rathbun, founder and CEO of Grenadilla Advisory, says she understands the day-to-day focus on these companies and their stocks as they continue to shovel billions of dollars into data centers, but she encourages investors to have a much longer time horizon. \"Now, the markets are asking to see some of that return on investment. I don't think we're going to see that for a while because I think the runway to AI and getting all the way to AI actually being relevant in our lives, day-to-day lives, is a little bit further out. So it's going to be a little bit rocky still, finishing out 2025 and certainly into 2026. This is a long-term play, AI, not a short-term play.\" Other stocks on the move included Nike which plunged 10.5% after the sportswear giant reported a drop in gross margins for the second consecutive quarter, hurt by poor sales in China and efforts to reset its product mix. And shares of frozen French fry maker Lamb Weston lost a quarter of their value to close at the lowest level in more than 8 years after the company signaled muted demand for its products for the rest of the fiscal year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

To come up with ‌the money, Son has already sold SoftBank's entire $5.8 billion stake in AI chip leader Nvidia ( NVDA ), offloaded $4.8 billion of its T-Mobile ( TMUS ) US stake, and slashed staff.\nSon has slowed most other dealmaking at SoftBank's Vision Fund to a crawl, and any deal above $50 million now requires his ‌explicit approval, two of the sources told Reuters.\n\nSon's firm is working to take public its payments app operator, PayPay. The initial public offering, originally expected this month, was pushed back due to the 43-day-long U.S. government shutdown, which ended in November. PayPay's market debut, likely to raise more than $20 billion, is now expected in the first quarter of next year, according to one direct source and another person familiar with the efforts.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate is also looking to cash out some of its holdings in Didi Global ( DIDIY ), the operator of China’s dominant ride-hailing platform, which is looking to list its shares in Hong Kong after a regulatory crackdown forced it to delist in the ⁠U.S. in 2021, a source with direct knowledge said. Investment managers at ‌SoftBank's Vision Fund are being directed toward the OpenAI deal, two of the above sources said.\nSoftBank's scramble to marshal funds offers a window into the strain faced even by the world's biggest dealmakers as they scramble to finance ambitious AI data center projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\nSoftBank declined to comment.\nSoftBank has options OpenAI has not ‍yet received the remaining funding, but expects the money to come in by the end of 2025, as stipulated in the contract, sources said.\nSoftBank has multiple sources of capital it could tap, including margin loans, cash on its balance sheet, stakes in listed companies, and corporate bonds or bridge loans, sources said.\nSon has strong reasons to draw on a range of funding mechanisms to fulfill those obligations. SoftBank secured a deal to invest in OpenAI at a $300 billion valuation in April. ​Since then, the valuation of OpenAI has risen dramatically and the company is in talks to raise additional funding from investors, including Amazon, tripling its valuation to close to $900 billion, one of the sources added, ‌which would give SoftBank a significant paper gain once the transaction is completed.\n\nStory Continues\nA major pool of capital for SoftBank is its undrawn capacity of margin loans borrowed against its ownership of British semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings. SoftBank recently expanded its margin loan capacity by $6.5 billion, bringing the total undrawn capacity to $11.5 billion. Arm’s stock has since tripled from its IPO price, providing SoftBank with additional collateral headroom to expand its borrowing capacity.\n\nSoftBank reported parent-level cash of 4.2 trillion yen ($27.16 billion) as of September 30.

Find the next big opportunity with these 25 smaller AI-focused companies with strong growth potential through early-stage innovation in machine learning, automation, and data intelligence that could fund your retirement.\nAlibaba Group Holding Investment Narrative Recap To own Alibaba today, you need to believe that its AI focused cloud platform and core China commerce assets can, over time, outweigh near term profit pressure and geopolitical uncertainty. The H200 export approval is directionally helpful for its AI cloud story, but chip access remains only one piece of the key short term catalyst, which is whether AI related cloud growth can offset heavy spending in quick commerce and AI infrastructure without prolonging margin strain.\n\nThe expansion of Cainiao and Tmall Supermarket fulfilment for Taobao Shangou, enabling four hour delivery in 31 cities, ties directly into that catalyst by showing where a lot of that spending is going. It reinforces that Alibaba is committing real capital to instant commerce at the same time as it pushes Qwen powered cloud services, which increases execution risk if user growth or order density falls short of what is needed to ease losses.\nYet investors should also factor in how prolonged losses in quick commerce could pressure Alibaba’s margins and cash flows if...\nRead the full narrative on Alibaba Group Holding (it's free!)\nAlibaba Group Holding's narrative projects CN¥1260.3 billion revenue and CN¥171.1 billion earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Alibaba Group Holding's forecasts yield a $197.98 fair value , a 32% upside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives 73 members of the Simply Wall St Community currently place Alibaba’s fair value between US$107.09 and US$266.34, with views spread across this full range.

This reignited fears that AI infrastructure spending is outpacing actual monetization. Broadcom compounded the anxiety; despite beating earnings, its stock fell as CFO Kirsten Spears cautioned that gross margins may come under pressure as product mix shifts further toward system-level AI sales. This sparked a macro rotation away from AI infrastructure and power plays. High-valuation names like AMD, Vertiv, and Bloom Energy fell as markets looked to sectors that can benefit from the recent Fed rate cut and a resilient economy.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD is up 77.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $214.30 per share, it is still trading 18.9% below its 52-week high of $264.33 from October 2025.

      "Content": "3 Tech Stocks to Buy for the New Year and Hold Through 2030\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:10 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Nvidia's GPUs remain the gold standard for data center clustering.\nCompetitors haven't been able to duplicate ASML's EUV technology.\nPalantir may be controversial for its government work, but it's also seeing mammoth growth from commercial clients.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nIf you're investing in tech stocks , you likely had a pretty good 2025. The tech sector is one of the better-performing sectors, and tech-focused exchange-traded funds are outperforming the S&P 500 by a significant margin.\nIt's no coincidence that of the top 10 most valuable companies in the world, nine are tech companies that operate squarely at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and real-world execution. The artificial intelligence market size is expected to grow from $390.91 billion in 2025 to an incredible $3.5 trillion by 2033 -- a compound annual growth rate of 30.6%. So, if you want your portfolio to continue to perform well, investing in tech stocks at the forefront of AI development is the way to go.\nHere are three that I'm currently watching, and I think this grouping is a strong bet for significant growth and profits through 2030.\n1. Nvidia Semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is perhaps the most consequential AI company in the world, and that's why its stock has soared to more than a $4 trillion valuation in the last year. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are ideally suited for parallel processing tasks that can be broken down and run across thousands of cores at the same time. Data centers bundle thousands of Nvidia GPUs to handle AI training and inference, making Nvidia's chips the current gold standard of AI architecture.\n\nNvidia has seen massive growth, with revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Oct. 26, 2025) jumping 62% from a year ago to $57 billion. And Nvidia believes that it will be at the center of further expansion, as it sees AI infrastructure being valued at $3 trillion to $4 trillion a year by the end of the decade.\n\"We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in a recent earnings release. \"The AI ecosystem is scaling fast -- with more new foundation model makers, more AI start-ups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.\"\n2. ASML If Huang is right about AI infrastructure growth -- and I think he is -- then another company that stands to benefit is the Dutch company ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) . ASML makes machines that are vital to the fabrication of semiconductors designed by Nvidia and its competitors. ASML's machines create tiny circuits and components that are used by foundries to make chips.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd most importantly, ASML's machines are unique. ASML is the only company that has mastered extreme ultraviolet (EUV) system technology that uses mirrors instead of multiple lenses to focus beams of light to craft chip components. Because ASML's technology is more advanced than deep ultraviolet (DUV) technology, its machines are capable of completing tasks that aren't possible for DUV machines.\n\nRevenue in the third quarter was 7.51 billion euros ($8.84 billion), up from 7.47 billion euros a year ago. However, the company's strong gross margin of 51.6% and net income of 2.12 billion euros show how lucrative this business is.\nAs the pace of semiconductor manufacturing continues increasing, ASML's EUV machines will remain in high demand.\n3. Palantir Technologies Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is a divisive company, to be sure -- the data analytics company was best known as a government contractor with a state-of-the-art software system that is capable of gathering and analyzing information from thousands of data points, including satellites, to provide military commanders and intelligence agencies with real-time insights.\n\nHowever, other government agencies also use Palantir. Its biggest source of revenue is from the U.S. government. And one agency that's getting a lot of attention is Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is using Palantir's platform to track undocumented immigrants for deportation. When CEO Alex Karp was asked about criticism of Palantir helping ICE, he responded: \"We are sorry that our haters are disappointed, but there are many more quarters to be disappointed and we are working on that too.\"\nRegardless of how you feel about the politics, there's no doubting that Palantir's revenue is growing exceptionally fast -- and not just from the U.S. government. Palantir's platform utilizes generative AI and has numerous commercial applications, and commercial growth is actually exceeding U.S. government growth these days. In the third quarter, Palantir recorded U.S. commercial revenue of $397 million, up 121% from a year ago; and U.S. government revenue of $486 million, up 52% from last year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Top Research Reports for NVIDIA, Netflix & Merck\n\nMark Vickery\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:02 PM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMDT\n\nUBS\n\nSCCO\n\nNFLX\n\nThursday, December 18, 2025\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) and Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK), as well as two micro-cap stocks The Monarch Cement Co. (MCEM) and Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CPIX). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA&rsquo;s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues.\n\nThe continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with more than 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicle space.\n\nThe Zacks analyst expect NVIDIA&rsquo;s revenues to witness a CAGR of 40.7% through fiscal 2026-2028. However, a limited supply of Blackwell GPUs may hinder its ability to meet demand. Rising costs associated with the production of more complex AI systems will hurt margins.\n\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>> )\n\nNetflix&rsquo;s shares have gained +5% over the past year against the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry&rsquo;s gain of +16.2%. The company is benefiting from its growing subscriber base, thanks to a robust localized and foreign-language content portfolio and healthy engagement levels with about two hours of viewing per member per day, indicating strong member retention.\n\nNFLX's advertising tier now accounts for more than 55% of new sign-ups in available markets. NFLX has set an ambitious target to double its revenues by 2030 and reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, supported by a diversified content strategy, including international programming, live events, and gaming initiatives.\n\nNFLX raised its full-year free cash flow forecast to $9 billion from $8-8.5 billion. For the fourth-quarter, Netflix projects $11.96 billion in revenue with 16.7% growth and a 23.9% operating margin, featuring major releases including Stranger Things' final season and NFL Christmas games.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>> )\n\nShares of Merck have gained +3.4% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry&rsquo;s gain of +16.7%. The company&rsquo;s blockbuster drug, Keytruda, and new products have been driving sales. With label expansion into new indications, particularly earlier-stage launches, Keytruda is expected to see continued growth. Animal health is also contributing to growth.\n\nMerck has been making meaningful pipeline progress across areas like oncology, vaccines and infectious diseases. Moreover, it is actively pursuing M&A deals to enhance its pipeline and diversify away from Keytruda.\n\nHowever, rising competitive and generic pressure on some drugs and persistent challenges for Gardasil in China remain overhangs. There are concerns about Merck&rsquo;s ability to successfully navigate the Keytruda loss of exclusivity period and potential competition for the drug.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Merck here >>> )\n\nMonarch Cement&rsquo;s shares have gained +5.9% over the past year against the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry&rsquo;s gain of +18.5%. This microcap company with a market capitalization of $805.78 million offers a compelling income-plus-stability profile, anchored by strong balance sheet discipline, margin leadership and capital flexibility. Monarch Cement&rsquo;s significantly increased dividends and buybacks in 2025 while maintaining $56.8 million in cash and no long-term debt.\n\nRetained earnings and equity continue to grow, enabling $25.5 million in self-funded capex. The Cement segment delivers dominant profitability, generating more than 94% of operating income with a 46% gross margin, reinforced by ongoing investment in long-life assets and a vertically integrated plant with >50 years of reserves.\n\nA capital-efficient JV provides steady earnings without full volatility, while timely asset monetization and a diversified equity portfolio enhance cash flow and earnings quality. Strong working capital and seasonality-aligned liquidity further support dividends, reinvestment and downside resilience.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Monarch Cement here >>> )\n\nShares of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry over the past year (+67.7% vs. +4.4%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $58.18 million offers a differentiated specialty pharma investment anchored by a scalable commercial platform and disciplined acquisition strategy.\n\nCumberland Pharmaceuticals&rsquo; established hospital, GI, and oncology sales infrastructure enables efficient integration of under-promoted, FDA-approved brands, supporting operating leverage and accretive growth. The Talicia partnership adds de-risked, long-duration revenue, combining existing sales momentum with patent and exclusivity protection through 2042 at modest capital commitment.\n\nLonger term, ifetroban provides meaningful upside, with positive Phase II data in Duchenne muscular dystrophy cardiomyopathy and multiple ongoing Phase II programs that reduce binary pipeline risk. Approximately $53 million in NOLs enhance future cash flow conversion, while partner-led international launches offer low-cost growth optionality.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Cumberland Pharmaceuticals here >>> )\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include UBS Group AG (UBS), Medtronic plc (MDT) and Southern Copper Corp.

We're digging into all of this in today's options pit, sponsored by Tasty trade.\n00:15 Speaker A\nAnd Henry Schwartz, CBOE Vice President of Market Intelligence is here to discuss. Uh, let's talk about this surge in options demand. We were just talking offline. You said it's up what three times since uh COVID?\n00:32 Henry Schwartz\nYeah.\n00:33 Speaker A\nThat is incredible. So, what is this trend tell you?\n00:36 Henry Schwartz\nSo, I mean, this year we're going to see 15 billion option contracts trade. Uh if you go back to to just before COVID, it was about 4 billion contracts a year. So, and in fact, I've been doing the calculations. It looks like the 15 billionth contract will trade on Christmas Eve.\n00:52 Speaker A\nMhm.\n00:52 Henry Schwartz\nI think we should have a door prize or something. Let's see if we can figure out what trade.\n00:56 Speaker A\nThere might be some binary option futures betting markets that could uh take care of that.\n01:00 Henry Schwartz\nAbsolutely. Well, I mean, that that's actually kind of one of the big themes, right? As we've seen this the evolution of risk taking, betting, you know, there's a lot of different ways to discuss it. Um, you know, the the you know, COVID really or you know, that whole kind of market environment really changed the landscape for options trading. And basically, uh we saw growth of about 50% in 2020 and it has kept up and it is retail that is really driving most of that. You know, we continue to see, you know, a healthy institutional business. Uh we see, you know, we see, you know, the the big theme really for this year is kind of everything is just stronger. Across the board, no matter what asset classes you look at, if you're talking about index options like SPX or VIX. If you're talking about ETF options, which you know, we were just talking about kind of the explosion in in number of ETFs and single stock option flow, which is really, you know, primarily retail driven. And when you have a year like, you know, like we're seeing this year with, you know, basically the broad averages up, you know, between 15 and 20%, uh that just brings in more and more activity.\n02:08 Speaker A\nSo, I've been thinking about this and tell me if I'm just way offline here. But if we take it back to early late 2020, early 2021, that's when we had the whole Reddit GameStop phenomenon going on. Arguably, a lot of it was fueled with the stimulus checks, the stimmies. and next year is going to be a blockbuster record year for fiscal stimulus. Um there's going to be a lot of tax refunds and I'm just wondering, is there any way we could have some kind of a repeat of that, maybe not to the same extent, but do you think that we just get another surge, um perhaps just because people have more money to play with?\n02:46 Henry Schwartz\nI I mean, I think you have you have a lot of dynamics going on at the same time. You know, we do have a a a rate, you know, the rates are going down in the cycle, but you also do have some concerns about the labor market, you have concerns about, you know, just fundamental valuations. So there's a little bit of push and pull. I think, you know, that the the COVID situation and you know, zero interest rates and stimulus and meme stock, uh that that was such a perfect storm of just kind of\n03:28 Speaker A\nAgreed, perfect storm.\n03:29 Henry Schwartz\nexplosive bullish activity and and and retail were able to capitalize on it. You know, in a large part because they were at home and they kind of had the freedom to trade. You also had commissions that basically gone to zero just leading into that. So, everything came together and you know, a lot of these traders found each other and learned from each other on Reddit and on, you know, social media. Uh I don't know if 2026 is going to be quite the same. I think there's a little bit more kind of back and forth. Uh but you know, at least in terms of the options activity, you know, we continue to see new brokerage firms coming uh online. We see the existing brokerage firms, you know, innovating and and rolling out new platforms and doing some really interesting things. So, you know, I see the business, at least in the options world continuing to to do very, very well. And you know, in terms of assets, uh you know, I think that you have this environment now where, you know, the US has had an amazing run and there's a lot of people that say, oh, you know, I don't know, this is getting a little bit tired. Uh but at the same time, you you you know, every time we have a dip, uh,\n04:36 Speaker A\nAnd that's arguably better for options traders. I mean, option traders like volatility. I I I want to make sure we get to a couple other things here. The other is the rise of zero-dated options. And so that just gives more opportunities. Back in the day, you only had monthlies, so you had to wait every month. Then we had weeklies, then basically we have dailies now. And that has just increased uh this volume of options. Talk to me about some of the other innovations. I know CBOE has a bunch of new products, too.\n05:08 Henry Schwartz\nYeah, so the so we pioneered the zero DTE or the daily option option cycle starting 2022 and those are now about 2/3 of the activity uh in SPX and um and some of the big ETFs. Uh and there there's no signs of that slowing down. Uh we just rolled out the Mag 10 index, which is the Mag 7 plus uh Broadcom, uh AMD and Palantir. And you know, those 10 symbols together do about a third of the single stock option. Out of almost 4,000 single stocks. So you you can see how concentrated it is. That's what the trader, that's what the investing public really, really is interested in. They're following the stories, they're getting in and getting out of these stocks. And so the Mag 10 index which launched about a month ago, I'm very proud to say I was the very first trade in in Mag 10. and that option expired today and I made a little bit of money at it. Uh we actually have daily options coming in those just uh in two weeks. So that's, you know, and that's new, right? This this is the first time that that there's been a uh an index that's not quite as broad-based with the daily options on it as well. So, um you know, there's you know, the the industry just continues to keep innovating. You know, we see a lot of work going on in complex order execution, which is you know, basically about a third of the activity is customers trading one option against another, vertical spreads, calendar spreads, exactly. Uh and that you know, CBOE and all the other exchanges continue to kind of take steps to make that uh easier to do, add functionality. You can now trade flex options versus listed options, which is a kind of a special option that lets people pick their own expiration date and um and strike price and even exercise style.\n06:56 Speaker A\nAll right, Henry, we got to leave it there, but congratulations on your Mag 10 trade. I hope it pretends a bullish 2026. Thanks for joining us in studio here.\n07:05 Henry Schwartz\nAwesome.\n07:06 Speaker A\nAll right, we'll\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Similarly, \"core\" inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.6%, beating the consensus forecast of 3.0%. This encouraging report meant that inflationary pressures were easing more quickly than anticipated. As a result, investors grew more optimistic that the Federal Reserve would have the flexibility to cut interest rates in the near future. Lower interest rates generally reduce borrowing costs for companies and can make stocks, particularly growth-oriented tech shares, more attractive to investors.\n\nStory Continues\nPalantir Technologies is up 158% since the beginning of the year, and at $193.64 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $207.18 from November 2025.

      "Content": "Is Nokia a Must-Own Stock for 2026?\n\nRobert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 12:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NOK\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points The former mobile phone leader struggled in 2024, with revenue down 9% year over year.\nBut the stock bounced back in 2025 thanks to a new CEO and a partnership with Nvidia.\nNokia saw sales jump 12% year over year in Q3, and its new strategy bears watching.\n10 stocks we like better than Nokia ›\nTech titan Nokia (NYSE: NOK) has lived many lives. It began 160 years ago as a pulp mill, eventually moving into technology and becoming the global leader in mobile phones in 1998.\n\nNokia was dethroned after the arrival of the Apple iPhone, and the Finnish company sold its handset business. Today, it focuses on networking infrastructure for data centers , along with its wireless network solutions.\nNow, Nokia stock is surging in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). Shares in the company are up more than 40% in 2025 through the week ended Dec. 12, as Nokia positions itself to be a key player in the AI era.\nLet's dive deeper into the tech giant to see if its stock is a buy for the new year.\nNokia's key partnership with Nvidia Nokia had a rough 2024, with revenue dropping 9% year over year to 19.2 billion euros. While the company struggled last year, 2025 is proving transformative for the company.\nIn the first quarter, it brought on a new CEO, Justin Hotard, as it transitions to greater AI emphasis. In October, the company announced a partnership with Nvidia to construct a wireless network that can support artificial intelligence's use on the edge.\n\nTogether, Nokia and Nvidia are building a 6G wireless system designed to support AI radio access network (AI-RAN) technology. AI-RAN differs from today's 5G network in that artificial intelligence transforms it from a passive data pipe into one where AI intelligently manages traffic for better speed, coverage, and capacity.\nNokia will adopt Nvidia's accelerated computing platform, which helps telecommunications companies seamlessly transition from 5G to 6G through software upgrades. In addition, Nvidia will make a $1 billion equity investment by purchasing Nokia stock at $6.01 per share.\nHotard summarized the significance of this deal, stating, \"Our partnership with Nvidia... will accelerate AI-RAN innovation to put an AI data center into everyone's pocket.\" AI-RAN deployment is happening quickly. T-Mobile US is set to begin testing Nokia's AI-RAN in 2026.\n\nNokia's return to sales growth AI-RAN technology is needed, since AI usage is expected to send wireless traffic soaring in the years ahead. Already, about half of ChatGPT's 800 million weekly active users access the service through mobile devices, according to Nokia.\n\nStory Continues\nDemand for AI delivered wirelessly is growing with the rise of AI-controlled self-driving cars, drones, robots, and agentic AI. In fact, Nokia sees ongoing network traffic expansion over the next decade. This makes its AI-native 6G network an important growth driver for the company.\nThe deal with Nvidia isn't the only bright spot. After Nokia's 2024 revenue dropped 9% year over year, sales reversed course and are up this year. In the third quarter, revenue reached 4.8 billion euros, a strong 12% year-over-year increase. The company's February acquisition of Infinera, a provider of optical networking solutions, contributed to the sales growth.\n\nHowever, Nokia's Q3 operating profit fell 14% year over year to 239 million euros as costs increased. This contributed to a 67% year-over-year decline in Q3 diluted earnings per share (EPS) to 0.01 euros.\nThe company is working to reduce expenses. At the end of Q3, Nokia had achieved cost savings of 0.8 billion euros, and is striving to reach total savings of 1.2 billion euros by the end of 2026. If it continues to reduce expenses while increasing revenue through its AI efforts, it could see EPS grow.\nTo buy or not to buy Nokia stock? The progress made in 2025 bodes well for Nokia's future. It's poised to benefit from the tailwind delivered by the AI market's expansion. The industry is forecast to reach $4.8 trillion by 2033, a jaw-dropping 25x increase in a decade from 2023's $189 billion.\nNokia's focus on AI-RAN technology looks like a winning strategy, and having Nvidia in its corner is advantageous. But its success isn't assured, as it competes against the likes of Ericsson and Cisco Systems .\n\nThat said, if you believe it can succeed, now isn't a bad time to buy the stock based on its share price valuation. Here's a comparison of its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which tells you how much investors are paying for a dollar's worth of earnings, based on estimates for the next 12 months, against competitors.\nThe chart shows Nokia's forward P/E multiple hovers around Cisco's after it came down from the boost it got with the Nvidia deal announcement. However, Ericsson has been the better value all year, and remains so.\nNokia still has to prove its strategy can deliver long-term financial upside, so its stock isn't a must-buy at this point. But the company looks like it's headed toward better days ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nokia right now?

The report was so strong that it has helped lift AI stocks across the board.\nMicron's big time beat For the quarter ending in November, Micron reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.78 on $13.6 billion in revenue, handily beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines; Wall Street had anticipated earnings of $3.96 per share on $12.9 billion in sales.\nMicron's guidance blew past analyst estimates as well, expecting to bring in $18.7 billion in revenue next quarter, well above the consensus target of $14.3 billion.\nWall Street was impressed. Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley said that \"Outside of Nvidia ,\" it was \"likely the best revenue/$net income upside in the history of the U.S. semis industry,\" referring to the AI behemoth's Spring 2023 earnings print that was the inflection point for the modern AI boom in public markets.\n\nMicron is a buy Micron is a solid pick within the AI market.

      "Content": "Will Nvidia Stock Crash in 2026?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 12:05 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Nvidia's stock has soared tremendously amid the scramble for generative AI-related hardware.\nThe stock isn't that expensive compared to its growth. But there are some risks investors should consider.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n2025 has been a banner year for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. Shares in the AI hardware titan have soared by 32% this year, trouncing the S&P 500 's comparatively measly return of just 15%.\nThat said, the generative artificial intelligence (AI) hardware boom is getting long in the tooth, leaving investors wondering if Nvidia can maintain its momentum in 2026.\nLet's dig deeper to see what the future may bring for the stock.\nNvidia is still a fantastic company With a market cap of $4.3 trillion, Nvidia is the largest company in the world, and it didn't get to this point by accident. The chipmaker's continued success has relied on its ability to create a deep economic moat in an industry with a fair bit of competition. For the most part, this edge relies on Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which is Nvidia's proprietary software platform designed to allow developers to get the most out of its graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nNvidia has been a pioneer in GPU technology since its founding in 1993. And this means a whole generation of developers has been trained on CUDA. It now boasts a vast ecosystem of tools and user knowledge that has given Nvidia a practically unassailable moat in its niche, even if products from rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) can deliver similar raw specs.\nThe generative AI boom allowed Nvidia to leverage the advantages it has been nurturing for decades, and business is booming. Third-quarter revenue soared 62% year over year to $57 billion, driven by the continued popularity of new data center AI chips such as the Blackwell series.\nAccording to CEO Jensen Huang, compute demand continues to accelerate. And Nvidia plans to release a new class of GPUs called Rubin, designed to tackle AI video generation in late 2026. On the surface, everything looks fantastic. But there are some rising uncertainties.\n\nWhat are the challenges? While Nvidia's business model is great for its shareholders , it doesn't seem ideal for its customers. Nvidia sells its hardware at tremendous markups. The entire company boasted a gross margin of 73.4% in the third quarter (popular products like Blackwell probably boast even higher margins). And these are the types of numbers you would typically expect to see in software companies that don't sell physical products.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia is maximizing profit, as it should. But its clients also have a fiduciary responsibility to reduce their costs if possible. And this dilemma might come to a head over the next few years -- especially as industry leaders like OpenAI continue to post eye-popping cash burn. The ChatGPT maker is believed to have lost more than $11.5 billion in its most recent quarter. And one analyst at Deutsche Bank thinks the problem could worsen, with total combined losses spiraling to $140 billion by 2029.\n\nAs a picks-and-shovels infrastructure provider, Nvidia can still win, even when some of its biggest customers lose. That said, the losses on the consumer-facing side of the AI equation suggest the industry foundations are very uncertain, which could eventually drive investors away.\nFurthermore, more Nvidia customers are investing in Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are also known as custom chips. These are workload-specific AI chips that can perform specialized tasks for significantly cheaper than Nvidia's large general-purpose GPUs. Many of Nvidia's top clients, like Alphabet , OpenAI, and Amazon , are already investing heavily in in-house chip design.\nWill Nvidia crash in 2026? Although Nvidia faces mounting challenges as clients continue losing money or increasingly turn to more affordable custom chips, a crash seems very unlikely. Despite the company's market cap of $4.3 trillion, its stock is reasonably priced considering its growth rate.\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23, the stock is actually much cheaper than the Nasdaq 100 average of 26. This dynamic suggests a significant slowdown is already baked into Nvidia's current valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

On December 10, Reuters reported that Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) has shown interest in buying Nvidia’s H200 AI chip, as the Trump administration has allowed Nvidia to export its chips to China.\n\n​According to the report, Chinese companies, including Alibaba, are yet to get a green light from the government to import chips from Nvidia. If the government allows it, this will be important news for Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) and other Chinese tech companies. These companies are currently using H20 chips, which are almost six times slower than the latest H200 chips, produced by Nvidia.\n​The report also highlighted that the Chinese government, in the last week, called representatives from Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), ByteDance, and Tencent to assess the demand for H200 chips. Alibaba and other companies in China are keen on securing these latest chips due to their ability to train AI models faster and more efficiently.\n\n​That said, Wall Street has a mixed opinion on the stock. Recently, on December 9, Arete downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy with a $172 price target. However, earlier on December 2, Susquehanna reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $190 price target.\n​Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a technology company that operates primarily in e-commerce, cloud computing, and online payment services.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of BABA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nThe move followed signs that the Trump administration may advance plans to allow limited sales of Nvidia's H200 artificial intelligence chips to Chinese customers, according to a Friday press release and people familiar with the matter.\nInvestors appeared to view the review as a step toward potential approvals, after President Donald Trump earlier said sales could proceed if the U.S. government collects a 25% fee. He has argued the policy could help U.S. chipmakers stay competitive by limiting demand for domestic Chinese alternatives.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, has circulated license applications to the State, Energy and Defense departments for interagency review, sources said. The process is not public and timelines remain uncertain.\nQuestions also remain around how quickly approvals could be granted and whether Chinese authorities would permit local companies to purchase the chips.\nThe proposal has drawn criticism from lawmakers concerned about national security and the military use of advanced AI technology.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist Art Hogan joins Opening Bid with Brian Sozzi to talk about his expectations for the Magnificent Seven and the broader AI trade.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat is the future of the AI trade and how are you playing it next year? Art, is it Max 7 or bust for you?\n00:09 Art\nUh, it's not. and I'll tell you this. I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Intel vs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points TSMC is the undisputed leader in manufacturing advanced chips.\nIntel's stock outperformed in 2025 after the company was backed by some big investors.\nTSMC has a clearer growth path between the two companies.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nWhen it comes to chip manufacturing, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the undisputed foundry leader, while Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is trying to make inroads. However, in 2025, it was Intel's stock that outperformed, up nearly 80% as of this writing, compared to a 40% gain for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\nLet's look at which stock is set up to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC for short, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. Due to its technological expertise and scale, the company manufactures the vast majority of advanced chips, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) . It counts Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom among its top customers.\n\nIn chip manufacturing, the goal is to consistently push down node sizes, which refers to the transistor density of the chips. The more transistors that can be fit on a chip, the more powerful and energy efficient they become. However, producing advanced chips at scale is difficult, and TSMC's main competitors, including Intel and Samsung , have struggled with yields (the number of defects per wafer). Meanwhile, nearly three-quarters of its production is at 7nm nodes and below, and it is set to move to 2nm technology next year.\nGiven its position in the industry, TSMC is the go-to partner for chip designers. It works closely with companies like Nvidia to grow capacity to meet their projected demand. And, as the only foundry that can really make these advanced chips at scale with high yields, it has also garnered strong pricing power. The company is set to raise prices once again next year, while the cost of its new 2nm processing technology is forecasted to be 50% higher than its 2nm technology.\n\nTSMC is well-positioned to continue to benefit from the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout and sees AI chip demand growing by more than a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years.\nThe case for Intel Intel stock's outperformance in 2025 wasn't really a result of its operational performance. The company has struggled to grow its revenue, and it felt a lot of gross margin pressure in the first half of the year. However, it did see a huge rebound in adjusted gross margins in Q3, with it climbing from 18% a year ago to 40%. Revenue, meanwhile, edged up 3%.\n\nStory Continues\nThe biggest reasons for Intel's gains in 2025 were from the high-profile investments others made into the company's stock. Nvidia made a $5 billion equity investment in the company, while SoftBank invested $2 billion. Meanwhile, the U.S. government made an $8.9 billion investment. These investments, along with the 51% sale of its Altera business for $5.2 billion, helped Intel end Q3 with nearly $31 billion in cash on its balance sheet.\n\nThe company will use that cash to keep building out its foundry business and advance its chip manufacturing technology. Meanwhile, it is collaborating with Nvidia on new products, including integrating its central processing units (CPUs) with Nvidia's NVLink system to allow its CPUs to communicate more quickly with Nvidia's GPUs. This would help give Intel a nice advantage in the data center CPU market, where it has been losing share to Advanced Micro Devices . Separately, Intel is also working on its own AI chips designed for inference, and it is supposedly close to a deal with SambaNova Systems to further its efforts in this area.\nThe verdict Intel's 2025 performance was largely from events that won't repeat in 2026. For the company to outperform next year, it's probably going to need to win a large foundry customer or show major progress in data center chips, either with its CPUs or GPU efforts. That makes the stock more of a wildcard.\n\nTSMC, meanwhile, is the much safer choice. The company is set to benefit from the continued AI data center buildout, and its path forward is much clearer. As such, it's my pick to outperform in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

Earlier this month, the White House granted Nvidia permission to resume shipments of its H200 artificial intelligence chips to China, while also loosening restrictions on Intel and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ). Although the H200 is not Nvidia's most advanced product, it remains meaningfully ahead of Chinese-made alternatives. Research cited from the Institute for Progress suggests the H200 delivers 32% more processing power and 50% more memory bandwidth than Huawei's Ascend 910C, while also being cheaper to operate and more reliable, reinforcing its appeal for AI model training and deployment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nSupporters of the decision argue the policy could help slow China's domestic chip development by keeping Chinese customers dependent on US technology, while preserving revenue streams that US firms could reinvest into future semiconductor innovation. They point to concerns that Huawei may be closing the gap by linking more chips together and potentially expanding production next year. However, Commerce Department estimates indicate Huawei is expected to produce about 200,000 Ascend chips this year, compared with roughly 14 million AI chips deployed by US companies, raising questions about whether domestic supply can meaningfully satisfy Chinese demand. Under the current framework, companies must still apply for licenses to import H200s, and US officials have indicated the government would take a 25% cut of any such sales.\n\nCritics caution that allowing H200 exports could gradually chip away at what remains the US's largest advantage in AI: aggregate computing power. As of mid-2025, the US accounted for nearly three-quarters of global AI supercomputer capacity, compared with about 14% for China, a gap seen as critical for training frontier models. There is concern that Chinese authorities could direct imported H200s toward leading firms and, through civilian channels, into defense-related research, potentially accelerating advances in both commercial AI and military applications. With bipartisan support in Congress for tighter controls, lawmakers are expected to scrutinize the administration's assumptions on Huawei's progress and weigh testimony from AI developers and cloud providers on whether the current approach strengthens, or possibly undermines, long-term US competitiveness in artificial intelligence.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 Tailwinds and 1 Red Flag to Consider with Nvidia Stock Right Now\n\nChris MacDonald\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:54 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIn the world of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) is often the first company investors think of as pure-plays in this high-growth space.\nQuick Read Nvidia’s upcoming Rubin chips are expected to deliver multiple times the power of current Blackwell GPUs and launch next year.\nNvidia trades at 22x forward earnings despite strong growth projections.\nThe key risk is whether mega-cap tech companies eventually reduce AI spending as models mature.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThere's good reason for this. Nvidia's high performance chips power essentially all of the current AI development we're seeing at home (and much of what's being done abroad). That's simply because Nvidia has focused on making the highest-performance chips on the market, and these are specifically the most in-demand chips for companies looking to build out their own large language models or internal AI applications to drive operating efficiencies.\nThis is a massive market, and it continues to grow by leaps and bounds. Investors are clearly pricing in tremendous growth moving forward. So, with that backdrop, let's dive into what this could mean for Nvidia moving forward in terms of both tailwinds and headwinds in the years to come.\n\nKey Tailwinds to Consider Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\nPicking just two tailwinds for Nivdia is difficult, considering the fact that this is a company that appears to be firing on all cylinders. Indeed, the company's dominance in the world of data centers, cloud infrastructure and almost all high-performance computing markets is impressive.\n\nThat said, I think the company's rollout of its upcoming Rubin chips could be absolutely transformative for both Nvidia and the industry as a whole. Hyperscalers are demanding the biggest and best chips, and these Rubin chips are expected to deliver multiple times as much power as its current next-generation chips on the market (its Blackwell GPUs), which are selling very well by the way. If the sort of AI workloads many investors expect to see materialize, there's simply one chip most companies will look to build on top of, and that's the upcoming Rubin chip. Expected to be released next year, this will likely be a central driver of Nvidia's persistent market share (and potentially even growth) throughout the coming year.\nAnother key tailwind I think is important to touch on is the current dominance of Nvidia's chip lineup. Its newest Blackwell GPU platform integrates seamlessly with Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem, making it very costly for the company's clientele to switch to other platforms. That's a key point I don't think gets enough attention - Nvidia buyers are essentially \"locked into\" the Nvidia ecosystem at a certain point, as switching would be even more costly than simply buying more chips. And with the company's existing Blackwell and Hopper chips still dominating in terms of share and usage among both domestic and international clients (with other model chips produced for key markets like China), Nvidia really has found a way to penetrate the world stage.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Key Red Flag to Watch in 2026 A red flag\nI think 2026 could be the year where valuations start to matter once again. I say that, and I actually think that based on Nvidia's current growth rate, this stock is very cheap at just 22-times forward earnings .\nNow, the question of course will be whether the forward growth expectations currently priced in by the market play out. But if Nvidia is able to achieve its growth estimates for the coming year, and come in line with 2027 earnings expectations as well, this is a stock that very likely has much more upside ahead. That's the risk for any investor trying to talk about Nvidia's valuation absent some sort of significant event driving growth expectations significantly lower. Emphasis on the word significantly.\n\nThat said, I do think the key red flag for investors to watch is whether or not we get any sort of indication from the market that mega-cap tech companies are intent on dialing back their AI spending over any time frame. Indeed, this AI spending trajectory is being projected by many in the market to essentially continue for decades. But there are some in the market who believe that at some point, these models will be built and can likely be sustained on current chip supply. If that's the case, then companies like Nvidia developing the latest and greatest chips may not have the stranglehold on the semiconductor they once did - chips with lower performance could take more market share.\nWe'll see if such a scenario plays out, and I'm not saying that's my base case. But I do think some concern around this potential reality in the future is driving Nvidia's relatively low multiple right now, so it's something to watch.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Broadcom vs. AMD: Which AI Chip Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 7:45 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points AMD is looking to carve a niche in the inference market.\nBroadcom has a massive opportunity with custom AI chips.\nThe stocks trade at similar valuations.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nTwo of the top semiconductor companies looking to eat into Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure dominance are Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) . Both stocks have performed well in 2025, led by AMD, which is up more than 70% year to date, as of this writing, compared to about a 45% gain for Broadcom.\nThe question, though, is which stock will perform better in 2026. Let's look at the case for both stocks.\nThe case for AMD AMD is the distant No. 2 player in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market behind Nvidia. However, the company has carved out a nice niche in inference, where price-per-inference costs are more important than raw computing power, given its ongoing nature, and where Nvidia's CUDA software moat isn't quite as wide. Importantly, inference is also eventually expected to become a much larger market than training over time.\n\nMicrosoft has already been working on a toolkit to convert CUDA software code to AMD's ROCm in order to use more of AMD's GPUs for inference. Meanwhile, the company struck a partnership with OpenAI to deploy 6 gigawatts of GPUs, beginning with 1 gigawatt next year. As part of the deal, OpenAI is also taking a stake in AMD through warrants that vest based on deployment milestones. It also has a deal with Saudi Arabian company Humain.\nGPUs are not AMD's only business, however. The company is also the leading provider of central processing units (CPUs), both in computers and in the data center. While GPUs provide the muscle, CPUs act as the brain. The market isn't as large as the one for GPUs, but it is growing quickly, and AMD has been taking share in the data center space.\n\nThe case for Broadcom Broadcom is attacking the AI chip market much differently than Nvidia and AMD. Instead of making GPUs, the company helps customers design custom AI ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). These are preprogrammed chips that are hardwired for specific tasks, and as such, they can both perform better and be more energy efficient.\n\nBroadcom helped Alphabet develop its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which have led to other big hyperscalers (owners of massive data centers) becoming customers. It has said its three furthest along customers could be a more than $60 billion opportunity in its fiscal year 2027 (ending October 2027), and a fourth customer, Anthropic, has placed a $21 billion order for Alphabet's TPUs that it will fulfill.\n\nStory Continues\nIn addition, Broadcom is working with OpenAI, and it will deploy 10 gigawatts of custom AI chips, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to be completed before the end of 2029. There have also been reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on developing its own custom AI chips and that they could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nBroadcom also has a strong networking portfolio, which consists of components, such as Ethernet switches and routers, that help transfer data and distribute AI workloads across servers. This business has also been booming, given the ongoing data center build-out.\nThe verdict Both AMD and Broadcom trade at similar valuations. AMD has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 32 times next year's analyst estimates, while Broadcom trades at around 33.5 times its fiscal-year 2026 estimates (ending October 2026). As such, which stock outperforms will likely come down to their growth next year, as well as future expectations.\n\nI think both stocks can once again have strong performances in 2026, but I think Broadcom will be the stock that will outperform. The company just has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it over the next few years with custom chips. The custom chip business requires high upfront costs, so these are multiyear commitments, usually for large projects. Many of these deals are already in place (as seen in its $73 billion backlog), and now it just has to deliver.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Can This $2 Billion AI Investment Help Nvidia’s Secret Portfolio From Collapsing?\n\nRich Duprey\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 7:06 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWV\n\nNBIS\n\nAPLD\n\nSNPS\n\nkeypoints]\nNvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) owns a growing portfolio of strategic equity investments in companies supporting the broader artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, which is not widely discussed among retail investors.\nThis portfolio has expanded in recent years to focus on stakes in AI infrastructure providers such as CoreWeave ( NASDAQ:CRWV ), Nebius Group ( NASDAQ:NBIS ), and Applied Digital ( NASDAQ:APLD ) that align with Nvidia's goals of expanding data center capacity and GPU utilization for AI workloads. These investments have gained greater importance as Nvidia seeks to secure demand for its products during a period of rapid AI adoption. Yet, analysts are also expressing growing concern over the investments.\n\nNvidia's latest addition is a $2 billion stake in Synopsys ( NASDAQ:SNPS ) that could prove key in accelerating computing and AI engineering solutions by integrating Nvidia's accelerated computing technologies with Synopsys's electronic design automation tools.\nEcosystem Support Amid Rising Risks Nvidia's investments aim to support its core AI business by backing companies that drive demand for its GPUs. Through direct equity stakes and its venture arm NVentures, Nvidia has built positions in public companies like CoreWeave, its largest holding currently valued around $1.6 billion, alongside Nebius Group and Applied Digital. These infrastructure-focused companies provide cloud and data center services that rely heavily on Nvidia hardware, helping expand the market for AI training and inference.\n\nHowever, this approach has become a growing source of analyst criticism due to the appearance of circular financing. That is where Nvidia invests in customers who turn around and purchase its chips, giving the appearance of artificially inflating organic AI chip demand.\nAnalysts have drawn parallels to vendor financing practices during past tech bubbles, noting that such interconnected deals could mask underlying weaknesses if AI spending slows. Recent large investments have sharpened these critiques, with some viewing them as efforts to sustain an ecosystem as an AI bubble forms.\nDoes the Synopsys Investment Ease or Heighten Concerns? The $2 billion investment in Synopsys does little to alleviate these concerns. While not a direct data center operator like CoreWeave or Applied Digital, Synopsys benefits from deeper integration with Nvidia technologies, potentially increasing reliance on Nvidia GPUs for its accelerated simulations.\nSome analysts say that Nvidia's aggressive investment pace across the AI supply chain adds fuel to whether these stakes prop up demand rather than reflect independent market forces.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, the Synopsis partnership focuses on revolutionizing engineering and design. Nvidia's CUDA-X libraries and AI physics technologies seek to optimize Synopsys' applications for chip design, physical verification, molecular simulations, electromagnetic analysis, and optical simulation. The collaboration also advances agentic AI engineering, Omniverse digital twins for full-system simulations, and cloud access for GPU-powered tools.\n\nNvidia looks to shift compute-intensive workloads from traditional CPUs to its GPUs, enabling faster, more precise simulations at lower cost across industries such as semiconductors, aerospace, automotive, and industrial. The chipmaker's goal is to achieve broader adoption of its accelerated computing platform in engineering workflows that it previously couldn't achieve at scale. It could open new markets and reinforce its position in AI-driven innovation.\nA Relative Bright Spot in a Challenging Period Since the Dec. 1 investment, Synopsys shares have performed well compared to Nvidia's other holdings, with its stake rising 10.5%. Nvidia purchased the stock at $414.79 per share -- about 4.8 million shares -- causing an initial spike that led to an early 18% gain, though it has pulled back some from those highs.\n\nIn contrast, much of Nvidia's portfolio has declined sharply in the past month, with CoreWeave losing half its value since the end of Q3 and its other holdings coming under pressure from an AI sector correction. Synopsys is a relatively bright spot for the chipmaker during this period.\nKey Takeaway Beyond any stabilizing effect on its investment portfolio, the Synopsys partnership positions Nvidia to capture growth in engineering simulation markets that has become increasingly reliant on GPU acceleration. By enabling Synopsys tools to run orders of magnitude faster, Nvidia could drive incremental demand for its hardware in design workflows, contributing to sustained sales expansion.\n\nThis strategic investment supports Nvidia's long-term revenue and profit aims as AI permeates system-level engineering, even if it does not fully resolve concerns over allegations of circular financing.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

Hint: it's still AI. Or more so, the companies that will be physically building out and powering the AI infrastructure.\nHennion & Walsh CIO Kevin Mahn tells Julie Hyman how he is \"following the money\" and watching the companies that will ultimately become the true architects of the artificial intelligence buildout.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nKevin Mann's back with us. He says the best strategy to capitalize on that market trend is simple.\n00:03 Kevin Mann\nFollow the money.\n00:05 Speaker A\nIt's not that simple because you got to figure out where the money is going. But I like, but I like, uh, I like that that that summary of it. Um, I want to dive straight into some of the themes that you're looking at for this year because that's really what people are looking for right now.\n00:07 Kevin Mann\nAbsolutely.\n00:14 Kevin Mann\nYes. Sure.\n00:17 Speaker A\nUm, and I know that there are places that you're looking that are related to AI, but like many people, you're trying to look outside the the giants that have performed well from this so far.\n00:26 Kevin Mann\nYes.\n00:27 Speaker A\nAnd you're looking at AI infrastructure with the buildout continuing, but how do you play that now?\n00:31 Kevin Mann\nYes. Right.\n00:32 Kevin Mann\nSo, if the Godfather of AI, Nvidia CEO Jensen Wong\n00:37 Speaker A\nYes.\n00:38 Kevin Mann\nis correct, and his forecast for a three to four billion dollar spend, I'm sorry, three to four trillion dollar spend by the end of this decade on AI.\n00:45 Speaker A\nThree trillion over a decade, maybe.\n00:46 Kevin Mann\nYeah, we're already at 700 billion, but we still have so much more to go. Who's going to benefit from all that infrastructure spending? It's going to be the data center construction companies, whether it's the company like Acom or MCore.\n00:54 Speaker A\nMhm.\n00:55 Kevin Mann\nIt's going to be the electrical connectivity companies. It's going to be the cooling solutions companies and it's going to be the power solutions company. So I think about a company within that realm such as Comfort Systems, ticker symbol FIX. Their stock's up over 100% year to date.\n01:06 Speaker A\nWell, let me stop you right there. Cuz how much of that all that is priced in? Like everybody knows this stuff is getting built. Everyone knows who the vendors are. The stock is up 100%.\n01:07 Kevin Mann\nYes.\n01:13 Kevin Mann\nYep.\n01:13 Speaker A\nSo what's not priced in yet to something like that?\n01:16 Kevin Mann\nAll their backlog of demand, the additional data centers that are going to be constructed and the need for cooling solutions for those new data centers.\n01:22 Speaker A\nGot it.\n01:23 Kevin Mann\nI mean, Fix is only trading at a forward PE of around 34 right now. It's relatively reasonable for this space, right? But if you don't want to lean into the industrial sector, how about the utility sector?\n01:33 Speaker A\nYeah, power solutions part of this as well. I mean, that's really been and that's something that Jensen himself has talked about that the bottleneck, if there is one or the limiting factor on all of this, part of that could be power.\n01:34 Kevin Mann\nPower solutions.\n01:38 Kevin Mann\nYes.\n01:41 Kevin Mann\nWithout a doubt. The AI revolution comes to a complete halt without power. And if we're going to rely upon our country's antiquated power grid, it's only going to slow further. So these large cap technology companies aren't going to wait for our government to fix the power grid. They're going to work with the utility companies. They're going to work with the small modular reactor companies to supply them with the power that their data centers needs. And if you want to stay in the utility sector, which I'm very bullish about,\n02:00 Speaker A\nOkay.\n02:00 Kevin Mann\nhow about a company like Duke Energy? Duke Energy\n02:03 Kevin Mann\nwhich everyone knows\n02:04 Speaker A\nOne of the big legacy utility providers, yeah.\n02:06 Kevin Mann\nYes. They're trading at about 17 time forward earnings, not bad. They got a dividend yield of about 3.7%, not bad. But they also own and operate six nuclear power plants in North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 Top Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nHIMS\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nKey Points Amazon's cost-cutting could supercharge its profitability.\nHims & Hers has explosive long-term growth potential.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nWe're coming to the close of 2025, and it has been an excellent year for stocks. The S&P 500 is up by a healthy 14%, while the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite has jumped 18%, propelled by the growth of new industries like generative AI .\n\nLooking ahead to 2026, investors will want to have exposure to continuing AI momentum as well as diversification into other aspects of the economy. In my view, for those looking to add new stocks to their portfolios now, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) could make great options for a $500 investment.\nAmazon The generative AI boom is beginning to mature, and it might be time for investors to pivot away from pure-play hardware stocks like Nvidia and start choosing companies that can benefit from the technology, but that don't have all their eggs in one basket. Amazon is unusual because it has significant exposure to the lucrative AI infrastructure market while also having the ability to incorporate the technology into its daily operations.\n\nFor starters, Amazon is a significant partner with (and minority owner in) leading AI company Anthropic, which specializes in creating large language models (LLMs) similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Anthropic has quickly overtaken its rival in the U.S. enterprise LLM market, attracting a market share of 32% compared to OpenAI's 25%, mainly because of its reliability and security.\nAs an equity partner, Amazon will see the value of its stake in Anthropic grow as the company gets larger, providing it with a source of noncash income. Furthermore, Anthropic relies on Amazon's cloud computing platform , Amazon Web Services (AWS), to build, train, and deploy its models, so it's also providing steady income to the tech giant.\nAnd Amazon is making strides to incorporate generative AI into its own business. In June, CEO Andy Jassy released a memo saying that the new technology could allow the company to reduce its corporate workforce through efficiency gains. Then in October, Amazon slashed 14,000 jobs, potentially saving it billions of dollars.\n\nThat said, Amazon's image as the poster child of AI layoffs (even if not all of its job cuts are AI-related) could introduce reputational risks. Investors should watch the situation carefully over the coming months.\nHims & Hers Health With all the talk about AI, it may seem like there are no other growth opportunities in the market. But that isn't true. Telehealth is shaping up to be a generational megatrend.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to analysts at J.P. Morgan , the so-called \"Internet of Medical Things\" could enjoy a compound annual growth rate of 24% through 2030 as a growing proportion of routine healthcare visits for needs such as psychiatric care and regular appointments are done virtually.\nHims & Hers Health stands out in the telehealth space in part because of its edgy Gen Z and millennial-focused branding. Instead of just offering a service, it has turned healthcare into an experience, focusing on addressing personal and sensitive issues like sexual health, hair loss, and weight loss, which some patients might be less comfortable seeing a doctor about in person. It also offers long-established drugs like Viagra in easy-to-take generic forms such as chewable mints, which makes it even more discreet for consumers.\nBusiness is booming. Third-quarter revenue surged 49% year over year to $600 million. A growing number of users are turning to Hims & Hers for personalized treatment plans, relying on the platform to serve several of their healthcare needs.\nFor example, a patient might use the Hims & Hers platform for sexual health, mental health, and weight loss. As a one-stop shop, Hims can save significant time and money for its users.\n\nHims & Hers is growing at an impressive clip, but it is still struggling to generate significant profits. Its third-quarter operating income actually fell by around half to just $11.8 million, which was relatively low compared to its $600 million in revenue.\nThat said, investors shouldn't be too worried about this. Management is pouring hundreds of millions into marketing to establish its brand. This long-term focus on winning market share will probably turn out to be more beneficial than chasing short-term profits.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

Bernstein said Nvidia’s forward price-to-earnings multiple “has fallen by 27% through the year, currently sitting just a hair under 25x.”\nWhile that may not appear cheap in absolute terms, Bernstein stressed context matters.\n“For this company, 25x forward EPS would suggest the shares are trading in the 11th percentile of valuation over the last 10 years,” Rasgon said.\nRelative valuation appears even more compelling, according to the analyst.\nBernstein noted that Nvidia trades at a roughly 13% discount to the SOX index, placing it in “the first percentile,” adding that over the past decade, there have been “only thirteen days where NVDA’s stock traded cheaper relative to the SOX than it is trading now.”\n\nBernstein highlighted strong historical returns at similar valuation levels. “Investors buying Nvidia’s stock at current levels have historically done very well,” the firm said, adding that purchases below 25x forward earnings over the past 10 years delivered “average 1-year returns of over 150% with zero instances of a negative drawdown.”\nWhile acknowledging recent concerns around AI capex and GPU competition, Bernstein stated that “capex intentions look fine at this point” and argued the overall setup remains attractive, reiterating an Outperform rating and a $275 price target.\nRelated articles\nInvestors buying Nvidia stock at these levels have historically done well: analyst\nSilver's Bullish Pattern Points Higher — Keep an Eye on $52 Resistance Zone\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why This AI Stock Could Outperform Nvidia Over the Next 5 Years\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Nvidia is sold out of cloud GPUs.\nAMD and Broadcom could take market share from it in the data center segment.\nAll three chipmakers outsource much of their manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has led the artificial intelligence (AI) investing sector since 2023. While 2025 hasn't been quite as good a year for its shareholders as the previous two were, the stock is still up around 30% year to date. The chipmaker is still a dominant force in the AI realm, but observers are raising the possibility that its competitors could start taking meaningful market share away from it.\nShould Nvidia start to lose its edge over the competition, it may no longer be the best AI stock to own. But over the next five years, which stock could overtake it?\nDifferent approaches to the AI computing problem Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , which are computing units that can process many thousands of calculations in parallel. This makes them perfectly suited for tasks that require a lot of computing power and that can be broken down into many smaller tasks that can be handled independently. Most artificial intelligence workloads fall into that category. Nvidia's GPUs have been the most popular parallel processors available since before the AI infrastructure buildout started in 2023, but that may change.\n\nOne issue Nvidia is having right now is that demand is outpacing its supply. In its earnings release for its fiscal 2026 third quarter (which ended Oct. 26), CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. While some may view this as a good problem to have, I think it's a bit of an issue. Its clients' needs for AI accelerator chips aren't going to decrease just because Nvidia can't fully supply them. Instead, they are going to look for alternative solutions.\nThat could open up the door for competing chipmakers to steal some significant market share, particularly if buyers find that the alternative products provide similar performance with lower costs. Two chipmakers that appear poised to benefit are AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) .\n\nAMD is a direct competitor to Nvidia, as it also makes GPUs. It recently forecast that it would grow its data center revenue at a 60% compound annual rate over the next five years. For reference, its data center division's revenue growth was a mere 22% during Q3. For AMD to grow as fast as predicted, it will need to eat into Nvidia's market share, which it already might be doing.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom is taking a different approach to the AI computing problem. Rather than designing another general-purpose GPU, it's partnering directly with hyperscalers to design custom AI computing units -- called application-specific integrated circuits -- that meet their precise needs. Among the best examples of these chips are Alphabet 's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nTPUs and other custom AI computing units aren't designed to handle a wide variety of workloads like GPUs are. However, when these computing units only see the one type of workload that they are configured for, they can deliver higher performance at lower costs. The trade-off of lower price and higher performance for less flexibility is a no-brainer for many data center operators, and Broadcom's approach could eat into Nvidia's market share as AI workloads become more streamlined.\nThese companies have the potential to steal some of Nvidia's market share over the next five years, but all the chip designers all have one thing in common.\nTaiwan Semiconductor will rise regardless of which chip designers are winning None of these companies fabricates its computing units in-house. Instead, the \"fabless\" chipmakers outsource that work to a handful of other companies that specialize in fabrication. In the chip production realm, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) captures nearly all of the highest-end work. It's not only the largest chip manufacturer by revenue in the world, but also a leader in its ability to deliver the most advanced chips. Broadcom, AMD, and Nvidia often work with Taiwan Semiconductor for their cutting-edge chips, and that's unlikely to change in the future, as that industry is nearly impossible to disrupt.\n\nWith Nvidia projecting between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in data center infrastructure spending by 2030, all three of these fabless chip companies could have a significant market opportunity to capture. I'm not sure which will be the ultimate winner among them. Still, I know that TSMC will be a winner regardless, giving it a strong chance of outperforming Nvidia over the next five years, particularly if Nvidia loses a meaningful amount of market share to its peers.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Got $10,000? 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in December and Hold for the Long Term\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 3:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia remains one of the best-positioned companies in AI infrastructure.\nAlphabet has a major cost advantage over competitors.\nBoth stocks look poised to be long-term AI winners.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nIf you've got $10,000 to invest and are looking for some growth stocks to hold for the long term, splitting it between a couple of top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks can be a good idea. This is a bit of an aggressive strategy, although AI leaders have been leading the market higher for the past few years.\nLet's look at two AI stocks to invest in now for the long term.\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the king of AI infrastructure, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the primary chips used to power AI workloads. The company currently commands a more than 90% market share in the GPU space, thanks to the wide moat it has established through the ecosystem it has developed around its chips. This starts with its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code was written and optimized for its chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's recent acquisition of SchedMD, which developed an open-source workload manager for AI clusters called Slurm, only helps widen its software moat. Slurm is a software platform that helps determine which GPU is assigned to which tasks and when. By acquiring SchedMD, Nvidia gains control over this important AI orchestration layer, which it can then optimize for its chips and hardware and make for a seamless experience.\nIn addition to software, Nvidia has also created an edge with its networking portfolio. Its proprietary NvLink interconnect system can transfer data between its GPUs much faster than standard PCIe connections. It pools GPU memory and boosts data throughput, essentially letting its GPUs act as one powerful unit. This optimizes large language model (LLM) training and discourages vendor mixing and matching.\n\nAs AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia is one of the companies best positioned to benefit. It has seen rapid growth, but with the AI race still just in the early innings, it has a long runway of growth still in front of it.\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is another company that is positioned to be a huge AI winner. Ironically, the reason for this is that it has been able to break free of being completely reliant on Nvidia. Alphabet has designed its own custom AI chips that are optimized to work in its Tensorflow framework. It has been using these chips to run internal workloads for more than a decade, and they are now in their seventh generation. While other companies have developed their own custom AI chips, none are as far along or as battle-tested as Alphabet's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's TPUs provide a significant structural cost advantage over both cloud computing competitors and companies developing foundational LLMs, like OpenAI. As a preprogrammed ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), TPUs offer better price-performance and power efficiency, allowing Alphabet to train its Gemini models and run inference for them more cheaply than other models. It also gives its cloud computing business better margins for customers who choose to use its TPUs.\n\nGiven Alphabet's better economics, this creates a virtuous circle, as it allows it to pour more money into its chips and AI models, making them better and more attractive to customers. Alphabet also has the advantage of being able to infuse its constantly improving Gemini model throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Google search to its Android smartphone operating system to its worker productivity tools.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has huge advantages as search and generative AI discovery meld into one. Google is already the default gateway to the internet on most devices, and the company has a long-established history of monetizing search through its vast ad network. It also has decades of search and YouTube video history that cannot be matched.\n\nWith cost, distribution, monetization, and data advantages, Alphabet is in a prime position to be a long-term AI winner.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

At the outset, many pros were doubting that year three of this bull market could match the outside gains of the prior two.\n00:13 Speaker A\nBut the AI trade keeps driving attention and driving behavior. And on today's stocks in translation, we're not looking at the best performers of 2025. We are looking at the names that you, the viewers, checked in on the most on the Yahoo Finance platform. And we're breaking down our top 10 trending tickers of 2025.\n00:32 Speaker A\nSo let's take a look at the scores on the door. and here we got the top 10 tickers. The first thing you might notice is that this is an AI dominated list with maybe Bitcoin in the middle as the exception.\n00:46 Speaker A\nThen you're going to see the perennial favorites, uh that's Nvidia and Tesla to the left there. They are in a different zip code. Our Nvidia quote page has a cool quarter billion page views this year, while Tesla clocks in at over 180 million.\n01:03 Speaker A\nAnd while Apple is usually top three, it was edged out this year by Palantir with nearly 100 million views. And from there things stabilize as AMD, Amazon, Bitcoin, Meta, Super Micro and Intel, they all clocked 40 to 60 million viewers each.\n01:17 Speaker A\nNow, let's take a look at this list from a different perspective. This is our Yahoo Finance heat map and we're looking at the box size right here. So each box size corresponds to the market cap of the company and all of these are large to mega caps with two in the $4 trillion bucket. That would be Nvidia and Apple,\n01:36 Speaker A\nall the way down to Intel over here at 180 billion. and in the far lower right, you almost can't see it there. You can see Super Micro, which is just shy of $20 billion. But the other thing you might notice is that the only losing ticker this year is Bitcoin, although Amazon is pretty close to break even too.\n01:52 Speaker A\nSo each of these has a different story. Now let's dive into some of the charts that really uh tell this story and this is going to be a year-to-date. So we'll start with Nvidia here. This has arguably been the poster child for the entire AI trade and you can see it got kind of sucked into the post liberation day redness there, but it has bounced back strong.\n02:09 Speaker A\nReally hasn't done much over the last few months, but with 30% gains in a year after almost being up, what is it? a thousand percent over the last three years. There you go, 963%. I think investors are going to take that.\n02:19 Speaker A\nNow Tesla. Tesla's really interesting because over the last year, and this is a three-year chart too, it has traced out a cup and handle formation. If it can break above 480, it has the ability to really break out and 2026 could be the year to do this. If it fails at this level, well, maybe it's got to consolidate a little bit longer.\n02:37 Speaker A\nNow, let's take a look at Palantir. This stock is up 2,500% over the last three years. Let's dial down to a year-to-date and you can see like Nvidia, it hasn't really done much over the last few months, but still sitting on 140% year-to-date gains.\n02:50 Speaker A\nNow, Apple year to date, this stock is only up 9%, but it has come back nicely after it just kind of stalled out after the liberation day uh melee where a lot of stocks were taking off, it was going sideways, but it finally caught up over the last few months. and so Apple has been generating recent record highs even as Nvidia has been going sideways.\n03:07 Speaker A\nNow here's AMD to round out the top five, 71% year to date. This is a very volatile stock, but again, I think investors will uh happily hold on to gains like that for a stock like AMD.\n03:16 Speaker A\nNow, Amazon, barely positive for the year. This is a stock you kind of got to look at over this entire three-year bull market. Still up 150%, but this was a year of consolidation. We'll have to see if 2026 breaks to the upside or the downside.\n03:30 Speaker A\nAnd you know what? Bitcoin is a very similar story, sitting on more gains over the last three years, but this has been a year of consolidation. It happens to be down about 10% right now, and 75,000 is a line in the sand that I am watching. I think that gets hit before it takes off again.\n03:44 Speaker A\nThen Meta, this is another three-year story. Uh hasn't done much this year, but we'll have to see if it can continue the trend. 445%, very strong over this bull market.\n03:53 Speaker A\nGetting towards the end here. Super Micro is a very volatile stock and while it's up this year a decent percentage, you can see it was up a lot more in early 2024. So this is one of those high beta plays you got to trade with caution, but guess what, the Yahoo Finance audience loves to day trade this stock.\n04:06 Speaker A\nAnd finally here's Intel. This is another kind of uh sine wave pattern here. Let me just dial this down to year to date so you can see it has really taken off over the last few months. It's become a volatile stock, but it was doing nothing for the first 6, seven, eight months of the year. So I think investors at the end of the day, at the end of the year going to be pleased with this one.\n04:24 Speaker A\nSo let us dial it back down here. I got a few things that are going to tell us what to watch in 2026. So just think of these as the questions that move these tickers. First is the AI spend payback test. Investors are going to want to see the revenue and not just the profits of these uh companies, not just the spending.\n04:42 Speaker A\nAnd the next up is margins versus Mega Cap spending. Can these giants keep growing without the profit engine getting dented? Third, keep an eye on the chip cycle inflection point. Does demand for semiconductors, does it broaden out or is it just stay limited to AI?\n04:59 Speaker A\nFourth, watch those crypto regulation headlines. 2025 was arguably the best year ever for crypto regulation and Bitcoin isn't even positive. So let's see if sentiment can shift. And finally, monitor those rate cuts versus the real economy. If we get more cuts, ask why. Is it a soft landing scenario or are we sinking into recession?\n05:17 Speaker A\nBottom line, these were the tickers investors just could not stop watching in 2025. Next year, what matters is whether the stories hold up and that's where the rubber meets the road. And tune into the Stocks and Translation podcast for more jargon busting deep dives.

If history is any guide, stocks will keep pushing higher: Since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, rising 1.3% on average, data compiled by Citadel Securities show.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nWhile longer-term worries about the artificial-intelligence trade linger and valuations remain stretched, optimism over a strong economy and corporate profits is keeping investor sentiment upbeat. Traders are snapping up bullish options on chipmakers and large-cap technology shares, according to Susquehanna International Group, while the retail crowd remains avid buyers of US stocks.\n“Barring any major shocks, it will be hard to fight the overwhelmingly positive seasonal period we are entering and the cleaner positioning set-up,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s trading desk team including Gail Hafif wrote in a note to clients. “While we don’t necessarily see a dramatic rally, we do think there is room to go up from here into year end.”\n\nUS stocks bounced back Thursday after a cooler-than-expected — albeit controversial — inflation report bolstered prospects for more interest-rate cuts next year. Technology shares led the advance, with the Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index rising 2% and the Nasdaq 100 Index adding 1.5% after wobbling in the past five days.\nThat’s good news for derivatives traders who spent the last few days buying options wagering on a further rally in technology shares. They scooped up call spreads tied to Nvidia Corp., Micron Technology Inc. and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), while selling puts on megacap names including Alphabet Inc., Nvidia and Broadcom Inc., according to data compiled by Susquehanna.\n“This is a classic expression of confidence that declines will be shallow and temporary,” said Chris Murphy, Susquehanna’s co-head of derivatives strategy. “Investors were using the tech drawdown to increase exposure to AI, semiconductors and long-duration tech, not flee from them.”\n\nStory Continues\nThe broader backdrop for US equities remains constructive as well. Investors have put about $100 billion into US stocks in the past nine weeks, extending a steady trend of inflows seen throughout 2025, according to Goldman Sachs. A gauge of investor sentiment tracked by the firm is sitting at the most bullish level since April.\n\nRetail investors, the stock market’s biggest cheerleaders this year, are showing few signs of losing interest. Individual traders have been net buyers of call options on US stocks for 32 of the past 33 weeks, the longest stretch in Citadel Securities’ data.\n“Following a year of strong portfolio returns and record household wealth, retail participants enter 2026 with both conviction and balance-sheet capacity to increase market participation,” Scott Rubner, head of equity and equity-derivatives strategy at Citadel Securities, wrote in a note to clients Thursday.\nInstitutional investors have become more upbeat on the stock market as well, scooping up calls across the stock market and piling into sectors outside Big Tech in the past few weeks, Rubner added. Economically sensitive real estate and industrials stocks showed the strongest buy signal for a second consecutive week, he said.\n\nSubsiding volatility ahead of a seasonally quiet part of the year is adding another tailwind. The S&P 500’s 10-day realized volatility has dropped to one of its lowest levels of the year, a dynamic that could prompt volatility-targeting and trend-following funds to increase equity exposure.\n“We still think there is room for volatility to compress further,” Goldman’s trading desk wrote. “Lower levels of implied volatility mean more fuel for systematic re-leveraging.”\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

If you're bullish and want a simple, low-cost way to invest, SoFi lets you trade Nvidia stock with no commissions, and new users who fund their account can receive up to 1,000 dollars in stock . Plus, anyone who transfers existing investments to SoFi and keeps them there through December 31, 2025, can earn an additional 1 percent bonus, offering even more upside for new investors.\n\nNvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) has evolved from a graphics-chip manufacturer into the backbone of the modern artificial intelligence boom. As companies scale generative AI, autonomous systems and data-intensive cloud applications, Nvidia's GPUs have become central infrastructure powering these technological shifts. After soaring 171 percent in 2024 and adding another 26 percent in 2025, many investors are now weighing whether Nvidia's valuation still leaves enough room for meaningful future gains.\nDon’t Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel could be the next AI powerhouse — join 10,000+ early backers and invest now just $0.81 per share .\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here’s how you can earn passive income with $100 .\n\nThis forecast examines Nvidia's financial standing and uses a structured methodology to outline potential price targets for 2025, 2026 and 2030. By blending analyst sentiment, valuation metrics and algorithmic projections, it offers a clearer picture of where NVDA could be headed both in the near term and over the next decade.\nCurrent Overview Trading above 180 dollars as of October 2025\nMarket Cap: 4.37 trillion dollars\nTrailing P/E Ratio: 51.23\nGross Margins: near 70 percent\nYTD Performance: over 30 percent\nNvidia continues to report exceptional fundamentals, driven largely by its data center division, which remains the company's strongest revenue engine thanks to global AI demand from major technology firms and enterprise cloud platforms. Gross margins remain robust, earnings consistently exceed expectations and the company's leadership role in high-performance computing continues to set it apart from competitors.\n\nInvestor sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive. Out of 48 analysts, 43 rate Nvidia as a Buy or Strong Buy, reflecting strong confidence in its long-term prospects. The average 12-month price target sits around 209.97 dollars, with projections ranging from 100 dollars on the low end to 250 dollars on the high end. Still, valuation concerns linger, along with fears that competition from AMD, Intel and new AI-focused players could chip away at Nvidia's premium positioning.\n\nStory Continues\nQuick Snapshot Table of Predictions\n\nYear\nBullish Prediction\nAverage Prediction\nBearish Prediction\n2025\n183.13\n178.84\n173.92\n2026\n308.56\n207.13\n170.15\n2027\n566.89\n442.32\n285.19\n2028\n628.83\n537.29\n396.17\n2029\n873.74\n719.91\n493.76\n2030\n863.77\n799.05\n774.93\n2031\n1029.59\n950.43\n848.77\n2032\n1069.34\n1010.52\n920.01\n2033\n1226.54\n1127.95\n993.88\n2040\n2358.25\n2228.74\n2028.93\n2050\n6367.97\n5786.71\n5596.95\n\nThese forecasts are based on algorithmic modeling by CoinCodex, which assesses historical price movement, volatility cycles and long-term trend behavior across multiple time horizons.\nBull and Bear Case Bull Case The bull case for Nvidia centers on its unparalleled profitability and dominance across the AI supply chain. With net profit margins above 50 percent and gross margins holding near 70 percent, Nvidia remains one of the most financially efficient companies in the tech sector. Institutional support is strong, as shown by the overwhelming majority of Buy-rated analyst recommendations. Valuation multiples such as P/E and forward P/E have eased from their peak levels, suggesting healthier entry points compared to earlier years. Nvidia's low debt profile and consistent free cash flow growth further reinforce the thesis that it will continue to lead long-term AI infrastructure and data center expansion, giving bulls confidence in sustained multiyear upside.\n\nBear Case The bear case focuses on the early signs of slowing growth across key financial indicators. Earnings per share, net income and free cash flow are still rising, but at a noticeably slower rate than their three-year averages. Nvidia's valuation metrics, including PEG ratio, EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA, remain elevated relative to industry competitors, raising concerns that the stock may still be priced for perfection. The company's dividend yield is extremely low and recent growth in dividend payouts has stagnated, limiting appeal for income-driven investors. Bears argue that if financial momentum continues to cool and competition intensifies, Nvidia may struggle to justify the lofty expectations currently embedded in its share price.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction for 2025 Bullish Prediction: 183.13 dollars\nAverage Prediction: 178.84 dollars\nBearish Prediction: 173.92 dollars\nNvidia's 2025 outlook reflects cautious optimism, with modest upside expected if the company continues executing on its AI and data center roadmap. Its premium valuation signals strong confidence from the market, but it also leaves little room for disappointment. Any signs of slowing demand, regulatory pressure or margin compression could trigger volatility in the short term.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction for 2026 Bullish Prediction: 308.56 dollars\nAverage Prediction: 207.13 dollars\nBearish Prediction: 170.15 dollars\nThe 2026 projections suggest that Nvidia's long-term trajectory will depend heavily on its ability to maintain pricing power despite rising competition. Some models anticipate more moderate returns as valuations stabilize and GPU demand normalizes. However, Nvidia's entrenched position across cloud infrastructure and AI-driven enterprise ecosystems may provide resilience even in a cooling market, helping extend its revenue expansion through mid-decade.\n\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction for 2030 Bullish Prediction: 863.77 dollars\nAverage Prediction: 799.05 dollars\nBearish Prediction: 774.93 dollars\nBy 2030, Nvidia's growth story becomes tightly interwoven with the long-term strength of the AI revolution. If demand for accelerated computing continues its upward trajectory and Nvidia sustains leadership in next-generation architectures, the company could see substantial long-term appreciation. Conservative models still show meaningful compounding returns through the end of the decade. However, risks remain, including intensified competition, cyclical demand disruptions and greater regulatory scrutiny surrounding AI hardware.\n\nInvestment Considerations Nvidia remains a quintessential growth stock — a pure play on next-generation computing and AI hardware infrastructure. Institutional ownership is strong, and retail investor enthusiasm remains high, but these factors also reflect elevated expectations built into the current share price. While Nvidia pays a dividend, its yield is negligible, functioning more as an indicator of corporate strength than an income generator.\n\nKey risks include competition from AMD and Intel, the possibility of slowing AI adoption, regulatory headwinds and global supply chain constraints. Still, Nvidia's deep integration into cloud ecosystems, its unmatched GPU leadership and its alignment with long-term technological megatrends make it one of the most compelling — and scrutinized — companies in the global market.\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market When evaluating any stock price forecast, it's wise to think about portfolio balance and not rely on a single company's trajectory. Markets shift quickly, and putting all of your capital into one sector or stock can increase risk. Many investors are turning to platforms that open the door to real estate, professional financial advice, fixed-income products, and even self-directed retirement options. These tools make it easier to diversify, smooth out volatility, and build wealth across multiple asset classes over time.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nRange Wealth Management Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools . Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.\nSee Next:\nThe ‘ChatGPT of marketing' just opened a $0.81 per share round — 10,000+ investors are already in .\nGM-backed EnergyX is tackling the global lithium supply shortage — invest before global expansion at just $10 per share by October 30 .\nThis article NVDA Stock Price Prediction: Where Nvidia Could Be by 2025, 2026, 2030 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In the background, a powerful wave of diversification swept through the market as investors responded to the cracks appearing in so-called US exceptionalism by buying up European, Asian and emerging-market stocks.\nHere are six charts that capture some of the key episodes that reshaped equity markets in 2025:\n\nThe year started with investors maxed-out on American exposure and convinced US dominance was here to stay. But DeepSeek shook the status quo in the AI world, while President Donald Trump’s April tariff salvo all but spelled the end of the bull market that began in 2022. Still, as Trump dialed back his trade war, interest rates fell and the global economy showed resilience, investor confidence returned.\nThat didn’t spare US stocks from bearing the brunt of the selloff. And they never fully caught up with the rest of the world, held back by a weakening dollar. The greenback hasn’t clawed back its 13% slump in the first half, while a growing chorus of strategists has recommended international equities over their US peers.\nMSCI Inc.’s gauge of global stocks excluding the US is tracking its strongest outperformance over the S&P 500 since 2009.\nThe US flagship index is missing from the ranks of best-performing benchmarks, but it did still achieve decent enough gains of 14%. The nagging worry for investors has been the concentrated nature of those returns. “Bubble in the making” became a key concern this year, with some data echoing the early stages of excessive internet over-valuations. The tech sector’s weighting in the S&P 500 reached a record 36%, breaching the previous peak of 2000 leading into the dotcom crash, before retreating below 35%.\n\nA closer examination of this year’s trading reveals unprecedented levels of concentration behind the gains on Wall Street. Tech megacaps powered the rally all year long, with just five stocks accounting for nearly 45% of the benchmark’s returns: Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile excitement around AI has driven returns in the US and Asia, the story has been very different in Europe, a market crucially lacking tech stocks. Here, other thematics stepped to the fore. Banks led Europe’s rally, surging on the way to their strongest year since 1997, while governments’ defense, energy and infrastructure spending commitments lifted the names set to benefit from these outlays.\nThe upshot of all this is the widest dislocation in market leadership between the US and Europe ever seen. Value stocks inspired the advance in Europe, while growth equities led it in the US. This pushed investors into unchartered territory, as equity factors typically move in similar fashion.\nInvestors buffeted by April’s extreme turbulence could hardly have anticipated the relatively smooth ride they had the remaining three-quarters of the year. No drawdown exceeded 5% until November, with each dip enthusiastically snapped up at a rapid clip. The AI narrative, solid earnings and the leftovers from April’s sudden positioning washout encouraged investors to chase stocks steadily higher. The impressive rally stalled only as exuberance over AI was questioned in the final stretch of the year.\nStrong appetite for stocks has been accompanied by the destruction of volatility this year. Considering historical reset patterns for the VIX Index, it’s surprising how often the gauge managed to retrace a spike of 40% or more within a 10-day trading period. This didn’t happen at all before 2011, but has already occurred several times in topsy-turvy 2025.\nStock investors embraced the notion that volatility spikes have become increasingly short-lived. A new market logic appears to have taken hold: stocks panic, volatility gets bid, the risk event is resolved, gamma supply takes over and volatility quickly retreats.\nUS option volumes marked fresh highs, with two daily prints exceeding 100 million turnover this year for the first time. To emphasise the increased demand, trading volume was above 60 million daily contracts on 117 days compared to only 12 days in 2024.\nWhile hedging demand played a role in April and November, most of the time it was calls dominating the tape. With investors chasing the right tail as well as volatility sellers using ultra short-term contracts to earn income, the options market remains a key factor for stocks, contributing to the swift resets in volatility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meanwhile, the threat of competition from deep-pocketed heavyweights and upstarts like OpenAI and Anthropic weighed on software makers that are considered most at risk from challengers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nWith the bull market in US stocks stretching into a fourth year, there are more concerns than ever about the sustainability of heavy spending on AI computing and whether the returns will justify the investments.\n“There’s a lot of optimism around AI, but also a lot of hype,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. “2026 will be more about the proof of AI. What’s the ROI on the hyperscalers that have been spending? Will they see profit growth continue to accelerate?”\n\nHere’s a look at some of the biggest stock market stories for the tech industry in 2025 and the outlook for each in the new year.\nNeocloud Nerves\nNeoclouds, which are companies that provide cloud-computing services tailored to AI customers, were the rage for most of 2025. But heading into 2026 they look more like proxies for AI bubble risk.\nGrowing scrutiny over OpenAI’s lack of profitability has raised questions about its ability to pay for its massive spending commitments, including a cloud-computing deal with Oracle Corp. said to be worth $300 billion over five years. Oracle was expected to be a major beneficiary of AI growth, but its stock is down 45% since hitting a peak in September as its exposure to OpenAI becomes a major concern.\n“There is a lot of fear with OpenAI and the commitments it has made,” said Adam Rich, who helps oversee more than $17 billion in assets as deputy chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Vaughan Nelson. “People can only forecast what we know, and right now there’s a lot we don’t know. So long as that’s the case, it will be hard for companies like Oracle to regain their luster.”\n\nStory Continues\nOracle has other issues, including the amount of money it’s spending on data center leases, reported delays in some data center projects, and financing questions. Its growing debt load is particularly concerning to investors, as a measure of the company’s credit risk has skyrocketed to its highest level since the financial crisis.\n\nBeyond Oracle, neocloud provider CoreWeave Inc. has lost about two-thirds of its market value since hitting a high in June. And Nebius Group NV shares are down more than 42% from an October peak.\nBoring Tech\nInvestors discovered new AI trades in 2025 by following where the billions of dollars in pledged capital expenditures are going. You can see it just by looking at the top performers in the S&P 500 Index. Memory and storage company Sandisk Corp. leads the list, followed by Western Digital Corp, which makes hard disk drives, and its rival Seagate Technology Holdings Plc. Micron Technology Inc., the biggest US-based maker of memory chips, is fifth.\nThe trend is expected to continue in 2026 as capital expenditures keep growing. Investors are increasingly thinking about where the next wave is headed, with some eyeing beaten-down software stocks.\n“Things at the edge are interesting,” said Melissa Otto, who heads technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “There is this AI ecosystem that orbits around the AI infrastructure itself.”\n\nSoftware Slump\nSoftware stocks traded at attractive market valuations in 2025, but that did little to entice investors. Shares of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, companies were hit particularly hard. Much of the weakness reflects growing fears that the group will be disrupted by AI, as offerings from services like ChatGPT and Alphabet’s Gemini cut into demand or pricing power.\nAI represents “existential competition” for some software companies as “AI chatbot and agent dominance becomes the core battlefield,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a research note this week.\nCompanies like ServiceNow Inc., Adobe Inc., and Salesforce Inc. were among the weakest performers in the tech sector this year. A Morgan Stanley index of SaaS companies is down 10%, compared with a gain of 5% for a broader software index that includes perceived AI winners like Microsoft Corp.\nWhether software’s underperformance continues will be a key stock market theme in 2026. Some Wall Street pros already think it’s overdone. The SaaS group “is trading anywhere between a 30-40% discount relative to what its fundamentals would suggest,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note to clients late last month.\n\nPricey Got Pricier\nConcerns that nose-bleed valuations would hamper the ascent of some of 2024’s hottest stocks in 2025 proved misplaced. Palantir Technologies Inc. turned out to be one of the year’s best performers despite trading at more than 200 times estimated profits for much of the year. The stock’s 146% advance ranks eighth in the S&P 500.\nWall Street has long been skeptical of Palantir, mainly because of the stock’s lofty valuation. Of the 29 the analysts covering the maker of data analysis software, just nine rate the stock a buy. Still, the company is expected to expand at an enviable clip, with revenue projected to jump 43% in 2026 and 39% in 2027, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nElectric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. also overcame concerns about its valuation, which is by far the most expensive among the so-called Magnificent Seven. The stock hit a record this week despite trading at more than 200 times anticipated profits and facing a number of headwinds from slowing EV sales to concerns about safety.\n\nInvestors are optimistic about Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s vision of a self-driving car future and nascent push into robotics. After two years of stagnant revenue growth, Tesla’s sales are expected to expand 13% in 2026 and 19% in 2027.\nAll of which leaves the tech landscape heading into 2026 roughly where it was a year ago. Yes, the stocks are pricey. But the opportunities for growth are there. It’s up to the companies to deliver.\n“Expectations are high and valuations are expensive,” Ameriprise’s Saglimbene said. “That means they have more to prove, and they will really have to exceed expectations to move higher.”\n--With assistance from Phil Serafino.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Bitwise said Bitcoin’s volatility is expected to decline further in 2026, potentially dropping below that of Nvidia, one of the most actively traded and volatile stocks in the U.S. equity market.\nThe firm argued that Bitcoin’s investor base is evolving, with a rising share of ownership held by institutions and long-term allocators rather than retail traders.\nThat shift, Bitwise said, could dampen the sharp price swings that have historically defined the cryptocurrency.\nBitwise also said Bitcoin’s correlation with equities is likely to weaken.\nUsing rolling 30-day correlations, the firm noted Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 has rarely exceeded 0.50.\nEthereum, Solana and Institutional Adoption Beyond Bitcoin, Bitwise predicted that Ethereum and Solana will set new all-time highs in 2026, provided U.S. lawmakers pass the proposed CLARITY Act.\nThe firm said stablecoins and tokenized financial assets are “megatrends,” with Ethereum and Solana positioned as major beneficiaries.\nThis is expected to coincide with U.S. regulators approving a wave of new products.\n\nBitwise projected that more than 100 crypto-linked exchange-traded funds could launch in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published generic listing standards in late 2025.\nBitcoin Price Outlook Despite Bitwise’s longer-term optimism, some analysts remain cautious in the near term.\nValdrin Tahiri, an analyst at CCN, said Bitcoin’s technical structure remains bearish.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to Tahiri, Bitcoin has entered the fifth and final wave of a corrective decline after breaking down from an ascending parallel channel.\nAt the time of reporting, Bitcoin was trading at around $87,950, down nearly 5% over the past week.\nHowever, please note that market conditions remain volatile, and price projections are subject to change.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Will Hit All-Time High in 2026, Bitwise Predicts, Will Be ‘Less Volatile’ Than Nvidia appeared first on ccn.com .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

On December 15, Bernstein SocGen Group reiterated an “Outperform” rating on the stock with a $275.00 price target. Analysts at the firm are confident in Nvidia’s AI leadership long-term, even though the company is currently facing China export license delays for the H200.\nThe firm noted that once Nvidia receives these licenses, it will begin to assess demand requests and begin manufacturing. While it does already have some H200 related inventory, it doesn’t have all the required components. Moreover, it is also currently working with suppliers and manufacturers to assess production timelines.\nBernstein highlighted how Nvidia hasn’t even received the official paperwork surrounding the 25% governmental revenue share, which is why they are uncertain about how this will all be accounted for in financial reporting.\nWhile the company believes it is at least 2 years ahead of Google’s TPU program, it does acknowledge the strides Google has made in its 10 years journey.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Is Selling Nvidia and Buying This Other Magnificent Chip Stock Instead\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:52 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Philippe Laffont founded the hedge fund Coatue Management.\nCoatue's largest positions are in leading artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\nLast quarter, Coatue trimmed its exposure to Nvidia and rotated profits into Alphabet stock.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAbout halfway through every quarter, any institutional investment fund that manages more than $100 million is required to file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), documenting all the stocks that it bought and sold during the prior quarter.\n\nOne such firm that I monitor closely is Coatue Management, founded by Philippe Laffont. During the third quarter, Coatue reduced its position in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by 14% -- selling 1.6 million shares. At the same time, Laffont increased the fund's stake in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) by 259% -- acquiring 5.2 million shares.\nLet's explore what may have motivated these moves and assess if now would be a good time to follow Laffont's lead.\nIs selling Nvidia stock right now a good idea? When OpenAI released ChatGPT to the general public in November 2022, Nvidia's market capitalization was roughly $345 billion. Today, the company is worth $4.3 trillion -- making the chip designer the world's most valuable company.\nAccording to Coatue's filings, the firm has held some exposure to Nvidia stock since 2016. Given Nvidia's meteoric rise over the last few years, taking some gains from a winning long-term position off the table seems reasonable.\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia remains the eighth-largest position in Laffont's portfolio -- alongside other AI leaders such as Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Amazon , and Broadcom .\nIn my view, Laffont is employing prudent financial judgment by modestly reducing Coatue's allocation to Nvidia and rotating some capital into other growth opportunities.\nWhy might Laffont like Alphabet stock? Alphabet's trajectory throughout the AI revolution has been almost the opposite of Nvidia's. Following the release of ChatGPT, many on Wall Street started sounding the alarm that the rise of large language models (LLMs) and chatbots could spell the end of traditional internet search engines.\n\nThe bear thesis was real: Chatbots were expected to eat Google's lunch, and Alphabet was facing an existential crisis. It seems like the only people who didn't buy into this doomsday scenario were the executives in charge at Alphabet.\nOver the last three years, the company has quietly made significant progress across a number of different areas within the AI realm:\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet released its own LLM, called Gemini, which is now a fixture on the Google search homepage.\nBeyond its core advertising business, Alphabet has done a stellar job growing its cloud infrastructure business -- Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP has inked a number of high-profile deals with major players including OpenAI and Meta, proving it can compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, which have larger shares of the cloud market.\nAlphabet is also a strategic investor in OpenAI's top rival, Anthropic. As part of their relationship, Anthropic is using Google Cloud to meet some of its computing power needs. Their deal includes access to Alphabet's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\nLastly, Alphabet is one of the leaders in the autonomous driving space; its Waymo self-driving taxi service is operating in several U.S. cities.\n\nI think the biggest selling point for Alphabet is its vertically integrated business model. The company's various assets in search (Google), streaming video (YouTube), consumer electronics (Android), cloud computing (GCP), autonomous vehicles (Waymo), and now custom hardware (TPUs) all share a common thread: artificial intelligence.\nLaffont may be hedging his portfolio away from pure-play semiconductor and data center businesses while seeking exposure to broader pockets of the ongoing AI infrastructure movement.\nIs Alphabet stock a good buy right now? Among the cloud hyperscalers, Alphabet's stock is still the cheapest by forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, though it has in recent months climbed back to near parity with Microsoft.\nThe caveat from the analysis above is that Alphabet has clearly experienced a meaningful valuation expansion over the last couple of months, while the valuations of Amazon and Microsoft have both compressed a bit.\nI think there are two primary factors driving the increased buying.\nFirst, Laffont isn't the only big-name investor betting on Alphabet stock. Warren Buffett also initiated a position in Alphabet last quarter. In addition, a growing number of technologists are beginning to propose that application-specific integrated circuits -- including Google's TPUs -- could pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the AI accelerator realm.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investors have flocked to Alphabet, which was trading at reasonable valuations relative to its megacap tech peers. While I think Alphabet remains a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity, there are a couple of important points to think about before jumping into the stock.\nAfter its recent run, Alphabet stock is no longer such a bargain. Moreover, the bull thesis around its opportunity in the chip landscape is currently somewhat theoretical.\nNevertheless, I think following Laffont's lead here could prove wise. If you've owned Nvidia stock throughout the AI revolution, then odds are you're sitting on a nice gain. It might not be a bad choice to take some profits and buy into other emerging players such as Alphabet as the AI infrastructure buildout continues to accelerate.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "These AI Stocks Could Surge in December as Momentum Builds\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points The AI hyperscalers are planning on spending a record amount on capital expenditures during 2026.\nNvidia and AMD are sparring for GPU supremacy.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a neutral party in the AI build-out.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWith December rolling toward its close, there are a few stocks that I think could surge before the end of the month. While the market may be growing a bit weary of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade, the reality is that hyperscalers are going to be spending more than ever on AI computing power in 2026. This benefits a handful of companies in an outsized way, and some of those that have already been the biggest winners from that spending are positioned to keep prospering in 2026.\nThree such stocks that I think could surge to end the year are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\nNvidia Nvidia has been a top-performing artificial intelligence stock since the buildout began in 2023. While there have been some impressive technologies developed over the past few years, we've only scratched the surface of what generative AI is capable of. As a result, hyperscalers are planning on record-setting data center capital expenditures in 2026 after setting new spending records in 2025. Nvidia is one of the primary beneficiaries of this spending because its graphics processing units (GPUs) provide a significant chunk of the computing power that goes into these data centers.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are best in class, in part thanks to the technology stack that supports them. It continues to deliver impressive quarter after impressive quarter, and the third quarter of its fiscal 2026 (which ended Oct. 26) was no exception. Revenue rose by 63% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose by 67%. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs was so high that CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs.\nAI data center buildouts aren't expected to slow down anytime in the near future: Nvidia's management believes that by 2030, global data center capital expenditures will reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion. Nvidia may be down a bit heading into 2026, but assuming that the expected spending will occur, it should be an excellent stock to buy now.\n\nAMD AMD hasn't had nearly as much success of Nvidia in the AI arms race. While its GPUs aren't far off in performance from Nvidia's, its supporting technology has lagged, specifically its controlling software. However, AMD has made a few acquisitions and inked some partnerships that have improved its supporting products, and management believes it can turn the company's fortunes around and make a big splash in the AI computing world.\n\nStory Continues\nOver the next five years, management believes the company can grow its data center business at a 60% compound annual growth rate. That would be a massive increase from the 22% growth that segment achieved in its most recently reported quarter. AMD will have a long way to go to prove that it is capable of delivering growth that rivals Nvidia's, but if it can, the stock should perform impressively.\n\nI think the market may start to recognize this shift in fortunes, causing AMD's stock to rise in the last few days of December.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Both Nvidia and AMD design chips, but neither manufactures them in-house. Instead, like many other \"fabless\" chipmakers, they farm that work out to several companies. In the case of the most cutting-edge chips, that work mostly falls to Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's largest chip foundry by revenue. Taiwan Semiconductor is a genius investment because it doesn't matter whether it's Nvidia, AMD, or some other designer offering the best computing solution -- the foundry is still positioned to benefit from their sales. All that really matters to Taiwan Semi is that the AI hyperscalers are spending more and more.\n\nAdmittedly, its status as a neutral player in the AI buildout can limit its overall upside. However, based on the growth projections for the AI infrastructure market, I'd be surprised if Taiwan Semiconductor weren't a top-performing stock over the next five years.\nIt's also much cheaper than the GPU designers, trading at 28 times expected forward earnings.\nI'm a huge fan of Taiwan Semiconductor and its invaluable position in the AI space, and believe the market may reward it heading into 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Financial industry companies that may see profits climb due to higher interest rates led the advance.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4% to 25,610.50, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.5% to 3,895.75.\nIn Seoul, the Kospi climbed 0.5% to 8,628.70.\nTaiwan's index gained 0.9%, while the Sensex in India dipped 0.2%.\n\nOn Thursday, European indexes gained after the Bank of England cut its key interest rate and the European Central Bank kept its rate steady .\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.8% to 6,774.76, and broke a four-day losing streak . The Dow added 0.1% to 47,951.85, and strength for tech stocks sent the Nasdaq composite up a market-leading 1.4%, to 23,006.36.\nSome relief came from a report showing that inflation was lower last month than economists expected. That could soothe nerves at the Fed, which is responsible for keeping inflation low and for keeping the job market strong.\nInflation is still higher than anyone would like, at 2.7% last month, but if it creeps closer to the Fed’s target of 2%, Fed officials could feel more free to cut interest rates to help a slowing job market . Wall Street loves lower rates because they can boost the economy and prices for investments, even if they may also worsen inflation.\n\nThursday’s inflation update may not move the needle much at the Fed given how noisy economic reports have been following the U.S. government’s shutdown. Next month’s update on inflation could provide a better gauge of what’s actually happening.\nAlso helping to drive gains was Micron Technology, a maker of memory and storage for computers, which rallied 10.2% after reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\nBillions of dollars are flowing into artificial-intelligence technology, which helped superstar stocks like Nvidia lead the market for years.\n\nStory Continues\nBut questions are rising about whether those stock prices shot too high and whether customers will get a good-enough return on their AI investments through bigger profits and productivity. Worries are also weighing on companies that are borrowing lots of money amid the AI frenzy.\nOracle added 0.9% and Broadcom rose 1.1%. They have been at the center of such concerns recently. Nvidia, the chip company that’s become Wall Street’s most influential because of its immense size, gained 1.8%.\n\nAnother winner was Trump Media & Technology Group, which jumped 41.9% to trim some of its steep loss for the year so far, 69.3% coming into the day. The company, which began with President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform and then moved into cryptocurrencies and various other lines of business, is now moving into nuclear power.\nIt’s merging with TAE Technologies in an all-stock deal, and each company will own roughly half of the combined business.\nIn other dealings early Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 16 cents to $55.84 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 21 cents to $59.61 per barrel.\nThe dollar rose to 156.08 Japanese yen from 155.53 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1719 from $1.1723.\nThe price of bitcoin rose to about $86,900.\n___\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Stan Choe contributed.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana To Hit All-Time Highs In 2026, Bitwise Predicts\n\nKhyathi Dalal\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:31 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nETH-USD\n\nSOL-USD\n\nNVDA\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nAsset management firm Bitwise expects 2026 to be a breakout year for crypto, with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ), Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH ), and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL ) all pushing to new all-time highs as institutional forces reshape the market.\n\nWhat Happened: In its 2026 Outlook, Bitwise argues the traditional four-year crypto cycle is fading.\nInstitutional adoption, spot ETF flows, on-chain growth, and a pro-crypto regulatory shift are now more powerful drivers than halving's or leverage-fueled boom–bust cycles.\nBitcoin, the firm says, is on track to become less volatile than mega-cap tech stocks like Nvidia, reflecting a broader, more institutional investor base.\nETFs are accelerating Bitcoin's transition into a mainstream, de-risked asset, and that trend should intensify in 2026.\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nETFs Absorb Supply As Institutional Demand Surges\nBitwise's core thesis is that ETFs will buy more than 100% of the annual new supply of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have already absorbed nearly twice the amount of BTC mined since launch.\nWith firms like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Vanguard opening ETF access, institutional demand is expected to overwhelm new issuance.\nBitwise also predicts half of Ivy League endowments will gain crypto exposure, following early moves by Brown and Harvard—an important signal given the $870 billion endowment pool.\nThe firm also forecasts over 100 new crypto-linked ETFs in the U.S., ushering in an \"ETF-palooza\" as regulatory clarity improves.\nSee Also: The ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\nCrypto Equities, Polymarket Lead The Next Wave\nCrypto equities are expected to keep outperforming traditional tech. While major tech stocks are up around 140% over three years, crypto equities are up over 500%, driven by revenue growth, M&A, and regulatory tailwinds.\n\nBitwise also sees Polymarket open interest hitting new all-time highs, surpassing 2024 election levels as it expands beyond politics into sports, culture, and macro markets.\nOn-chain vaults—often called \"ETFs 2.0\"—are expected to double in assets as Wall Street capital moves on-chain.\nWhat's Next: Bitwise expects Bitcoin's correlation with equities to fall further in 2026. As regulation, ETF flows, and institutional adoption take centre stage, crypto-specific fundamentals, not stock market swings, should increasingly drive performance.\n\nStory Continues\nImage: Shutterstock\nTrending Now:\nWall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share .\n\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery . With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\n\nThis article Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana To Hit All-Time Highs In 2026, Bitwise Predicts originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "A Top Small-Cap AI Stock to Buy Now and Into 2026\n\nBeth McKenna, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:05 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Preformed Line Products stock seems to fly under the radar of many investors.\nThe Ohio-based company is growing at a healthy clip, is profitable, has significant insider ownership, and maintains a clean balance sheet.\nThe company has been largely operated by the same family since its founding in 1947 and even pays a modest dividend.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nSmall-cap stocks are those with market capitalizations ranging from $300 million to $2 billion. These stocks, as a group, should be viewed as higher-risk/potentially high-reward investments.\nSome of them will likely turn out to be huge long-term winners. After all, many great-performing large-cap stocks started as small caps. Nvidia stock was a small-cap stock just over 20 years ago, and now the company is the leading maker of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, boasting a market cap that's the largest on the S&P 500 index at a whopping $4.2 trillion.\nSmall caps have powerful growth potential because it's easier for smaller companies to grow earnings faster on a percentage basis than it is for larger companies -- and percentage earnings growth essentially drives stock-price performance.\n\nHowever, the stocks of smaller companies tend to be riskier and volatile. Only investors with higher risk tolerances should consider investing in small caps.\nHere is a small-cap stock that I believe has the potential to remain a long-term winner and grow into a large cap: Preformed Line Products (NASDAQ: PLPC) .\nThis company is profitable, which isn't all that common in the small-cap space. Moreover, it also pays a modest dividend, which is relatively rare among small caps.\nPreformed Line Products: A top small-cap stock to consider buying for 2026 Company\nMarket cap\nForward P/E Ratio\nWall Street's Estimated 5-Year Annualized EPS Growth\nYear-to-Date 2025 Stock Return\n5-Year Stock Return / 10-Year Stock Return\nPreformed Line Products\n$1.05 billion\nN/A. Trailing P/E = 28.4\nN/A\n68.8%\n246% / 471%\nS&P 500 Index\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\n16.6%\n96.6% / 302%\n\nData sources: Yahoo! Finance and YCharts. P/E = price to earnings . EPS = earnings per share. Data to Dec. 18, 2025.\nAI-driven electric grid upgrades and global expansion are growth drivers Preformed Line Products, founded in 1947, describes itself as a \"designer and manufacturer of products and systems employed in the construction and maintenance of overhead and underground networks for energy, communications, and broadband network companies.\" It's a global company with locations in 20 countries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Ohio-based company's customers include power utilities, telecommunications network operators, cable television and broadband service providers, as well as construction contractors.\nPreformed Line Products should receive a long-term boost from the increasing adoption of AI worldwide. The electric grids in the United States and other countries must be significantly upgraded and expanded to support the growing power demand related to AI. That said, it's a positive in my mind that PLPC's products and services cater to several industries and end uses, and that the company is not a pure play on AI or the electric grid.\n\nSignificant insider ownership and involvement of the family of the founder in running the business One of the main factors I like about this stock is that the same family has been actively involved in running the company since its founding 88 years ago by engineer Thomas Peterson. Robert Ruhlman is the executive chairman, having transitioned from CEO in early 2024. His son, J. Ryan Ruhlman -- who is the great-grandson of the founder -- is president and a board member.\n\nThe Ruhlman family has a significant stake in the stock -- so its interests are aligned with those of shareholders. Insiders own from about 31% to 48% of shares outstanding. (Data varies by source, with reputable sources having different percentages.) Nevertheless, this entire range represents a significantly higher insider ownership percentage than investors typically find in the vast majority of stocks.\nPLPC stock will likely be somewhat volatile in the short term, along with other stocks connected to AI. But the Ruhlman family is obviously running this business with long-term performance in mind. As such, it's a good stock for long-term investors.\nSolid financials In the third quarter, Preformed Line Products' revenue increased 21% year over year to $178.1 million. Growth in the United States was driven by strong performances in both the energy and communications end markets. The international segments also grew, driven by higher energy product sales as well as incremental communication market sales from the company's recently acquired JAP Telecom.\n\nIn May, the company acquired JAP Telecom, a Brazilian designer and manufacturer of connectivity solutions for the South American telecommunications infrastructure market. At that time, CEO Dennis McKenna (no relation to me) said, \"Not only does this strategic acquisition expand our communications product offering, it also enhances our ability to serve the unique infrastructure needs of customers across South America and the globe.\"\nIn Q3, Preformed Line Products' net income adjusted for one-time items was $10.3 million, or $2.09 per share, up 36% year over year. The adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growing faster than revenue indicates an expanding profit margin.\nThe company has robust cash flows, another factor that I particularly like. Cash generated from operations was $18.9 million, up 102% year over year. Free cash flow (FCF) was $8.5 million, a solid result especially considering PLPC is using cash to build a new, larger, and more modern facility in Poland. The company ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $72.9 million and long-term debt of $31.3 million.\n\nSpeaking of the new facility being built in Poland, it's only roughly 215 miles by highway to the border with Ukraine. Once the Russian-Ukrainian war ends, Ukraine's critical infrastructure will need significant rebuilding. This includes energy and communications infrastructure, which are PLPC's core end markets. This is just my speculation, but it seems reasonable to predict that the company could get some of this rebuilding work.\nPreformed Line Products' current dividend yield is about 0.39%. While this is modest, even a modest dividend can make a big difference in an investor's return over the long term when it is reinvested.\nIn the earnings release, Executive Chairman Robert Ruhlman shared good news on the subject of tariffs:\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Exclusive-US launches review of advanced Nvidia AI chip sales to China, sources say\n\nBy Alexandra Alper\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:38 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBy Alexandra Alper\nWASHINGTON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has launched a review that could result in the first shipments to China of Nvidia 's second-most powerful AI chips, five sources ​said, making good on his pledge to allow the controversial sales.\nTrump this month said he would ‌allow sales of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, with the U.S. government collecting a 25% fee, and that the sales would help keep ‌U.S. firms ahead of Chinese chipmakers by cutting demand for Chinese chips.\n\nThe move drew fire from China hawks across the U.S. political spectrum over concerns the chips would supercharge Beijing's military and erode the U.S. advantage in artificial intelligence .\nBut questions have remained about how quickly the U.S. might approve such sales and whether Beijing would allow Chinese firms to purchase ⁠the Nvidia chips.\nReuters reported last week that ‌Nvidia was considering an increase to production of the H200, the immediate predecessor to its current flagship Blackwell chips, after initial orders from China outstripped the current capacity.\nThe U.S. ‍Commerce Department, which oversees export policy, has sent license applications for chip shipments to the State, Energy and Defense Departments for review, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the process is not public.\n\nThose agencies have 30 days to weigh in, ​according to export regulations, with the ultimate decision falling to Trump if agency officials disagree. The start of ‌the inter-agency licensing review has not been reported previously.\nThe Commerce Department and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA White House spokesperson did not comment on the review, but said \"the Trump administration is committed to ensuring the dominance of the American tech stack – without compromising on national security.”\nU.S. HAD BANNED H200 SALES TO CHINA\nWhile the H200 chips are slower than Nvidia's Blackwell chips at many AI tasks, they remain in wide use in the industry ⁠and have never been allowed for sale in China.\nTrump had previously ​opened the door to sales of a less-advanced version of Nvidia's ​Blackwell chips, its cutting-edge offering, but backed away from the move and approved sales of the H200 instead.\nLed by White House AI czar David Sacks, several members of the Trump ‍administration now argue that shipping advanced AI ⁠chips to China discourages Chinese competitors like Huawei from redoubling efforts to catch up with Nvidia and AMD's most-advanced chip designs.\n\nStory Continues\nTrump's move represents a dramatic reversal from his first term, when he drew international ⁠attention by cracking down on Chinese access to U.S. technology, citing claims that Beijing steals American intellectual property and harnesses commercially obtained technology ‌to bolster its military, which Beijing denies.\n(Reporting by Alexandra Alper; Additional reporting by Stephen Nellis and ‌Karen Friefeld; Editing by Peter Henderson and Jamie Freed)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This \"Magnificent Seven\" Company May Now Be Winning the AI War\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:52 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nAMZN\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points After ChatGPT took some of its search traffic, Alphabet rebounded by introducing AI Overviews and AI Mode.\nAlphabet's Gemini 3 is considered a leading LLM.\nManagement will increase the tech giant's capital expenditures in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIt's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world in significant ways, and the major hyperscalers are all investing hundreds of billions of dollars in their efforts to capitalize on the trend. Companies like Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are all developing robust AI businesses that are driving the charge, and companies like Nvidia and Broadcom are providing key parts of the hardware infrastructure that supports the technology.\n\nIf 2025 was a year of expansion, 2026 could be a year when those companies' investments start showing results, and when that happens, Alphabet could be a big winner.\nMore AI for more people The current types of large language models (LLMs) were first introduced to the public through OpenAI's ChatGPT three years ago, but Alphabet has actually used similar tech to power its Google search engine for years. However, the ChatGPT launch changed the AI landscape and led to a new LLM race, and Alphabet now offers its own generative AI services.\n\nAlthough it looked for a time like Google was in danger of losing its dominance in search as more people just asked questions to ChatGPT and had it do the legwork, Alphabet has responded effectively by rolling out its own competitive LLMs, and it flipped the script by offering AI Overview and AI Mode on its search pages. Recently, paid clicks have been accelerating, and Alphabet's revenue is soaring. Sales increased 16% year over year in the third quarter, with strong performances across the business.\nToday, its operation includes a broad spectrum of products and services, including YouTube, Android, Waymo autonomous vehicles, and others. Google Search remains its core business, but there's a lot more going on. Its varied revenue streams will provide it with diverse growth drivers in 2026 and beyond.\n\nHowever, of particular importance recently is the Google Cloud Platform. Alphabet's cloud services are where its clients engage with generative AI to create their own apps and agents, and cloud services revenue increased 34% year over year in Q3. The accelerating pace of growth in this area implies that the opportunity to create with AI is attracting more clients to the cloud, and Alphabet's newest LLM, Gemini 3, has been rated the top LLM to use right now according to several leaderboards. Gemini has 650 million active users, and the company is capitalizing on its strong user base to monetize these services.\n\nStory Continues\nNot just LLMs Beyond its robust LLMs, which may be winning the LLM wars at least for now, and its search feature, which still holds a market share of about 90%, Alphabet has other AI products that are driving growth. It designs its own AI accelerator chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it uses to train and power its LLMs, along with the Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that most of its rivals are using today.\n\n\"Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products, is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said.\nAlphabet has made several important deals recently for its TPUs, which are specialized chips designed for deep learning and inference workloads, in contrast with Nvidia's more general-purpose GPUs. TPUs give Alphabet an edge in AI development, especially as LLMs become more sophisticated and need more of this kind of processing power to deliver the results users want. Alphabet signed a key partnership with Anthropic, which makes the popular Claude LLM, and is rumored to be in talks with Meta to supply it with chips.\nMore in store for 2026 On the Q3 earnings call, management told investors that it expects to spend between $91 billion and $93 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, up from its previous forecast figure of $85 billion. It also plans a \"significant increase\" in capex in 2026.\nThe results of all this spending are already showing up in accelerated cloud growth, accelerating paid clicks, and higher overall sales, and those trends could get even better next year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Does Philippe Laffont Know Something Wall Street Doesn't? The Billionaire Investor Just Sold Nvidia and AMD, and Bought These Other Chip Stocks Instead\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points During the third quarter, Coatue Management reduced its exposure to GPU leaders Nvidia and AMD.\nAt the same time, the firm dramatically increased its stakes in Alphabet and Marvell Technology.\nPhilippe Laffont is making sure his fund has positions across the entire semiconductor landscape.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWithin 45 days of the end of each quarter, every institutional investor managing over $100 million is required to file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings itemize which stocks they bought and sold during that quarter. This provides everyday investors with a glimpse -- though a delayed one -- into what the \"smart money\" on Wall Street is doing.\nDuring the third quarter, Philippe Laffont's firm, Coatue Management, made a number of interesting moves. It trimmed its exposure in semiconductor leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) by 14% and 19%, respectively. In addition, Laffont more than tripled the fund's stakes in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) .\nLet's break down what may have influenced these decisions and assess if Laffont could be onto something big.\nNvidia and AMD dominate the AI chip market Nvidia and AMD are the two leading designers of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the most widely used parallel processing chips for training large language models and building generative AI applications.\nThe rise of generative AI has ushered in a wave of unprecedented revenue and profit growth for chip designers. Shares of Nvidia and AMD have skyrocketed by nearly 900% and 200%, respectively, throughout the AI revolution.\nManagement consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting that investment in AI infrastructure will reach nearly $7 trillion over the next five years -- with the majority of that spending allocated toward building data centers and chip procurement.\nWith that in mind, it seems likely that the hyperscalers will continue accelerating their AI capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Given these secular tailwinds, the prospects surrounding Nvidia and AMD appear bright.\n\nThis begs the question: Does Laffont see something the rest of us don't?\nUnderstanding Alphabet and Marvell's positions in the chip market One of the biggest catalysts for Alphabet right now is its cloud infrastructure business. Google Cloud has attracted a number of high-profile customers, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms .\nMoreover, the company's custom-designed AI processors -- which it calls Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- are becoming a key part of the value proposition around its AI ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile GPUs and other specialized parallel processors get most of the attention among AI investors, there's a lot more that goes into a data center. Marvell can provide much of it: The company specializes in designing architecture for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) computing stacks, as well as other networking, security, and storage hardware.\nAs AI workloads become larger and more sophisticated -- requiring enhanced memory and storage processes -- demand for the offerings of players like Marvell should rise further.\nThe bottom line: The semiconductor opportunity is broadening While analysts appear optimistic about Alphabet's TPU business, these chips are heavily geared toward custom applications such as deep learning. Meanwhile, Marvell is carving out its own pocket in the AI realm focused on data centers' memory storage needs.\nIn my view, Laffont's moves during the third quarter look more like a structural mix shift than a reflection of souring sentiment toward AI GPUs. What I mean by that is the billionaire smartly reduced his fund's exposure to general-purpose chip designers such as Nvidia and AMD and rotated capital into other specific segments of the AI space.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a broader point: Laffont still has significant exposure to the GPU market. It's not as if Coatue completely dumped its stakes in Nvidia and AMD.\nDuring the third quarter, he merely increased his bets on other areas of the chip market beyond generic accelerators. The construction of Coatue's portfolio suggests the firm is quite bullish about the continuing expansion of AI infrastructure. It appears that Laffont is trying to capitalize on this trend by building a diversified portfolio around the proliferation of chips and their various applications in AI.\nAt the end of the day, I think building positions in the major players across GPUs, custom chipsets, memory architecture, and more will prove to be a winning investment strategy in the long run.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Up 400%, Down 70%: Why a $5 Million Bet on Ramaco Resources Signals Long-Term Conviction\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 3:25 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: METC\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Austin-based Beck Capital Management added 151,835 shares of METC in the third quarter.\nThe value of the position increased by about $5 million from the previous period.\nThis marked a new holding for Beck Capital, which did not report holding METC shares in the previous period.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nOn November 14, Austin-based Beck Capital Management disclosed a new position in Ramaco Resources (NASDAQ:METC) , acquiring 151,835 shares valued at approximately $5 million, according to its latest SEC filing.\nWhat Happened According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated November 14, Beck Capital Management disclosed a new stake in Ramaco Resources (NASDAQ:METC) . The fund purchased 151,835 shares during the third quarter, reporting a position valued at $5 million as of September 30. This acquisition accounts for 1.2% of the fund’s $433.8 million in U.S. equity holdings.\n\nWhat Else to Know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: NVDA: $32.3 million (7.5% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: META: $16.1 million (3.7% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AVGO: $14.5 million (3.4% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: MSFT: $14.5 million (3.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: VRT: $11.6 million (2.7% of AUM)\nAs of Thursday, shares of Ramaco Resources were priced at $14.41, up 34% over the past year and outperforming the S&P 500, which is up 15% in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nRevenue (TTM)\n$579.5 million\nNet Income (TTM)\n($32.9 million)\nDividend Yield\n2%\nPrice (as of Thursday)\n$14.41\n\nCompany Snapshot Ramaco Resources operates a portfolio of mining assets across key Appalachian regions, supplying metallurgical coal to major steel producers in the U.S. and abroad. The company produces and sells metallurgical coal, with operations spanning multiple mining properties in West Virginia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. It generates revenue primarily through the extraction and sale of coal to domestic and international steel producers, and coke plants -- serving blast furnace steel mills and coke plants in the United States, as well as global metallurgical coal consumers.\n\nFoolish Take What matters most for long-term investors here is not the stock’s violent swing, but whether the underlying business is becoming more durable at the bottom of the cycle. This move reflects a willingness to look past near-term price action and focus on balance sheet strength and optionality.\n\nRamaco’s third-quarter results show why that matters. Despite weak metallurgical coal pricing, the company ended September with record liquidity of $272 million and a net cash position of more than $77 million, its strongest balance sheet on record. Cash costs remained firmly in the first quartile of the U.S. cost curve at $97 per ton, and adjusted EBITDA came in positive at $8.4 million even as benchmark coal prices declined.\n\nMore importantly, Ramaco is no longer just a coal story. Management is accelerating development of its Brook Mine in Wyoming, where it plans to produce roughly 3,400 tons per year of rare earth and critical mineral oxides, a 175% increase from prior expectations. That transition is backed by capital, not leverage, which lowers execution risk relative to smaller resource peers. In portfolio context, this position is modest at about 1.2% of assets, far smaller than core mega-cap technology holdings. That suggests a measured, asymmetric bet rather than a speculative swing. For patient investors, the volatility may be the price of accessing a business with both cyclical recovery upside and a credible path into strategic minerals.\n\nStory Continues\nGlossary 13F reportable assets: The U.S. equity holdings that investment managers must disclose quarterly to the SEC on Form 13F.\nAssets under management (AUM): The total market value of investments that a fund or firm manages on behalf of clients.\nStake: The ownership interest or share that an investor holds in a company.\n\nDividend yield: A financial ratio showing how much a company pays in dividends each year relative to its share price.\nMetallurgical coal: A type of coal used primarily in steel production, not for electricity generation.\nBlast furnace steel mills: Industrial facilities that use blast furnaces to convert iron ore into steel, often requiring metallurgical coal.\nCoke plants: Facilities that process coal into coke, a fuel and reactant used in steelmaking.\nOutperforming: Achieving a higher return or growth rate compared to a benchmark or index.\nPosition: The amount of a particular security or asset held by an investor or fund.\nFiling: An official document submitted to a regulatory authority, often disclosing financial or ownership information.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Morgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nMoz Farooque\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 3:03 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nMS\n\nNVDA\n\nWhen parallels are drawn between a company and Nvidia , investors pay attention.\nThat’s exactly how Morgan Stanley framed Micron Technology’s ( MU ) latest quarter, calling it one of the biggest revenue and profit surprises in the history of the U.S. chip space, second only to Nvidia’s AI-powered surge.\n\nMicron delivered another solid double beat, extending a streak dating back to fiscal Q3 2023. Additionally, over the past six months, the stock has increased by 109% and 200% year-to-date .\nFollowing the blow-out quarterly results, the firm bumped its price target on Micron stock to $350 from $338 while reiterating an Overweight rating .\nIt also hailed it as their top U.S. semiconductor pick, another feather in the tech giant’s cap. For perspective, with Micron stock trading near $254 (at the time of writing), pointing to nearly 38% upside from current levels\nThough the headline numbers were impressive, it was Micron’s guidance that reset expectations across the memory space.\nMicron forecasts earnings of over $8 per share, roughly double what Mr.Market expects as AI demand continues outpacing supply, signaling a major shift in memory pricing power.\nWhere Micron fits in the AI hardware stack Micron Technology (MU) fills a critical gap in the AI ecosystem that’s often misunderstood.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nInvestors hope good news from Nvidia gives the rally more life\nPalantir CEO Karp just settled major debate\nSpotify just solved a major problem for listeners\nAmazon lawsuit could be a warning to other employers\n\nIt specializes in the production of memory chip s, which function differently from the “brains” of a computer.\nSo, if Nvidia’s GPUs are essentially the brain doing all the thinking, Micron’s chips provide the short-term and long-term memory that enables those chips to function efficiently.\nAI systems are storing, moving, and recalling colossal amounts of data all the time, which is where Micron’s role becomes mission-critical.\nMicron manufactures two key products in DRAM and NAND .\nDRAM is a quick, short-term memory, which is like a work desk, and it also commands premium pricing.\nRelated: Veteran analyst makes jaw-dropping call on Tesla stock\nOn the other hand, there’s long-term storage, such as a filing cabinet, which holds AI data, cloud files, and photos at scale.\n\nWhat sets Micron apart is its AI-specific memory .\nModern AI data centers require significantly more memory per server compared to traditional systems, which must be faster, denser, and more power-efficient.\nFor perspective, AI servers such as AWS’s P5 pack a whopping 2 TB of RAM compared to 256 GB on a common general-purpose server (nearly 8 times more memory per box ).\nMorgan Stanley calls Micron’s quarter nearly unprecedented Morgan Stanley’s bullish take was not on Micron beating expectations, but it was on how decisively it reset them.\nIn his note, analyst Joseph Moore talked about how Micron’s guidance came billions of dollars above consensus.\nRelated: Bank of America sets AI stocks to buy list for 2026\nAt the same time, he argued that earnings power moved to levels that we've rarely seen in our memory.\n\nThe scale of the upside points to something a lot more structural compared to a one-off pricing bump, which points to a tightening in supply along with robust AI-driven demand.\nHowever, Moore also sounded the alarm over margin expansion, noting that Micron’s implied EBIT margins are pushing at a pace that tech players have historically struggled to sustain.\nAccording to Seeking Alpha , Micron’s current EBIT margins on a trailing-twelve-month basis are at a lofty 26% , 323% higher than the sector median.\nThat strength comes from a power-packed combo of water-tight DDR5 pricing, improving visibility in high-bandwidth memory , along with unusually disciplined capital spending.\nPerhaps just as important is that demand signals appear to be as durable as ever.\n\nMicron's Earnings snapshot (Q1 FY2026) at a glance Non-GAAP EPS: $4.78 , a $0.82 beat vs. consensus.\nRevenue: $13.64 billion , topping estimates by about $760 million , according to Micron .\nQ2 FY2026 revenue guide: $18.7 billion ± $400 million (vs. $14.23 billion consensus).\nQ2 gross margin guide: 67% ± 1% (GAAP) / 68% ± 1% (non-GAAP) .\nQ2 EPS guide: $8.19 ± $0.20 (GAAP) / $8.42 ± $0.20 (non-GAAP) (vs. $4.49 consensus).\n\nWall Street maps out Micron’s long-term upside Micron’s strong quarterly performances and even healthier outlooks effectively lit a fire under price targets, with analysts leaning harder into the “AI memory shortage” narrative.\nNeedham: $300 (from $200), pointing to nearly 33% upside , on the back of a tightening memory market along with firmer DRAM pricing linked to AI demand.\nWedbush: $300 (from $220), also pointing to 33% upside , as data-center buildouts keep the pressure up on high-end memory supply.\nKeyBanc: $325 (from $215), or roughly 44% upside , backing an Overweight rating on fast-growing AI-driven demand and improving cycle visibility.\nBofA Securities: $250 (from $180), a more cautious 11% upside , while maintaining a Neutral rating, on the back of the memory upcycle.\n\nMicron’s CEO says the memory cycle has fundamentally changed Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra just said that AI-driven memory crunch isn’t just a 2025–2026 blip , but a multi-year structural shortage , impeding its ability to supply its clients.\nIn doing so, Mehrotra jacked up Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM), total addressable market forecast to nearly $100 billion by 2028 , a couple of years earlier than previous estimates. ( up from nearly $35 billion in 2025) .\n\nIn other words, the HBM opportunity is now expected to blow past the entire DRAM market from a few years ago.\nWhat’s even more telling is that Micron has locked in clients for its entire 2026 HBM supply, including the next-generation HBM4.\nThat suggests hyperscalers treat memory as more of a strategic resource than a commodity.\nAlso, later in the Q&A, Mehrotra outlined that Micron can currently meet just 50% to two-thirds of demand from most of its marquee customers, reinforcing the strength in the company’s pricing power and tightness in AI infrastructure.\nRelated: Facebook makes daring move to challenge Disney, Netflix\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 18, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Michael Burry Asks For Photos Of Warehoused Nvidia GPUs After Analyst Questions Jensen Huang's Blackwell Shipment Numbers (UPDATED)\n\nAnanya Gairola\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:31 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nGM\n\n^IXIC\n\nEditor’s Note: This story has been updated to provide additional clarity on Nvidia GPU dies shipped in 2025.\nOver the weekend, Michael Burry , the investor made famous by \"The Big Short\" for forecasting the 2008 housing collapse, asked for evidence of stockpiled Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) GPUs.\n\nThis development came after an analysis on X questioned whether Jensen Huang's statement about Blackwell shipments aligns with the company's reported revenue and U.S. data-center capacity.\nBurry Joins Debate Over Nvidia's Blackwell Shipments Burry's statement came after a detailed thread on X from a user known as Kakashii ignited fresh scrutiny around Nvidia's latest GPU generation.\nThe user, who introduced themselves as an attorney on social media, questioned Huang's statement that six million Blackwell GPUs have already shipped.\n\nHuang said in October 2025 that demand for Nvidia's chips is still surging, noting that the company has shipped 6 million Blackwell GPUs over the past four quarters, reported CNBC.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nAt the time, he also stated that Nvidia expects a combined $500 billion in GPU sales across the Blackwell line and next year's Rubin generation.\nAccording to the analysis shared by Kakashii on X, Nvidia's reported $111 billion in data-center revenue since Blackwell launched does not appear to support that shipment volume.\nEven after factoring in the more than $10 billion Nvidia disclosed in the 2024 fourth-quarter Blackwell revenue, the thread argues the numbers only account for roughly 4 million units, leaving a potential gap of hundreds of thousands to millions of GPUs.\n\nPower and Data-Center Capacity Add Another Layer Of Questions The thread also pointed to the enormous energy requirements of running Blackwell chips.\nIf 6 million GPUs shipped and 65% to 70% were deployed in U.S. data centers, they would require 8.5 to 11 gigawatts of power — roughly equivalent to the electricity capacity of Singapore, the analyst said.\nHowever, the U.S. only added an estimated 8.5 gigawatts of data-center-usable capacity between 2024 and 2025, the user noted. That assumes every new facility uses only Nvidia hardware and no Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) or Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google chips.\nEven then, the user argued, the power supply barely matches the stated GPU shipment volume.\n\nStory Continues\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nBurry Calls For Receipts: ‘Calling For Pics And Proof' Sharing the thread, Burry urged X users to send him photos or proof of Nvidia GPUs being stored \"in mass quantities\" in the U.S. or overseas.\n\"Some have reached out to me,\" he wrote, adding, \"it is getting interesting. But I need more.\"\nNotably, the bar chart shown at Nvidia's GTC DC in October reflected 6 million GPU dies shipped in calendar year 2025.\nA footnote on the slide noted that the Blackwell and Rubin architectures use two GPU dies per chip. As a result, while 6 million GPU dies were shipped, the total came to 3 million complete GPU packages.\n\nDespite Nvidia's Pushback, Burry Says His Bearish Thesis Still Holds Up Last month, Burry doubled down on his bearish view of Nvidia, reaffirming his analysis on X just hours after the company privately pushed back his past claims. Burry argues the company's $112.5 billion in buybacks added no real shareholder value and only offset stock-based compensation.\nMeanwhile, analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo defended Nvidia, saying concerns about rising Days Sales Outstanding and inventory levels misunderstand the company's sales patterns and preparation for new Blackwell chips.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged 31.88% so far this year, outperforming both the Nasdaq Composite's 22.29% gain and the Nasdaq 100's 22.49% rise.

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Title": "Which AI Chip Stock Is the Better Buy for 2026: Nvidia or Alphabet?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b56db8d9-9245-3055-866c-62eb8454ddb5/which-ai-chip-stock-is-the.html",
      "Content": "Which AI Chip Stock Is the Better Buy for 2026: Nvidia or Alphabet?\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:05 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia continues to grow rapidly, thanks to its leadership in artificial intelligence (AI) data center chips.\nAlphabet has a full AI stack, and could now add its TPU chips to the equation.\nBoth look like long-term winners, though the better buy could depend on the investor.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe stock market is witnessing a technological arms race playing out in real time. Companies are racing to build the data centers and other infrastructure to support artificial intelligence (AI), which experts believe could create trillions of dollars in economic value over the coming decades.\nInside these data centers are massive clusters of chips, which work together to train and operate AI models. The AI chip conversation begins with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , the company that has dominated this market from the jump.\nHowever, tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has emerged as a potential competitor after successfully training its AI models with custom-built TPU chips it designed in-house.\nWhich AI chip stock is the better buy heading into 2026?\nNvidia's AI dominance creates a high ceiling, but a lower floor Thus far, developing AI has required massive quantities of chips. Nvidia's leadership in the AI chip market has translated to explosive revenue and profit growth for the company since early 2023. Some experts believe Nvidia's market share in the data center GPU chip space is as high as 92%.\nAs long as hyperscalers continue to build out this infrastructure, it's hard to see Nvidia's business slowing down anytime soon. In fact, Nvidia announced that it has booked $500 billion in orders for its Blackwell chips and their looming successor, Rubin, through the end of next year, with $150 billion of that already delivered.\n\nThis data center boom has been highly lucrative. Nvidia now has deep pockets to develop and prepare for emerging AI opportunities outside of data centers, such as autonomous vehicles and humanoid robotics. That said, data center chip sales have become nearly the entirety of Nvidia's business. If data center investments dry up, Nvidia would struggle to fill those holes, and the stock would likely collapse.\nAlphabet's AI ecosystem makes it the safer bet For as much money pouring into AI data centers as there is, the group of companies cutting the checks, the AI hyperscalers, is relatively small. Among them is Google's parent company, Alphabet. Rather than relying on Nvidia's chips to power its AI models, Alphabet has worked diligently to develop its own custom-built tensor processing units, or TPUs, designed specifically for Google Cloud's machine learning workloads.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet successfully trained its newest Gemini model on its TPUs. It went so well that the company is considering selling its TPUs to other AI hyperscalers, such as Meta Platforms . Alphabet probably won't challenge Nvidia's market leadership, but the TPU represents additional upside to Alphabet's complete AI ecosystem. It's icing on an already delicious cake.\n\nThe stock already has a high floor due to its lucrative advertising and cloud computing business segments. Even if Alphabet never sells its TPUs to another company, they still provide a crucial cost benefit, saving Alphabet from spending billions of dollars on third-party chips. At this point, it appears that Alphabet has a significantly higher floor than Nvidia.\nThe winner? It depends Does that make Alphabet the better buy? Well, it sort of depends on the style of investor you are. If you want maximum upside, it's hard to beat Nvidia, which has proven to possess the foresight needed to dominate the AI opportunity from the beginning. Even if other companies begin encroaching on the data center market, Nvidia will likely remain a key player in the AI field, including future applications.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a business that is a bit more diversified and stable, Alphabet may be a better fit for you. The company has multiple established business units and still offers exposure to new industries, like autonomous driving and quantum computing, through its smaller divisions.\nThe good news? Both stocks trade at attractive valuations, based on the market's expectations for their future earnings growth.\nA higher anticipated growth rate accompanies Nvidia's higher price-to-earnings ratio, though things can change quickly if the AI investment cycle ends prematurely.\nUltimately, it's hard to go wrong with either company as a buy-and-hold AI investment for 2026 and beyond.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "LIVE\n\nStock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq jump after cooler CPI inflation reading as AI trade reignites\n\nKaren Friar , Brett LoGiurato and Ines Ferré\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 1:01 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\n^DJI\n\nGOOG\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\nUS stocks rebounded on Thursday as investors digested easing inflation pressures from the latest reading on consumer prices that could help set expectations for the path of interest rates.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) led the way up with a gain of 1.4%, pushed north by a strong earnings report from Micron ( MU ), which saw its shares rise 10%. The tech gain came after AI trade worries had spurred another bruising session for tech on Wednesday.\nShares in the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and the blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose around 0.8% and 0.2%, respectively.\n\nHeadlining the morning was a cooler-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed inflation rose 2.7% in November over the prior year and 2.6% on a \"core\" basis — both figures coming in below economist estimates of 3% and 3.1%, respectively.\nAs with Tuesday's monthly jobs report , economists have noted that the inflation data may be less reliable than normal thanks to the US government shutdown . At the same time, the Federal Reserve seems more attentive to cracks in the labor market than to price pressures. On Wednesday, Fed governor Chris Waller signaled support for rate cuts before the release of the CPI update.",

      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Invest $1,000 in Right Now\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 1:00 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nSOUN\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's growth is likely to outpace analysts' expectations in 2026, as it now has an opportunity to sell its chips into the Chinese market.\nSoundHound AI's ability to continue delivering impressive growth on the back of its solid backlog should help the stock regain its momentum.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nIt has been another good year for the stock market, with the S&P 500 index entering the third year of its bull run a couple of months ago. Despite a shaky start to the year, major indexes quickly found their footing and are up impressively in 2025 as of this writing.\nThe Nasdaq Composite index is up almost 20% this year, indicating that technology stocks have enjoyed another decent year. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index is also sitting on healthy gains of 16%. The good news for investors is that the S&P 500 index is expected to hit a level of 7,500 after a year, according to HSBC, a potential upside of 10% from current levels.\nDeutsche Bank has a more ambitious S&P 500 forecast of 8,000 by the end of 2026. HSBC points out that artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to play an essential role in driving the stock market higher in 2026. That's why it would be a good idea to take a closer look at AI stocks that are playing a key role in this industry and can soar higher in the new year.\n\nAssuming you have $1,000 in investable cash at your disposal after meeting your expenses, clearing high-interest loans, and saving for a rainy day, it may be a wise move to put that money (either individually or combined) into the two AI stocks discussed in this article.\nLet's see why these two names could be big winners in 2026 and beyond.\nRecent developments indicate that this AI giant is on track for a blockbuster year AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has delivered respectable returns of 31% in 2025. However, 2026 could turn out to be a much better year for the chipmaker, as it is likely to witness stronger demand for its chips.\nNvidia already has a massive data center order backlog of around $290 billion for 2026. That's well above the $167 billion data center revenue that Nvidia generated in the past year. What's more, President Donald Trump's announcement that Nvidia will now be able to sell its advanced H200 chips into the Chinese market has the potential to add $30 billion to Nvidia's top line next year.\n\nExport restrictions imposed on the sale of Nvidia's chips to Chinese customers weighed on the company's business earlier this year. However, the demand for its data center graphics processing units (GPUs) in that market remains robust. Reuters reports that Chinese tech giants ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba are looking to place large orders for Nvidia's H200 GPU, which is six times more powerful than the H20 chip it was selling into that market earlier this year.\n\nStory Continues\nTherefore, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia's earnings grow at a faster pace than the 59% jump to $7.45 per share that analysts are estimating for next year. The potential access to the Chinese market could boost Nvidia's revenue by an additional 10% next year (based on the $316 billion consensus estimate), and that could give its earnings growth a nice shot in the arm.\n\nAll this explains why analysts expect a 42% increase in Nvidia's stock price in the coming year based on its median 12-month price target of $250. It could ultimately outperform expectations, which is why it would be a good idea to put your investible cash into the chipmaker.\nThis beaten-down stock could make a solid comeback in 2026 SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has had a forgettable 2025. Shares of the AI voice solutions company have lost 46% of their value this year after a phenomenal 2024. However, the 12-month median price target of $16 suggests that the stock could rise 48% in the next year.\nWhat's worth noting is that SoundHound's financial performance has been solid this year. The midpoint of the company's 2025 revenue guidance stands at $172.5 million, which is just over double its 2024 revenue. SoundHound's impressive growth is a result of its expanding customer base, which is seeking to integrate voice AI solutions into its operations to capitalize on the productivity and efficiency gains offered by this technology.\n\nFrom smart devices to restaurants to vehicles to financial services, SoundHound is gaining traction in multiple areas. Additionally, its agentic voice AI solution is gaining traction among customers serving various industries, as management remarked on the November earnings call. SoundHound, therefore, is making solid progress in a market that's expected to clock annual revenue of $41 billion in 2030, growing at an annual rate of 24%.\nThe fact that SoundHound's growth is outpacing the broader market is an indication that it is winning a bigger share of this space. As a result, its top-line growth could be much better than the 38% increase to $233 million that consensus estimates are predicting for 2026.\nThe only problem is that SoundHound is trading at a costly 32 times sales. However, its growth rate is solid enough to justify that valuation. More importantly, SoundHound is capable of maintaining a high growth rate thanks to a huge contractual backlog worth $1.2 billion at the end of last year. As such, there is a strong possibility that SoundHound stock will regain its momentum in 2026, which is why it seems like a good idea to buy it with your investible cash while it is beaten down.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Why don't we start here? It's a few you select. Start off with Deepseek, Dan.\n00:05 Dan\nYeah, I mean this was a a almost catastrophic moment uh for the AI industry when Deepseek announced uh that they trained their R1 model on less than state of the art chips. It sent everybody into a tizzy about whether or not anyone needed high-powered GPUs anymore and so that really was probably the worst point for the company this year. Lost almost $600 billion uh in their market cap. But it turned out, they actually people uh companies do need those high-powered chips to run those models. So, uh they're still being trained on high-powered chips and now they're also continuing to be run. In fact, uh CEO Jensen Wong made the case that you need even more powerful GPUs to ensure you get better results out of those types of models. So it was an interesting kind of shift there. Uh other highlights from the year, this maybe not a highlight, maybe a little bit of a low light was when uh President Trump banned the company from selling its H20 chip into China. And that was obviously a huge deal because it wiped out essentially the uh revenue from that country. Jensen Wong has pointed out that roughly 50% or more of the world's AI developers are based in China. Uh he's made the argument that it's important for the country of China to be reliant on US technology to allow for US technological supremacy. And so he's been countered by uh Hawks and Washington who say, look, you cannot give uh China these kinds of high-powered chips or at least the highest powered chips that Nvidia has because it will eventually trickle in to the Chinese military. Uh of course, we've seen the kind of on again, off again, you know, will they, won't they with the H20 chip. Eventually President Trump said, hey, you know, you can sell it. give us 15% though. Uh, China though said, just no, we don't want those chips, telling companies not to use them. And so there's been little revenue out of China uh since then, except for now where the H200 comes in. That's Nvidia's Hopper chip. It's a a highlight uh for them for the year where they are now able to or soon will be able to sell that chip into China. And so it's a big deal for Nvidia because it means once again, that tap will start flowing. Again, it has to go through uh all the correct processes to eventually be able to ship them. President Trump just kind of said this uh in a Truth Social post. Uh said that he's talked to uh Xi Jinping uh in China and that he was happy about it. Uh but nothing really concrete has gone through yet. However, it is a positive for Nvidia to be able to sell that chip eventually. And then, uh you know, we'll see what happens when they come out with their next generation Vera Rubin chips, whether that means that uh the prior generation of Blackwills will be able to uh go into China. It all kind of remains to be seen. Um there was one other point when the company hit $5 trillion in market cap. That could be a positive for them. I don't know.\n03:13 Speaker A\nUh Dan, so all right, so Deepseek, H20, H200, what about Dan also another moment on the timeline? Nvidia and the commitment it's made Dan, the amount of money it's committed to invest in Sam Altman's company. Talk about that.\n03:36 Dan\nYeah, they uh said that they would invest upwards of $100 billion in open AI. and that includes Open AI purchasing Nvidia chips. Now, you know, there's been uh uh conversations uh or discussions where uh Jensen Wong has said, look, nothing's really gone forward in with that respect yet. Um I think there uh was some potential fear from investors that it was you know, so much money or the the conversations around uh the circular AI. Uh Nvidia actually put out a statement basically rebutting a number of uh Wall Street analysts kind of fears around that, whether that's you know, the circular AI investing, the fears of an AI bubble, the depreciation of uh GPUs over time and the accounting practices uh that uh uh Michael Berry had pointed out uh in his uh famous now uh post on X. Um, and so, you know, I I I do think that that was a big moment for them, one of the biggest, uh but, you know, it seems as though it's kind of on, I guess hold or they're they're waiting to to move forward. I'm not sure where the company is exactly this point, but certainly when it was announced, it was huge. anybody throughout the year that said that they were going to be working with AI immediately saw a positive benefit, but that started to really trail off towards the tail end of the year as more people started talking about the potential for an AI bubble. But, you know, we just saw Micron report huge numbers, huge uh outlook saying that they're sold out of their uh high bandwidth memory for these AI chips through calendar 2026. So, you know, we'll probably continue to see that up down up down for the uh the AI trade.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Shares of semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) jumped 4.6% in the afternoon session after the company was named a top pick for 2026 by Jefferies amid a broader rally in the chip sector.\nThe positive sentiment came after the investment firm identified KLA alongside industry leaders Nvidia and Broadcom. The recommendation noted a shift in investor interest toward companies with sustainable demand from the build-out of AI infrastructure. KLA's stock also benefited from a wider rebound among chipmakers, which followed a strong forecast from memory-chip maker Micron Technology. Micron's upbeat outlook was driven by surging demand and supply shortages, which allowed the company to charge more for its products and lifted sentiment for peers like KLA and Applied Materials.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $1,225, up 4.5% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy KLA Corporation? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us KLA Corporation’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 14 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 3.9% on the news that Jefferies upgraded the semiconductor company's stock to Buy from Hold and raised its price target.\n\nThe firm increased its price target on the shares to $1,500 from a previous target of $1,100, marking a significant 36% jump. This move signaled a more positive outlook for the company. The sentiment was echoed by other analysts. TD Cowen also raised its price target for KLA to $1,300 from $900. Similarly, Stifel increased its price target to $1,260 while maintaining its Buy rating, pointing to the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations. These actions reflected a strong growth outlook for KLA.\nKLA Corporation is up 92.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $1,225 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $1,246 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of KLA Corporation’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,671.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

      "Content": "Micron Shares Jump on Earnings Beat - What's Next?\n\nEthan Feller\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:11 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nMicron Technology ( MU ) shares surged more than 11% after the company reported blowout earnings yesterday evening, easily beating analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The most notable takeaway was Micron’s guidance for next quarter, with revenue expectations raised to $18.7 billion from roughly $14.2 billion and earnings guidance nearly doubling from $4.78 per share to $8.42.\n\nManagement struck a confident tone, noting that it is “more than sold out,” and reiterated expectations for the total addressable market for high-bandwidth memory to reach $100 billion by 2028, implying a compound annual growth rate of roughly 40%.\nThere’s no question this was a stellar report, capping off a banner year for the memory giant. Still, it’s hard to ignore the industry’s cyclical nature. Historically, peak earnings often coincide with peak pricing, and memory stocks have a habit of looking cheapest just before margins begin to roll over.\nThat said, the AI-driven demand backdrop makes this cycle anything but typical. With powerful secular tailwinds, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) , and strong technical momentum reinforcing the bullish fundamentals, excessive caution here could quickly prove misplaced.\n\nWhile AI leaders like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) have traded sideways to lower over the past several months, Micron has continued to push higher. The key question is whether tight high-bandwidth memory supply will persist and drive the stock even higher, or if investors begin rotating back into established leaders like Nvidia and Broadcom.\nFor investors considering MU stock, the most practical approach is to let the price action be the guide. Below, I’ll break down Micron’s technical setup and outline a tactical plan.\nMicron Technology Shares Rally on Earnings Upgrades As shown in the chart below, Micron shares largely stagnated between 2022 and mid-2025, reflecting a choppy earnings revision trend and lingering skepticism around the durability of the memory recovery. While AI-driven demand for high-bandwidth memory was already emerging, investors lacked confidence that Micron could fully monetize that opportunity.\n\nThat changed in the summer of 2025, when earnings revisions turned decisively higher as visibility into HBM production, pricing, and capacity allocation improved. Management’s increasingly confident guidance signaled that demand was not only strong but constrained by supply, forcing analysts to raise forecasts. As earnings expectations reset higher, the stock followed.\nThe wave of earnings upgrades has continued, earning Micron a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) . Estimates were raised again today, and over the past 60 days, current year earnings expectations have climbed 22.38%, while next year’s estimates are up 32.42%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCan MU Stock Breakout Again? Micron’s technical chart is sending several important signals. The stock has delivered an impressive run, forming a series of consolidations and subsequent breakouts over the past several months. While shares are trading sharply higher today, MU has not yet cleared prior highs and remains within a broad trading range.\n\nKey support and resistance levels are critical to watch here. This news should be decisively bullish, but if the stock fails to break out and close above the $262 level in the near-term, it raises some caution flags. A clean breakout above that level, however, would likely signal another leg higher.\nIf MU does not break out, investors should closely monitor the rising support below. A decisive move beneath that level would materially increase downside risk. One additional cautionary signal is the expansion in the stock’s daily trading range. Stocks that grind higher on low volatility often sustain trends, but rising volatility (ranges) during an advance, as seen in MU, can sometimes precede a corrective phase.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nWhat’s Next for Shares of Micron Technology? Micron’s earnings reset has clearly established the stock as a leader in the AI infrastructure trade, but the next phase will likely be driven by price action rather than headlines. As long as high-bandwidth memory supply remains tight and earnings revisions continue to trend higher, MU has room to extend its outperformance, even as larger AI names like Nvidia work through their own consolidation phases.\n\nThat said, leadership rotations are a constant in this market. If investor risk appetite shifts back toward platform and networking exposure, or some other vertical, you could see leadership emerge elsewhere in the AI industry. For now, however, MU’s combination of accelerating earnings momentum and constructive technicals keeps the stock firmly in focus.\nUltimately, investors should remain disciplined and let the chart confirm the next move. A sustained breakout would argue for another leg higher, while a failure to hold key support would signal that expectations may be getting ahead of fundamentals.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Nvidia Earns 69% of Its Revenue From the U.S. Here's How Tariffs Could Affect That in 2026.\n\nChris Neiger, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia makes most of its revenue from sales to large U.S. tech companies.\nPresident Trump has lifted a ban on sales of Nvidia's H200 processors to China, but the company must pay the federal government 25% of the revenue from those sales.\n2026 could bring more international sales for Nvidia, but there's no indication that would result in reduced sales to domestic buyers.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the undisputed leaders in artificial intelligence hardware. Its parallel processors occupy a central role in data centers worldwide, as it holds an estimated 90% share of the market for AI accelerator chips.\nTechnology companies in the U.S. are snatching up Nvidia's processors at the fastest rate -- 69% of the company's revenue comes from domestic sources right now, according to research from The Motley Fool . However, ever since President Donald Trump announced earlier this year that he was imposing steep new tariffs on nearly every other country, Nvidia has been forced to navigate a shifting set of U.S. trade policies.\nHow might those tariffs and Trump's various trade conflicts impact Nvidia's U.S. revenue in 2026? Here are a few points to consider.\nNvidia's U.S. chip demand should remain robust in 2026 Nvidia is a chip designer, not a chip manufacturer -- like other \"fabless\" operations, it hires other companies to actually produce its processors. Most of Nvidia's chips are made by the world's leading third-party chip foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor , also known as TSMC.\nTSMC manufactures many of Nvidia's processors in Taiwan, which are then imported into the U.S. and sold to tech companies. Some semiconductor tariffs have already impacted Nvidia's bottom line, but the bulk of the company's trade-conflict-related headwinds have come as a result of U.S. restrictions preventing the export of its more advanced chips to China. In its fiscal 2026 first quarter alone (which ended April 27), the company took a $4.5 billion charge due to the lost value of H20 chips it made specifically for the Chinese market that it found itself unable to legally sell there.\n\nAnything could change in 2026, but as of right now, tariffs and trade conflicts likely won't change the fact that the majority of Nvidia's sales will come from U.S.-based companies. Meta , Alphabet , OpenAI, and many others are already spending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to build data centers powered in part by vast quantities of Nvidia's processors, and that trend does not appear likely to slacken any time soon. And with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimating that global spending on data center infrastructure will amount to between $3 trillion and $4 trillion between now and 2030, spending by U.S. tech giants will likely remain a very high percentage of the company's sales next year.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's sales could rise in China in 2026 One recent change could modestly impact the mix of sources for Nvidia's revenues in 2026: Trump has decided that Nvidia can begin selling its H200 chips in China.\nAs of right now, those processors technically won't incur tariffs -- but they will cost Nvidia. Trump will reportedly only allow those H200 sales to China if Nvidia gives the U.S. government a 25% cut of the resulting revenues.\n\nCurrently, about 5% of Nvidia's chip sales go to customers in China, down from a high of 25% in 2022. It's unclear how much of Nvidia's revenue will come from China in 2026, and also unclear how much demand for the H200 there will be from Chinese companies, especially as the Chinese government has indicated that it wants its domestic companies to develop their own AI semiconductors. But some of the latest reporting indicated that Nvidia is considering further ramping up H200 production to match the anticipated increase in demand.\nOf course, if demand for the H200 processor is high and Nvidia significantly increases its sales to China, the percentage of its revenue from that country could tick back up again.\nNvidia doesn't need to worry about slight shifts in its revenue diversification Nvidia sells its processors worldwide, and demand for them is sky high. In its fiscal 2026 third quarter, which ended Oct. 26, Nvidia's data center sales rose 66% year over year to $51 billion. Given that there is no end in sight right now for data center spending, the chipmaker could experience continuing growth from this segment for years.\n\nNvidia's diluted earnings per share increased 67% to $1.30 in the most recent quarter, and the company remains a solid AI investment. What's more, it enjoys an impressive gross margin of nearly 74% -- sales of its processors, no matter where they are being shipped to, are extremely profitable.\nThe point here is that the company has, thus far, weathered an uncertain tariff and trade environment, and has continued to thrive. If some restrictions on semiconductor trade are lifted soon, which appears likely, it could result in even more growth for Nvidia.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "3 Best AI ETF Picks for 2026\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Quantum computing is an exciting theme, but one that's going to take some time to play out.\nInvestors should consider a broad spectrum of names beyond just the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nThe three ETFs below offer a range of options for investors to gain exposure to the AI sector.\n10 stocks we like better than Defiance Quantum ETF ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is already well on its way to being the biggest technological revolution since the internet -- and it's still in the early innings.\nWhile names such as Nvidia , Microsoft , OpenAI , and Alphabet have emerged as the \"faces\" of AI, there are plenty of potential winners throughout the sector. Infrastructure builders, enterprise software creators, application developers, and cloud providers all play an integral part to the ecosystem. AI is far more than just semiconductor manufacturers.\nThat's why when it comes to investing in AI, it may be better to just buy the theme instead of trying to pick individual winners. Some of the biggest returns so far have been delivered by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. But stretched valuations, evidence of slowing momentum, and questions surrounding whether all the AI development spending will be worth it are beginning to plague some companies.\nAn ETF that can maintain exposure to some of those megacap names but look beyond them for additional opportunities may be the way to play it in 2026. Here are the three artificial intelligence ETFs that I'm favoring as we head into the new year.\n1. Defiance Quantum ETF If you're interested in true futuristic tech, quantum computing is probably for you. If artificial intelligence is the next revolution, quantum is the rocket that could really propel it to the next level.\nQuantum computing involves developing the technology for processing and calculating at speeds far beyond what traditional computers can do today. It has potential applications in technology, medicine, energy, finance, scientific discovery, and more.\n\nThe Defiance Quantum ETF (NASDAQ: QTUM) invests in companies at the forefront of quantum development. Top holdings right now include Tower Semiconductor , Rigetti Computing , Teradyne , Coherent , and Micron Technology .\nThe only Magnificent Seven name among the top 10 holdings is Alphabet, and it only comes in at No. 10, with a weight of 1.8%. So there's good diversification here relative to the broader tech sector and the equity market in general.\nQuantum is a little more niche and a lot more appropriate for a long-term holding than traditional AI stocks. It may be years before quantum becomes anything close to having mainstream applications, so it should be considered an investment in potential more than concrete current results.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF The Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AIQ) looks more like a traditional big tech ETF, but it's careful to include companies of all sizes and from all around the world. In that way, it's designed to be a more inclusive and comprehensive take on AI investing.\nThe fund's index starts by grouping companies in two categories:\n\nAI developers: Includes product and services developers and users, as well as companies that offer AI solutions as a service to customers.\nAI and big data analytics: Semiconductor, storage, and/or hardware manufacturers, as well as quantum computing developers.\nA minimum \"exposure score\" is required for inclusion. Qualifying components are weighted by market cap.\nAIQ is a nice middle ground between big and small companies, although it definitely tilts toward large caps. The AI exposure requirement is a nice way to build the portfolio and ensure that the fund is more of a pure AI play than just a generic megacap tech fund.\n3. Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) describes itself as the world's first generative AI ETF. It's unique in that it's the only actively managed fund among the three, which is advantageous in such a rapidly evolving space. But it also leans more toward the megacap names.\n\nTop holdings currently include Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms , and Palantir . Amazon , Broadcom , and Advanced Micro Devices also reside in the top 10, so there's very much a Nasdaq-100 index feel to this fund.\nIf you're looking for a straightforward, more \"conservative\" way to invest in AI, CHAT might not be a bad choice. You get the heavy large-cap exposure without a lot of the risk that comes from investing in newer or emerging names.\nShould you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF right now? Before you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Defiance Quantum ETF wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "AVGO Stock Drops 20% From 52-Week High: Should You Buy on the Dip?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:44 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nBroadcom AVGO shares closed at $326.02 on Wednesday, down 19.7% from the 52-week high of $414.61, it hit on Dec.10. The decline can be attributed to AVGO’s soft gross margin guidance for fiscal 2026 due to higher AI mix in the revenue as well as higher tax rate due to the impact of global minimum tax and shift in geographic mix of income as compared with fiscal 2025. The first-quarter fiscal 2026 guidance also reflects the negative impact of unfavorable AI mix in revenues, a sequential decline in non-AI semiconductor revenues and modest growth expectations for the Infrastructure Software segment. However, does this dip in AVGO shares offer a buying opportunity? Let’s find out.\n\nAVGO Prospects Ride on Strong AI Revenues AVGO is benefiting from strong demand for XPUs, which are a type of application-specific integrated circuits necessary to train Generative AI models. They require complex integration of compute, memory and I/O capabilities to achieve the necessary performance at lower power consumption and cost. Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms are major users of these XPUs. In fiscal 2025, AI revenues surged 65% to $20 billion from fiscal 2024. Broadcom’s current order backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion as AVGO’s latest 102-terabit per second Tomahawk 6 switch continues to gain traction.\n\nBroadcom’s XPUs are gaining traction. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, AI revenues surged 74% year over year to $6.5 billion. XPU adoption accelerated in the reported quarter as enterprises continue to use these to train their large language models (LLMs) and monetize their platforms through inferencing APIs and applications. AVGO’s expanding clientele, which now includes Anthropic, is driving growth. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received a $10 billion order to sell Alphabet’s latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, Broadcom received an additional order worth $11 billion from the same customer. AVGO now expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 AI revenues to double year over year to $8.2 billion.\n\nIn fact, strong demand for XPUs, an innovative product portfolio, and an expanding partner base have helped Broadcom outperform the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector as well as peers including NVIDIA NVDA and Marvell Technology MRVL. In the trailing 12 months, AVGO shares have appreciated 49.3%, outperforming the broader sector’s return of 21.2%. While shares of NVIDIA have returned 30.9%, Marvell Technology fell 25.1% in the past year.\n\nAVGO Stock’s Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory Continues\nStrong Portfolio & Rich Partner Base Drives AVGO’s Top Line Consolidated backlog hit $162 billion in fiscal 2025, including $73 billion in AI backlog set to be delivered over the next 18 months. AVGO’s networking portfolio is gaining from strong demand for Tomahawk 6 products, as well as the Jericho 4 Ethernet fabric router.\n\nAVGO expanded its portfolio with the launch of the industry’s first Wi-Fi 8 silicon solutions for the broadband wireless edge ecosystem, including residential gateways, enterprise access points and smart mobile clients. Tomahawk 6 - Davisson (TH6-Davisson), the company’s third-generation Co-Packaged Optics Ethernet switch, is now being shipped. TH6-Davisson is specifically designed for the accelerating demands of AI networking, as it delivers an unprecedented 102.4 terabits per second of optically enabled switching capacity.\n\nIn August, Broadcom announced the Jericho 4 Ethernet fabric router that has the ability to interconnect more than one million XPUs across multiple data centers. In October, the company announced Thor Ultra, the industry’s first 800G AI Ethernet Network Interface Card, capable of interconnecting hundreds of thousands of XPUs to drive trillion-parameter AI workloads. AVGO also announced the industry’s first Wi-Fi 8 silicon solutions for the broadband wireless edge ecosystem, including residential gateways, enterprise access points and smart mobile clients.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom has a rich partner base that includes the likes of OpenAI, Walmart, NVIDIA, Canonical, Arista Networks, Alphabet, Dell Technologies, Meta Platform, Juniper, Supermicro, among others. AVGO expects first-quarter fiscal 2026 Semiconductor revenues of $12.3 billion, suggesting 50% year-over-year growth. Infrastructure Software revenues are expected to grow 2% year over year to $6.8 billion.\n\nAVGO’s Earnings Estimate Revision Shows Positive Trend The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $9.88 per share, up 8.1% over the past 30 days, indicating 44.9% growth from fiscal 2025’s reported figure. The consensus mark for fiscal 2026 revenues is currently pegged at $92.51 billion, suggesting 44.8% growth from fiscal 2025’s reported figure.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $2.01 per share, up six cents over the past 30 days, indicating 25.6% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 revenues is currently pegged at $19.23 billion, suggesting 29% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nBroadcom Inc.

      "Content": "The $1.6 Trillion AI Stampede: Is Wall Street Building Data Centers No One Will Use?\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:38 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGC=F\n\nBTC-USD\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nA century after Roger Babson warned of a looming crash ahead of the Great Depression, a similar tension is resurfacing as investors weigh the pace and scale of today's AI boom. Enthusiasm around artificial intelligence is echoing the optimism once attached to radios and automobiles in 1929, even as questions grow around valuation discipline and capital allocation. Tech companies are projected to spend just under $1.6 trillion a year on data centers by 2030, based on Omdia data, despite AI's long-term profit potential still being debated. Some observers suggest the issue may extend beyond AI itself, pointing to parallel signs of speculative behavior across markets, from sharply higher gold prices to record government deficits and the rapid expansion of a roughly $3 trillion private credit market increasingly tied to AI-related lending.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThose speculative dynamics have already shown volatility elsewhere. Bitcoin's total market value climbed by $636 billion earlier in the year before reversing by mid-December, while memecoin trading volumes fell sharply from January peaks, according to Blockworks. In many cases, investors appeared to focus less on long-term value creation and more on the possibility of quick gains, a pattern reinforced by social media, global information flows, and survey data showing rising aspirations for extreme wealth, particularly among younger cohorts. Against this backdrop, AI has emerged as the dominant focal point in business and finance, potentially amplifying herd behavior as companies race to avoid being left behind.\n\nThe pressure is now filtering into corporate balance sheets. While the largest technology firms are largely funding data center expansion from cash-rich positions, others are leaning more heavily on debt. Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) is raising $38 billion to build data centers in Texas and Wisconsin, while newer operators such as CoreWeave and Fluidstack are also borrowing aggressively to finance AI-focused infrastructure. Some of these projects rely on complex financing structures to acquire Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) graphics processors, assets that some observers think could depreciate faster than expected if demand assumptions change. As investment firms build tens of billions of dollars' worth of capacity without fully secured customers, concerns are growing that a shift in sentiment could expose vulnerabilities reminiscent of past cycles, where optimism persisted until doubt finally took hold.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The company is a major supplier of memory to AI chip giant Nvidia ( NVDA ).\nMicron’s DRAM revenue rose 69% to $10.8 billion in the company’s first quarter, driven by AI-linked demand for HBM.\n\nThat upswing helped Micron's first quarter earnings and revenue surpass Wall Street’s expectations, with its EPS of $4.78 above the projected $3.95 and its $13.6 billion in quarterly revenue above the roughly $13 billion estimated by Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg.\nRevenue from Micron's NAND — or storage chips — used in data centers surpassed $1 billion for the first time.\n\nMicron was more bullish than expected about the future, forecasting revenue between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion in the second quarter, above the $14.4 billion expected. The chipmaker’s profits are also set to benefit as surging AI demand has created an industry shortage of memory chips: The company sees EPS hitting $8.42 at the midpoint in the February quarter, ahead of the $4.71 estimated by analysts, and projects its gross margin will hit an all-time high of 68%.\n“Over the last few months, our customers' AI data center buildout plans have driven a sharp increase in demand forecast for memory and storage,” CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a call with analysts following the results Wednesday. \"We believe that the aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nThe CEO said he expects the market for HBM chips to soar to $100 billion in 2028 from $35 billion in 2025.\nThe positive surprise had Wall Street analysts upping their price targets on Micron shares as high as $500 Thursday morning.\n“Micron continues to benefit from highly favorable industry conditions, driven by unprecedented AI-related demand, particularly for higher-value memory products, coupled with persistently tight global supply conditions,” Raymond James analyst Melissa Fairbanks said in a note raising her price target on the stock to $310 from $190.\nMicron’s shares stood around $251 in midday trading, with Thursday’s gain putting the stock up around 210% for the year.\n\nStory Continues\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(NYSE: BRK ) (NYSE: BRK ) CEO, Warren Buffett , who asked him to diversify his holdings.\nAccording to Arouet, if Gates hadn’t listened to Buffett, he would now be “the world's first trillionaire, worth twice as much as Elon.”\nAs Microsoft shares continue to soar, and its market capitalization is now at $3.6 trillion, Gates’ net worth would have stood at a staggering $1.5 trillion if he had retained all of his shares in the company and hadn’t embarked on the massive philanthropic journey with his ex-wife, Melinda Gates .\nTo be fair, it's difficult to fault Buffett for that advice. Few could have anticipated Microsoft's extraordinary surge over the past decade, particularly after the stock spent years largely treading water following the dot-com crash, taking roughly 15 years to reclaim its prior peak.\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

      "Content": "Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT): A Bull Case Theory\n\nRicardo Pillai\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:40 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: VRT\n\nNVDA\n\nWe came across a bullish thesis on Vertiv Holdings Co on X.com by @TheValueist. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on VRT. Vertiv Holdings Co's share was trading at $160.66 as of December 16th. VRT’s trailing and forward P/E were 60.63 and 30.30 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nVertiv Holdings Co designs, manufactures, and services critical digital infrastructure technologies and life cycle services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments in the Americas, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. VRT is increasingly positioned as a core beneficiary of the global AI data center build-out, with roughly 80% of revenue tied to data centers and leadership positions across thermal management, large-scale UPS, and power distribution.\n\nIts scale, global manufacturing footprint, and expanding service network underpin deep relationships with hyperscalers, colocation providers, and NVIDIA, positioning Vertiv as a system-level partner rather than a component supplier. Demand visibility is unusually strong, with orders up sharply year over year, backlog approaching $9.5 billion, and a book-to-bill well above 1x, providing multi-year revenue visibility into at least 2026.\nManagement attributes this strength to structural drivers including accelerating AI monetization, geographic expansion of AI infrastructure beyond North America, and grid and labor constraints that elongate rather than truncate the cycle while increasing Vertiv’s content per site through prefabrication and behind-the-meter solutions. Strategically, Vertiv is shifting toward higher-value architectures such as 800V DC power, co-developed with NVIDIA, and system-level offerings like OneCore and SmartRun that compress deployment timelines and increase share of wallet. Services, now over 20% of revenue, are a key differentiator, with rising margins and intensity as AI infrastructure grows more complex.\n\nThe planned acquisition of PurgeRite reinforces this service moat in liquid cooling at an attractive valuation and strengthens Vertiv’s lifecycle engagement with customers. Financially, margins, free cash flow, and leverage have improved materially, supporting disciplined reinvestment and bolt-on M&A. However, the stock already reflects a premium valuation that capitalizes sustained high-teens growth and continued margin expansion. While Vertiv offers compelling exposure to AI infrastructure bottlenecks with strong execution and management quality, returns from current levels depend largely on earnings delivery and the durability of AI data center capex beyond 2026 rather than further multiple expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT) by OppCost in May 2025, which highlighted AI-driven data center demand, margin expansion, and improving free cash flow. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 52% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out. The thesis still stands as secular data center growth remains intact. @TheValueist shares a similar thesis but emphasizes on system-level positioning, backlog visibility, and valuation risk.\n\nVertiv Holdings Co is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds . As per our database, 102 hedge fund portfolios held VRT at the end of the third quarter which was 104 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of VRT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "China Prepares to Wreck US AI Industry\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:15 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nORCL\n\nMETA\n\nMSFT\n\nThe math is simple. It starts with three facts. China has spent massive amounts to create very low-priced electricity at a rate several times the U.S. pace. It has built massive dams. The best example is the Motuo Hydropower Station on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. No other nation could build a colossal project so fast. And China has extraordinary solar power supply. Do the large Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) companies pay for these? No. The central government largely does. China is a dictatorship, so things happen that way.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points There are three ways China is poised to leap ahead in artificial intelligence.\nThe United States faces many headwinds in creating AI infrastructure.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNext, China creates a science project like the one America did when we built the atomic bomb. The nation’s best scientists all work on one project: chips that rival those made by Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ). Reuters calls it China’s Manhattan Project. The news service reports, “Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance.” Much of the tech seems to have been “stolen” from Western companies.\nFinally, China creates extremely advanced AI products, like those from Alphabet Inc. ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and OpenAI, which it then dumps into the market. The latest versions include DeepSeek-V3.2, which anyone in the public can use, and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, which is more for tech business operations. Chen Fang, a Chinese engineer who worked on the project, said, “People thought DeepSeek gave a one-time breakthrough, but we came back much bigger,” according to VentureBeat.\n\nThe Chinese could be lying, but experts with access to the DeepSeek products don’t think so. The Chinese can employ huge numbers of top experts to move forward even faster. There is no competition for talent like there is among America’s tech companies. No engineer in China is being paid $10 million to move from Microsoft Corp. ( NASDAQ: MSFT ) to Meta Platforms Inc. ( NASDAQ: META ). China won’t allow it.\nU.S. AI Headwinds It takes three years to build a data center in the United States, especially for large hyperscale projects. Ask Elon Musk.\nU.S. data centers face a scarcity of electricity as builders attempt to bring data centers online quickly. Renewable energy has not scaled fast enough. This has forced America to return to coal generation. Environmental activists are trying to stop that.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the U.S. AI data center builders will need hundreds of billions of dollars to build out infrastructure. That capital has to be raised somewhere. Tech companies and financial players are cobbling it together. Companies like Microsoft and Meta do not have enough capital to cover these expenses themselves. Blue Owl Capital just walked away from helping to fund an Oracle Corp. ( NYSE: ORCL ) data center project. Money is fickle.\n\nNearby residents and businesses oppose U.S. data centers. Data center power use can drive up electricity prices. The grid in some areas is too weak to supply the power. And politicians are starting to make electricity prices an issue. That can slow or kill data centers in some parts of the country.\nThe Wall Street Journal recently wrote, “An escalating artificial intelligence race between China and the U.S. is drawing comparisons to the Cold War, and is likely to be just as consequential.”\nWhat happens to the valuation of Nvidia, Microsoft, OpenAI, and other sector leaders if China starts to pull ahead? It is similar to what people worry about with an AI bubble.\nHow to Short the Entire AI Industry\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Palantir and Seagate have seen big gains as well, causing a growing number of investors to worry that AI is in a bubble akin to the dot-com era . But those gains are small potatoes compared to one Indian company.\nThe share price of RRP Semiconductor Ltd. has surged by an eye-popping 55,000% in the past 20 months. On Dec. 17, 2023, you could have bought shares for 10 Indian rupees (roughly 11 cents in U.S. dollars). Today, those shares are selling for 11,095 rupees (approximately $123).\n\nThat stock surge comes despite a number of things that would cause red flags to shoot up at near terminal velocity normally. The company has just two full-time employees, according to Bloomberg , and it posted negative revenue in the most recent quarter. And until early last year, it was focused on the real estate industry, not semiconductors.\nThat hasn't mattered to investors, even as regulators have sounded some warnings. (India's Securities and Exchange Board is investigating the company for potential wrongdoing, which has caused the stock price to fall slightly, but nothing compared to its rise.)\nRRP began to move into the AI space in 2024, when the company's owner acquired GD Trading and Agencies. That company previously acted as an agent/broker for a wider variety of goods (from chemicals to consumer products), but shifted to semiconductor manufacturing after the acquisition and changed its name to RRP Semiconductor.\nThat set off an investor firestorm. (India has a limited market for semiconductor companies, which might explain some of the investor fervor.) One reason the share price might have escalated as much as it does? Only 2% of the company is publicly traded. Founder Rajendra Chodankar and a small group of associates hold the other 98%, says Bloomberg.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Rivian CEO on self-driving, designing AI chips, and why Tesla needs more competition\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 5:05 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nVLKAF\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAt Rivian's ( RIVN ) Autonomy and AI Day on Dec. 11, the pure-play EV maker outlined a whole range of tech and software products, with a focus on vertical integration — meaning doing everything from end to end in-house.\nCEO RJ Scaringe launched the company's new Autonomy platform at the event — and during a trying time for the EV sector, in which so far only Tesla has achieved profitability. While Rivian has achieved gross profits in recent quarters, actual bottom-line (or net) profits have been elusive.\n\nScaringe, who founded the company in 2011, saw Rivian go public in 2021 and reach stratospheric heights of $120 a share before the stock came back down to earth, now at $18. A crucial cash infusion from Volkswagen ( VWAGY ) of nearly $6 billion via a joint venture between the two companies has given Rivian much-needed breathing room.\nThe following is a condensed version of Yahoo Finance's conversation with Scaringe, touching on the company's path toward full self-driving (FSD), or personal L4, as Rivian calls it, building in-house chips, and where the overall EV industry is headed.\nYahoo Finance: Thanks for having us here, RJ. Rivian's Autonomy platform — talk to me about the progression from where Rivian is right now to what's going to come out in the near term and its vision for the future.\nRJ Scaringe: Autonomy has been a journey for us. We followed the launch of our Gen 1 vehicles at the end of 2021. In early 2022, we realized we wanted to do a clean-sheet approach to our Autonomy platform. So we started the process on that, and that involved developing a camera platform, redesigning the compute platform, and architecting the whole system around an AI-centric approach.\n\nThat was what went into our [current] Gen 2 vehicles that we ultimately launched in the middle of 2024, and the compute relative to our Gen 1 [vehicles] increased by about 10x — that's the inference on the vehicle. When we launched that, there was 55 megapixels of cameras, an array of radars, and that began the process of building the data stream to really train this model.\nOn our Gen 3 platform, it's [built using] an in-house chip ... This is a platform that can process 5 billion pixels per second, so that's roughly 5x the best in class today. This is very, very high processing capability. And that not only raises the performance level of this platform, but it also allows us to build the model more efficiently and more quickly.\nCurrently, Rivian offers Universal Hands-Free, which is akin to GM's Supercruise, and that will be expanded to more roads. What comes next?\nIn 2026, we'll add \"point to point.\" So you can get in the car from your driveway, type the address, and it does everything, hands-free, eyes-on, etc. .... But it's still supervised.\n\nStory Continues\nThen the platform expands to the next big step, which is eyes-off — and eyes-off is really powerful. That's when you can start to be in the car, be on your phone, be reading a book. Essentially, your role in driving the car diminishes to nothing. You're just a passenger.\nAnd then the next step beyond that is what we call personal Level 4, which is the idea that the vehicle can completely operate on its own, even without anybody in the car. And so things like picking the kids up from school, an airport drop-off, or grabbing groceries.\n\nRead more: How to find the best luxury car insurance\nYou mentioned the custom silicon Riving is making in-house. Talk to me about why that's important for you to make that the next jump in the next few years. Why not use an off-the-shelf self-driving product like Nvidia's?\nWe made the decision years and years ago to build our entire vertical software platform in-house and not rely on tier-one suppliers for any of that content ... We then built teams of thousands of people to go put all that together. [We] spent many, many, many hundreds of millions of dollars to develop those systems. And when we've approached autonomy and our overall AI roadmap, we had a very similar view, which is this is going to be the most important technical shift in transportation, I would say, more than anything else, more than anything since the beginning of the car. And we wanted to control our own destiny...\n\nYou [also] need a partnership with someone like a TSMC, which in our case is our partner. [Although Rivian designed its chip in-house, a chipmaker is needed to actually produce the chip.] And what we're going to get is better performance, something that's very specific to vision-based robotics ... And then we needed to build this data flywheel, and so lots of offline training, that means lots of GPUs.\nI want to mention Tesla because it is doing the same thing with regard to going fully vertical. It has its own chips. It's doing its own data centers. But unlike Tesla, Rivian uses sensors as opposed to just camera vision. Do you think Rivian can meet, and even surpass, where Tesla FSD is in the next couple of years?\n\nOur goal is to be world-class. Tesla, to be clear, is a great product. They've built a really impressive platform. We're very much aligned with them on believing it needs to be a neural-net-based approach, building an end-to-end trained model that's using a fleet of vehicles, building a data flywheel that trains the model with reinforcement learning. So we really agree here.\nWe do have a different view on the benefits of a diverse set of perception modalities. In our case, still being camera-heavy, call it camera-primary. But by including radar and lidar [light detection and ranging], it allows us to turn our entire fleet into a \"ground truth\" fleet. So every vehicle on the road is very helpful in training our model. [Similar to Tesla, Rivian's EVs will send massive amounts of data collected via sensors and cameras to train its self-driving model.]\nI want to ask you about the bigger picture of the EV industry in America. The tax credit went away in Q4. How are things going for you now as a result? I've heard people talk about how the pure-play EV makers might actually benefit from this because we have fewer competitors in the market.\nI think what you postulated in your question is probably somewhat right. I think you are seeing a lot of manufacturers pull back. I think that's unfortunate. I think it'd be healthier for the auto industry if everybody was focused on electrification. I think that pullback means there's going to be less choice, which is bad for customers. But I do think because there's less choice, it means it's going to be a less competitive environment...\n\nIf you were to look at the segment of vehicles with price points that start under $50,000, there's very few highly compelling choices, and as a result of that, a single company, Tesla, has accumulated around 50% market share ... and that's not a reflection of a healthy industry. It's a reflection of an underserved market. And so if we want to see electrification go from its 8% adoption, which is what it is in the United States today, to let's say 25 or 30 or ultimately 100%, we need to have more than one great choice.\nAnd of course, I think Rivian is one of those [great choices] with our R2. I think it's going to be exceptional. The car itself is just amazing, but I hope there's others.\nPras Subramanian is Lead Auto Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Got $1,000? 3 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIONQ\n\nORCL\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia boasts of exceptional multiyear revenue visibility.\nAlphabet’s full-stack AI approach is proving to be a key competitive advantage.\nIonQ can prove to be a high-growth, high-risk addition to a large and well-diversified investment portfolio.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe Federal Reserve's much-awaited 25-basis-point interest rate cut, announced on Dec. 10, has not delivered the market relief many investors had hoped for. While tech stocks initially jumped, the optimism was quickly replaced as renewed concerns around artificial intelligence (AI)-powered stocks resurfaced. Investor sentiment has further deteriorated after AI cloud giant Oracle missed earnings estimates in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Nov. 30, 2025), raising concerns about its ability to convert high-level capital investment into sustained profits.\nWith markets swinging sharply in response to changing sentiment, long-term investors can convert today's uncertainty into an entry opportunity. In case you have $1,000 not required to pay bills and debt or kept aside for contingencies, then investing in any of these three stocks can help generate wealth in the long run.\n\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might seem like the most obvious buy-and-hold pick for decades, and for good reason.\nThe company's exceptional long-term order visibility, worth nearly $500 billion of Blackwell and Rubin systems through 2025 and 2026, is itself a strong indicator of the durability of its long-term growth trajectory. While $150 billion in orders have already shipped, $350 billion worth of orders remain. Nvidia has expanded its strategic partnership with Saudi Public Investment Fund-backed AI company HUMAIN to jointly deploy up to 600,000 of its latest GPU systems over the next three years. This, coupled with a new compute capacity supply agreement with Anthropic, has expanded Nvidia's multiyear demand in addition to the $500 billion.\n\nThe reopening of the Chinese market is also a significant growth catalyst, considering that Nvidia once earned nearly 20% to 25% of its data center revenue from this market. Recently, the U.S. government approved the export of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, provided that 25% of the revenue is paid to the U.S. Treasury. According to a Reuters report, the company has informed Chinese clients that it is evaluating options to expand H200 chip production to meet the surging demand. While the Chinese government has yet to formally approve the purchases of these chips, the report notes that several Chinese technology companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already contacted Nvidia to secure supply.\n\nStory Continues\nDespite the stellar demand, visibility, and expanding market access, Nvidia stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of 23 and a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.48. While the stock may experience short-term volatility due to changes in hyperscaler spending and policy shifts, its long-term growth story remains intact. Hence, investors should be picking up a stake in this stock, especially at its current reasonable valuation levels.\n\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has also become a crucial player in the global development of AI infrastructure. The company exited the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025) with a Google Cloud backlog of $155 billion, up 46% on a sequential basis. Customers also entered into a larger number of deals valued at over $1 billion in the first nine months of 2025, compared to the combined total of the previous two years. Additionally, nearly 70% of the company's cloud customers are already using the company's AI products.\n\nThe rapid pace of enterprise adoption and improved multiyear revenue visibility of Google Cloud can be partly attributed to the company's full-stack AI strategy, spanning AI infrastructure, proprietary chips, AI models, and enterprise platforms. The full-stack approach is helping Google Cloud support large-scale AI deployments more efficiently. This, in turn, is contributing to improving margins and deepening existing customer relationships.\nBeyond Cloud, Alphabet's strategy of embedding AI across its ecosystem is also delivering strong results. AI experiences are already driving higher engagement in Search through AI Mode and AI Overviews. The company is seeing a higher number of overall queries, including commercial queries, which present additional avenues for monetization. YouTube is also benefiting from AI-driven recommendation systems and is witnessing robust double-digit revenue growth from advertising and subscriptions.\n\nAlphabet is generating durable cash flows from its consumer products, while Google Cloud is well positioned to ride the multiyear enterprise AI wave. The company trades at 27.6 times forward earnings, which appears rich. However, considering its scale, diversified revenue base, and technological edge, Alphabet can be a solid long-term pick even at an elevated valuation level.\nIonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is too speculative to serve as a core holding in a diversified portfolio. However, this quantum computing specialist could still merit a small allocation for investors seeking exposure to its long-term growth optionality or those growth drivers that cannot be fully modeled.\nIonQ has delivered exceptional top-line performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025), with revenue soaring 222% year over year to $39.9 million, exceeding even the upper end of its own guidance by 37%. IonQ also has $3.5 billion in cash and no debt on its balance sheet, allowing the company to invest in future growth initiatives.\n\nManagement has highlighted multiple technical and product-specific milestones. The company successfully deployed its #AQ 64 Tempo system (capable of running large and complex quantum circuits) three months ahead of schedule and achieved a record two-qubit fidelity of 99.99% (meaning the system executes two-qubit operations correctly 99.99% of the time).\nIonQ is focused on expanding its presence beyond quantum computing, into associated areas, such as quantum networking, sensing, and security, through targeted acquisitions, including that of Oxford Ionics, Vector Atomic, and a controlling stake in ID Quantique. The company is also exploring commercialization opportunities through large-scale solutions-based contracts and a land-and-expand strategy. The company is thus striving to build long-term and sticky client relationships.\n\nStill, investors should remain aware of IonQ's risks, considering that the company is loss-making and incurring significant expenses on innovation. IonQ stock trades at 208.3 times sales, which is also very rich. Yet, the stock can be a good addition provided it does not exceed 5% of a large diversified portfolio.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "10 Most Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Invest in\n\nJabran Kundi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:42 AM PST 17 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nSemiconductor stocks have been a big beneficiary of the AI boom since 2022. At the same time, they are also prone to escalations in the US-China AI trade war, which dominates headlines and often brings negative sentiment into the market.\nOne such development happened on December 9, when Reuters reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had allowed Nvidia to sell its H200 processors to China. According to the news, the U.S. Commerce Department was working on the details of the agreement. This agreement would also apply to all other chipmakers. As a result, the broader semiconductor sector is likely to generate positive sentiment going forward.\nHere is how Nvidia reacted to the development:\nDespite this deal, China will still not have access to the latest Blackwell and Rubin chips that Nvidia makes. In this way, the U.S. government appears to have struck a balance between continuing trade with China and denying it access to state-of-the-art technology.\nHere is how Donald Trump announced the deal on the Truth social media platform:\nThese developments should be seen as supportive of the semiconductor industry in the near term. With that background, we have evaluated the most undervalued semiconductor stocks to invest in and present the list below.\nOur Methodology To identify the 10 most undervalued stocks to invest in, we first screened all semiconductor companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined their forward P/E ratios to identify those trading at least 25% below the NASDAQ forward P/E of 26.35. Finally, we selected the top 10 stocks with the best potential upside based on Wall Street consensus and ranked them accordingly. Additionally, we also included data on hedge fund holdings in these companies as of Q3 2025 to provide further insight into investor interest.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 427.7% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 264 percentage points ( see more details here ).\n\nStory Continues\n10. ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: ON ) Potential Upside: 3.63%\nForward P/E: 19.01\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 45\nOn December 11, ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) announced that it was extending its longstanding strategic partnership with the automotive supplier FORVIA HELLA. Across its advanced automotive platforms, FORVIA HELLA will incorporate ON Semiconductor’s PowerTrench T10 MOSFET technology under the new agreement.\n\nThe T10 power MOSFETs are designed to reduce system-level costs for automotive applications while increasing efficiency and power density. They are produced at ON Semiconductor’s state-of-the-art facility based in East Fishkill, New York. With ultra-low conduction and switching losses, ON’s T10 power MOSFETs deliver higher density while maintaining a compact design. By reducing both drain-to-source resistance and gate charge, the shielded-gate power trench MOSFET technology also lowers output capacitance.\nThe companies intend to address the increasing electrical demands of autonomous driving, safety systems, and electrification by combining FORVIA HELLA’s expertise in automotive systems with ON Semiconductor’s intelligent power solutions.\nExecutive Vice President of Purchasing at FORVIA HELLA, Sven Hoenecke, pointed out the impact of this collaboration by saying:\nGroup President of Onsemi’s Power Solutions Group, Simon Keeton, highlighted that the extended agreement reinforces ON’s 25-year partnership with FORVIA HELLA.\nON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: ON) provides intelligent sensing and power solutions. The company operates through the Analog and Mixed-Signal Group, Power Solutions Group, and Intelligent Sensing Group segments. ON Semiconductor is based in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\n9. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ: SYNA ) Potential Upside: 6.9%\nForward P/E: 14.98\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 27\nOn December 11, Barclays’ analyst Thomas O’Malley reaffirmed his Buy rating on the company with a price target of $78. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) enjoys a consensus Buy rating with a median upside potential of 6.9%.\nThe upside also received a boost on December 5 when Northland Capital Markets initiated coverage of the company with a Strong Buy rating. The coverage highlighted SYNA’s forward earnings estimates, where the research firm expects FY26 earnings of $1.11 and FY27 earnings of $1.92.\n\nWhile the stock’s 6% YTD decline has kept the shares undervalued, the outlook looks bright if management’s guidance is anything to go by. Even this year, the company’s revenue growth was driven by its Core IoT portfolio, which grew 74% YoY. The growth is expected to continue, as per CEO Rahul Patel, who mentioned the next-generation Synaptics Astra Edge AI processors, which are going to power the next generation of computing at the edge.\nThe company’s intentions to target this emerging market are what make it an exciting and undervalued play to bet on. The CEO noted that while the company is currently relying on existing markets, once AI on the Edge becomes the norm, SYNA's market will expand significantly.\nSynaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a semiconductor equipment maker that develops products like displays, touch systems, biometrics, audio, wireless, and voice processing for various devices. It was founded in 1986 and is based in San Jose, California.\n8. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Potential Upside: 8.39%\nForward P/E: 13.94\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\nOn December 16, C J Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald maintained his Buy rating on Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) and raised the price target from $150 to $185. The research firm’s price target remains well below the $200 median target per CNN’s compilation of 36 analyst ratings. The company has also announced on December 18 that it completed the acquisition of Alphawave Semi. The acquisition is intended to help Qualcomm enter the data center market, a move it made earlier this year after exiting the market in 2018.\n\nQualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) continues to surge amid analyst optimism and positive developments. The company’s Snapdragon Cockpit Elite technology will be on display at the CES 2026, according to LG Electronics’ press release on December 10. LG is set to showcase its Qualcomm-powered AI Cabin Platform at the event.\nQualcomm’s technology will enable the AI Cabin to perform all AI calculations on the device without requiring a connection to any external server. This will significantly improve real-time AI assistance. The press release mentioned examples where this technology will be useful. If a driver fails to notice a merging vehicle, they can be quickly alerted by the Qualcomm System-on-Chip (SoC). The lack of a cloud connection also reduces vulnerabilities, such as latency and hacking.\n\nQualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops and commercializes foundational technologies for the wireless industry worldwide. The company is operating through Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL), Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI).\n7. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: SWKS ) Potential Upside: 9.89%\nForward P/E: 13.71\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 35\nOn December 11, Thomas O’Kalley of Barclays maintained his Hold rating on Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SKWS) stock, along with the price target of $88. This price target remains well above the median price target of $75 and offers 31% upside from the current level.\n\nSWKS has struggled since the announcement of the merger with Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), but the stock has been rallying for the past month, and Barclays’ $88 price target may add further to the bullish sentiment. Investors were possibly spooked by the amount of time it may take for the merger to financially benefit the company. The merger is expected to be executed by early 2027, with about $500 million in cost savings expected by 2028-2029. The cash-and-stock transaction is weighing heavily on the stock, as is the risk of regulatory approval.\nThe regulatory risk stems from the fact that both Skyworks and Qorvo are competitors and significant suppliers for one company: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). A merger would reduce competition in RF components, increasing Apple’s dependence on a single supplier. This reduced competition is generally bad for the end consumer, which is why regulators usually side with companies like Apple in such merger scenarios.\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) specializes in radio-frequency and analog solutions. These products enable wireless connectivity across industrial applications, automotive systems, and smartphones, among other things. It is based in Irvine, California.\n6. NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI ) Potential Upside: 15.33% Forward P/E: 16.86 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53 On December 16, Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) and raised the price target from $255 to $265. According to estimates from 34 analysts covering the stock on Wall Street, the stock has a median upside target of $265, exactly where BofA’s price target now stands. Cantor Fitzgerald Research also made some comments on the semiconductor industry on December 16, expecting relative outperformance from NXPI stock. These two positive analyst responses come at a time when investors are fearing negative sentiment as a result of news coming out of Chandler, where the company’s ECHO fab used to manufacture parts for 5G equipment. According to an NXP spokesperson who spoke to Business Journal on December 13:\nThe Chandler facility is expected to close by 2027 after a lack of ROI on investments amid lower-than-expected global 5G deployments. The firm will completely exit the radio power market while scaling down operations at the Chandler fab. NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) is a designer and manufacturer of semiconductor equipment based in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Its high-performance mixed-signal products are sold globally across markets such as automotive, IoT, mobile, and communication infrastructure.\n\n5. Cirrus Logic Inc (NASDAQ: CRUS ) Potential Upside: 19.66%\nForward P/E: 16.51\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 25\nIn a report released on December 12, Thomas O’Malley, an analyst at Barclays, maintained his Hold rating on Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) stock. He also maintained the $95 price target, originally set on November 5, immediately after the company’s Q2 Fy2026 earnings report.\n\nIn stark contrast to the above, on December 10, analyst Tore Svanberg of Stifel maintained a Buy rating on the stock, assigning a target price of $150. This bullish sentiment stems from the company’s launch of the CS40L5X series on December 9. This is a closed-loop haptics driver for the automotive industry. Cirrus Logic has traditionally been focused on the smartphone market. But the company is now moving into the automotive market to drive growth, and this product launch is a step in that direction. This move will not only help growth but also reduce reliance on a single sector.\nTore Svanberg believes this move aids the company’s drive to focus on the High-Performance Mixed-Signal (HPMS) segment. The stock fell right after the November 4 earnings announcement. However, with this move, analysts remain upbeat about the company’s growth prospects, even as investors exited the stock immediately after the earnings due to relatively disappointing guidance.\n\nCirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) is a fabless semiconductor company that provides low-power, high-precision mixed-signal processing solutions for mobile and consumer applications. The company operates in two main segments, Audio and High-Performance Mixed-Signal (HPMS). It is based in Austin, Texas.\n4. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU ) Potential Upside: 20.42% Forward P/E: 9.48 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105 On December 16, Needham raised Micron Technology’s (NASDAQ:MU) price target from $200 to $300, a staggering 50% increase. The firm also maintained the prior Buy rating on the stock. Needham estimates Micron's tangible book value at $96.15 per share by the fiscal first quarter of 2028, implying a $300 price target with a 3.1x tangible book value multiple. The price target boost comes as analysts foresee demand comfortably outpacing supply throughout the next calendar year. This demand is also likely to contribute to higher DRAM and NAND prices, helping improve Micron’s margins. Micron’s HBM3E and HBM4 capacity is completely booked for the whole of 2026, with margins comfortably above DRAM averages. These DRAM averages are up 162% YoY, clearly reflecting bullish sentiment around the stock. As a result of this demand, Needham estimates Micron will likely update its 2026 capital expenditure forecasts to $20 billion. Just a day prior to this, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson also maintained his Outperform rating on MU, upgrading the price target from $220 to $300. CNN’s analyst estimates show a highest price target of $362, based on 40 price targets. The back-to-back price target upgrades move the stock’s median price target of $280 further above, suggesting Micron is still undervalued according to analysts. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a semiconductor company that provides memory and storage solutions, both of which have become increasingly important in the high-performance computing era. The company employs over 53,000 people and is based in Idaho, United States.\n\n3. ASE Technology Holding Co. (NYSE: ASX ) Potential Upside: 20.85%\nForward P/E: 18.77\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\nOn December 9, ASE Technology Holding Co. (NYSE:ASX) reported its unaudited consolidated net revenues for the month of November. ASX continues to prove its stability and strength in the semiconductor industry. Net revenue totaled NT$58,820 million in November, reflecting a 2.3% month-over-month decline. However, it was 11.1% higher than the same month last year in New Taiwan dollar terms.\n\nIn U.S. dollar terms, revenue totalled $1,903 million, indicating a sequential decline of 3.9% but a strong year-over-year increase of 15.5%. Despite small monthly fluctuations, these numbers demonstrate a steady annual growth, strengthening ASE Technology Holding’s position in the semiconductor sector.\nThe firm’s ATM (assembly, testing, and materials) segment delivered NT$36,082 million in revenue in November. ATM segment’s revenue was slightly up by 0.1% from October in NT$ terms, but saw a strong year-over-year growth of 23.6%. In US dollar terms, the ATM segment posted revenue of $1,167 million, a 1.5% decline from October. It showed a significant 28.5% year-over-year growth. ASX’s November performance highlights solid demand for its assembly and testing business. This segment is contributing substantially to the company’s overall growth trajectory.\n\nASE Technology Holding Co. (NYSE:ASX) provides semiconductor manufacturing services across Taiwan, Europe, the United States, Asia, and global markets. The company operates in four segments: Testing, Packaging, EMS, and Others. It provides front-end engineering testing, semiconductor packaging, final testing, wafer probing, and interconnect materials production services.\n2. Photronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLAB ) Potential Upside: 26.6% Forward P/E: 15.91 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27 Photronics Inc. (NASDAQ:PLAB) boasts significant upside after a strong earnings report and back-to-back analyst upgrades. On December 11, D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely maintained his Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $30 to $45. On the same day, Christian Schwab of Craig-Hallum also assigned a price target of $42, along with a Buy rating. These earnings came as the company continued to ride strong momentum in the last month, resulting in an incredible rally that saw the stock price double in less than a month. On the earnings call, Christian Schwab inquired about the pricing pressure in China. Management replied that it prioritizes its capacity for higher value customers, so if one product faces margin pressure, another is prioritized for production. At the moment, 22nm and 28nm technologies are considered higher-margin and therefore prioritized. Management also confirmed to the analyst that it expects gross margins to stay steady in the near term as it continues to make new investments. When asked about tariffs and other geopolitical issues, the company mentioned that customers have now become used to supply chain disruptions as a result of these factors and therefore factor them in when placing orders, resulting in improved planning that doesn’t hurt the company as it did before. Photronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLAB) manufactures semiconductor chips. It provides photomasks containing microscopic images of the circuits printed on these chips. The company is based in Connecticut, United States.\n\n1. Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (NASDAQ: SIMO ) Potential Upside: 41.89% Forward P/E: 18.19 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36 On December 15, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss maintained his Buy rating on Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (NASDAQ:SIMO). The company now has a median target price of $120, according to CNN’s compilation of 9 analyst ratings, implying 41.89% upside from current levels. This median price target is close to $125 price target that Craig Ellis of B. Riley Securities assigned on November 13. The stock rallied nearly 20% after that rating, but is now dropping back to the same level as the broader market declines. Following the announcement above, the company released the SM8388, a power-efficient SSD controller. Its low power consumption, high performance, high capacity, and relatively low cost make it a leading controller in the market. The enterprise-grade security features further add to the controller’s reliability when deployed in enterprise environments. With the above development, the company now addresses two key bottlenecks facing companies building AI infrastructure: power costs and memory constraints. As AI workloads generate massive amounts of new data, Nearline SSDs become increasingly important. This is an improvement over HDDs, which can’t meet the performance and power-efficiency requirements of these AI workloads, which is why the stock price rose heading into December. Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (NASDAQ:SIMO) develops, manufactures, and supplies essential semiconductor equipment to the electronics market, including flash controllers and storage solutions. It is based in Hong Kong, with offices in Taiwan and the United States.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of SIMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "Why Is Crypto Down Today? – December 18, 2025 “With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days,” says Fadi Aboualfa, Head of Research at Cooper.\n\nSead Fadilpašić\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:16 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nCOIN\n\nNVDA\n\nAfter a day of a very minor rise, the crypto market is down today. The cryptocurrency market capitalisation decreased by 1.5% and now stands at $3.01 trillion. Also, 95 of the top 100 coins have gone down over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $129 billion.\nTLDR: Crypto market cap is down on Thursday morning (UTC); 95 of the top 100 coins and all the top 10 coins have gone down today; BTC decreased by 0.3% to $86,722, and ETH is down 3.9% to $2,834; BTC positioning remains decisively bearish; ‘ETH tells a more nuanced story’; Bitcoin has shown a repeatable pattern in 2024 and 2025; BTC may move above $140,000 in the next 180 days; Bitcoin’s volatility decreased below Nvidia’s in 2025; Anatoly Aksakov affirmed a strict ban on crypto payments in Russia; Coinbase expanded into stocks, advanced trading, and built-in prediction markets; US BTC spot ETFs saw inflows of $457.29 million, and BTC spot ETFs recorded $22.43 million in outflows; Crypto market sentiment keeps falling.\n\nCrypto Winners &#038; Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices decrease over the past 24 hours.\nBitcoin (BTC) is down by just 0.3% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $86,722. This is the category’s smallest drop.\nBitcoin (BTC)24h7d30d1yAll time\nEthereum (ETH) is down by just 3.9%, now changing hands at $2,834.\n\nThe highest drop is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 5% to the price of $0.1245.\nXRP follows with a change of 4.6%, now standing at $1.84.\nWhen it comes to the top 100 coins, 95 coins saw decreases. Of these, three are double-digit.\nLEO Token (LEO) is at the top of the red list, having dropped 27.1% to the price of $6.58.\nHyperliquid (HYPE) and Pump.fun (PUMP) follow, with falls of 12% and 11.8%, currently changing hands at $23.94 and $0.002021.\nOn the green side, Canton (CC) appreciated the most: 5.6% to $0.07517.\nMidnight (NIGHT) is next with a 3.9% rise, now trading at $0.06385.\nBitcoin’s volatility becoming more restrained, decreasing below the volatility of Nvidia shares in 2025, Bitwise says. According to the analysts, this shifts reflects a maturing and more diversified investor base.\n\nMeanwhile, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Markets , affirmed a strict ban on payments using crypto in the country.\n“We must understand that cryptocurrencies will never become money within our country,” he said. “They can only be used as an investment instrument. If payment is required, it will only be in rubles.”\nBTC Hitting $140,000 in 180 Days Fadi Aboualfa, Head of Research at Cooper , commented that Bitcoin has shown the same repeatable pattern in 2024 and 2025. Price hits all-time highs, corrects sharply, and “then finds support almost perfectly at its ETF investor cost basis before beginning the next expansion.”\n\nStory Continues\n“Institutions are not ‘staking sats’,” Aboualfa says. In fact, he argues, “most do not care about sats at all now that Bitcoin is accessible through equities-style ETF shares. They care about risk-adjusted contribution to a portfolio.”\nNotably, without rebalancing, a modest 2% BTC moves to 6.2% in less than 180 days during these cycles. “A 5% allocation drifts dangerously close to double-digit.”\n\n“With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days. If cost basis rises 10% to 15% as in prior cycles, the resulting premium seen at past peaks produces a target range of $138,000 to $148,000.”\nMoreover, Nick Forster, Founder at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , noted that markets continue to slide as we head into the New Year, “with prices sitting on a knife’s edge amid mixed U.S. economic data and persistent macro uncertainty.”\nHe says that BTC positioning remains decisively bearish. Traders are pricing continued downside risk through Q1 and Q2, as ongoing sell pressure from previously inactive wallets weighs on spot prices.\n“Looking into the December 26 expiry, positioning is increasingly polarised. On the upside, there is a notable build-up of calls at the $100K and $120K strikes, suggesting some traders are still holding out for a sharp relief rally. On the downside, bears have accumulated substantial put exposure at the $85K strike, pointing to expectations of BTC sliding below $85K in the near term.”\n\nThe probability of NTC reaching $100,000 is now near 30%, while the chance of reclaiming ATHs sits at around 10%, Forster says.\n“ETH tells a more nuanced story,” he says. Signals show a far more balanced outlook into the end of Q2 next year compared to BTC’s persistent bearish bias.\nThere’s a 45% chance that ETH reclaims $3,000 by the end of Q1 next year. Also, there’s a 25% chance it surpasses $4,000 over the same period.\nOverall, Forster says, “volatility remains elevated and positioning is defensive, but upside tails have not been fully abandoned as markets brace for a volatile start to the year.”\nLevels &#038; Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC stood at $86,722. The day began with $87,011, trading relatively sideways before briefly jumping to the intraday high of $90,164.\nIt quickly plunged to the intraday low, however, of $85,373. It’s been trading sideways again since.\nBitcoin could further decrease towards $84,000, followed by the $82,300-83,200 range. A higher drop would pull the price below $80,000. On the other hand, a rise may see BTC reclaim 90,000.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView\nEthereum is currently changing hands at $2,834. Initially, it went up from about $2,906 to the high of $3,021.\nIt then plunged to the intraday low of $2,796. Like BTC, it has traded sideways up until the time of writing.\nIf the price continues falling, ETH may see a pullback to the $2,700 level, followed by $2,630. A market uptick could push it upwards to regain the $3,000, if it manages to hold it.\nEthereum (ETH)24h7d30d1yAll time\nMeanwhile, the crypto market sentiment continues decreasing within the fear territory.\nThe crypto fear and greed index stands at 22 today, compared to 25 yesterday. It is moving towards the extreme fear zone.\nThe fear and uncertainty is increasing as the market continues trending downward. Analysts argue that this may continue in the short- and mid-term at least.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nETFs Sees a Mixed Wednesday The US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke the outflow streak on Wednesday, with $457.29 million in inflows.

Moreover, BlackRock posted $111.17 million in inflows.\n\nOn the red side, Ark&#038;21Shares let go of $36.96 million.

By the closing time on 17 December, the S&#038;P 500 was down by 1.16%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 1.93%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.47%. This is the major indices’ fourth successive decline, as AI bubble worries increase.\n\nIs this drop sustainable?\nThis latest decrease was expected, many analysts argue. It may continue in the short term.

      "Content": "Can NBIS AI Cloud 3.1's Blackwell Ultra Launch Trigger Growth Momentum?\n\nShreya Majumder\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:14 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWV\n\nAMZN\n\nNBIS\n\nAs AI initiatives grow, enterprises face new operational challenges regarding GPU availability across regions, planning capacity for multiple teams and ensuring predictable access to resources. Nebius Group N.V. NBIS is addressing these needs with the launch of Nebius AI Cloud 3.1, the latest release of its full-stack AI cloud platform. Building on the Nebius AI Cloud “Aether\" framework, version 3.1 infuses next-generation NVIDIA NVDA Blackwell Ultra infrastructure, transparent GPU capacity management, expanded AI/ML developer tools and improved enterprise security and compliance features. These updates position Nebius AI Cloud as an ideal platform for enterprises scaling AI workloads in production.\n\nNebius is now rolling out NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra globally, including HGX B300 and GB300 NVL72 systems, becoming the first cloud provider in Europe to run both in production and the first worldwide to deploy GB300 NVL72 with 800 Gbps NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand. Paired with accelerated networking, storage and filesystem scaling, Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 removes AI infrastructure bottlenecks and reinforces its position with top MLPerf Training v5.1 results. Furthermore, version 3.1 introduces Capacity Blocks and a real-time dashboard, providing enterprises with full visibility into reserved GPU capacity across regions. Additionally, project-level quotas and new storage rules enable tighter control over resources and costs.\nBeyond infrastructure and operations, Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 expands its ecosystem to streamline AI development, offering simplified access to NVIDIA BioNeMo NIM microservices for healthcare and life sciences without requiring NGC keys or NVDA AI Enterprise licenses. The release also enhances developer experience with improved Slurm orchestration, FOCUS-compliant billing and a refined console, while strengthening enterprise security with HIPAA-ready audit logs, granular access controls, VPC security groups and Microsoft Entra ID–based IAM for regulated and government workloads.\n\nAs AI models grow larger and more complex, platforms like Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 are poised to play a key role in enabling enterprises to innovate faster, without compromising on performance, governance, or control. While capacity expansion supports NBIS’ revenue outlook, with 2025 guidance now set at $500–$550 million, up from the prior $450-$630 million, near-term risks remain. Power constraints, supply-chain uncertainty and intensifying competition from top players like Amazon AMZN and rivals such as CoreWeave, Inc . CRWV could limit capacity growth and weigh on execution in an increasingly crowded AI infrastructure market.\n\nStory Continues\nRising Rivalry to Cloud NBIS’ AI Infrastructure Growth Path CoreWeave continues to ramp up investments in data centers and server infrastructure to keep pace with the ongoing traction in customer demand. CRWV grew from a niche GPU provider into a leading AI cloud by buying large GPU inventories and carving out relationships with AI labs and companies that need lots of H100/Blackwell-class GPUs. A major force behind its momentum is its multi-billion-dollar agreements with NVDA. Third-quarter highlights include being the first to deploy NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems for large-scale frontier AI workloads and the first to offer NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances, giving CRWV an early lead in real-time AI and simulation workloads.\n\nAmazon is rapidly expanding AWS’ power capacity, doubling what it had in 2022 and on track to double again by 2027. In the fourth quarter alone, it expects to add another 1 GW. The expansion includes power, data centers and chips like AWS’ Trainium and NVIDIA GPUs. AMZN continues to deepen partnerships with NVIDIA, AMD and Intel, placing large chip orders and expanding these relationships over time. Backed by strong security, performance and enterprise focus, AWS continues to dominate major enterprise and government cloud migrations, driving AI demand. To support this, AWS added over 3.8 GW of capacity in the past year, more than any other cloud provider.\nNBIS’ Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Nebius have gained 179% in the past year compared with the Internet – Software and Services industry’s growth of 26.8%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation-wise, Nebius seems overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of F.

Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ) drew a cautious view due to challenges in its foundry operations.\nIn memory and chip equipment, Micron ( NASDAQ:MU ) leads the way, with Sandisk ( NASDAQ:SNDK ) also rated Overweight.

      "Content": "Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.: Why the Mag 7 needs to 'recalibrate'\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is concentrated primarily in the top ten technology stocks, according to Barclays.\nPNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati, Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré , and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss the market's concentration in tech and whether it's time for investors to start selling the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat I mentioned at the top about how much concentration risk there is in the S&P 500. What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

With it, “stocks start to feel like a native internet object, not a brokerage product,” he added.\n“For many users, especially outside the U.S. or EU, this is the first time equities are one tap away: no broker account, no complex onboarding, fractional by default,” he noted.\n“That said, there’s a key friction point people underestimate: these assets still trade 24/5, not true 24/7.” Even though the tokenized assets “live on-chain and can technically move anytime,” pricing, corporate actions, and redemptions “remain anchored to U.S. market hours,” Dadybayo said. “For a crypto-native audience used to always-on DeFi, weekends are effectively dead time, which breaks the mental model of seamless on-chain finance,” he opined. “In practice, this blends TradFi constraints with crypto UX,” one that is “powerful, but not fully native yet.”\n\nThe launch marks one of the clearest attempts yet to bring tokenized financial products to mass-market distribution channels, rather than keeping them confined to crypto-native wallets and exchanges.\nThe aim is to bring “tokenized equities onto truly open infrastructure,” Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said in a statement.\nSethi believes that what counts is “the real promise of tokenization,” one that could become “neutral, composable building blocks that anyone can use.”\nTelegram Goes Exclusive With TON, Barring Other Networks From Apps and Games\nTelegram claims to have more than 900 million users globally, while TON Wallet reports nearly 100 million users, according to project figures.\nxStocks, meanwhile, offers a fully collateralized, one-to-one backed product, backed by underlying equities and ETFs held through regulated partners. The tokens are designed to trade on-chain while tracking the price of the underlying assets, offering exposure without direct ownership of the shares.\n\nHowever, the service is not available to U.S. users and is limited to jurisdictions where the tokens can be legally offered, given how xStocks has not registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933.\nThat legal structure relies on careful jurisdictional controls, which could limit how broadly the distribution model can expand, particularly as regulators scrutinize tokenized representations of traditional assets more closely.\n\nStory Continues\nTelegram Founder Alleges French Role in Moldova Vote Censorship\nTokenized equities have existed for years, but adoption has remained limited. Earlier efforts often struggled with liquidity, regulatory uncertainty, and narrow user bases concentrated on crypto trading platforms.\nBy embedding tokenized assets within a consumer messaging app with a broad user base, Kraken and its partners appear to be testing whether distribution could have been the missing ingredient for scaling.\nFor Kraken, the TON rollout fits into a wider strategy. The exchange recently announced plans to acquire Backed Finance to consolidate issuance, trading, and settlement of xStocks. Support for additional blockchains is already underway, including Mantle and TRON.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Its EngineeringOS platform brings people, data, and AI into one workspace to support faster design decisions and capture expert knowledge as part of daily work.\nCoLab co-founder and CEO Adam Keating said: “This is about accelerating the development of products that matter.\n\n“Whether it’s national security, healthcare, or the energy transition, progress in these areas depends on how quickly engineering teams can design, test, and refine complex physical systems. At CoLab, we envision a future where they can do those things much faster.”\nWithin the Nvidia Inception programme, CoLab will explore how Nvidia platforms that support advanced simulation, training environments and synthetic data generation can align with its decision-making workflows.\nCoLab intends to bring outputs from these tools into a structured process so that relevant data reaches specific engineers at appropriate points in the design cycle.\nCoLab co-founder and chief technology officer Jeremy Andrews said: “AI will accelerate how designs are generated and validated.\n\n“But the limiting factor will be decision-making. Our focus is on capturing design intent — the discussions, rationale, and trade-offs behind engineering decisions — and using that context to make AI outputs more relevant and consistent with how teams actually work.”\nCoLab also plans to examine how to use Nvidia technologies for AI training and evaluation.\nThe company said that its platform records a dataset of engineering knowledge through digital design reviews, capturing a continuing record of why decisions were made as well as what changed.\nIn November 2025, CoLab announced a $72M USD Series C funding round led by Intrepid Growth Partners. The company said it will use the funds to develop new AI agents, build integrations with other engineering and AI applications, expand partnerships, and scale its go-to-market teams. CoLab also indicated that it expects to make several product and partnership announcements before the end of the year.\n\nStory Continues\n\"CoLab joins Nvidia Inception to speed AI adoption in engineering\" was originally created and published by Verdict , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Bitwise Asset Management’s 2026 forecast anticipates the launch of more than 100 new crypto-linked ETFs, driven by the SEC’s streamlined listing standards effective from October 2025.\nWhile the outlook projects new all-time highs for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart warns that a significant shakeout may be inevitable as the sector becomes overcrowded.\n\nBitwise Shares 11 Crypto Predictions for 2026 Bitwise has made 10 projects for 2026, spanning crypto and ETF markets that investors will track closely. According to the crypto index fund manager:\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana will set new all-time highs\nBitcoin will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs\nBitcoin will be less volatile than Nvidia.\nETFs will purchase more than 100% of the new supply of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as institutional demand accelerates.\nCrypto equities will outperform tech equities.\nPolymarket open interest will set a new all-time high, surpassing 2024 election levels.\nStablecoins will be blamed for destabilizing an emerging market currency.\nOnchain vaults will double in AUM.\nEthereum and Solana will set new all-time highs (if the CLARITY Act passes).\nHalf of Ivy League endowments will invest in crypto.\nMore than 100 crypto-linked ETFs will launch in the US.\nBitcoin’s correlation to stocks will fall.\n\nA Wave of ETF Liquidations Could Occur in 2026, James Seyffart The eleventh prediction turned heads, becoming of particular concern for analysts. The surge of anticipated crypto-linked ETF launches follows a major regulatory shift.\nIn September 2025, the SEC introduced generic listing standards for commodity-based trust shares, including crypto assets.\nThis change allows ETFs to list without individualized review, reducing delays and uncertainty.\nBitwise expects this regulatory clarity to drive institutional adoption and fresh inflows into crypto ETFs in 2026.\nhttps://twitter.com/BitwiseInvest/status/2001307177084957053?s=20\n\n繼續閱讀\nBitcoin ETF Dominance and Altcoin Saturation Bloomberg data shows 90 existing crypto ETPs managing $153 billion, with 125 filings pending. Bitcoin leads with $125 billion across 60 products, while Ethereum follows at $22 billion in 25 ETFs.\nAltcoins like XRP and Solana remain niche, with 11–13 products each and $1.5–$1.6 billion in assets, signaling rising saturation risks.\nWith the market poised to be flooded, analysts anticipate direct competition for investor capital. However, historical trends suggest caution, with roughly 40% of ETFs launched since 2010 eventually closing, often due to insufficient assets or trading volume.\nThe Coming Crypto ETF Shakeout: Winners, Losers, and the Rise of ‘Zombie’ Assets Seyffart’s warning reflects a broader concern that fast expansion often precedes consolidation. Crypto ETFs that fail to attract sufficient AUM, differentiate their strategies, or establish strong distribution networks may face early closure.\nProducts offering specialized exposure strategies, income features, or tailored risk profiles could establish lasting positions.\nChris Matta, CEO of Liquid Collective, echoes this concern in the context of “zombie” projects, describing crypto assets with market caps of $1 billion or more but minimal development.\nTherefore, investors entering the ETF space will need to be highly selective. Trading liquidity, tracking accuracy, fee structures, and issuer credibility will be crucial in distinguishing sustainable products from those that are likely to fail.\nMeanwhile, Bitwise’s bullish predictions suggest that leading ETFs tied to major assets may continue to benefit from sustained institutional inflows.\n\nThe expected wave of liquidations by late 2027 will likely reshape the sector, consolidating capital among the strongest products.\nWhile disruptive, the process may ultimately strengthen the US crypto ETF market by:\nRemoving weak offerings,\nClarifying choices for investors, and\nHighlighting differentiated strategies.\nThe question remains: in a crowded ETF sector, which products will survive and which will join the growing ranks of crypto’s forgotten “zombie” assets?\nRead original story The 11th Crypto Prediction from Bitwise May Not Survive—James Seyffart Warns by Lockridge Okoth at beincrypto.com\n\n條款 及 私隱政策\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Bitcoin has moved 68% between its 2025 low of around $75,000 in April and its all-time high of $126,000 reached in early October.\nNvidia, by comparison, has recorded a much wider 120% swing, rising from a low near $94 in early April to a peak of $207 later in the year.\nDespite Nvidia’s higher volatility, the chipmaker’s shares have delivered stronger returns.\nNvidia is up roughly 27% year-to-date, while Bitcoin has slipped about 8% since the start of the year as crypto markets have increasingly decoupled from equities.\n\nBitwise sees the calmer price action as a structural shift rather than a temporary phase. The firm said traditional market forces that once drove extreme crypto cycles, such as leverage-fueled speculation and sharp reactions to halving events, are losing influence.\nLooking ahead, Bitwise struck an optimistic tone on Bitcoin’s broader outlook. The firm expects Bitcoin to set a new all-time high and break away from the historical four-year cycle that has shaped previous bull and bear markets.\nIt also predicts deeper institutional involvement in 2026, naming banks such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch as potential entrants.\n\nStory Continues\nBitcoin’s Long-Term Holder Selling May Be Nearing Its End: K33 Bitcoin has seen sustained sell-side pressure from long-term holders since 2024, but that trend may be nearing exhaustion , according to a new report from research and brokerage firm K33.\nThe firm estimates that around 1.6 million BTC, worth roughly $138 billion, has re-entered circulation over the past two years as early investors took profits.\n\nK33 head of research Vetle Lunde said the scale of these movements points to deliberate selling rather than technical factors like wallet consolidation or ETF-related transfers.\nThe report notes that 2024 and 2025 rank among the largest years on record for long-term supply reactivation, driven not by speculation, but by direct selling into deeper institutional liquidity.\nRead original story Bitcoin Now Less Volatile Than Nvidia as Investor Base Broadens, Says Bitwise by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

On December 9, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri reiterated a Buy rating and a $235 price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The positive stance comes as Jefferies continues to doubt the demand for the company’s H200 chips in China.\nEven with the US clearing Nvidia to sell the chips to Chinese clients, Jefferies has questioned the demand as the country prioritizes domestic alternatives. That’s because the H200 processors are the second-best AI chips with reduced capabilities.\nThe research firm warns that the company could feel the brunt of the Chinese government’s push for independence in the advanced AI processor. That’s in part because Chinese AI model performance is advancing, with Moonshot’s Kimi K2 Thinking model rising to fourth globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia has partnered with Mistral AI to accelerate the development of a new family of Open Models. Mistral 3 family is the latest model, optimized for Nvidia platforms and designed for distributed intelligence from the cloud to the edge. The models deliver industry-leading accuracy and efficiency for enterprise AI and are available for use in the cloud, data centers, or at the edge. Additionally, the new models are tailored to enable researchers and developers to experiment with and accelerate AI innovation.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and sells specialized processors, initially for gaming but now also crucial for AI, data centers, professional visualization, and the automotive industry. It developed the graphics processing unit (GPU) and the CUDA parallel computing platform, which allows its GPUs to perform tasks beyond graphics.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

On December 12, Reuters reported that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) informed Chinese clients that it is evaluating adding production capacity for its powerful H200 AI chips. This comes after orders surpassed its current output level.\nTo provide a brief background, the US President Donald Trump recently announced that the US government will allow the company to export H200 processors to China and take a 25% fee on such sales. In addition to the above, Reuters also reported that major Chinese companies, such as Alibaba and ByteDance, reached out to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with regards to purchasing H200, and they are keen to place large orders.\n\nElsewhere, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) highlighted that the world hyperscalers, which is a trillion-dollar industry, continue to transform search recommendations and content understanding from classical machine learning to Gen AI. NVIDIA CUDA tends to excel at both.\nAt Meta, AI recommendation systems continue to deliver better quality and more relevant content, because of which more time is being spent on apps like Facebook and Threads. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) further highlighted that analyst expectations for top CSPs and hyperscalers in 2026 aggregate CapEx continued to rise and is now at ~$600 billion, over $200 billion increase as compared to the start of the year.\nIn a different development, on December 8, Atif Malik from Citi maintained a “Buy” rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock, with a price objective of $270.00.

Currently on analysts’ watchlists, Nvidia has a consensus Buy rating with a $250 average price target.\nOn December 11, Vivek Arya of Bank of America reiterated its $275 price target on the company with a Buy Rating. BofA cited Nvidia’s commanding market share in the AI compute and networking sectors as the primary reason for maintaining its position. However, this positive view is counterbalanced by several risk factors, including the irregular nature of global AI projects, the cyclical variability of the gaming market, and outstanding concerns regarding the availability and access to power.\nEarlier on December 9, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained his Overweight rating on the Nvidia’s shares with a $265 price target. The analyst upgraded his evaluation of Nvidia after official statements confirmed that the Trump Administration had finalized its plans to remove export restrictions on Nvidia’s H200 chips being sold to China. Rakers characterized this development as an incremental positive and estimated that it could potentially generate an additional $25 billion to $30 billion in annual revenue for the company and add 60 to 70 cents per share to earnings.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company that provides graphics and compute & networking solutions in the US, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and internationally.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "3 Ultra-Safe Vanguard ETFs to Buy, Even if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:35 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points The Total Stock Market ETF is more diversified than an S&P 500 index fund.\nLarge-cap value stocks tend to hold up well during stock market sell-offs.\nThe consumer staples sector contains many high-yielding stocks at reasonable valuations.\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF ›\n\nIf the calendar year ended at the time of this writing, the S&P 500 would be up over 15% in 2025 -- a strong encore to over 20% gains in 2024 and 2023 . Whereas historically, the S&P 500 has produced an average annual total return of 9% to 10%.\nHowever, there are valid reasons why the S&P 500 is rising so rapidly. Nvidia and 19 other stocks make up around half of the index. Many of these companies have demonstrated solid earnings growth and high margins.\nInvestors looking to diversify their portfolios with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have come to the right place. Investment management firm Vanguard offers some of the lowest-cost ETFs available. It can charge low fees because it manages a massive amount of assets.\nHere's why the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEMKT: VTI) , the Vanguard Value ETF (NYSEMKT: VTV) , and the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEMKT: VDC) are good buys even if the stock market falls in 2026.\n1. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF The Total Stock Market fund is the largest ETF or index fund in the world -- surpassing $2 trillion in net assets earlier this year. As the largest companies have grown larger, the S&P 500 has expanded to comprise a greater share of the total U.S. stock market. But it's not the entire market.\n\nThe Total Stock Market ETF fund comprises thousands of companies not included in the S&P 500. Combined, these non-S&P 500 companies make up around 16% of the stock market. That's the key difference between the Total Stock Market fund and an S&P 500 index fund.\nOver the long run, the Total Stock Market ETF will perform similarly to the S&P 500. But the Total Stock Market ETF could be a better buy for investors who want to fully participate in the market.\nIt's also a better choice for investors concerned about a stock market sell-off, as many smaller companies have inexpensive valuations compared to high-flying top tech names. There's a psychological component to owning the Total Stock Market ETF as well. If you believe that the U.S. stock market will go up in value over time, then it can be easier to hold an ETF like the Total Stock Market fund through periods of volatility than individual stocks, where you can talk yourself into a bad reason to sell them.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Vanguard Value ETF The Vanguard Value ETF is a great investment option for investors looking to participate in the stock market with reduced exposure to tech-focused companies compared to the S&P 500. You won't find any \"Magnificent Seven\" names in this ETF.\nThe largest holdings are JPMorgan Chase , Berkshire Hathaway , ExxonMobil , Johnson & Johnson , and Walmart . The financials, industrials, and healthcare sectors dominate this ETF, with many companies offering attractive valuations and growing dividends.\n\nValue stocks tend to hold up better during a market sell-off because they are priced based on their existing earnings rather than potential earnings.\nThe Value ETF yields 2.1% and has a 21.2 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 1.1% yield and 29.1 P/E for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -- making it a good choice for risk-averse investors looking to boost their passive income stream.\n3. Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF The consumer staples sector has been among the worst-performing sectors in 2025 as investors gravitate toward growth stocks and business-to-business companies.\nConsumers are pulling back on spending, and inflation has made it challenging for consumer staples companies to pass along higher costs to strained consumers. Many leading consumer staples companies are experiencing weak volume and margin pressure.\n\nThe Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF is an excellent choice for value-focused investors looking to boost their passive income. The ETF yields 2.2% and features a 23.6 P/E ratio. Walmart , Costco Wholesale , Procter & Gamble , Coca-Cola , and PepsiCo make up 51.8% of the fund. These reliable companies should do well during a recession thanks to their elite supply chains and pricing power.\nEven with consumers looking to stretch their dollars, the sector should hold up well during a stock market sell-off, especially if it has nothing to do with consumer staples -- like a downturn in artificial intelligence spending. For example, consider that during the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off on April 8, the S&P 500 was down by just over 15% year to date, while the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF was down by just 3.1%.\n\nUsing ETFs in a diversified portfolio In today's age of low-cost ETFs, it's easy to use ETFs as tools in your portfolio. If you like investing in individual stocks in sectors where you feel you have a comprehensive understanding, then ETFs can be used as role players to fill a need outside of your wheelhouse. For example, if your portfolio is heavily concentrated in AI growth stocks, but you want to allocate some capital to dividend-paying stocks, a simple way to do that would be to buy the Vanguard Value ETF or the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF. Or if you're looking for a catch-all way to invest in the broader market without having to pay attention to individual stocks, then the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF could be for you.\n\nThe best way to navigate potential market volatility isn't to hit the sell button, run for the exits, and wait for prices to fall before jumping back in. Rather, a better approach is to align your holdings with your risk tolerance, hold stocks during periods of volatility, and compound returns over time.\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF right now?

      "Content": "What Are 3 of the Best AI Stocks to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points TSMC has a technological monopoly on advanced AI chip manufacturing.\nNvidia is responsible for designing critical pieces of the modern data center.\nMicrosoft can easily monetize AI by inserting it into its software ecosystem.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) is solidifying its mark in the world, it would be naive not to expect that some of today's AI-focused companies won't stand the test of time. In some cases, these companies may be too niche to remain independent and will ultimately become acquisition targets. Others simply won't survive.\nWhen I think about AI stocks I want to hold for the next decade, I look for companies that are key players in different phases of the AI pipeline. The following three companies fit that description and appear to be good long-term investments.\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) isn't an AI stock in the traditional sense, but it's one of the more important companies in the space. As the world's leading third-party semiconductor foundry, TSMC manufactures chips designed by \"fabless\" companies that don't own the facilities to produce them themselves.\n\nWhen it comes to manufacturing the types of advanced AI chips used in data centers, TSMC essentially has a monopoly . With its superior technology and efficiency, it's the go-to company, and there's not a close second.\nCompanies like Intel and Samsung also operate foundries that can deliver chips using some of the most cutting-edge process nodes, but they have issues -- such as production delays and low yields -- that make them far less reliable. Not only has this made AI chips a large part of TSMC's business, but it has also given it more pricing power.\nBoth TSMC's revenue and operating income (profit from core operations) have grown impressively over the past couple of years; however, its dominance in advanced AI chips has enabled it to grow its profits at a significantly faster pace.\n2. Nvidia Whereas TSMC is the manufacturer that brings chips to life, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the designer behind critical parts of the AI ecosystem. Its lead in the parallel processor market, in particular, is why the stock skyrocketed over the past few years, turning it into the world's most valuable public company, with a market cap of nearly $4.2 trillion.\n\nFor a time, Nvidia was known for making graphics processing units (GPUs) that were primarily used to improve the performance of video games. However, the company and other clients realized that its parallel processors were useful for other types of computing workloads, and it began to pivot its focus toward those markets. Its latest pivot came as the AI trend picked up steam, and demand soared for hardware capable of handling the massive data sets involved in that technology. Many of the data center chips used for training and operating AI systems come from Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nOf the $57 billion in revenue Nvidia made in the third quarter (up 62% year over year), $51.2 billion (up 66%) came from its data center segment.\nWhile Nvidia's GPUs and other hardware have gotten a lot of attention, CUDA -- its parallel computing platform and application programming interface -- has flown under the radar a bit. CUDA allows Nvidia's chips to be programmed for specific tasks, and the developers who work in AI are widely familiar with it, which adds to the company's moat. Moreover, CUDA programs only run on Nvidia chips, which further increases the switching costs associated with purchasing AI accelerator chips from competitors.\n\nOther major tech companies, including Alphabet and Amazon , have begun designing their own AI chips, often with the assistance of Broadcom; however, Nvidia has a significant head start. It will inevitably lose some market share over the next decade, but as the size of the overall AI chip market continues to grow, it should remain relatively stable.\n3. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has two major things working in its favor regarding AI. First, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud infrastructure platform in the world, and a go-to choice for many companies to build and host their own AI apps. Azure's AI capabilities have helped it close the gap a bit with segment leader Amazon Web Services.\n\nThe second major factor is that Microsoft's software portfolio comprises numerous titles and services that hundreds of millions of people use regularly, including Microsoft 365 (Excel, Word, Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.), LinkedIn, GitHub, and the Windows operating system, among others.\nThis allows Microsoft to act as a seamless AI distributor because it can easily add this new technology to software that people are already using, and then monetize it. For many corporations and individuals, paying a relatively small additional fee for Microsoft 365 Copilot is a straightforward decision. It has become another reliable revenue source for Microsoft, and it should only get better as adopting these tools becomes the norm for corporations.\n\nWhile pure-play AI companies, by definition, rely solely on this new tech for their revenues, for Microsoft, AI is more of a bonus. The company's business is well-diversified, spanning software, tech hardware, gaming, cloud computing, and professional networking. Even if the AI hype cools over the next decade, Microsoft's business will remain strong and highly profitable.\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

The company reported earnings per share of $1.30, beating a Street estimate of $1.25.\nNvidia is guiding fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $63.70 billion to $66.30 billion. The analyst estimate is currently $61.48 billion .\n\nDon’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAlso, Nvidia said demand for its newest AI chips continues to accelerate, potentially driving total revenue for its Blackwell and Rubin platforms past the previously announced $500 billion target through 2026.\nAnalyst View Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described the quarter as a \"Massive beat and raise,\" noting that Nvidia lifted its January revenue outlook by $3 billion. He said the company’s commentary made it clear the AI boom is still in its \"early innings,\" calling the report a “Major validation moment from the Godfather of AI, Jensen and Nvidia.\"\n\nAccording to Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, if Nvidia's earnings touch $6.50 per share in fiscal year 2027, which marks a 42% increase from its forecasted $4.57 per share this fiscal year, the stock could hit $292 per share at 45 times earnings.\nAdditionally, economist Mohamed El-Erian noted that the company's quarterly earnings release \"has arguably evolved from a corporate update to a full-blown ‘macro event,’\" which he said illustrates the rapid growth of AI's systemic importance for markets, companies, and the economy.\nExpansion In the Middle East HUMAIN , backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund , expanded its strategic partnership with Nvidia to accelerate sovereign AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the U.S.\n\nStory Continues\nAlso, Oracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL ) is supercharging its Abu Dhabi cloud region with the Middle East’s first Nvidia-powered Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Supercluster .\nSee Also: Missed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Invest Now at Just $0.85 a Share\nOther Key Events Last month, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the growing dominance of the company's CUDA platform, which has become the backbone for nearly every major AI frontier model and an increasingly wide range of scientific and industrial applications.\nThis month, NVIDIA invested roughly $2 billion in Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNPS ) common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share to further expand the partnership.\n\nAlso, the company is expanding its open-source artificial intelligence portfolio with a sweeping set of new models, datasets, and development tools designed to accelerate progress in both digital and physical AI.\nNvidia and Amazon Web Services deepened their long-running partnership at AWS re:Invent with new integrations across interconnect technology, cloud infrastructure, and AI software .\nStock Comparison Year-to-date, Nvidia shares rose 28.4%, compared to the VanEck Fabless Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMHX ), which gained about 28.57% and Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (NYSE: SHOC ), which escalated 46.27% so far this year.\nAlso, the company’s share growth compares favorably with that of its closest peers, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO ) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM ), which rose approximately 46.61% and 45.00%, respectively, so far this year.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nTrending Now:\nWall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share .\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10 . Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery . With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\nThis article Billionaire Investor Adds To Nvidia Position As AI Conviction Builds originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Nvidia slid 3.8% to its lowest since September, and the S&#038;P 500 fell 1.2% to a three-week low, slipping under its 50-day moving average.\nThe selling gathered pace as investors questioned whether the companies at the center of the AI boom can continue to justify their lofty valuations and heavy spending. Concerns around the cost and viability of data centre expansion added to the unease, with traders watching how big-ticket financing plans ripple through the sector.\n\nOracle fell 5.4% after a report said its largest data centre partner, Blue Owl Capital, will not back a $10B deal for its next facility.\nAmazon slipped 0.6% after a report said it is in talks to invest about $10B in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and Alphabet dropped 3.2% after a Reuters report said Google is working on an effort, alongside Meta, to erode Nvidia’s software advantage.\nThe chip complex took a broader hit. Broadcom fell 4.5% and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.9%, reinforcing a market mood that has turned more sensitive to any sign that the AI buildout may deliver profits slower than hoped.\nCrypto Awaits CPI As Bitcoin Hovers Without Clear Support For Bitcoin, that backdrop kept the move heavy and the bounce restrained. Mike Marshall, head of research at Amberdata, said the key is that the “support bid” has not shown up in size.\n“We are seeing weak market structure beneath price and relatively light ETF inflows, which reduces the market’s ability to stabilize quickly when momentum flips. Broader macro worries around rates, growth uncertainty, and cautious risk sentiment are compounding it.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;In this environment, the market tends to probe until it finds a level where buyers have conviction. Based on our ETF cost-basis analysis, the first meaningful floor is near $80K, and if we see sustained outflows or tighter financial conditions, $60K becomes the next major reference,” he said.\n\nStory Continues\nRate markets reflected the same caution. Comments from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, often viewed as dovish, supported demand for two- and five-year Treasuries, and longer-dated bonds lagged, nudging the 10-year yield about one basis point higher to roughly 4.15%.\nTraders now turn to Thursday’s consumer inflation data, which could reset rate expectations into year-end and decide whether crypto stabilizes near current levels or keeps probing for a clearer floor.\nRead original story Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Edges Lower As Asia Follows Wall Street’s Tech Rout by Shalini Nagarajan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: These 2 Stocks Will Be the First to Join the $5 Trillion Market Cap Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 5:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia will continue to benefit from increased AI infrastructure spending.\nAlphabet's structural cost advantage should become more evident in 2026.\nBoth stocks are attractively valued, even after nice runs in 2025.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWhile a company obtaining a $5 trillion market cap seemed like a fantasy just several years ago, I think there will not just be one company that hits this milestone next year, but two.\nLet's look at the stocks ready to join the $5 trillion club in 2026.\nNvidia With a market cap of nearly $4.3 trillion, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's largest company. Its stock price would need to rise just around 16%, as of this writing, to hit the $5 trillion mark. While its share price doesn't need to see a massive gain to get there, it's still a meaningful move. However, Nvidia has the ingredients for its stock to outperform once again in 2026.\n\nNvidia's performance in 2026 and beyond will largely be determined by artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending, both next year and into the future. Right now, that spending only continues to rise, led by cloud computing companies, which have been struggling to keep up with demand despite enormous capital expenditure (capex) budgets. Meanwhile, OpenAI, in coordination with Oracle , plans to spend a massive amount on AI infrastructure in the coming years, while other large tech companies and even governments are also spending big.\nAt this point, megacap tech companies are trying not to get left behind in the AI race, and that is great news for Nvidia. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the main chips used to power AI workloads, and the ecosystem it has built around them has given it a wide moat. This starts with its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundation AI was written on and optimized for its GPUs. Meanwhile, its proprietary NVLink interconnect system helps its chips act as one powerful unit, discouraging mixing and matching.\n\nNvidia's stock is also reasonably valued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 24 times 2026 analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio near 0.6 times (with below 1 times considered undervalued). That gives the stock plenty of room to run next year.\nAlphabet Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) market cap currently checks in around $3.7 trillion, which means it has a little more work to do than Nvidia. To get to a $5 trillion market cap, the stock would have to increase by about 35%. Alphabet's stock has climbed more than 60% in 2025 as of this writing, so that type of performance isn't out of reach.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is already the most profitable company in the world, and the stock is attractively valued, trading at a 27 times forward P/E and a PEG below 1 time for a very durable business. Getting to a $5 trillion market cap in 2026 is largely going to be about accelerating revenue growth and positioning the company as an AI leader. Alphabet helped flip the narrative that it was going to be an AI loser in 2025, and now it needs to continue to show why it is likely to be one of the biggest AI winners.\n\nThe company's cloud computing and search/AI businesses actually complement each other tremendously, which it should further demonstrate in 2026. By having both its own world-class AI chips and a foundational large language model (LLM), Alphabet has a structural cost advantage that cannot be matched. The company can train its Gemini models and run inference much more cheaply due to its custom tensor processing units (TPU).\nThis gives Google Cloud a margin advantage and makes it more attractive to customers, while Alphabet also embeds Gemini into its products to make them better. This just becomes a virtuous cycle that should see Alphabet gain more cost and performance advantages over time through its businesses. Expect this to become more evident in 2026, helping power the stock higher.\n\nThrow is some additional upside next year from its expanding Waymo robotaxi business and its sizable investment in SpaceX, and Alphabet looks set to hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Morgan downgrade on concerns about Fortinet’s competitive standing and platform recognition contrasts with its push into AI-centric security, highlighting a tension between innovation momentum and market perception.\nWe’ll now examine how J.P.

These 29 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early identification of life changing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.\nFortinet Investment Narrative Recap To own Fortinet, you need to believe its integrated security and networking platform can stay relevant as customers consolidate vendors and shift toward AI-centric and cloud security. The J.P. Morgan downgrade underscores that competitive positioning and platform recognition remain the key near term swing factors, while the ongoing firewall refresh cycle and service growth pressures are still the biggest execution risks. The latest AI data center announcements do not materially change those near term drivers, but they do shape how investors frame the opportunity.\n\nAmong the recent news, the integrated FortiGate VM running on NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs looks most relevant because it ties Fortinet’s ASIC and virtual firewall strengths directly into private cloud and AI infrastructure. For investors focused on catalysts, this kind of deep hardware level integration can support the idea that Fortinet is building a credible role inside high performance AI data centers, which may matter as buyers rationalize vendors and increase scrutiny on which platforms truly scale across on premises, cloud, and AI workloads.\nYet even as Fortinet pushes deeper into AI data centers, investors should be aware that the industry wide shift toward cloud native, consolidated security platforms could...\nRead the full narrative on Fortinet (it's free!)\n\nFortinet's narrative projects $9.2 billion revenue and $2.4 billion earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "Bill Gates, Ken Fisher Rake In $1.7 Billion From Dow Stock That Trounced Nvidia\n\nSurbhi Jain\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 4:31 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nNVDA\n\n^DJI\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nBill Gates and Ken Fisher are quietly sitting on massive gains from one of 2025's most overlooked winners. Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT ), now the top-performing stock in the Dow, is up more than 62% year-to-date. CAT stock’s rally has added roughly $1.7 billion in combined value to holdings tied to the Gates Foundation and Fisher Asset Management, even as flashier names like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) continued to grab the headlines .\n\nThe rally hasn't been driven by hype or headline-grabbing narratives. Instead, CAT stock has delivered steady, low-volatility gains — the kind institutions love and retail investors often overlook.\nDon’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nThe Dow's Surprise Leader Caterpillar’s leadership in the Dow Jones Industrial Index stands out in a year where market returns have been uneven. The stock is up nearly 65% over the past six months and recently traded near $589 after climbing from cycle lows earlier in the year.\nEven after a brief pullback, Caterpillar remains firmly in an established uptrend, supported by strong intermediate-term performance rather than short-lived momentum bursts.\n\nThat consistency is what separates CAT from flashier trades. While tech leadership has rotated and volatility has resurfaced, Caterpillar has kept grinding higher and now sits at the top of the Dow's performance table.\nBillionaires Are Already Cashing In The gains are especially visible in billionaire portfolios.\nAs of Sep. 30, CAT was trading around $477. Since then, the stock has risen roughly 23%, adding meaningful value for large holders. Bill Gates' foundation trust, which still owns about 6.35 million shares, has seen roughly $700 million in additional value in just three months — even after trimming the position during the quarter.\n\nSee Also: Missed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Invest Now at Just $0.85 a Share\nKen Fisher's firm holds an even larger stake, with 9.44 million shares, translating into more than $1 billion in unrealized gains over the same period, with almost no change in position size.\nWhy CAT's Rally Matters This isn't a speculative run tied to a single trend. Caterpillar's outperformance reflects a market rewarding durability — infrastructure exposure, pricing power, and earnings visibility — at a time when investors are growing more selective.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen the Dow's top stock of the year is an industrial heavyweight rather than a tech darling, it sends a clear signal. Capital isn't just chasing growth — it's chasing reliability.\nAnd in 2025, Caterpillar has delivered both.\nImage created using artificial intelligence via Midjourney.\nTrending Now:\n\nWall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share .\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10 . Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery . With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\nThis article Bill Gates, Ken Fisher Rake In $1.7 Billion From Dow Stock That Trounced Nvidia originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\n\nFaizan Farooque\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 3:33 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNvidia ’s H200 processor is becoming the epicenter of a conflict in China, and stock market experts and investors cannot see it on a chart.\nChinese cloud and internet corporations want Nvidia's processor right now, since their own accelerators aren't fast enough. Beijing, on the other hand, is looking at the big picture and may be ready to give up short-term success in exchange for control over its semiconductor future.\nSince 2018, Washington has levied new tariffs on nearly $370 billion worth of Chinese imports. Trade organizations claim this package currently means that products arriving from China have to pay about $77 billion more in taxes each year.\nThe trade war between the U.S. and China is unlikely to subside anytime soon. The conflict intensified in the incumbent administration. However, the previous government made every effort to minimize China's \"unfair\" advantage.\n\nKatherine Tai, who served as U.S. Trade Representative from 2021 until January 2025, put it plainly in a 2024 statement .\nTaking stock of the situation is important for Nvidia. The business has previously downplayed China in its predictions, but the H200 is still the most powerful AI processor that Chinese clients can lawfully purchase from the U.S.\nHow much of Nvidia's potential is still related to China and how much is gone for good will depend on whether it ever ships into the market at volume.\nRelated: History of Nvidia: Company timeline and facts\nCorporate China is still chasing Nvidia’s H200 The demand for Nvidia's H200 in China is already more than what the firm can currently make, according to a Reuters report .\nThe news outlet said Nvidia has informed Chinese customers that it is thinking about adding H200 capacity, since big buyers like Alibaba and ByteDance are very interested, even if the company is mostly focusing on its newer Blackwell and future Rubin processors.\n\nRelated: You won’t believe what Coca-Cola just did with its coffee brand\nReuters also said that Chinese cloud service providers and business clients have been asking Beijing officials to approve H200 imports, saying local accelerators still don't come close to the sheer computing power of the H200.\nReuters spoke to one investor who indicated that the H200 is about two to three times faster than the most sophisticated AI processors made in China. This makes it the best processor Chinese purchasers can access without breaking U.S. export laws.\nThat difference in performance is causing a lot of anger on the ground. Some Chinese authorities have suggested a solution that would allow H200 imports only if they come with native accelerators.\n\n繼續閱讀\nThis would help domestic chipmakers while still allowing businesses to use Nvidia's technology.\nKey points for Nvidia investors: Chinese cloud and internet platforms still think Nvidia is the best choice for performance.\nIn China, there is enough demand for H200 to put a strain on Nvidia's present supply.\nAny access to H200 is likely to come with strings attached, such as obligations to bundle with competitors in the same country.\n\nFor investors, all of this makes one thing clear: Nvidia's silicon is still in demand in China's data centers. Policy, not demand, is what's holding things up.\nBeijing would rather back Huawei than buy more Nvidia Bloomberg's report shows that Beijing is not as excited as its tech companies are.\nDavid Sacks, the White House's AI and crypto czar, informed the outlet that China is deliberately rejecting Nvidia's H200 in favor of chips made in China.\nSacks stated that Chinese authorities had \"figured out\" Washington's strategy of only permitting exports that are behind the curve. They are using their own clearance procedure to slow down H200 shipments and safeguard local producers.\n\nRelated: US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding\nBloomberg also said that China is thinking about giving its semiconductor sector up to $70 billion in new incentives. That package would be meant to speed up the country's drive for self-sufficiency, with businesses like Huawei at the core, even if U.S.-approved Nvidia chips are technically accessible.\nBloomberg is saying that Beijing sees the H200 as a short-term convenience that it is ready to give up in order to build up its own champions.\nIt seems as if Nvidia really listened to that message. Bloomberg said the business has already taken China out of its short-term revenue forecasts, even though CEO Jensen Huang thinks the Chinese data center sector is worth around $50 billion a year, according to CNBC .\n\nH200 sales in China might potentially reach roughly $10 billion a year, but only if Beijing lets in a lot more imports, estimates show.\nWhat this means for Beijing’s strategy:\nBeijing is using approvals to slow H200 adoption and shield local chipmakers.\nSubsidies and incentives are being scaled up to pull AI workloads onto domestic silicon.\nNvidia is planning as if China is upside optionality, not a core growth driver.\nWhy the H200 standoff matters for Nvidia stock When you put the two stories together, you have a two-level game on which investors need to keep a careful eye.\nThere is talk about urgency and pent-up demand at the business level. Chinese IT businesses prefer H200s because they still work better per chip than chips made in China. The longer they wait, the more likely they are to lag behind competitors across the world that already have Blackwell-class gear.\n\nAt the same time, there is deliberate caution at the state level. Beijing appears to be increasingly keen on utilizing subsidies and clearances to give local suppliers an edge, even if it means AI rollouts for its own firms may take longer in the short term.\nMore Nvidia:\nIs Nvidia’s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn’t think so\nMorgan Stanley revamps Nvidia’s price target ahead of big Q3\nInvestors hope good news from Nvidia gives the rally more life\nBank of America resets Nvidia stock forecast before earnings\nAMD flips the script on Nvidia with bold new vision\nFor Nvidia stockholders, the difference between what China wants and what Beijing is ready to allow is an uncertainty premium.\nNvidia has assured clients that any licensed H200 sales to China will not stop it from serving U.S. customers, according to Reuters . This shows that the company is confident it can service both markets if it receives the go-ahead.\n\nBloomberg's research, on the other hand, shows that investors can't trust that green light would ever come at a large scale, at least not without rigorous restrictions that also help Chinese rivals.\nImplications for Nvidia’s long-term setup include the following.\nMoney coming in from China may not be a steady source of development, but it may be lumpy and based on policy.\nIf domestic Chinese accelerators don't have to compete with Nvidia, they may become better quicker.\nNvidia's multiple may start to show how much it is exposed to the U.S. and other \"open\" AI markets, with China seen as a call option.\nIf Beijing lets in a small number of strictly controlled H200 imports, Nvidia might get back billions of dollars in extra sales from a market it has mostly given up on, while also making people think that its chips are still the best in the world.\n\nNvidia's business in China may continue to be fundamentally weak, no matter how loud the demand is, if approvals are limited or take a long time.\nRelated: Jensen Huang’s 2025 net worth as Nvidia market cap tops $4 trillion\nWhat Nvidia investors should watch next The H200 is no longer Nvidia's most advanced product, but it is a good way to see how much more the business can expand in China under the present export rules.\nBloomberg's article makes it clear that the key issue is no longer whether the H200 is good enough (it is), but whether Beijing is still ready to allow U.S. export policy to determine its AI agenda.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Nvidia is still the most popular option in China when it comes to data centers, as long as purchasers can acquire it.\nFor Nvidia investors, the setup is simple: If clearances start to go through or if Beijing starts to change its attitude on H200 imports, it might mean that Nvidia's China forecast is not completely priced in.\nA hard turn to indigenous chips, supported by big subsidies and stricter unofficial rules, would show that Nvidia has to develop in places other than China.\nIn any case, the H200 debate is less about one \"old\" chip and more about how Wall Street should evaluate China's risk across all of Nvidia's AI products over the next several years.\nRelated: Tesla has problem no one was pricing in\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 17, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Could This AI Chip Stock Make a Major Comeback by the End of the Year?\n\nJohn Bromels, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 3:16 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points During each of the previous three Decembers, Nvidia's stock has surged 8.8% or more.\nThese surges were usually accompanied by broader market uptrends, which seem unlikely this year.\nThat leaves big company news as the only likely catalyst for a share price jump.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had a rough couple of months, with its stock down about 17% from its October peak. The last time Nvidia's shares were this far off their highs -- almost a year ago -- it took nearly six months for them to recover.\nHowever, could we be in for a holiday miracle? Could the stock not only regain its lost ground, but also hit new highs in the last 10 trading days of the year?\nHere's why it might actually happen -- and the one big obstacle standing in the way.\nWhat history says Nvidia's stock is no stranger to December \"mini-surges.\" Just last year, for example, its shares rose 8.8% between Dec. 18 and Dec. 24. The year before that, its stock shot up 10.1% between Dec. 6 and Dec. 18. And in 2022, its shares jumped 13% between Dec. 6 and Dec. 13.\nThose are all impressive moves, but in order for the stock to return to October's record $207.04 closing price, it would have to rise by about 17.4%. That's a tall order, but it isn't impossible.\n\nIn fact, Nvidia's done it before. In 2016, share prices surged a huge 33.9% between Dec. 1 and Dec. 27, with 16.8% of that rise occurring between the 16th and the 27th of the month. So a 2025 repeat isn't outside the realm of possibility. That said, the company's market cap in December 2016 was less than $64 billion, a far cry from its current $4.3 trillion valuation.\nPlus, in recent years, the stock has also seen a few double-digit declines in December. Some of them even happened alongside the stock's record jumps. Last year, for example, right before its 8.8% surge, Nvidia had dropped 11.2%. In 2022, right after its 13% jump, shares fell 22.3%. And in some years, there was no major jump or big plunge at all.\nReflecting the market Nvidia's end-of-year moves have tended to mirror the overall market, only with more intensity. For example, that big 22.3% price drop in December 2022 reflected a 5.9% decline in the S&P 500 . Last year, during its 11.2% December slide, the broader market also slid by 3.5%.\nIn other words, if the S&P 500 is doing well, Nvidia's stock tends to be doing really well. If the broader market is doing badly, its shares tend to be doing really badly.\n\nStory Continues\nUnfortunately, the market's growth has slowed over the past few quarters. Between its April 5 low and the end of the second quarter, the S&P 500 rose by a robust 24.5%. In the third quarter, it rose just 7.8%. So far in the fourth, it's only risen 1.9%.\nThat slowing growth came despite three Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, in September, October, and December. There won't be any further rate cuts this year.\n\nThat makes it unlikely that there will be a big year-end market surge that will benefit Nvidia stock. The likeliest reason for the shares to surge would be some major company-specific news.\nWhat news is left? But Nvidia has already put out excellent news in its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 19.\nThe company reported record revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year over year; per-share earnings of $1.30, up 67%; and an impressive gross margin of 73.4%, as measured under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Sales of its Blackwell chips are \"off the charts,\" according to CEO Jensen Huang, and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) are sold out. The company is expecting $65 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, with 74.8% GAAP gross margins.\n\nIt's hard to think of what more the company could possibly announce that would be enough to boost its shares by 17.4%, or about $700 billion in market value. That's more than the entire market caps of Costco and Coca-Cola combined.\nUnless a major issue emerges over the next couple of weeks with Alphabet 's tensor processing units (TPUs) or AMD 's high-end chips, which are expected to compete with Nvidia's GPUs, I really can't think of any likely scenario that would add so much value to Nvidia so quickly.\nThat's why it doesn't seem likely that the stock will make enough of a comeback to hit new highs by the end of 2025. But so what? Given the company's very strong outlook, 2026 is shaping up to be a big banner year for the chipmaker, and if the price is a bit cheaper during the holidays, it offers an opportunity for new investors to buy Nvidia shares at a discount.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Markets Sell Off -0.5% to -1.8% Ahead of Inflation Rate Thursday\n\nMark Vickery\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 3:10 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nORCL\n\nTSLA\n\nMU\n\nNVDA\n\nWednesday, December 17, 2025\n\nMarkets experienced a heavier sell-off today, after starting the session at the opening bell flat-to-up. By 11am or so, the Dow and the small-cap Russell were in negative territory; the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had already gotten there. The Dow closed -228 points, -0.47%, and it got off easy. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 were all down -1.16%, -1.81% and -1.14%, respectively.\n\nThis marks the fourth-straight down-day for the blue-chip Dow and the comprehensive S&P 500. The Russell 2000 has only traded down since closing at an all-time high last Thursday. The Nasdaq has dipped into the red over the past month of trading, and down -6.5% from its all-time high back in late October of this year.\n\nThe AI trade had been keeping markets buoyant for much of 2025; now that the year is coming to an end, investors are apparently looking toward 2026 with a warier eye than we&rsquo;ve seen &mdash; although we&rsquo;ve only had one &ldquo;Santa Claus Rally&rdquo; in the past five years, in 2023. AI stocks have taken it on the chin, including Oracle ORCL -5.4%, Broadcom AVGO -4.5% and NVIDIA NVDA -3.8%. Also, Caterpillar CAT dropped -4.7% and Lennar Home LEN fell -4.4%.\n\nEven Tesla TSLA, fresh from an all-time closing high just yesterday, suffered a heavy round of profit-taking today, as the EV leader slid -4.6% on the day. Tesla has also been named by the California DMV as having provided misleading claims about its autos, claiming them to have &ldquo;full self-driving capability&rdquo; when they don&rsquo;t, exactly. The DMV adopted this position from a judge&rsquo;s ruling last month, and has been given 60 days to take down such claims.\n\nMicron Posts Huge Beats in Q1 Report\n\nAfter today&rsquo;s close, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated Micron MU blew the doors off expectations in its fiscal Q1 report. Earnings of $4.78 per share swept away the paltry Zacks consensus of $3.91, while revenues of $13.64 billion zoomed past the $12.74 billion anticipated. Next-quarter guidance is also significantly higher than we had previously forecast.\n\nOperating cash flow rose +47% quarter over quarter to $8.41 billion, and is more than double the $3.24 billion it had reported in the year-ago quarter. Micron doubled its cloud memory business year over year to $5.28 billion, on improved +66% gross margins. Shares are up +5% in late trading, adding to its stupendous +168% rise in share price from the start of the year.\n\nNovember CPI Inflation Rate Hits the Tape Thursday Morning\n\nTomorrow ahead of the opening bell, we not only get normal Weekly Jobless Claims , but the government-shutdown-delayed Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November (skipping October completely). We already hear noises from some market participants about the accuracy of this upcoming data 16 hours before it&rsquo;s released, but consensus is currently for a +3.1% Inflation Rate (year-over-year CPI, headline) &mdash; the highest since May of 2024. Core CPI year over year is anticipated at +3.0%.\n\nWe have already seen the erosion to the labor market over the past year yesterday with the Employment Situation report. If we also see CPI numbers continuing to tick up &mdash; and we&rsquo;ve only gone up or stayed pat each month since April&rsquo;s low +2.3% &mdash; that may be a bad sign for the economy on the brink of a new year. &ldquo;May&rdquo; be; it&rsquo;s not certain. Even still, selling off the tops of this healthy 2025 market seems more reasonable if investors are questioning what&rsquo;s to come.\n\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

On Wednesday, Fed governor Chris Waller signaled support for rate cuts before the release of the CPI update.\nRead more: How the Fed rate decision affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments\nGiven all that, markets are seen as less laser-focused on the inflation print than usual.

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the Next $4 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:50 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Alphabet's market cap has come out of nowhere to surpass Microsoft's.\nMassive investments in its technology and the release of Gemini 3 have dramatically changed perceptions about the Google parent.\nAlphabet has the second-lowest P/E ratio in the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nMany investors were shocked when Nvidia became the first company to achieve a $4 trillion market cap . The competition for the world's largest market cap was long a contest between Apple and Microsoft , so to see Nvidia emerge out of nowhere likely came as a surprise.\nNow, the question is, which company is the next to achieve a $4 trillion market cap? Today, Apple has already achieved that, but instead of Microsoft (which previously reached that point before retreating), I believe another emerging company will be the next one to reach this milestone. Here's why.\nThe next $4 trillion company Today, the stock most likely to reach $4 trillion and stay above that point is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . Currently, its market cap is at $3.7 trillion, surpassing Microsoft's current $3.5 trillion market cap.\nThat choice may come as a surprise to some investors. As recently as spring 2025, the Google parent's market cap was under $2 trillion.\nAlphabet stock had long been smaller than many of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, as the rise of ChatGPT weighed on the stock. When GPT-4 came out in 2023, investors soured on Google Search, and its market share had fallen below 90% for the first time in decades.\nAt that point, not only did ChatGPT offer more thorough and concise results, but it bypassed the advertising ecosystem that had long served as the primary source of the Google parent's revenue.\n\nThe company released Google Gemini later that year. Still, Gemini did not initially stand out from the likes of Claude, Grok, Copilot, and numerous other AI platforms trying to unseat ChatGPT.\nAlso, investors should remember that Alphabet has long worked to reduce its dependence on advertising for revenue. In recent years, Google Cloud has claimed an increasing share of the revenue. Still, even though Alphabet was an early pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI), these efforts did not seem to impress investors.\nWhat changed? However, Alphabet has long benefited from a massive level of liquidity and considerable free cash flows. In late 2024, it pledged to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures (capex) in 2025, later raising that to the $91 billion-$93 billion range.\nMuch of that spending has gone into improving legacy products. Search now incorporates AI-driven results, and Google Cloud offers upgraded infrastructure, multimodality AI models, and new tools for developers. Additionally, AI should help to make Waymo a source of revenue as it seeks to compete in the autonomous driving space.\n\nStory Continues\nNonetheless, it seems to be the release of Gemini 3 in November that has captured the most attention recently. With improved reasoning, coding, and multimodal understanding, some analysts claim it is \"better than ChatGPT.\"\nWith that, the stock is up more than 60% over the last year, and more than 110% from its April low. Not surprisingly, almost half of that increase has occurred since October.\nMoreover, despite these gains, it is the second-cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. Its P/E ratio of around 30 is undercut only by Meta Platforms , a stock trading at 28 times earnings. That comparative discount could give investors all the more reason to continue buying stock in the Google parent.\nAlphabet at $4 trillion (and beyond) Between the relatively low valuation and the newfound success of Gemini 3, Alphabet appears likely to reach $4 trillion next.\nUltimately, investors like winners in cutting-edge technologies, and amid Alphabet's massive investments, having Gemini 3 perceived as \"better than ChatGPT\" positions Alphabet stock for higher moves.\n\nAdditionally, the AI pioneer is aggressively applying the technology to Google Cloud, and its efforts with Waymo could begin to bear fruit soon. As investors notice the stock as undervalued relative to peers, it continues to benefit from numerous tailwinds.\nAmid such successes, Alphabet may not only reach $4 trillion, but could challenge Apple and Nvidia for the world's largest market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Musk holds a roughly 12% stake in Tesla, valued at around $200 billion.\nBut the bigger driver of his wealth surge this week has been SpaceX's valuation reportedly doubling since the summer to $800 billion, based on a secondary share sale by the aerospace company ahead of a potential IPO next year .\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is now more than twice as wealthy as number two on the rich list, Alphabet cofounder Larry Page, who's worth $264 billion after a year-to-date wealth gain of $96 billion — second only to Musk .\nHe's also more than four times as rich as Warren Buffett , the outgoing CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who's worth $150 billion after giving more than half of his fortune to good causes.\nMusk's personal fortune exceeds the market values of Oracle , Mastercard, and Johnson & Johnson — three of the 20 most valuable US public companies with market capitalizations exceeding $500 billion. His recent gains have narrowed the gap with Visa, which has a market value of $660 billion.\nMusk's epic wealth rally The serial entrepreneur has had a striking wealth recovery in recent months. Tesla stock roughly halved between mid-January and mid-March as his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sparked public backlash and worried shareholders that he was getting distracted .\nMusk even briefly lost his top spot on the rich list to Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison in September, before Tesla shares rallied to fresh highs.\nTesla and other huge US tech companies have seen their stock prices soar this year, fueled by immense buzz around AI . In Musk's case, he's excited investors by spending big on AI to develop Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\nStory Continues\nBy contrast, skeptics such as Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame have warned that AI companies are overspending on microchips and data centers, and diagnosed a stock-market bubble that's bound to burst.\nThe AI boom has translated into huge wealth gains for key shareholders such as Musk, Page and his cofounder Sergey Brin, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang.\nMusk could become the world's first trillionaire after Tesla shareholders approved his pay package in November, which promises to roughly double his stake in Tesla over the next decade if he hits milestones such as selling 1 million Optimus robots and raising adjusted profits from around $17 billion last year to $400 billion.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Not All AI Stocks Are Falling These Days. Micron Is Rising on Strong Earnings\n\nKara Greenberg\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nKey Takeaways Micron Technology posted earnings that topped analysts' estimates, sending shares higher in extended trading Wednesday.\nCEO Sanjay Mehrotra said growing AI demand drove record results for the memory chipmaker and Nvidia supplier.\nWorries about an AI bubble have weighed on the tech sector lately. Micron is still riding the AI boom higher.\n\nShares of the memory chip maker were up over 5% in extended trading Wednesday after the company posted earnings that blew past analysts' estimates, driven by growing demand for AI hardware.\nMicron Technology ( MU ) posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.78 for the fiscal first quarter, well above the $3.96 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for . Its revenue jumped nearly 60% year-over-year to a record $13.64 billion, also exceeding expectations.\n\nWhy This Matters to Investors As a supplier for leading AI chipmakers including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Micron has seen strong momentum in its data center business this year, helping it earn a reputation as a winning \"pick-and-shovel\" play for the AI trade.\n\"Micron delivered record revenue and significant margin expansion at the company level and also in each of our business units,” said CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, who called the company an \"essential AI enabler.\"\n\nMicron projected adjusted earnings per share of $8.22 to $8.62 on revenue of $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion for the second quarter, well ahead of consensus estimates.\n\nMicron's stock, though well off record highs seen earlier this month, has largely avoided the worst of the recent slump in the AI sector. It's continued to benefit from a shortage in the memory market , supporting stronger pricing and higher margins. Micron's GAAP gross margin jumped to 56% in the first quarter, up from around 38% a year earlier, with the company saying it expects that to climb as high as 68% in the current quarter.\nShares of Micron have nearly tripled in value in 2025 through Wednesday's close, making it one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 for the year.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Riley Wealth Management described Oracle as \"probably the poster child\" for questions about AI project financing and profitability.\n\"Investors are starting to be more differentiated and looking at the potential winners and the potential time frame before return on invested capital,\" Hogan said. \"That doesn't mean we're anywhere close to the final innings of artificial intelligence. It just means investors are being more discerning.\"\nBesides Oracle, which fell 5.4 percent, other AI players such as Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet and Broadcom all lost more than three percent.\nWhile technology and communications services were among the sectors to retreat, energy led the winners among sectors moving higher.\n\nOil prices rallied after US President Donald Trump ordered a blockade of \"sanctioned\" oil tankers heading to and leaving Venezuela.\nThe commodity later pared some of its gains, but finished the day up more than one percent.\nVenezuela, which has the world's largest proven oil reserves, shrugged off the threat of more pain, insisting that it was proceeding with business as usual.\n\"Export operations for crude and byproducts continue normally. Oil tankers linked to PDVSA operations continue to sail with full security,\" state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) said.\nIn Europe, London's stock market rallied as the pound faltered on expectations of cuts to Bank of England interest rates, after data showed UK inflation falling faster than forecast.\n\nBritain's annual inflation rate slowed to 3.2 percent in November, cementing expectations that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate on Thursday and again on more than one occasion in 2026.\nAnalysts had expected inflation to have cooled only slightly to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent in October.\nEurozone inflation remained at 2.1 percent in November, hovering just above the target set by the European Central Bank, slightly revised official data showed Wednesday.\nThe ECB is expected to hold interest rates steady Thursday for its fourth straight meeting with inflation in check, although debate is heating up about the path forward.\nBoth the Paris and Frankfurt stock markets ended lower. Asian markets were mixed.\n\nStory Continues\nIn corporate news, the share price of Chinese chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai soared more than 550 percent on its home-city debut Wednesday.\nShares in Netflix climbed 0.2 percent after Warner Bros.

      "Content": "Prediction: These 2 AI Darlings Will Be Worth $5 Trillion or More in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Nvidia's growth is expected to be rapid in 2026.\nAlphabet could see its valuation increase and strong growth continue to cross the $5 trillion mark.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nCurrently, there are no stocks with a $5 trillion market cap or greater. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is valued at $4.3 trillion, and was recently valued at over $5 trillion before pulling back. Following up Nvidia are Apple at $4 trillion, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) at $3.7 trillion, and Microsoft at $3.5 trillion. These are the only real candidates that can be worth $5 trillion or more, as Amazon is the fifth-largest company in the world at $2.6 trillion, which means its stock would have to more than double to breach the $5 trillion threshold.\nSo, of these four, which ones could be worth $5 trillion or more in 2026? I think there are only two real answers, and one may surprise you.\nReaching the $5 trillion valuation threshold won't be easy for one of these stocks It should come as no surprise that I think Nvidia will cross the $5 trillion valuation threshold in 2026. It's still growing at a rapid pace thanks to its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPU) technology stack. Demand for artificial intelligence computing power in data centers isn't slowing down, and it is shouldn't for some time. Nvidia believes global data center capital expenditures will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from $600 billion in 2025. Should that come to fruition, Nvidia would be a monster performer over the next five years, and 2026 is shaping up to be another phenomenal year.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs, although he didn't elaborate on how far in the future they are sold out. Regardless, demand outpaces supply for its GPUs, which allows it to maintain high prices and lofty profit margins. This will fuel Nvidia's growth in 2026, and Wall Street analysts are expecting 48% growth again in fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027) after rising a projected 63% in fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026).\nWith growth like that, it won't take a whole lot for Nvidia to reach the $5 trillion threshold in 2026.\nHowever, it will take a bit more effort from Alphabet.\nAlphabet was a bit of a laggard in the AI arms race because competitors launched generative AI tools before it did. Furthermore, the initial release of its model was bad and caused several PR nightmares. However, Alphabet has addressed those issues and is now one of the leading providers of generative AI. In addition, Alphabet's core Google search business was spared from being broken up due to monopoly concerns earlier this year, and its future is now much clearer than it was just six months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nSince July 1, Alphabet's stock has been on fire, rising about 80%. However, for Alphabet's stock to be worth $5 trillion, it must rise at least 35% from today's levels.\nCan it do that?\nAlphabet's earnings growth has been impressive in recent quarters There are a few ways for a stock to rise: growing revenue and earnings, or an increase in valuation. Both of these are reasonable actions for a share price to rise, and Alphabet will likely need a boost from both to cross the $5 trillion threshold. In Q3, revenue rose 16% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 35%. If Alphabet can keep up its EPS growth, then it could cross the $5 trillion threshold with growth alone. However, I think it could also use some help in the valuation department.\nDespite growing at the same pace or faster than Apple or Microsoft, Alphabet trades at a discount from a price-to-earnings perspective.\nShould Alphabet's stock receive a 35 times trailing earnings valuation, that would result in 14% growth alone.\nAlphabet will need all the help it can get to reach a $5 trillion valuation by the end of 2026, but I think it can do it. Even if it doesn't, I think it could easily reach that level by 2027.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Micron has broken its quarterly record in two straight quarters, with a third potential record coming this week.\nMicron has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in 10 straight quarters.\nAnalysts expect Micron to report first-quarter earnings per share of $3.93, up from $1.79 in last year&#039;s first quarter.\nThe company has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in seven straight quarters and in nine of the past 10 quarters overall.\nGuidance from the company calls for first-quarter revenue in a range of $12.2 billion to $12.8 billion and earnings per share in a range of $3.60 to $3.90.\n\nDon&#8217;t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\n\nWhat Analysts Are Saying: Micron will set a new quarterly record and the company could have \"record quarters ahead,\" Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a new investor note.\nThe analyst maintained a Buy rating on Micron with a price target of $300.\n\"We are expecting Micron to report another record quarterly only to be topped by February quarter guidance,\" Cassidy said.\nThe analyst said the record revenue is coming by disciplined supply growth in recent years along with strong demand for the company&#039;s products.\n\"We see the financial performance as supporting the growth.\"\n\nCassidy said the company is becoming stronger with AI applications having an increased need for memory.\nThe analyst said a key item to watch will be management commentary for when more meaningful capacity is coming.\n\"We recommend owning the stock.\"\nNeedham analyst Quinn Bolton maintained a Buy rating on Micron and raised the price target from $200 to $300 ahead of the earnings report.\n\"With the memory market continuing to tighten, demand likely to exceed supply throughout CY 26,\" Bolton said.\nThe analyst raised revenue and eps estimates for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027 \"substantially.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\"Demand conditions in the data center market remain robust, driven by increasing hyperscaler and neocloud CapEx.\"\nBolton said this is a strong tailwind for Micron that will help average selling prices and gross margins.\nSeveral other analysts raised their price targets for Micron stock ahead of the earnings report, including Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson , who maintained an Outperform rating and raised the price target from $220 to $300.\n\nSee Also: The AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nKey Items to Watch: Micron shares are up over 160% in 2025, which could create high expectations for the stock.\nAnalysts and investors likely expect another double beat and raised guidance. If the company fails to beat or update on guidance, shares could end up being volatile the rest of the week.\nFreedom Capital Markets Chief Market Strategist Jay Woods cautioned on shares being volatile in his weekly newsletter .\n\"Shares have traded lower after posting results over the last four quarters and over five of their last six,\" Woods said.\nThe market expert said this could be a case of shares trading higher before earnings and selling off after the earnings report.\n\nMicron said it had all-time highs for its data center business and was entering 2026 with \"strong momentum\" during its fourth quarter financial results. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told investors Micron was \"uniquely positioned to capitalize on the AI opportunity ahead.\"\nAnalysts and investors will be looking forward to guidance and commentary on future growth for the company.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nTrending Now:\nWall Street&#039;s $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That&#039;s why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn&#039;t tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10 . Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn&#039;t just for trading — it&#039;s also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery . With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It&#039;s a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\nThis article Micron Q1 Preview: Record Quarter Predicted By Analyst — 'We Recommend Owning The Stock' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Best Tech ETF Picks for 2026\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 1:18 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Tech has been a strong outperformer, but it might be time to rethink investing in this sector.\nCompanies with strong fundamentals and more reasonable valuations present enticing opportunities.\nSoftware and digital payments are two subsectors that have the chance to outperform in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Amplify ETF Trust - Amplify Digital Payments ETF ›\n\nAs we wrap up 2025, tech stocks are again on pace to be one of the best-performing S&P 500 sectors. Fueled by strong demand for anything tied to artificial intelligence (AI) , investors steadily bought stocks and pushed the Nasdaq-100 index to several new all-time highs.\nWhile the \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks helped lead the way higher, 2026 may not be a repeat. If you're looking to invest in tech, it may be time to look beyond just Nvidia , Microsoft , and Apple . While these have been terrific-performing companies for a long time, there are a number of opportunities within the sector that may be flying under the radar.\nIn particular, undervalued areas of the tech sector could see better performance. The mega-cap companies, as well as chip stocks, have really gotten all the attention lately. Areas, such as software and digital payments, could enjoy renewed interest if investors begin seeking out more value-oriented stocks backed by healthy fundamentals.\nHere are three tech ETFs that I believe could outperform in the coming year.\nInvesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: RSPT) invests in all of the big large-cap tech companies, but removes the concentration factor. It equally weights the roughly 70 tech stocks within the S&P 500 and rebalances quarterly to ensure it maintains its diversified exposure.\n\nRSPT is a great way to invest in the tech stocks that have led the market over the past several years, but broaden out the exposure in case the mega-cap names begin to underperform. We've already seen some hints that investors are worried about Magnificent Seven valuations. This ETF allows you to invest in the long-term tech narrative while mitigating some of that idiosyncratic risk.\nTop holdings currently include Western Digital , Micron Technology , and Teradyne .\nAmplify Digital Payments ETF Think of the one thing that almost every person does at least once a day (and probably multiple times): buy something! Years ago, people would pay for these purchases using cash or a check. Today, everybody uses credit cards or some form of digital payment, such as PayPal .\nThe Amplify Digital Payments ETF (NYSEMKT: IPAY) invests in all the major companies that provide payment services. Its top three holdings -- American Express , Visa , and MasterCard -- are all major credit card issuers, but other companies within the top 10 reflect how the entire sector is evolving. PayPal is more of a traditional online payment platform. Global Payments is a payment processor and software provider. Coinbase Global is a cryptocurrency trading platform.\n\nStory Continues\nThe transaction processing space is already a big cash flow generator. Adding the next-generation fintech evolution to it provides a great long-term growth opportunity.\niShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF Ever since coming out of the 2022 bear market, software has been a tech laggard. The AI boom had investors gravitating toward semiconductor stocks, leaving certain segments of the sector underbought and unloved.\nWithin the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGV) , there are a lot of high-quality companies with strong revenue growth and solid margins that could finally see some of that value get unlocked in 2026. Top 10 holdings include Palantir Technologies , Salesforce , Intuit , and ServiceNow alongside industry heavyweight Microsoft.\n\nSoftware is intriguing because it covers so many areas within tech. IGV is essentially an investment in cloud computing, enterprise automation, cybersecurity, and AI productivity tools. There's constant demand for performance improvement and staying ahead of the latest threats. That makes a lot of these companies steady cash flow generators that can actually add some stability to a portfolio.\nWith software lagging behind the Nasdaq-100 in 2025, there's some catch-up potential in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amplify ETF Trust - Amplify Digital Payments ETF right now?

The S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) fell over 1%, as tech weakness returned emphatically. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) lost around 0.5%, after US stocks finished mixed in Tuesday's session .\n\nAI trade worries rattled tech stocks again following a Financial Times report that Oracle's $10 billion data center project has lost the backing of private lender Blue Owl Capital. It comes amid scrutiny of increasing use of debt and off-balance-sheet moves to fund tech companies' capital spending on AI infrastructure, despite persistent questions over demand for the tech.\n\nOracle shares fell nearly 6%, and megacap tech stocks followed. Nvidia ( NVDA ) lost almost 4%, Broadcom ( AVGO ) sank over 4%, and Google ( GOOG ) was down over 3%.\nTech's bruising intensifies the spotlight on Micron Technology's ( MU ) quarterly results, due after the bell on Wednesday. Its report should help paint a clearer picture of demand on the AI semiconductor side of the market, as the company supplies chips for Nvidia's server systems.\nMeanwhile, weeks in a data vacuum, Wall Street is trying to find a clear signal in a noisy November jobs report to pinpoint a path for interest rates next year. Markets are also waiting for the other data shoe to drop: Thursday's update on consumer inflation in November.\nIn a clue to the path ahead, Fed governor Chris Waller said Wednesday that the central bank still has scope to cut rates, hinting at \"50 to 100 basis points\" of room.\nElsewhere in corporates, Netflix ( NFLX ) stock rose after Warner Bros.

Year to date, GE Vernova stock has run up 93%, inclusive of a 15% gain last Wednesday, after the company announced plans to roll out a fuel cell business for data centers at its investor day.\n\nGE Vernova has been seen as a beneficiary of the AI infrastructure build-out, as demand for energy transmission and grid integration is booming. According to RBC analyst Christopher Dendrinos, GE Vernova's electrification backlog has grown 4x since 2022 and is projected to double again by 2028.\nBut news that private lender Blue Owl Capital ( OWL ) will not back a $10 billion deal for Oracle's data center threw funding for that build-out into greater scrutiny on Wednesday.\nStill, GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik emphasized in an interview last week that the company has \"a lot of other drivers\" of demand. Strazik said that only 10% of the company's current backlog comes from hyperscalers, which could grow to approximately one-third of the backlog over the next three years.\n\nToday at 6:06 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nMedline stock begins trading above $35 per share Medline ( MDLN ) shares began trading on Wednesday afternoon at $35 each.

AI chipmaking machine producer ASML ( ASML ) also shed 3%, while contract semiconductor manufacturer TSMC ( TSM ) dropped nearly 2% and Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) edged down just over 1%,\n\nToday at 3:35 PM UTC Myles Udland\n\nMedline raises $6.3 billion in year's biggest IPO The biggest IPO of 2025 is getting in just before the finish line.\nMedical supply giant Medline ( MDLN ) said late Tuesday that it had raised $6.26 billion in its IPO, selling a little over 216 million shares at $29 a piece, with the stock set to begin trading on Wednesday. The IPO values Medline at upwards of $50 billion, based on a total of roughly 1.8 billion Class A and Class B shares outstanding.\nThe deal caps the best year for the IPO market since 2021 , with Wall Street's outlook for deals and new issues even more optimistic heading into 2026 .\nRecent reports have indicated that SpaceX is likely to go public in 2026 , with the company having recently struck a deal for insiders to sell stock in Elon Musk's rocketry and satellite business that valued the company at $800 billion.\nMajor AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic are also expected to explore going public within the next 18 months, according to The Information . Database giant Databricks, which raised money at a $134 billion valuation this week, said it could explore a public offering as soon as next year.\n\nToday at 3:02 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nOracle drops on debt concerns Oracle ( ORCL ) shares fell nearly 4% Wednesday after the Financial Times reported that private lender Blue Owl Capital will not back a $10 billion deal for its next data center as the burgeoning AI cloud player rushes to secure computing capacity and investors scrutinize its mounting use of debt to do so.\n\nThe decline put Oracle shares down nearly 18% for the month. The stock fell after the company's earnings last week showed its costs rising more than expected while bleeding more cash than anticipated. The tech firm's $248 billion in off-balance sheet lease obligations revealed in its quarterly SEC filing added to investor fears over its growing debt pile, while its over-reliance on OpenAI to meet its ambitious revenue targets has also sent shareholders backpedaling.\nThough Oracle execs said after its earnings results that it's committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating — it currently has a BBB rating on its bonds — investors haven't been so sure, piling into Oracle credit default swaps that saw spreads reach their highest level since 2009 last week.\n\nToday at 2:45 PM UTC\n\nStocks rise at the open Stocks rose briefly at the market open as Wall Street weighed the latest jobs data and oil surged, while Oracle ( ORCL ) shares slid.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) moved up nearly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) added 0.3% after US stocks finished mixed in Tuesday's session .\n\nToday at 2:05 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nGeneral Mills stock rises as revenue tops estimates, guidance reaffirmed General Mills stock ( GIS ) climbed about 1% in premarket trading after earnings missed estimates, but revenue came in better than expected for the quarter.\nThe Cheerios maker reported fiscal second quarter earnings per share of $0.78 on revenue of $4.86 billion. Wall Street analysts estimated earnings of $1.04 on revenue of $4.78 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nGeneral Mills' efforts to invest in its brands, divest its North American yogurt business, and unfavorable trade comparisons weighed on the results, the company said.\nFor the full fiscal year, which ends in May, General Mills reaffirmed it expects net sales growth to range from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%. Adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS are both expected to fall 10% to 15% for the year.\nGeneral Mills' guidance was largely in line with analysts' expectations. Although many on the Street believe the packaged foods company is facing some challenges, analysts noted that these challenges are already reflected in the stock price.\n\"Underlying fundamentals remain challenging, but we think many are of the view that this is largely reflected in Street estimates and with shares trading at a discount to PF peers on a historical basis and no major surprises expected for the print itself, many find it difficult to see how the stock could trade lower,\" UBS analysts wrote in a note ahead of the results.\n\nToday at 1:30 PM UTC Brett LoGiurato\n\nHut 8 shares surge as ex-bitcoin miner signs $7 billion AI data center lease Reuters reports :\n\nRead more here .\n\nToday at 1:00 PM UTC\n\nAmerica's biggest banks are ending 2025 on top with big growth goals and markets 'wide open' Bank of America ( BAC ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Wells Fargo ( WFC ), and Citigroup ( C ) are setting ambitious plans for growth in 2026 as they wrap up an upbeat 2025.\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nRead more here .\n\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC Karen Friar\n\nWarner Bros Discovery board urges shareholders to reject rival bid from Paramount The contest for Warner Bros.

Bitcoin is now about 7% lower for the year. It was trading at about $87,100 at noon in Singapore on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the latest decline is a much milder correction than in the previous three down years, it’s happened against a vastly different backdrop. Since the last major crypto crash in 2022, institutional adoption has widened, regulation has matured, and the industry has found its arguably most important champion in US President Donald Trump.\nThe rapid lurch lower since bitcoin hit a record of over $126,000 in early October has confounded bulls and left cryptoassets struggling to find a footing. Volumes are low, investors are bailing on bitcoin ETFs and derivatives markets are showing a lack of appetite for betting on a rebound. Even massive buying from the dominant bitcoin whale — Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ) — hasn’t been enough to turn things around.\n“Most are surprised by the lack of follow-through despite so many positive catalysts,” said Pratik Kala, a portfolio manager at hedge fund Apollo Crypto.\nRead more here .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Better AI Stock: ASML vs. Nvidia\n\nChris Neiger, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 12:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nASML\n\nKey Points ASML makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and holds 90% market share.\nNvidia's GPUs are in heavy demand from tech giants, and its earnings surged 67% higher in the third quarter.\nNvidia's shares are cheaper than ASML's.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nStocks in the semiconductor sector have been among the most sought-after investments over the past few years, as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) processors has surged. Two companies that have benefited from the trend are semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) and chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nBoth could continue to benefit from heavy spending on AI infrastructure, which is forecast to reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion over the next five years. But which one looks like the better AI stock to buy now and hold for the long term?\nNvidia's AI dominance Nvidia 's ability to meet the soaring demand for powerful parallel processors propelled the company's market capitalization from approximately $364 billion at the end of 2022 to around $4.3 trillion today. Its dominance in the AI semiconductor market has led to skyrocketing revenue and earnings.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025 (which ended Jan. 26, 2025), Nvidia's sales rose by 114% to $130.5 billion, and its diluted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 130% to $2.99. And the good times are still rolling for Nvidia. Its revenue increased by 62% in its fiscal 2026 third quarter to $57 billion, and EPS popped by 67% to $1.30.\nThe chipmaker's ability to grow sales and earnings so quickly stems from its estimated 90% share of the data center GPU market. The company's chip designs are superior to competitors' at AI processing, leaving tech giants clamoring for its most advanced semiconductors.\nMoreover, the AI chip market's growth will have more drivers than chatbots from OpenAI and Alphabet . Tech companies are increasingly betting on robotics, self-driving vehicles, and other autonomous systems that will also require advanced AI processors. Consider that Morgan Stanley estimates the humanoid robotics market could be worth $5 trillion by 2050.\n\nAs these other markets begin to take shape, it could fuel further sales growth for Nvidia's processors.\nASML benefits from demand for Nvidia's processors ASML makes some of the key equipment required to manufacture AI processors, which it sells to foundry operators like Taiwan Semiconductor , which in turn churn out the semiconductors designed by clients like Nvidia. This part of the supply chain has boomed lately, and ASML's shares are up 52% over the past year.\n\nStory Continues\nASML enjoys an enviable position in the AI chip manufacturing equipment space, holding an estimated 90% market share in lithography. That's impressive enough, and research from Morningstar indicates that ASML's technology is a decade ahead of its rivals. When it comes to making the most advanced chips, its machines hold a technological monopoly, because no peer offers similarly capable options.\n\nThe company also benefits from the fact that it services the machines it sells, providing it with potentially decades of recurring revenue for each machine. ASML's service revenue rose 39% in the first nine months of this year to 6 billion euros, and more growth is expected on that front as it sells more equipment that could remain in use for up to 30 years.\nWhile there are some concerns about the possibility that the AI market may be in a bubble, it's important to note that ASML, like Nvidia, is highly profitable. The company's gross margins hover in the low 50% range, and in the first nine months of this year, its diluted earnings per share were $17.38 -- a 40% increase from the same period in 2024.\nWhy Nvidia has a slight edge over ASML I think both of these AI stocks deserve a place in most people's portfolios, but Nvidia gets the win in this matchup because its shares are cheaper than ASML's. Nvidia's stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 23 right now, compared to ASML's P/E ratio of 34. It's worth noting, though, that both are well below the tech sector's average P/E ratio of 45.\n\nAnd while Nvidia does get my vote, you probably couldn't go wrong buying either stock and holding onto it for years to come.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This Tech Stock Takes the S&P 500 Top Spot in 2025\n\nFernanda Horner\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 12:19 PM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\n^GSPC\n\nSNDK\n\nWDC\n\nNVDA\n\nWith traders dusting off their portfolios and reviewing their investment strategies for 2026, now is a good time to evaluate this year's outperformers to see if they still hold promise for the new year. We already covered the best Dow Jones Industrial Average stock of 2025 -- spoiler alert, it's not Nvidia (NVDA) -- so now the S&P 500 Index (SPX) gets the same treatment.\n\nTaking the benchmark's top spot for the year is Wall Street newbie SanDisk Corp (NASDAQ:SNDK), which began trading in early February and joined the SPX in late November. The flash memory manufacturing company is a spinoff of Western Digital (WDC), which takes the runner-up spot.\nSNDK has added 268.2% in the last nine months, more than quadrupling off its independent trading debut on the Nasdaq at $36 on Feb. 13. Analysts were already taking notice before the rally picked up in September, culminating in a Nov. 12, record high of $284.59. Shares have since pulled back from that peak, but support at $200 appears to be keeping recent losses in check.\nDespite this outperformance, short sellers have been piling on the security, likely due to AI overvaluation concerns . Short interest is up 22.8% in the last two reporting periods, and now makes up more than 5.2% of the security's available float. This suggests SNDK may be a short squeeze contender in 2026.\nIt's also worth noting that the chip stock tended to outperform volatility expectations in the past year, as suggested by its Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) of 89 out of 100.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Credo Technology Stock Is Down 28% in Two Weeks. Is the Dip Worth Buying?\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:44 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRDO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Credo Technology stock dropped 28% in two weeks, but there's no company-specific bad news behind the pullback.\nThe stock's high beta of 2.7 means double-digit swings are normal for this volatile growth name.\nThis high-priced stock is not for everyone, but long-term investors with strong stomachs may find this dip worth buying.\n10 stocks we like better than Credo Technology Group ›\n\nCredo Technology Group (NASDAQ: CRDO) has had a rough couple of weeks. Shares dropped nearly 12% in just five market days as of Dec. 17, and the data networking expert's stock is down 28% in two weeks.\nBut zoom out a bit, and the picture looks very different. Credo's stock is still up 103% year to date and has gained 839% over the past three years -- nearly matching Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) legendary run in almost exactly the first three years of ChatGPT and generative artificial intelligence (AI). That's some legendary company at these lofty heights.\nIs Credo's dip a buying opportunity , or perhaps the start of a long-lasting retreat? Let's take a look.\nWhy Credo's stock dropped There's no company-specific bombshell behind this pullback. Credo didn't miss earnings, lose a customer, or bungle a product launch. Instead, this looks like garden-variety volatility in a high-flying stock.\nAnd make no mistakeL Credo is both high-flying and volatile. The stock's beta value is 2.7, which means the stock tends to move in the same direction as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) market index -- but 2.7 times faster . Double-digit weekly swings aren't unusual for this stock; they're the price of admission to Credo's party.\n\nWhen you own a stock that's up 860% in three years, you're going to see some gut-wrenching drops along the way. That's just how it works in Wall Street's high-octane growth stock lane.\nThe bull case remains intact Nothing about Credo's fundamental story has changed recently.\nThe AI connectivity opportunity is massive. As GPU clusters scale from thousands to millions of chips, the data-transfer \"plumbing\" connecting them becomes mission-critical.\nThat's where Credo enters the conversation. Credo's active electrical cables (AECs) reportedly offer 1,000 times better reliability and approximately 50% lower power consumption than fiber-optic alternatives with similar data speeds. Those are game-changing advantages when deployed across a massive data center.\nThe company is executing. Revenue more than doubled last fiscal year, gross margins are expanding, and the company recently turned profitable.\n\nStory Continues\nThe product roadmap is also compelling, as the company finds new use cases for its fundamental components. New offerings like ZeroFlap optical transceivers and OmniConnect gearboxes could triple or quadruple Credo's total addressable market by 2030.\nAnd Credo's leadership is solid. Co-founders Lawrence Cheng and Job Lam are still running the show 17 years in, serving as CTO and COO, respectively. CEO Bill Brennan has been at the helm since 2013.\n\nThe risks haven't changed either Credo's biggest vulnerability remains customer concentration. Its largest customer accounts for over 40% of revenue, and the entire business serves just a handful of hyperscaler tech giants. That's a real risk, and it's not going away anytime soon.\nFurthermore, the stock isn't cheap by most metrics. Shares are changing hands at 120 times trailing earnings and 31 times sales. That may be a bargain next to market darlings like Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) , but Credo's multiples are loftier than Nvidia's. You're paying a higher price for Credo's hypergrowth, and if that growth stumbles, the stock will take a hit.\nSo is the dip worth buying? Credo's long-term investing thesis is that the company is building the foundational connectivity layer for AI infrastructure. If you see great value in that idea, and you're willing to assume that Credo can stave off well-heeled challengers such as Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , then a 28% pullback in two weeks is just noise, not a value-altering signal.\n\nThis is an aggressive stock for investors with strong stomachs and long time horizons. If that's you, and you've been waiting for a better entry point, you should consider grabbing a few Credo shares while they're trading at a modest discount.\nJust don't expect the volatility to stop. Credo is still a relatively small company, with just $796 million of trailing revenues, and it didn't start delivering consistent bottom-line profits until a year ago. The ride will be bumpy for years to come, but so far, Credo has been heading in the right direction.\nShould you buy stock in Credo Technology Group right now? Before you buy stock in Credo Technology Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Credo Technology Group wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025\n\nRyan Peterson\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:37 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nShares of AMD have steadied near recent highs as investors digest strong AI-related momentum alongside lingering questions about how quickly the company can meaningfully close the gap with Nvidia in data center acceleration. The story right now is less about AMD's growth prospects and more about whether enthusiasm around AI chips has largely been priced in heading into year-end.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, we ran AMD through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI's GPT. The goal wasn't to set a bold long-term target, but to produce a short, data-driven outlook that blends price action, technical signals, and the current narrative around AI demand and competition.\nWhat the AI model is actually predicting The agent was fed recent price action and a focused set of inputs to produce a short-term outlook. At the time of the run, AMD traded at $207.58. For the period from Dec. 16 through Jan. 6, the model's base-case projection came out to:\nAverage predicted price: $207.30\nImplied move: essentially flat drift into early January\nSignal snapshot: MACD remains low and flat, while RSI has begun to decline, pointing to cooling momentum rather than a breakdown\n\nIn plain language, the AI sees AMD's most likely path over the next few weeks as sideways, with little incentive for traders to push the stock meaningfully higher or lower without a new catalyst. That reflects a market that's comfortable with AMD's positioning, but not eager to expand the multiple further in the near term.\nFundamentally, AMD continues to benefit from rising demand for its MI300 AI accelerators, which management has highlighted as a key growth driver into 2025 as hyperscalers diversify beyond Nvidia. Recent earnings results showed data center revenue accelerating sharply year over year, reinforcing the idea that AMD is firmly in the AI spending cycle, even if it remains a distant second to Nvidia in market share.\nAt the same time, AMD's stock has already reflected much of that optimism. Shares rallied strongly earlier in the year on AI enthusiasm and improving PC demand, leaving less room for short-term upside unless orders or guidance surprise meaningfully. Broader coverage has also noted that while MI300 adoption is growing, the pace of revenue ramp and margins will be critical to sustaining investor confidence.\n\nPrice action in December supports that view. The stock has traded in a relatively tight range, with momentum indicators softening. The declining RSI suggests buying pressure is easing, while the flat MACD points to indecision rather than distribution. That combination often precedes consolidation rather than a sharp move, especially in large-cap semiconductor names late in the year.\n\nStory Continues\nThink of this AI outlook as a short-term temperature check. The model isn't making a judgment on AMD's long-term role in AI compute or its ability to take share over time. Instead, it's estimating how the market is likely to behave while investors wait for clearer signals on AI revenue scaling, margins, and competitive dynamics. In this run, the agent favors a muted move.\n\nFor longer-term investors bullish on AMD's AI roadmap and diversified chip portfolio, a flat few weeks is largely noise. For traders, it's a reminder that the next meaningful move in AMD will likely hinge on fresh data, either stronger-than-expected AI revenue traction or clearer signs that competition is pressuring pricing and margins.\nImage: Shutterstock\nThis article ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

Instead, the fund leans into reliable dividend payers such as AbbVie , Home Depot , and Coca-Cola . With only 13.7% of the fund concentrated in its top three holdings, the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF spreads risk more evenly than the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and tends to produce steadier dividends over time.\nIf your goal is decades of passive income you can count on, this fund can serve as a sensible, low-maintenance core.\nWhat makes the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF tick Let's start with the basics:\nSince its founding in 2011, the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF has always offered at least 30% higher dividend yields than the average S&P 500 tracker. These days, the fund's yield stands at 3.79%, which is more than 3 times the leading market index's yield.\nIt's the only U.S.-listed fund that tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index. It's an automated index, ranking American stocks with a proprietary score based on free cash flows, debt balances, return on equity (ROE), effective yields, and five-year dividend growth rates.\nThe tech giants that rule the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes are absent from this top-100 list, presumably because of their modest dividend yields.\nThe 0.06% annual expense ratio is low enough to match many Vanguard funds, and far below popular income ETFs such as the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEMKT: JEPI) at 0.35% and the iShares iBoxx Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEMKT: LQD) with a 0.14% fee ratio.\n\nThere are other dividend-focused ETFs on the market, but the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF tracks a unique high-quality income index with a heavy focus on high-quality dividend funding. It's not a simple bet on high yields , but a more sophisticated approach that also considers each company's fiscal management and cash profits.\nThe trade-off nobody wants to talk about It should be said that the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF isn't for everyone. The fund often lags behind S&P 500 trackers like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) in terms of long-term price gains. Even if you reinvest your dividends in more shares along the way, the broader market's total returns are usually stronger. That's especially true in the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom, where many of the market's top performers come with modest dividend yields or none at all:\n\nStory Continues\nThat's the trade-off you sign up for. You give up some upside during megacap growth runs, and in return you get a steadier paycheck from your portfolio that arrives without a fuss.\nFor many income-first investors, that matters more than headline returns. Dividends pay the bills, fund weekend plans, cover health costs, or buy groceries without forcing a sale in a down market.\n\nThe Schwab Dividend 100 ETF is built for that role: reliable distributions from cash-generating businesses that have paid through cycles, and a mix of household-name holdings that feels like an old friend you can call on when you need it.\nIs this fund right for you? This dividend stability is not a promise, since dividends can be cut even in a diversified portfolio of high-quality payers. It is a practical approach, though.\nIf your plan is to find income to lean on for years, this fund makes it easier to sleep at night. You're relying on companies that have shown they can keep paying, and that they have the financial chops to keep the quarterly checks coming. Pair this security with a few growth-oriented stocks or ETFs if you still want some runway for upside, but treat the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF as the part of your portfolio that writes the checks.\n\nYou may not beat the market this way, but the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF's generous payouts should keep coming in any economy. This fund is for investors who value reliable income over maximum growth; skip it if you want to chase the next Nvidia.\nShould you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) lost 0.3%, after US stocks finished mixed in Tuesday's session .\n\nAfter weeks in a data vacuum, Wall Street is trying to find a clear signal in a noisy November jobs report to pinpoint a path for interest rates next year. Markets are also waiting for the other data shoe to drop: Thursday's update on consumer inflation in November.\nIn a clue to the path ahead, Fed governor Chris Waller said Wednesday that the central bank still has scope to cut rates, hinting at \"50 to 100 basis points\" of room. Another key policymaker, the New York Fed's John Williams, is speaking at a separate appearance.\n\nMeanwhile, AI trade worries rattled tech stocks again following a Financial Times report that Oracle's $10 billion data center project has lost the backing of private lender Blue Owl Capital. It comes amid scrutiny of increasing use of debt and off-balance-sheet moves to fund tech companies' capital spending on AI infrastructure, despite persistent questions over demand for the tech.

Year to date, GE Vernova stock has run up 93%, inclusive of a 15% gain last Wednesday, after the company announced plans to roll out a fuel cell business for data centers at its investor day.\n\nGE Vernova has been seen as a beneficiary of the AI infrastructure build-out, as demand for energy transmission and grid integration is booming. According to RBC analyst Christopher Dendrinos, GE Vernova's electrification backlog has grown 4x since 2022 and is projected to double again by 2028.\nBut news that private lender Blue Owl Capital ( OWL ) will not back a $10 billion deal for Oracle's data center threw funding for that build-out into greater scrutiny on Wednesday.\nStill, GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik emphasized in an interview last week that the company has \"a lot of other drivers\" of demand. Strazik said that only 10% of the company's current backlog comes from hyperscalers, which could grow to approximately one-third of the backlog over the next three years.\n\nToday at 6:06 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nMedline stock begins trading above $35 per share Medline ( MDLN ) shares began trading on Wednesday afternoon at $35 each.

The IPO values Medline at upwards of $50 billion, based on a total of roughly 1.8 billion Class A and Class B shares outstanding.\nThe deal caps the best year for the IPO market since 2021 , with Wall Street's outlook for deals and new issues even more optimistic heading into 2026 .\nRecent reports have indicated that SpaceX is likely to go public in 2026 , with the company having recently struck a deal for insiders to sell stock in Elon Musk's rocketry and satellite business that valued the company at $800 billion.\nMajor AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic are also expected to explore going public within the next 18 months, according to The Information . Database giant Databricks, which raised money at a $134 billion valuation this week, said it could explore a public offering as soon as next year.\n\nToday at 3:02 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nOracle drops on debt concerns Oracle ( ORCL ) shares fell nearly 4% Wednesday after the Financial Times reported that private lender Blue Owl Capital will not back a $10 billion deal for its next data center as the burgeoning AI cloud player rushes to secure computing capacity and investors scrutinize its mounting use of debt to do so.\n\nThe decline put Oracle shares down nearly 18% for the month. The stock fell after the company's earnings last week showed its costs rising more than expected while bleeding more cash than anticipated. The tech firm's $248 billion in off-balance sheet lease obligations revealed in its quarterly SEC filing added to investor fears over its growing debt pile, while its over-reliance on OpenAI to meet its ambitious revenue targets has also sent shareholders backpedaling.\nThough Oracle execs said after its earnings results that it's committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating — it currently has a BBB rating on its bonds — investors haven't been so sure, piling into Oracle credit default swaps that saw spreads reach their highest level since 2009 last week.\n\nToday at 2:45 PM UTC\n\nStocks rise at the open Stocks rose briefly at the market open as Wall Street weighed the latest jobs data and oil surged, while Oracle ( ORCL ) shares slid.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) moved up nearly 0.2%.

Wall Street analysts estimated earnings of $1.04 on revenue of $4.78 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nGeneral Mills' efforts to invest in its brands, divest its North American yogurt business, and unfavorable trade comparisons weighed on the results, the company said.\nFor the full fiscal year, which ends in May, General Mills reaffirmed it expects net sales growth to range from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%. Adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS are both expected to fall 10% to 15% for the year.\nGeneral Mills' guidance was largely in line with analysts' expectations. Although many on the Street believe the packaged foods company is facing some challenges, analysts noted that these challenges are already reflected in the stock price.\n\"Underlying fundamentals remain challenging, but we think many are of the view that this is largely reflected in Street estimates and with shares trading at a discount to PF peers on a historical basis and no major surprises expected for the print itself, many find it difficult to see how the stock could trade lower,\" UBS analysts wrote in a note ahead of the results.\n\nToday at 1:30 PM UTC Brett LoGiurato\n\nHut 8 shares surge as ex-bitcoin miner signs $7 billion AI data center lease Reuters reports :\n\nRead more here .\n\nToday at 1:00 PM UTC\n\nAmerica's biggest banks are ending 2025 on top with big growth goals and markets 'wide open' Bank of America ( BAC ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Wells Fargo ( WFC ), and Citigroup ( C ) are setting ambitious plans for growth in 2026 as they wrap up an upbeat 2025.\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nRead more here .\n\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC Karen Friar\n\nWarner Bros Discovery board urges shareholders to reject rival bid from Paramount The contest for Warner Bros.

Bitcoin is now about 7% lower for the year. It was trading at about $87,100 at noon in Singapore on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the latest decline is a much milder correction than in the previous three down years, it’s happened against a vastly different backdrop. Since the last major crypto crash in 2022, institutional adoption has widened, regulation has matured, and the industry has found its arguably most important champion in US President Donald Trump.\nThe rapid lurch lower since bitcoin hit a record of over $126,000 in early October has confounded bulls and left cryptoassets struggling to find a footing. Volumes are low, investors are bailing on bitcoin ETFs and derivatives markets are showing a lack of appetite for betting on a rebound. Even massive buying from the dominant bitcoin whale — Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ) — hasn’t been enough to turn things around.\n“Most are surprised by the lack of follow-through despite so many positive catalysts,” said Pratik Kala, a portfolio manager at hedge fund Apollo Crypto.\nRead more here .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "1 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock You'll Want to Own Next Year\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:55 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points This company operates market-leading businesses in three industries.\nMassive investments in AI infrastructure have weighed heavily on its free cash flow.\nIt's showing strong operating results that should eventually lead to an increase in free cash flow.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been the driving force behind many of the stock market's biggest winners over the last three years. Big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have seen their share prices reach new all-time highs, driven by strong AI-related business results across both software and cloud computing . Both companies are pushing toward $4 trillion valuations. Meanwhile, Nvidia briefly touched a $5 trillion market cap this year as big tech companies continue to buy up its graphics processing units (GPUs) as fast as it can sell them.\n\nBut not every AI-related stock has zoomed higher this year. One company, in particular, has seen its stock stuck in neutral, climbing less than 5% this year while the S&P 500 is up more than 17%. But that could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors. In fact, the stock could produce very strong returns as soon as next year. Here's why you'll want to own Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2026.\nA dominant force across three major industries Amazon may have started as a small online bookseller, but it has grown to be much more. Its marketplace offers nearly everything you can think of, and it can ship millions of items to U.S. customers within one to two days thanks to its massive fulfillment network. It has built a burgeoning advertising business that has expanded from retail media ads to video ads served through its Prime Video service and other streaming partners. And it's the largest cloud computing platform in the world, operating Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAll three businesses are experiencing rapid growth and demonstrating strong momentum.\nThe online retail business continues to produce high-single-digit revenue growth despite generating over $250 billion in annual sales. Its third-party seller services, which enable other businesses to sell through Amazon's marketplace, are showing accelerating growth, up 11% in the most recent quarter. The entire ecosystem rests on Amazon's Prime subscription service, which has steadily pushed subscription revenue 10% higher.\nAmazon's advertising business is accelerating, climbing 24% in the most recent quarter, reaching a $70 billion run rate. Prime Video is a key catalyst for that continued growth, as 80% of subscribers are on the ad-supported tier and Amazon adds more live sports content to the service. It has also partnered with several major streaming platforms through its demand-side ad-buying platform.\n\nStory Continues\nOverall, Amazon is seeing operating margin expansion in its North American and International reporting segments. A couple of factors are leading to higher margins. First, advertising sales have extremely high margins relative to product sales and even third-party services. The second is that Amazon's improvements to its fulfillment center have reduced its shipping costs. Shipping costs have increased at a slower pace than paid units in each of the last eight quarters.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing business remains the company's most important segment, accounting for most of the operating income and growing quickly. Management has successfully reaccelerated revenue growth for the segment, achieving 20% year-over-year growth last quarter, driven by strong triple-digit revenue from AI services. That rate is significantly slower than both Microsoft and Google, but AWS is also growing off a larger base.\nCEO Andy Jassy expects sales to continue at the current pace for the foreseeable future. That's supported by a growing backlog, which reached $200 billion by the end of the third quarter. Amazon also signed deals in October with commitments exceeding everything it booked in Q3, so there's a lot of momentum behind the cloud computing segment to keep growing.\n\nAmazon looks undervalued right now Amazon is investing heavily to capitalize on the opportunities it sees in both cloud computing and e-commerce. It spent $90 billion through the first three months of the year on capital expenditures (capex), and management expects full-year cash capex to come in around $125 billion. That's well above Alphabet's planned $92 billion in capex for the year and slightly more than Microsoft (which spent $80 billion through the first nine months of the year).\n\nThat high spending has weighed heavily on Amazon's free cash flow, which fell to $14.8 billion over the trailing-12-month period. That's down from $47.7 billion in the previous 12-month period. Indeed, the high capex has hit Amazon's cash flow much harder than capex has hit either Microsoft or Alphabet. That's in part because its competitors have high-margin software businesses that continue to grow quickly, offsetting their spending, while Amazon's retail business still has relatively low margins.\nBut Amazon has gone through multiple investment cycles throughout its history. Each time, it has emerged with much stronger cash flows than it had before the investment cycle. Considering the growing backlog of cloud computing contracts and the secular trend toward migrating to cloud computing services, investors should remain confident that the pattern will hold. While management expects to increase its capex further in 2026, free cash flow will eventually trough as capital intensity levels off. With strong operating cash-flow growth, Amazon should see a rapid recovery in free cash flow.\n\nAmazon has historically traded around 50 times its free cash flow near its peaks. With its current market cap of $2.5 trillion, investors are merely expecting it to return to its peak free-cash-flow levels from a bit over a year ago. It seems very likely that Amazon will far exceed those levels over time, pushing its stock price significantly higher.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "How will the stock market perform in 2026? Wall Street pros weigh in.\n\nMary Cunningham\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:45 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.\nThe S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17— a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.\nThe key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an AI bubble percolate?\n\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"\nOther forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.\nWhat will drive stocks in 2026?\nSeveral catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.\n\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the group said in its equity outlook. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"\nThe AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.\nAnother area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers .\n\nStory Continues\nGrowth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.\n\"That's something we haven't seen,\" he said. \"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it.\"\n\nAdam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.\nStill, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.\n\nIs my money safe?\nThe biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.\nAI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with earnings growth from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.\n\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.\nAmid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.\n\nIn its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.\nCrisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped . The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.\n\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"\nStill, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.\n\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.\nEye Opener: New video emerges of Nick Reiner moments before arrest\nWhat we know after Rob and Michele Reiner's son Nick arrested in their deaths\nMore details emerge about Rob Reiner and wife Michele's killings\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "1 Prediction for Nvidia in 2026\n\nHoward Smith, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 9:41 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Investors are becoming skeptical that Nvidia's remarkable growth can continue.\nNvidia's CEO has already signaled why they could be wrong.\n2026 could mark a new leg of growth for Nvidia.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a focal point of investment in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector this year. It's the undisputed leader in accelerated computing. However, Nvidia's chips aren't the only reason why.\n\nThe company's graphics processing unit (GPU) stacks combine hardware, software, and platform solutions designed to support applications from gaming to professional visualization and accelerated computing. I believe Nvidia's vast array of solutions will reaccelerate growth in the stock price next year.\nAI solutions for the future Nvidia's revenue soared to a record $57 billion in the recently reported fiscal third quarter. That was a remarkable 62% year-over-year jump.\nSome investors believe that this kind of growth is unsustainable. That seems like a sensible position considering that level of sales. I predict that another leg of sustainable growth lies ahead that investors will begin to recognize in 2026. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has already publicly signaled what it will be, too.\n\nEven if the AI data center buildout slows, as some believe will happen, Jensen Huang sees a long growth runway for his company over the next decade. In an interview earlier this year, Huang stated, \"This is going to be the decade of AV [autonomous vehicles], robotics, autonomous machines.\"\nNvidia will supply both hardware and software to support that development. The company produces embedded systems for autonomous and robotic applications. Nvidia's Drive ADX platform provides high-level compute performance for the highest level of self-driving technology.\nThe company calls its Jetson platform \"the ideal software for robotics and generative AI at the edge.\" It's powered by Nvidia's leading Blackwell GPU, helping to generate more hardware sales, too.\n\nInvestors should continue to monitor data center growth to track the state of Nvidia's business. However, watching developments in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and machines should provide confidence that a new leg of sales growth for Nvidia is likely. That, in turn, should drive the stock higher after shares have consolidated over the past couple of months.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,955 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,089,460 !*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 968 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Micron's Make-or-Break Moment: Can AI Hype Justify a 176% Surge?\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nMarket participants are bracing for Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) to report earnings after Wednesday's close, with the bar set high as skepticism around the AI trade begins to surface. The shares have surged 176% in 2025, ranking as the fifth-best performer in the S&P 500 and marking Micron's strongest year since 2013, well ahead of the roughly 40% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. That momentum has softened in recent sessions, with the stock down about 12% over the past four days following a Dec. 10 high, suggesting investors may be reassessing expectations ahead of the report.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Sign with MU.\nIs MU fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe company is expected to post strong growth as sustained spending on AI data centers supports demand for its high-bandwidth memory chips, but the market appears focused on whether that momentum is still accelerating. Recent sharp declines in Oracle and Broadcom, both of which fell 11% in a single session last week, have highlighted how quickly sentiment can turn on perceived AI beneficiaries. Some investors may now be adopting a more cautious stance, waiting for clearer signals on how durable data-center growth could be before re-engaging with the sector.\nValuation remains a central part of the Micron debate. Despite this year's rally, the shares trade at roughly 11 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, the lowest multiple among the 30 stocks in the semiconductor index, which trades closer to 25 times forward earnings. That discount stands out against peers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ), and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), which command significantly higher multiples. At the same time, expectations for Micron's fundamentals have been moving higher, with consensus forecasts for fiscal 2026 net earnings up 16% over the past month and more than 50% over the past quarter, while revenue estimates have risen by more than 20% over the past three months. With enthusiasm elevated and memory demand still cyclical, the upcoming earnings report could either reinforce the view that Micron is reasonably valued or test how much optimism is already reflected in the shares.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "My Surprising Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Pick for 2026\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Investors have become impatient with the lack of immediate results from Amazon's increased spending.\nAmazon is adding more computing capacity to Amazon Web Services.\nAdvertising was Amazon's fastest-growing segment in the third quarter.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nThe \" Magnificent Seven \" is the name given to the group of Nvidia , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , Meta , Tesla , and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . These seven companies are bundled together because they have driven much of the stock market's gains in recent years. As of Dec. 15, they are seven of the world's top nine most valuable companies and represent nearly 35% of the S&P 500 .\nSo far this year, every \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has produced double-digit returns except for one: Amazon.\nOnce the face of growth stocks, Amazon has lagged over the past year, frustrating its investors along the way. Despite that retreat, Amazon may be positioned to bounce back in 2026.\nWhy has Amazon's stock been lagging? There hasn't been one issue that's caused Amazon's underperformance. It's more a combination of factors. First, Amazon has spent a lot of money this year, with capital expenditures (capex) of around $90 billion through the first nine months of 2025.\nGiven how much Amazon has been spending (mostly on AI infrastructure), investors have been wanting more to show for it -- especially when it comes to Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth. With many of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks making big splashes in AI, some people viewed Amazon as falling behind in the race.\nAmazon's heavy spending has weighed on its free cash flow, and that's not something investors typically like without seeing more immediate results. Add in how expensive Amazon's stock has been, and there was little room for error in many investors' eyes.\nAWS is positioning itself for the future AWS may not have been producing the results that we've grown used to seeing over the years, but investors jumping ship seems like a premature overreaction (which is no surprise if you know investors). Yes, AWS has been losing market share to Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, but it's still the world's largest cloud platform by far.\n\nCloud platforms are, and will continue to be, crucial to AI training and scaling. That's why Amazon has been focusing so much on building out more infrastructure and adding computing capacity. It has added more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months and plans to double its capacity through 2027.\n\nStory Continues\nThis investment is noteworthy because, according to calculations from investment bank Oppenheimer , each incremental gigawatt of capacity could add $3 billion in revenue. The high capex might be weighing on Amazon's financials right now, but it's poised to pay off in the long term.\nAmazon has an underrated profit machine There's no doubt that AWS is Amazon's profit engine, accounting for most of its operating income. However, advertising is a high-margin business that has been growing steadily over the past couple of years.\nOn one hand, Amazon has access to data from its millions of customers and Prime members, making it more effective at helping advertisers with targeted ad campaigns. They know what customers buy, when they buy it, what they watch, what they listen to, what they browse, and other information that allows advertisers to target with greater precision.\nOn the other hand, Amazon's massive reach means it has plenty of places to set these ads. Whether it's online, when you search for a specific product, stream something on Prime Video, watch Twitch, or listen to music, there's no shortage of real estate for advertisers looking to reach potential customers. Amazon also announced that it recently struck partnerships that allow its advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix , Spotify , and SiriusXM .\n\nIn the third quarter, Amazon's advertising services revenue grew 24% to $17.7 billion, outpacing its revenue from subscriptions ($12.5 billion). Beyond revenue growth, advertising is a high-margin business that can help Amazon boost its overall profitability. I expect the momentum to continue in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Google teams with Meta’s PyTorch to chip away at Nvidia’s moat, Reuters says\n\nLuke Juricic\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:17 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nInvesting.com -- Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is intensifying efforts to make its proprietary artificial intelligence hardware more compatible with the industry’s leading software, a move aimed at challenging NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) grip on the AI computing market, Reuters reported Wednesday.\n\nThe initiative, known internally as \"TorchTPU,\" focuses on optimizing Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to run PyTorch, an open-source framework originally developed by Meta Platforms Inc. PyTorch has become the global standard for AI development, and its seamless integration with Nvidia’s hardware has historically acted as a significant barrier to entry for competing chipmakers.\nFor years, Google’s TPUs were primarily optimized for its own internal software framework, Jax. While efficient for Google’s internal workloads, this requirement created a \"bottleneck\" for external enterprise customers who have already built their AI infrastructure on PyTorch, according to the Reuters report, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe TorchTPU project represents a shift in organizational focus. By allocating more engineering resources to ensure TPUs are \"developer-friendly\" for the broader PyTorch ecosystem, Google aims to make its silicon a more viable alternative to Nvidia’s market-leading GPUs.\nThe push comes as Google Cloud seeks to prove to investors that its massive capital investments in AI hardware are yielding scalable returns.\nCloud Revenue: TPU adoption is a critical engine for Google’s cloud division, which competes with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.\nThe CUDA Moat: Wall Street analysts often cite Nvidia’s CUDA software as its primary competitive advantage. By natively supporting PyTorch, Google is attempting to neutralize that advantage.\nOpen-Source Strategy: To accelerate market uptake, Google is reportedly considering open-sourcing components of the new software bridge.\n\nWhile Nvidia remains the dominant provider of AI processors, the high cost and limited availability of its chips have led major tech firms to seek alternatives. Meta, one of Nvidia’s largest customers, has been a key proponent of open-source software like PyTorch to ensure hardware flexibility across the industry.\nBy creating a software bridge that allows developers to easily switch away from Nvidia hardware, Google seems set on positioning its own chips to undercut Nvidia’s premium pricing and force a more competitive environment across the AI data center market.\nNvidia stock is down 3.1% in late morning trading, while Alphabet has dropped 3% itself.\n\nStory Continues\nRelated articles\nGoogle teams with Meta’s PyTorch to chip away at Nvidia’s moat, Reuters says\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Amazon Set to Waste $10 Billion on OpenAI\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nAmazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) apparently cannot help itself. Media reports say it plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) reportedly plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI, a firm swarmed by competition.\nClearly, Amazon is trying to buy its way into the AI market when the bubble may be about to burst.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nOpenAI, which until recently has been the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world, has raised money from a long list of investors. Some are venture capitalists who are simply writing checks to get returns. However, another list consists of money or strategic deals with Microsoft, Oracle, Softbank, Nvidia, and, soon, Disney.\nWhat these tech investors are getting is a stake in a company that has had its spot at the top of the industry challenged by Gemini 3. That is an Alphabet Inc. ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) offering. It is also one that the company says will not make money until 2030, one that will need hundreds of billions of dollars to hit its ambiguous goals, and one that has a growing number of direct competitors. These competitors include divisions of public companies, well-funded xAI and Anthropic, and a legion of smaller companies.\n\nBloomberg reports, “OpenAI is in initial discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. and use its chips, a potential win for the online retailer’s effort to broaden its AI industry presence and compete with Nvidia Corp.” Amazon is a tiny player in the AI chip business. Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) dominates, with a market cap of $4.33 trillion, which makes it the most valuable company in the world. Put plainly, the Amazon deal is part of the dangerous “round tripping” that goes on in the industry. One company invests in another. The company that gets the investment uses the money to buy products or services from the investor.\nAmazon clearly has little chance of competing head-to-head with Nvidia, so it is buying its way into the market. And Amazon can hardly say it is getting special treatment from OpenAI. The Financial Times reports, “OpenAI has already locked in $1.5tn in long-term deals with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom to supply chips and other computing infrastructure.”\nOpenAI does have one important strategic advantage in an Amazon deal. Like the rest of the AI world, it does not want to be trapped in a world where Nvidia is the only arms supplier.\n\nStory Continues\nPeople have begun to ask whether the AI industry has created a valuation bubble. They are worried that the companies leading the race into AI will never make money. Many AI products are currently free. Investors worry that the data centers needed to run AI will take years to build and may not have enough electricity to run them. Still others believe that not all the large AI companies can survive in a brutally competitive market. The total of these investments will eventually move into the trillions of dollars.\n\nThe Amazon deal with OpenAI is another example that the train has run off the rails.\nAmazon Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Exclusive-Google works to erode Nvidia's software advantage with Meta's help\n\nReuters\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nDec 17 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google is working on a new initiative to make its artificial intelligence chips better at running PyTorch, the world’s most widely used AI software framework, in a move aimed at weakening Nvidia 's longstanding dominance of the AI computing market, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe effort is part of Google's aggressive plan to make its Tensor Processing ​Units a viable alternative to Nvidia's market-leading GPUs. TPU sales have become a crucial growth engine of Google's cloud revenue as it seeks to prove to investors that its AI investments are generating returns.\nBut ‌hardware alone is not enough to spur adoption. The new initiative, known internally as “TorchTPU,” aims to remove a key barrier that has slowed adoption of TPU chips by making them fully compatible and developer-friendly for customers who have already built their tech infrastructure using PyTorch software, the ‌sources said. Google is also considering open-sourcing parts of the software to speed uptake among customers, some of the people said.\n\nCompared with earlier attempts to support PyTorch on TPUs, Google has devoted more organizational focus, resources and strategic importance to TorchTPU, as demand grows from companies that want to adopt the chips but view the software stack as a bottleneck, the sources said.\nPyTorch, an open-source project heavily supported by Meta Platforms, is one of the most widely used tools for developers who make AI models. In Silicon Valley, very few developers write every line of code that chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices or Google will actually execute.\nInstead, those developers rely on tools like PyTorch, which is a ⁠collection of pre-written code libraries and frameworks that automate many common tasks in ‌developing AI software. Originally released in 2016, PyTorch’s history has been closely tied to Nvidia’s development of CUDA, the software that some Wall Street analysts regard as the company’s strongest shield against competitors.\n\nNvidia’s engineers have spent years ensuring that software developed with PyTorch runs as fast and efficiently as possible on its chips. Google, by contrast, has long ‍had its internal armies of software developers use a different code framework called Jax, and its TPU chips use a tool called XLA to make that code run efficiently. Much of Google’s own AI software stack and performance optimization has been built around Jax, widening the gap between how Google uses its chips and how customers want to use them.\nA Google Cloud spokesperson did not comment on the specifics of the project, but confirmed to Reuters that the move would provide customers with choice.\n\nStory Continues\n\"We ​are seeing massive, accelerating demand for both our TPU and GPU infrastructure,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our focus is providing the flexibility and scale developers need, regardless of the hardware they choose to build on.\"\nTPU FOR CUSTOMERS\nAlphabet had ‌long reserved the lion’s share of its own chips, or TPUs, for in-house use only. That changed in 2022, when Google’s cloud computing unit successfully lobbied to oversee the group that sells TPUs. The move drastically increased Google Cloud's allocation of TPUs and as customers' interest in AI has grown, Google has sought to capitalize by ramping up production and sales of TPUs to external customers.\n\nBut the mismatch between the PyTorch frameworks used by most of the world’s AI developers and the Jax frameworks that Google’s chips are currently most finely tuned to run means that most developers cannot easily adopt Google’s chips and get them to perform as well as Nvidia’s without undertaking significant, extra engineering work. Such work takes time and money in the fast-paced AI race.\nIf successful, Google's “TorchTPU” initiative could significantly reduce switching costs for companies that want alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia’s dominance has been reinforced ⁠not only by its hardware but by its CUDA software ecosystem, which is deeply embedded in PyTorch and has become the ​default method by which companies train and run large AI models.\n\nEnterprise customers have been telling Google that TPUs are harder to adopt ​for AI workloads because they historically required developers to switch to Jax, a machine-learning framework favored internally at Google, rather than PyTorch, which most AI developers already use, the sources said.\nJOINT EFFORTS WITH META\nTo speed development, Google is working closely with Meta, the creator and steward of PyTorch, according to the sources. The two tech giants have been discussing deals ‍for Meta to access more TPUs, a move first reported ⁠by The Information.\nEarly offerings for Meta were structured as Google-managed services, in which customers like Meta installed Google's chips designed to run Google software and models, with Google providing operational support. Meta has a strategic interest in working on software that makes it easier to run TPUs, in a bid to lower inference costs and diversify its AI infrastructure away from Nvidia’s GPUs to gain negotiating power, the people ⁠said.\n\nMeta declined to comment.\nThis year, Google has begun selling TPUs directly into customers’ data centers rather than limiting access to its own cloud. Amin Vahdat, a Google veteran, was named head of AI infrastructure this month, reporting directly to CEO Sundar Pichai.\nGoogle needs that ‌infrastructure both to run its own AI products, including the Gemini chatbot and AI-powered search, and to supply customers of Google Cloud, which sells access to TPUs to companies such as ‌Anthropic.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu, Kenrick Cai and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This $500k Retirement Portfolio Pays $7,700 Per Month\n\nOmor Ibne Ehsan\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:55 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: SI=F\n\nTLT\n\nNVDA\n\nTLTW\n\nJEPI\n\nQuick Read iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF (TLTW) yields 13.92% through covered calls on long-term Treasury bonds.\nTLTW holdings likely benefit from Fed rate cuts as long-term bonds increase in value.\nA three-ETF strategy combining TLTW with gold and silver covered call funds targets 18.5% total yield.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nIf you want a $7.7k monthly income on a $500k portfolio, some may call you crazy, but it is still possible. ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF ( BATS:TLTW ) , FT Vest Gold Strategy Target Income ETF (BATS:IGLD) , and the Ubs Ag Etracs Silver Shares Covered Call ETN Exp 21 Apr 2033 (NASDAQ:SLVO) give you very high yields and a respectable safety profile that can boost your yields massively if you put them in your portfolio.\nThe catch is that these ETFs alone should not constitute your entire portfolio. If you have a portfolio of, say, $1 million, and you want a little more income, you can set aside $500k to higher-yielding ETFs like these to boost your overall income while having some funds to fall back on just in case they don't do as well.\n\nIf not, you should only chase more yield if you fall into any of the two following categories:\nYou are nearing the end of your retirement, and you want to end it lavishly.\nYou're struggling to make ends meet, and you're willing to sacrifice some safety for yield.\nA $500k portfolio churning out $7.7k per month means $92.4k a year, or an 18.5% yield. The following 3 ETFs can make that happen. You can squeeze out even more yield if you allocate more money to the higher-yielding ones, but I'll assume you're just going to split your money equally among them for the sake of this article.\nFT Vest Gold Strategy Target Income ETF (IGLD) The FT Vest Gold Strategy Target Income ETF gives you exposure to the price movements of gold via the popular SPDR Gold Trust ETF ( NYSEARCA:GLD ) while also generating a consistent monthly income. Simply put, it tracks gold but adds extra income by writing call options on gold and then collecting premiums.\n\nYour typical covered call ETF that targets the stock market also generates its income this way. The difference is that gold is much more likely to stay solid through a recession. One bad jobs report, or a major company like Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) reporting a bad quarter, can send covered-call ETFs like JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF ( NYSE:JEPI ) down by double digits. They're only flashy today due to the extended rally.\n\nStory Continues\nIGLD has a stronger foundation as gold itself looks incredibly strong right now, with central banks worldwide stockpiling gold. Sanctions on Russia have caused gold exports from the country to plunge. It's a triple whammy that favors gold when you take the shaky global economy into account.\nIGLD yields 7.39% with an expense ratio of 0.85%, or $85 per $10,000. It's steep, but you won't find a higher-yielding name if you want to buy something that targets GLD.\n\niShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF (TLTW) The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF executes a very similar strategy, this time with U.S. Treasury bonds. It holds shares of another ETF called the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( NASDAQ:TLT ) , which holds U.S. bonds expiring in 20+ years.\nThen, it uses monthly covered call options on those holdings to boost income.\n\nAgain, this is much better than your run-of-the-mill covered call ETF in terms of safety. Bonds are not going to shift under your feet, because they're the safest asset you can hold. Besides, you are likely to get upside on top of the generous yield as Fed interest rates come down. The Fed lowered its interest rates last week, and this is going to make long-term bonds more expensive as they already have secured a higher yield until they mature.\nAnd even if a recession hits, I expect TLTW and TLT to go up, not down. TLT went from $95 to over $122 in a few months as interest rates were cut drastically in 2008. Today, TLT trades below $90 and snaps back quickly as Wall Street gets hungrier for yield. This will translate into more upside for TLTW, as it holds TLT.\n\nThe catch is that TLTW will underperform if the TLT remains flat, which is unlikely to stand the case as the Fed is cutting.\nTLTW yields 13.92%. The expense ratio is 0.35%, or $35 per $10,000.\nUbs Ag Etracs Silver Shares Covered Call ETN Exp 21 Apr 2033 (SLVO) The Ubs Ag Etracs Silver Shares Covered Call ETN Exp 21 Apr 2033 tracks the performance of an index that mimics owning shares of a silver ETF. You benefit from rises in silver prices, but your upside is capped each month. It's very similar to IGLD but more aggressive.\nDo note that this is not an ETF. It is a debt note from UBS (credit risk involved), and it matures on April 21, 2033.\n\nSLVO has long been a loser in the market, as it did not offer any capital appreciation until very recently. If you reinvested the dividends, it would still get you 2% to 3% a year.\nHowever, what changed the equation is that silver prices have tripled since 2024. This is due to unceasing demand from multiple sectors like solar, AI, and more. Plus, silver is seen as a safe haven like gold. Many believe it can still deliver multibagger returns from here as silver's valuation still pales in comparison to the historical gold/silver ratio.\nSLVO is very under-the-radar and gets you a 34.73% yield. The expense ratio is 0.65%, or $65 per $10,000.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Amazon's $10 Billion AI Power Play: OpenAI Deal Could Disrupt Nvidia's Chip Empire\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:38 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nPeople familiar with the matter have indicated that OpenAI is in early-stage discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), a development that could expand Amazon's role in the AI ecosystem while potentially increasing competitive pressure on Nvidia (NVDA). The talks, which remain preliminary and subject to change, could value OpenAI north of $500 billion and may involve the ChatGPT creator adopting Amazon's Trainium chips. If the discussions progress, the arrangement could represent an incremental but meaningful step for Amazon's semiconductor ambitions, particularly as large AI developers begin to test alternatives to Nvidia's dominant GPU offerings.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs MSFT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTrainium is positioned as a core part of Amazon's broader AI strategy alongside Amazon Web Services, which remains the largest global provider of cloud computing and data storage. Despite that scale, AWS has faced stiff competition in attracting AI developers from rivals such as Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), one of OpenAI's largest backers, as well as platforms linked to Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) and Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), both of which have been evaluating non-Nvidia chip options. Amazon has suggested that Trainium chips could handle AI workloads more cheaply and efficiently than Nvidia's market-leading GPUs, an argument aimed at customers seeking cost-effective infrastructure as AI spending accelerates.\n\nThe negotiations between OpenAI and Amazon reportedly began around October, following a corporate restructuring at OpenAI that resulted in Microsoft taking a 27% ownership stake after nearly a year of talks. OpenAI was most recently valued at $500 billion in an employee share sale, briefly placing it ahead of SpaceX as the world's largest startup and highlighting the intensity of investor interest in AI leaders. At the same time, some market observers have warned that parts of the AI funding cycle could be vulnerable to excess, particularly where capital flows loop between suppliers and customers. Notably, OpenAI and Amazon announced last month that AWS will provide $38 billion of cloud computing capacity over seven years, a deal centered on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips, suggesting that any future shift toward Trainium would unfold alongside, rather than immediately replace, existing infrastructure commitments.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

There are already businesses winning the AI race, whether they make hardware, operate cloud platforms, or run the large language models that have become so popular among consumers.\nBut other industries are starting to embrace AI instead of fighting it, showcasing how seriously executive teams are taking this new technology to bolster their competitive positions.\nIn fact, a prominent streaming giant just decided to partner with a top AI company in a move that could impact the media and entertainment sector. Investors should take notice.\nThe House of Mouse is leaning into AI It was announced on Dec. 11 that Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) entered a three-year partnership with OpenAI , licensing more than 200 characters (including Mickey Mouse, characters from Inside Out and Frozen, and Marvel superheroes) for photo generation on ChatGPT and video generation on Sora by those apps' user bases. Disney can show these user-generated videos on Disney+, its streaming platform.\n\nWhat's more, Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI. And it will become a customer, integrating OpenAI's technology across its organization in various ways for its employees and to help create new products for customers.\nThis is clear evidence that Disney is leaning into AI, at a time when those in Hollywood worry about the tech's impact on content creation.\n\"Disney and OpenAI affirm a shared commitment to responsible use of AI that protects the safety of users and the rights of creators,\" the press release reads.\nThis is an encouraging statement for those in the industry, but it will be interesting to see how much appetite there is for watching AI-created videos from viewers.\nDisney benefits because it can potentially earn incremental revenue by leveraging its intellectual property in this new way. While it's not known if the business will make money from its characters' use on ChatGPT or Sora prompts, it can drive more engagement on Disney+ if this type of short-form content catches on. Disney could better compete with Meta Platforms ' Reels on Facebook and Instagram and Alphabet 's YouTube Shorts. There is intense competition for attention .\n\nStory Continues\nAnd it gives Disney a first-mover advantage. Perhaps if AI-generated videos go viral, investors could see similar moves by Netflix , for example.\nOne obvious critique of this decision might be that Disney is selling out and diluting the value of its intellectual property, making its famous characters available to the masses. With ChatGPT counting 800 million weekly users (as of early November), however, this is a good example of a media and entertainment powerhouse attempting to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nInvestors can find value in the streaming market This partnership highlights just how valuable Disney's intellectual property is. With characters, storylines, and franchises that span Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, no company can go toe-to-toe with this depth and breadth of content. It makes sense that OpenAI would want to sign a deal with an industry leader. This also suggests there has been significant demand from ChatGPT and Sora users to be more creative and work with Disney characters rather than other studios' intellectual property.\n\nFrom an investment point of view, those looking to put capital to work in the streaming industry might want to consider Disney. It has become a leader in the streaming wars, with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN providing a full range of content for an entire household. And its experiences segment is extremely profitable.\nShares currently trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.8. It's difficult to find value like this in the stock market these days.\nShould you buy stock in Walt Disney right now?

The program awarded $1.5 million in AI cloud compute and inference credits to startups selected from more than 250 applicants across 60+ countries.\nRLWRLD was selected as the top winner following evaluations by a judging panel that included leaders from NVIDIA, OpenAI, ABB, Physical Intelligence, and venture firms such as Khosla Ventures, Accel, Next47, and Shanda Grab Ventures. Judges assessed finalists on technical originality, scalability, and readiness for real-world deployment.\nAs the first-place winner in the Foundation Models category, RLWRLD received $150,000 in Nebius AI Cloud compute and inference credits, accelerated by NVIDIA AI infrastructure.\n\nThe Nebius Robotics & Physical AI Awards were created to spotlight startups building the models and systems required to deploy Physical AI in real industrial environments. Sixteen companies were recognized across categories spanning Foundation Models, Simulation, Robot Runtime, Industrial Deployment, and Vision AI.\nRLWRLD’s work focuses on building robot foundation models designed for high-difficulty manipulation and reliable industrial deployment, rather than technology demonstrations for general-purpose robotics. At the core of its platform is RLDX, a proprietary robotics foundation model capable of controlling a 15-degree-of-freedom robotic hand, enabling precise manipulation tasks that require human-level dexterity.\nJudges also cited RLWRLD’s use of high-fidelity, multimodal industrial data and its active collaboration with industry partners as indicators of the company’s commercial readiness, particularly for manufacturing and logistics environments where reliability and precision are critical.\n“Winning this category reinforces our belief that Physical AI needs foundation models built for the real world, not just controlled demos,” said Jung-hee Ryu, CEO of RLWRLD . “This recognition reflects the progress we’ve made working directly with industry partners to deploy our technology.”\n\nStory Continues\nFollowing the award, RLWRLD plans to expand global partnerships and accelerate commercial deployment of its foundation models across humanoid and industrial robotics, with a focus on manufacturing and logistics environments in the U.S. and Asia.\nAbout RLWRLD\nFounded in 2024, RLWRLD is a Physical AI startup developing robot foundation models that enable machines to see, sense, and act with human-like dexterity and cognition. The company operates across the United States, South Korea, and Japan, and trains its models using high-precision 4D+ multimodal industrial data collected through a proprietary multi-sensor capture system. RLWRLD is currently working with major manufacturing partners in South Korea and Japan and aims to become a global leader in industrial robotics AI.\nMedia Contact\nKite Hill\nRLWRLD@kitehillpr.com\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4de89afb-3ddf-4e45-8150-57ee7810e073\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Those seven companies — Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Apple ( AAPL ) — are essentially powering the artificial intelligence boom.\nThese stocks are up on average 21% this year compared to a 15% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data. Alphabet is the top performer with an advance of 62% amid optimism on its new Gemini 3 model.\nIn turn, the valuation of the S&P 500 has reached a level even most bulls would agree is on the rich side. Krishna's work reveals the S&P 500 is trading at the 91st percentile relative to its 10-year valuation history.\n\"Complacency\" could ignite an AI bubble, Deutsche Bank strategist Adrian Cox told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (video above).\nRead more: How AI, unemployment, and interest rates could shape the stock market and your investments next year\nIndeed, complacency appears to have settled in, despite the risks investors had to endure this year.\nRemember the \"Liberation Day\" tariff spectacle in April? The S&P 500 tanked 4.8% the day after President Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on April 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped a staggering 1,679 points.\n\nTariffs are now in effect, though they are not as severe as first advertised.\nAnd more recently, disappointments from AI darlings CoreWeave ( CRWV ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) have begun to call into question the near-term outlook for the AI trade.\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation in 2026 in the AI trade,\" Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye said on Opening Bid .\nAlphabet is Essaye's top AI pick for 2026, though he acknowledges there are likely to be winners and losers from the Magnificent Seven complex next year.\n\"I think companies like Oracle that [are] not overextended financially but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that is tied to open AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" Essaye added. \"There's going to be some pretty serious bifurcation. We've seen it in the last, say, two months of 2025. I think that gets worse in 2026.\"\n\nStory Continues\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 17)\n\nJoel South\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:25 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTM\n\nTOYOF\n\nTSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nShares of Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) have retreated 3.4% in the past week, as it announced the acquisition of SchedMD and a partnership with Mistral AI, and in the wake of the White House approving sales of H200 chips to certain Chinese customers. Meanwhile, insiders continue to sell shares. Nvidia’s stock is 22.8% higher than six months ago, outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in that time.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points U.S.-China trade relations have presented headwinds, but Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) is also the dominant AI chipmaker in the market, and the company’s profitability remains strong.\nHere is a look at where Nvidia stock could be headed for the rest of this year and into the next.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nNote that gains for the chipmaker in that time have helped wipe away the steep drop the stock suffered early in 2025, after it reported it would take a $5.5 billion charge tied to the H20 chip export restrictions to China. While some analysts have raised price targets, others caution about ongoing headwinds due to uncertainty surrounding future U.S.-China trade relations and the potential for stricter regulations. The third-quarter report was stellar on the top and bottom lines due to strong growth in the data center segment.\nDespite its challenges, the company's pivot to U.S. AI infrastructure investments signals resilience. With analysts eyeing robust data center demand, 24/7 Wall St. here explores whether Nvidia can sustain its recovery and drive further growth.\n\nWhy Invest in Nvidia? Nvidia faces significant hurdles as it navigates U.S.-China trade restrictions and intense market expectations. In the first quarter, export controls on its H20 AI chip—which had been designed specifically to circumvent export restrictions on advanced technology to China—led to the substantial write-down noted above. Analysts believed the ban could result in a $9 billion revenue hit. Some $700 million would affect fiscal first-quarter results, with the remaining $8 billion spread across the second and third quarters.\n\nU.S. tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures also threatened supply chain costs, particularly for components sourced globally, while competition from Huawei’s Ascend chips grows. These factors had analysts warning of margin pressure. Yet, Nvidia's profitability remains robust. The company has reportedly raised prices 10% to 15% on some of its most popular GPUs as a result of the tariffs. Gaming processor prices jumped 5% to 10%, while it hiked high-end AI GPUs as much as 15% to account for surging manufacturing costs and to keep its earnings stable.\n\nStory Continues\nYet investments in U.S. AI infrastructure, supported by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's $165 billion Arizona fab expansion, bolster Nvidia's supply chains and are backed by its $37.6 billion cash reserve.\nCEO Huang announced during his recent trip to South Korea that Nvidia will supply more than 260,000 advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to South Korean firms, including Samsung and Hyundai Motor. He believes AI has reached a \"virtuous cycle\" where improvements in the models lead to more investment, which in turn leads to further improvement and investment. He also expressed hope that trade talks between the U.S. and China might lead to a change in policy that allows Nvidia to resume sales of state-of-the-art chips in China. As mentioned, the U.S. president has now allowed the company to sell its advanced H200 AI chips to China.\n\nThe AI market is projected to grow at a 37% CAGR through 2030, according to Grand View Research. This supports Nvidia’s $170 billion fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, a 30% increase over the $130.5 billion it generated in 2025.\nNvidia as a Company In its third-quarter earnings report, Nvidia revenue totaled a record $57.01 billion, including $51.2 billion from its data center division. The total was up 66% year over year, largely fueled by the voracious demand for its AI chips.\nThe chipmaker invested $3.2 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, expanding Blackwell accelerator production and AI infrastructure. The company's capex has spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion to meet hyperscaler demand.\n\nU.S.-China trade restrictions still pose risks, even with the seeming thaw, tariffs could raise costs, which would explain the price hikes reportedly implemented. A 36% operating expense increase to $5.8 billion for R&D offset Nvidia's adjusted operating income of $37.8 billion.\nYet, Nvidia's growth is not solely tied to data centers. The company expanded its automotive segment, with a 32% year-over-year increase to $592 million, driven by partnerships with Toyota and Aurora Innovation for autonomous vehicles. This diversifies Nvidia's portfolio amid tariff uncertainties.\nNvidia has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of $65 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook exceeded analysts' consensus projection.\nNvidia as a Stock This has been a rollercoaster year for Nvidia shareholders. The stock dropped to a 52-week low of $86.62 in April. After an announced pause in U.S.-China tariffs and the first-quarter results, the share price recovered. It hit an all-time high of $212.19 in October, which had the company's market cap briefly over $5 trillion.\n\nWhile some insiders have been selling shares, analyst sentiment remains bullish. Of 64 analysts who cover the stock, 60 recommend buying shares, 11 of them with Strong Buy ratings. Their consensus one-year price target is $250.93, which signals over 41% upside potential from its current price. Targets range from $140 to $352 per share.\nCitigroup, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and others recently maintained their Buy-equivalent ratings. Evercore ISI has the street-high target price. It cited accelerating revenue growth, strong demand for Blackwell chips, an improving supply chain, and a significant pipeline. Yet, renowned investor Michael Burry is bearish on Nvidia.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$140.00\n−21.2%\nMedian\n$250.93\n41.2%\nHigh\n$352.00\n98.1%\n\nNvidia's AI dominance, 93% data center growth, and automotive partnerships with Toyota positioned the company for gains in 2025. However, tariff risks and DeepSeek’s competitive AI models require caution. The AI market's growth and the chipmaker's $47 billion second-quarter revenue position Nvidia to achieve its $170 billion full-year revenue target, while its cash buffer and Stargate Project role offer stability. Still, valuation concerns linger. Nvidia is a buy for growth-oriented investors, but others should use caution.\n\n24/7 Wall St.'s 2026 year-end price target for Nvidia is $300.14 per share, which would be a 68.9% gain. That estimate accounts for tariff risks, competition from DeepSeek, and potential Blackwell supply constraints. It also reflects Nvidia's AI dominance and second-quarter 2026 revenue guidance.\nTime to Sell Nvidia Stock as Michael Burry Takes Aim?\n\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are.

      "Content": "Marvell Technology Looks Undervalued as Artificial Intelligence Spending Surges\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Marvell Technology is one of the most undervalued AI stocks right now, and it's down by 25% this year.\nA sale and acquisition have positioned the company to become a long-term winner in the AI data center boom.\nA questionable rumor still weighs heavily on the stock despite Marvell Technology's CEO rebuking it.\n10 stocks we like better than Marvell Technology ›\n\nIf you want to find undervalued artificial intelligence (AI) stocks , you have to start with ones that aren't receiving as much hype. Nvidia is the most well-known growth stock right now, and Palantir Technologies is another AI leader that has attracted plenty of investors.\nHowever, fewer investors know about Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) , and a few controversial rumors have made the stock even cheaper. Marvell Technology is a custom AI chipmaker that investors may want to monitor.\nDispelling the rumors Marvell Technology looked undervalued for most of the year. Its revenue growth rates have steadily outpaced the stock's 25% year-to-date decline. However, Marvell took another hit when rumors swirled around that the company lost a lot of business from Amazon and Microsoft .\nThat type of news would be devastating for the company. AI chipmakers make most of their revenue from a small handful of tech companies , and losing two of the largest hyperscalers in the industry would limit future growth opportunities. Other tech companies may be wary of doing business with an AI chipmaker that lost Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nHowever, Marvell Technology CEO Matt Murphy poured cold water on the rumors when speaking with CNBC's Jim Cramer. Murphy told viewers that Marvell did not lose any business from those tech giants.\nThe debunked rumor continues to weigh on the stock price, which presents an opportunity for long-term investors. However, the credibility around this rumor isn't the only reason investors should appreciate the dip in Marvell Technology stock.\nMarvell's valuation hasn't moved as quickly as its revenue Marvell Technology has a 23.5 forward P/E ratio and continues to post impressive revenue growth. The chipmaker boosted its sales by 37% year over year in the third quarter of its fiscal 2026, ended Nov. 1, while operating income increased by 23% year over year.\nThe net income figure for the third quarter isn't the best for gauging the stock since that number includes the proceeds from a $2.5 billion sale of its automotive Ethernet business. It's a one-off event that inflated Marvell Technology's net income growth, but the company has maintained a net profit margin of roughly 10% in previous quarters.\n\nStory continues\nThis isn't even the first quarter of strong growth for fiscal 2026. Marvell delivered 63% and 58% year-over-year revenue growth rates in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2026. Its revenue and net income are moving in the right direction despite its stock price suggesting that the complete opposite has happened.\n\nMarvell Technology is locked into AI chip growth Marvell's $2.5 billion divestiture gave it more capital while freeing up resources to prioritize custom AI chips. However, the company didn't just stop with selling off a slower part of its business. The AI chipmaker acquired photonic fabric provider Celestial AI for $3.25 billion. The total acquisition may be valued at $5.5 billion if certain sales objectives are achieved.\n\nThe deal should help Marvell Technology scale faster in the burgeoning AI data center industry and boost demand for its AI chips. AWS Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services Dave Brown praised the December acquisition, casting even more doubt into rumors that Marvell Technology lost business from two tech giants.\nMarvell swapped a slow-growth business for a high-growth one that complements its AI ambitions nicely. Investors have not yet priced in this reality. Marvell shares traded above $100 per share to start the year, and it may be due for a rally to all-time highs soon enough.\nIf the AI chipmaker continues to post 30%-plus year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2027 and beyond, the mismatch between revenue growth and its current valuation will become more difficult to ignore.\n\nShould you buy stock in Marvell Technology right now?

      "Content": "Exclusive-How China built its ‘Manhattan Project’ to rival the West in AI chips\n\nFanny Potkin\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:17 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nINTC\n\nSSNLF\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nBy Fanny Potkin\nSINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence , smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. ​The smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\nNevertheless, China still faces ‌major technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government ‌initiative to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.\n\nStory Continues\nChinese electronics giant Huawei plays a key role coordinating a web of companies and state research institutes across the country involving thousands of engineers, according to the two people and a third source.\nThe people described it as China's version of the Manhattan Project, the U.S. wartime effort to develop the atomic bomb.\n\n“The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,” one of the people said. \"China wants the United States 100% kicked out of its supply chains.\"\nHuawei, the State Council of China, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to requests for comment.\nUntil now, only one company has mastered EUV technology: ASML, headquartered in Veldhoven, Netherlands. Its machines, which cost around $250 million, are indispensable for manufacturing the most advanced chips designed by companies like Nvidia and AMD—and produced by chipmakers such as TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.\nASML built its first working prototype of EUV technology in 2001, and told Reuters it took nearly two decades and billions of euros in R&D spending before it produced its first commercially-available chips in 2019.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small ⁠feat,” ASML told Reuters in a statement.\nASML's EUV systems are currently available to U.S. allies including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.\nStarting in 2018, the United States began pressuring ‌the Netherlands to block ASML from selling EUV systems to China. The restrictions expanded in 2022, when the Biden administration imposed sweeping export controls designed to cut off China's access to advanced semiconductor technology.\nThe controls targeted not just EUV systems but also older deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines that produce less-advanced chips like Huawei’s, aiming to keep China at least a generation behind in chipmaking capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said the Trump Administration has strengthened enforcement of export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and is working with partners \"to close loopholes as technology advances.”\nThe Dutch Ministry of Defence said the Netherlands is developing policies requiring “knowledge institutions” to perform personnel screenings to prevent access to sensitive technology “by individuals that have ill intentions or who are at risk of being pressured.”\nExport restrictions ‍have slowed China's progress toward semiconductor self-sufficiency for years, and constrained advanced chip production at Huawei, the two people and a third person said.\nThe sources spoke on condition they not be identified due to the confidentiality of the project.\n\nCHINA'S MANHATTAN PROJECT\nOne veteran Chinese engineer from ASML recruited to the project was surprised to find that his generous signing bonus came with an identification card issued under a false name, according to one of the people, who was familiar with his recruitment.\nOnce inside, he recognized other former ASML colleagues who were also working under aliases and was instructed to use their fake names at work to maintain secrecy, the person said. Another person independently confirmed that recruits were given fake IDs to conceal their identities from other workers inside the secure facility.\nThe guidance was clear, the two people said: Classified under national security, no one outside the compound could know what they were building—or that they were there at all.\n\nThe team includes recently retired, Chinese-born former ASML engineers and scientists—prime recruitment targets because they possess sensitive technical knowledge but face fewer professional constraints after leaving the company, ​the people said.\nTwo current ASML employees of Chinese nationality in the Netherlands told Reuters they have been approached by recruiters from Huawei since at least 2020.\nHuawei did not respond to requests for comment.\nEuropean privacy laws limit ASML's ability to track former employees. Though employees sign non-disclosure agreements, enforcing them across borders has proven difficult.\nASML won an $845 million judgment in 2019 against a former Chinese engineer accused of stealing trade secrets, but the defendant filed for bankruptcy and continues to ‌operate in Beijing with Chinese government support, according to court documents.\n\nASML told Reuters that it “vigilantly guards” trade secrets and confidential information.\n\"While ASML cannot control or restrict where former employees work, all employees are bound by the confidentiality clauses in their contracts,\" the company said, and it has \"successfully pursued legal action in response to the theft of trade secrets.”\nReuters was unable to determine if any legal actions have been taken against former ASML employees involved in China’s lithography program.\nThe company said it safeguards EUV knowledge by ensuring only select employees can access the information even inside the company.\nDutch intelligence warned in an April report that China \"used extensive espionage programmes in its attempts to obtain advanced technology and knowledge from Western countries,\" including recruiting \"Western scientists and employees of high-tech companies.”\n\nThe ASML veterans made the breakthrough in Shenzhen possible, the people said. Without their intimate knowledge of the technology, reverse-engineering the machines would have been nearly impossible.\nTheir recruitment was part of an aggressive drive China launched in 2019 for semiconductor experts working abroad, offering signing bonuses that started at 3 million to 5 million yuan ($420,000 to $700,000) and home-purchase subsidies, according to a Reuters review of government policy documents.\nRecruits included Lin Nan, ASML's former head of light source technology, whose team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Shanghai Institute of Optics has filed eight patents on EUV light sources in 18 months, according to patent filings.\nThe Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics did not respond to requests for comment. Lin could not be reached for comment.\n\nTwo additional people familiar with China’s recruitment efforts said some naturalized citizens of other countries were given Chinese passports and allowed to maintain dual citizenship.\nChina officially prohibits dual citizenship and did not answer questions on issuing passports.\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nINSIDE CHINA'S EUV FAB\nASML's most advanced EUV systems are roughly the size of a school bus, and weigh 180 tons. After failed attempts to replicate its size, the prototype inside the Shenzhen lab became many times larger to improve its ⁠power, according to the two people.\nThe Chinese prototype is crude compared to ASML's machines but operational enough for testing, the people said.\nChina's prototype lags behind ASML's machines largely because researchers have struggled to obtain optical systems like those from Germany's Carl Zeiss AG, one of ASML's ​key suppliers, the two people said.\n\nZeiss declined to comment.\nThe machines fire lasers at molten tin 50,000 times per second, generating plasma at 200,000 degrees Celsius. The light is focused using mirrors that take months to produce, according to Zeiss' website.\nChina's top research institutes have played key roles in developing homegrown ​alternatives, according to the two people.\nThe Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIOMP) achieved a breakthrough in integrating extreme-ultraviolet light into the prototype's optical system, enabling it to become operational in early 2025, one of the people said, though the optics still require significant refinement.\nCIOMP did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a March online recruitment call on its website, the institute said it was offering \"uncapped\" salaries to PhD lithography researchers and research grants worth up to 4 million yuan ($560,000) plus 1 million yuan ($140,000) in personal subsidies.\n\nJeff Koch, an analyst at research firm SemiAnalysis and a former ASML engineer, said China will have achieved \"meaningful progress” if the “light source has enough power, is reliable, and doesn’t generate too much contamination.”\n\"No doubt this is technically feasible, it's ‍just a question of timeline,\" he said. \"China has the advantage that commercial EUV now exists, so they aren't starting from zero.\"\nTo ⁠get the required parts, China is salvaging components from older ASML machines and sourcing parts from ASML suppliers through secondhand markets, the two people said.\nNetworks of intermediary companies are sometimes used to mask the ultimate buyer, the people said.\nExport-restricted components from Japan’s Nikon and Canon are being used for the prototype, one of the people and an additional source said.\n\nNikon declined to comment. Canon said it was not aware of such reports. The Japanese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nInternational banks regularly auction older semiconductor fabrication equipment, the sources said. Auctions in China sold older ASML lithography equipment as recently as October 2025, according to a review of listings on Alibaba Auction, an Alibaba-owned platform.\nA team of around 100 recent university graduates is focused on reverse-engineering components from both EUV and DUV lithography machines, according to the people.\nEach worker's desk is filmed by an individual camera ⁠to document their efforts to disassemble and reassemble parts—work the people described as key to China's lithography efforts.\n\nStaffers who successfully reassemble a component receive bonuses, the people said.\nHUAWEI SCIENTISTS SLEEP ON-SITE\nWhile the EUV project is run by the Chinese government, Huawei is involved in every step of the supply chain from chip design and fabrication equipment to manufacturing and final integration into products like smartphones, according to four people familiar with Huawei’s operations.\nCEO Ren Zhengfei briefs senior Chinese leaders on progress, according to one of the people.\nThe U.S. placed Huawei on an entity list in 2019, banning American companies from ‌doing business with them without a license.\nHuawei has deployed employees to offices, fabrication plants, and research centers across the country for the effort. Employees assigned to semiconductor teams often sleep on-site and are barred from returning home during the work week, with phone access restricted for teams handling more sensitive tasks, according to the people.\nInside Huawei, few employees know the scope of this work. \"The teams are kept isolated from ‌each other to protect the confidentiality of the project,\" one of the people said. “They don't know what the other teams work on.”\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore, additional reporting by Alexandra Alper in Washington, editing by Ken Li and Michael Learmonth)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
