      "Content": "2 Spectacular Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in 2026, According to Wall Street\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 1:47 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: DDOG\n\nWSFX.BO\n\nS\n\nNVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Some of the best potential investment returns in 2026 might come from the overlooked corners of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.\nDatadog and SentinelOne aren't directly known as AI companies, but this technology is now central to the products they offer.\nWall Street is bullish on both stocks for 2026, with the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal predicting significant upside.\n10 stocks we like better than SentinelOne ›\n\nDuring 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks like Nvidia and Palantir Technologies comfortably outperformed the broader market. But a new year can bring new opportunities, and some of the best returns in 2026 might come from the less-obvious areas of the AI industry.\nSentinelOne (NYSE: S) built a cybersecurity platform that uses AI to automate everything from threat detection to incident response. Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) , on the other hand, designed a series of tools to help accelerate the pace of AI development, and they are going to be in high demand as the industry matures.\nThe majority of the analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal recommend investing in SentinelOne and Datadog, and their consensus price targets point to significant potential upside during 2026.\nThe case for SentinelOne According to SentinelOne, the average enterprise security team experiences over 1,000 threat alerts every single day that require manual investigation, and human-led processes simply can't keep up. The company's Singularity platform detects and investigates alerts using AI, thwarts potential attacks at machine speed, and autonomously responds to critical incidents in the event a breach is successful. These attributes ease the burden on human security teams.\n\nLast year, SentinelOne launched an upgraded version of Singularity's integrated AI-powered virtual assistant. It's called Purple AI Athena, and it's capable of reasoning its way through security problems at machine speed, and autonomously implementing solutions. It's designed to think like a seasoned security analyst, so it doesn't just enhance the abilities of existing employees -- it's like having an extra team member entirely.\nSentinelOne generated $258.9 million in revenue during its fiscal 2026 third quarter (ended Oct. 31). It represented a year-over-year increase of 23%, which was an acceleration from the 22% growth it produced in the second quarter three months earlier. The company is officially on track to deliver over $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time ever during its fiscal year 2026 (which ends on Jan. 31), marking a very positive milestone.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 39 analysts who cover SentinelOne stock, and 23 have given it a buy rating, and none recommend selling. Their consensus price target is $21.41, which implies a potential upside of 42% over the next 12 to 18 months, but the Street-high target of $30 suggests the stock could soar by 100% instead.\n\nI think those price estimates are realistic, because SentinelOne is one of the cheapest stocks in the cybersecurity space. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5.1 represents a steep discount to the valuations of CrowdStrike , Palo Alto Networks , and Zscaler , which also offer AI-powered cybersecurity tools.\nAs a result, this could be a great AI stock for investors to buy as the new year gets underway.\nThe case for Datadog Many businesses have shifted their operations and sales channels online over the past decade, allowing them to improve efficiency and reach a global customer base. Datadog developed a cloud monitoring platform to help them manage their digital infrastructure, and reduce costly downtime that often negatively impacts their customers.\n\nDatadog now offers similar products for AI developers. In 2024, it launched LLM Observability, which helps developers identify technical issues and track expenditures when building large language models (LLMs), which sit at the foundation of most AI software applications. LLM Observability also constantly monitors the quality of a model's outputs, to ensure it produces accurate information for end users.\nDatadog also offers an advanced AI assistant called Bits AI, which integrates into its various product platforms. It can autonomously investigate alerts, diagnose technical issues, and even suggest potential solutions. This not only saves human workers a significant amount of time, but it also reduces digital infrastructure downtime even further than Datadog's original product suite.\n\nDatadog had around 32,000 customers at the end of the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30). Around 5,000 of them were using at least one of its AI products, and that number was up by a whopping 67% compared to the year-ago period. The company's revenue from AI-native customers also doubled during the quarter, and accounted for a record-high 12% of its total revenue of $886 million.\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 48 analysts who cover Datadog stock, and 35 rate it a buy, while none recommend selling. They have an average price target of $214.67, which suggests the stock could climb by 57% over the next 12 to 18 months, and the Street-high target of $260 points to an even bigger potential upside of 91%.\nBased on the incredible momentum in Datadog's AI business, I think its stock could be a great addition to any diversified portfolio this year.\n\nShould you buy stock in SentinelOne right now?

      "Content": "Palantir Billionaire Peter Thiel Sells Nvidia and Tesla, and Buys an AI Stock Up 483,000% Since Its IPO\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Nvidia has more than 80% market share in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators.\nTesla has a massive long-term opportunity in autonomous driving technology.\nMicrosoft is monetizing artificial intelligence through software and cloud services.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nBillionaire Peter Thiel is best known for his role in co-founding Palantir Technologies . But he also runs the hedge fund Thiel Macro, which made three interesting trades in the third quarter:\n\nThiel Macro sold 100% of its stake in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nIt sold 76% of its stake in Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nFinally, it started a position in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) .\nThe new position in Microsoft is particularly interesting. It accounts for 34% of the hedge fund's invested assets despite returning about 483,000% since its IPO in March 1986. In other words, Microsoft has already been an extraordinary winner, but Thiel is evidently confident it will continue winning from here.\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia, Tesla, and Microsoft.\n1. Nvidia Nvidia is well known for its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs), chips used to speed up compute-intensive data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) training and inference. However, the company is truly formidable due to its full-stack strategy that spans adjacent hardware (like CPUs and networking) and software development tools.\n\nWhy did Thiel exit his position in Nvidia during the third quarter? I would hazard a guess at competition from Broadcom and Marvell Technology , companies that designed custom AI chips for Alphabet and Amazon , respectively. However, custom AI chips are unlikely to put a major dent in Nvidia's dominance -- the company controls more than 80% of the AI accelerator market -- because the total cost of operations is often higher.\nAdditionally, Thiel may have been concerned about export restrictions, which have stopped Nvidia from selling its chips in China, the second-largest artificial intelligence market in the world. However, President Trump recently said Nvidia could sell its H200 GPUs in China , which could be a material (and unexpected) catalyst for the company.\n\nPersonally, I think Thiel sold Nvidia too early. Wall Street expects adjusted earnings to grow at 67% annually through fiscal 2027 (ends in January). That makes the current valuation of 46 times earnings look rather cheap, especially when Nvidia beat the consensus earnings estimate by 3% during the last six quarters. I think patient investors should consider buying (not selling) at the current price.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Tesla Tesla has struggled with various headwinds in recent years, including high interest rates and consumer backlash to Elon Musk's political activities. In turn, while global electric car sales increased 33% during the year that ended in October 2025, Tesla's revenue declined, and its market share dropped 5 percentage points. The company also ceded its status as the market leader to Chinese automaker BYD , and I doubt Tesla will ever regain its lead.\n\nHowever, the investment thesis for Tesla primarily centers around autonomous driving and humanoid robotics. Its vision-only robotaxis (i.e., self-driving cars that navigate based on vision inputs alone, rather than using cameras, radar, and lidar like Waymo) are not only more cost-efficient, but also should scale more quickly because Tesla doesn't need to build detailed maps of each city before commencing operations.\nCurrently, Tesla robotaxis are limited to San Francisco and Austin, despite Musk saying the company would serve \"half the population of the U.S.\" by the end of 2025. However, Tesla plans to enter five more U.S. cities -- Dallas, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, and Phoenix -- in the near future, and Morgan Stanley analysts see the company as the technology leader in a market that could approach $4 trillion by 2040.\n\nImportantly, while Peter Thiel sold Tesla in the third quarter, it remains his largest holding. Wall Street expects adjusted earnings to grow at 8% annually through 2026, which makes the current valuation of 235 times earnings look absurdly expensive. But Tesla is best viewed as a very long-term investment (i.e., 10 years to 15 years) because it will take time for autonomous vehicles and robots to become major facets of daily life.\n3. Microsoft Microsoft is leaning on its status as the largest enterprise software company in the world to monetize artificial intelligence. It has added generative AI copilots to its office productivity, cybersecurity, enterprise resource planning, and low-code development software suites. Monthly active users reached 150 million in the September quarter, up from 100 million in the June quarter, according to CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft Azure is also the second-largest cloud provider as measured by infrastructure and platform services sales. The company has gained about 3 percentage points of market share since ChatGPT launched in late 2022 despite compute capacity constraints. However, Microsoft is adding data center capacity rapidly, and Morgan Stanley's latest CIO Survey ranks Azure as the cloud provider most likely to gain share over the next three years.\nWall Street estimates Microsoft's adjusted earnings will increase at 16% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027. That makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look somewhat expensive. But Microsoft topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 8% in the last four quarters, which makes the current price more reasonable.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The Dow rose two-thirds of one percent while the S&P 500 added two tenths, and the Nasdaq was little changed. Gains in chipmakers like Nvidia were offset by losses in Tesla. The electric car maker’s shares fell about two and a half percent after it posted its second straight year of declining sales in 2025. Last year, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all notched double-digit gains, their third straight year in the green, a run last seen during 2019-2021. Technology stocks boosted the Nasdaq more than 20% and Alex Guiliano, chief investment strategist with Resonate Wealth Partners, says that has made them expensive and investors should look to other sectors for opportunities. “Valuations in different corners of the market, whether it's value or international stock opportunities, can complement quite nicely some of the trends we've seen with the AI narrative. And if you're concerned about where the AI narrative has taken you, especially with valuations being where they are, you don't necessarily have to chase that with new money or the dividends that you're reinvesting. It's a great opportunity to look at other corners of the market.” Another stock on the move today was Ulta Beauty which added two and a half percent after broker Argus Research increased its price target. It says the retailer continues to grow despite a softer industry backdrop as the company gains market share through innovation and exclusive product launches.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $65.49 billion, up 66.5% from the year-ago period.\nNVDA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.66 per share and revenue of $211.91 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +55.85% and +62.39%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.64% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. As of now, Nvidia holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Nvidia is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 39.99. This denotes a premium relative to the industry average Forward P/E of 29.03.\n\nInvestors should also note that NVDA has a PEG ratio of 0.86 right now. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Semiconductor - General industry stood at 3.02 at the close of the market yesterday.\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 40, finds itself in the top 17% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CES is kicking off on January 6th under the bright lights of Las Vegas, and tech editor Dan Howley is here with what to expect. Dan, tell us.\n00:15 Dan Howley\nYeah, Jared, there's going to be a number of big announcements at this year's show. The the first obviously, will probably, and biggest, be out of Nvidia. They're hosting their own press event on January 5th. CEO Jensen Wong will take the stage. He did it last year as well. They announced a number of new products, a new chip for a smaller bitesize desktop AI computer, as well as a number of different software innovations that they've really been pushing as of late. They also brought out their kind of digital army of robots. It was basically a a a video recording uh and then a little tiny robot uh care of Star Wars uh took the stage alongside of him.\n00:54 Dan Howley\nUh outside of Nvidia, we're also expecting to see AMD host their own press event with CEO Lisa Sue. Uh we'll see Intel and Qualcomm both host press events as well related to their respective chips. Uh and then overall, we should see a ton of AI. I mean, you know, the chips themselves are are, you know, obviously enough to say that AI is going to dominate, but uh you can expect to see a lot of robots, uh a lot of smart home devices. You can even see some wearables that are AI powered. And those usually, you know, so far we haven't seen anything too interesting as far as AI powered wearables outside of maybe, you know, the intelligence built into smart glasses or smart watches. There's never been a dedicated device that's really taken off. Open AI is supposedly working on one, don't expect it at CES. Uh and then finally, uh Autos. Autos have been a big part of CES as of late.\n01:54 Dan Howley\nUh they continue to do so and we'll likely see things ranging from flying cars to uh different types of boats. Uh we know that there'll be some major automakers like Hyundai on hand, uh Sony and Honda, their uh Afeela vehicle will be there as well. Uh and so it's going to be a jam-packed show, but again, I think the big takeaway is going to be from Nvidia. They're the the hottest uh company on the market right now and what they're doing in AI as well as AI from the the rest of the companies at the show.\n02:18 Speaker A\nDan, we got about 30 seconds. So I'm just going to ask you real quickly, any surprises over the last few weeks that have jumped into your attention span uh that might kind of give us a hint of what 2026 has in store for us in tech?\n02:32 Dan Howley\nYeah, I mean the the Nvidia Groc uh kind of licensing deal, non-exclusive licensing deal. Uh I think it was estimated $20 billion. That was really interesting and it just kind of shows where Nvidia sees its its future at this point, you know, making these kinds of investments and new types of chip technologies or different types of chip tech chip technologies to really hold on to the lead that it has.\n03:00 Dan Howley\nUh you know, I I think we're going to continue to see these kinds of not necessarily acquisitions, but you know, licensing agreements will hire some executives from a company, uh things along those lines. Uh they really kind of became popular in 2025 and I think we'll continue to see them through 2026. It's a a way for companies to kind of avoid the scrutiny of acquiring a company, taking it over entirely, while still getting some of that knowhow and IP.\n03:22 Speaker A\nAll right, Dan, appreciate it.

For stocks, the outlook calls for more optimism. Every Wall Street forecaster tracked by Bloomberg is predicting that stocks will rally for a fourth consecutive year .

The S&P 500 is down nearly 1% in the period, with investors looking at a third consecutive down \"Santa\" period.\nAmong the top items on Wall Street's 2026 list is the Federal Reserve, where the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 look likely to continue this year. President Trump has promised this month to appoint a new chair to replace Jerome Powell. For now, most traders expect the central bank to hold steady on interest rates later this month, though bets are more split for March's meeting.\nLIVE 19 updates\n9 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nDow, S&P 500 kick off the first day of trading with gains Stocks kicked off the first day of trading with modest gains as semiconductor stocks lifted the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nThe broad-based index gained nearl 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) rose 0.6%.

Let's look at five cheap tech stocks to buy right now.\n\nNvidia While Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock isn't often associated with being cheap, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 25 times next year's analyst estimates. For a company that just grew its revenue by 62% last quarter and continues to see insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) , that's a bargain.\n\nSpending on artificial intelligence (AI) just continues to climb, and Nvidia remains in the best position to capture it. It has about a 90% market share in the GPU market, and its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code has been written, gives it a wide moat. And the company has shown it is ready to go on the offensive following a few recent acquisitions and partnerships.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing With a forward P/E of less than 24, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is another top tech bargain. The company saw its revenue soar 41% last quarter, and it is projecting that demand for AI chips will continue to grow at a more than 40% compound annual rate over the next few years.\nAs the only company that can manufacture advanced chips at scale with few defects, TSMC is in a prime position to benefit from the strong continued demand for GPUs and other AI chips. The company is working closely with chip designers on their semiconductor road maps to expand capacity to meet the increasing demand. And it has strong pricing power that will continue to drive revenue growth as well.\n\nMeta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the cheapest of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, trading at a forward P/E of just 22. However, the company has been a strong grower, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\nMeta's growth is being driven by AI, which it is using to both attract new users and keep people on its sites longer by feeding them more of the content they are interested in. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better ad campaigns and improve targeting.\nLast quarter, this led to a 14% jump in ad impressions and a 10% rise in ad prices. The company has just started gradually introducing ads to its WhatsApp messaging platform and its 3 billion users, as well as on its newest platform, Threads. This should help drive growth in the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nSalesforce With a forward P/E of just above 20, shares of Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) are inexpensive for a solidly growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) company with recurring revenue and high gross margins. Meanwhile, the company has the potential to become an AI winner.\nIts acquisition of Informatica, whose platform gathers data from a variety of sources and creates a single record, helps position it as a central source for a company's data from which AI agents can then act. This is an important piece of the puzzle with AI agents, which should help its solution continue to gain traction.\n\nLast quarter, annual recurring revenue for its AI agent platform surged 330% to $540 million. And this is really just the beginning of what could become an enormous opportunity.\nPinterest With a forward P/E just above 13, Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is not only cheap, but its stock is also in the bargain bin. Last quarter, its revenue climbed 17%, while it grew its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization by 24%.\nThe company has been seeing strong growth in users and average revenue per user in international markets, while it has transformed its site into an AI-powered shoppable discovery platform. Its Performance Plus ad suite is helping advertisers create better campaigns and get better returns on their spending.\n\nUsers are increasingly drawn to Pinterest's platform to shop by the AI features it has introduced, such as visual search and virtual clothes try-ons. Its enhancements on both the front and back ends should continue to drive growth.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "3 AI Stocks Poised to Surge on the January Effect\n\nTirthankar Chakraborty\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 12:00 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nMU\n\nRecent declines in U.S. stocks may be concerning because they defy the historical Santa Claus rally. However, overall, the major indexes posted solid gains in 2025, despite the April sell-off triggered by President Trump’s sweeping tariff declarations.\nNow, they are even better positioned to build momentum due to the “January Effect,” a seasonal tendency for stocks to rise throughout January. Stock prices often gain momentum as investors reinvest year-end bonuses and engage in tax-loss harvesting, which leads to renewed buying in the markets.\n\nTherefore, it’s prudent for astute investors to capitalize on this bullish trend by investing in growth-oriented stocks. Many of these opportunities are concentrated in the technology sector, which has gained significantly from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, the main force driving market growth for some time. Notable among them are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc . MU and Palantir Technologies Inc . PLTR. Let’s see why they are positioned for growth and what makes them a compelling buy –\nNVIDIA Set for Strong Growth on AI Demand and Trade Easing NVIDIA’s strong competitive edge in the AI hardware segment and persistent demand for its next-generation Blackwell chips and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) are set to drive growth.\nLately, the Trump administration has approved shipments of H200 AI chips to select customers in China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, indicating solid growth prospects. This move also suggests that U.S.-China trade tensions have eased to some extent, a development welcomed by NVIDIA and other semiconductor companies.\n\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA expects global data center capital outlays to increase year after year, supporting strong demand for its sought-after computing hardware. All of this has led NVIDIA to project fiscal fourth-quarter 2026 revenues at around $65 billion, with a margin of plus or minus 2%, according to investor.nvidia.com.\nThe company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 55.9%. The company’s $4.66 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) is up 12% year over year, and NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicron Set for Growth on HBM Demand and Strong Cash Position Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are in continuous demand because they handle large volumes of data while reducing power consumption. These chips were not only a growth driver for Sanjay Mehrotra-led semiconductor behemoth in 2025 but will continue to fuel growth this year.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company expects fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion, citing investors.micron.com, nearly mirroring the revenue growth seen during the dot-com bubble. Additionally, Micron has a sufficient cash balance of $3.9 billion from its fiscal first-quarter 2026, providing ample resources to support its growth initiatives.\nThus, the company’s projected earnings growth rate for the current year is 278.3%. The company’s $31.36 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 185.9% year-over-year, and Micron has a Zacks Rank #1 (read more: Micron's Blowout Earnings: The Best AI Stock for 2026?).\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPalantir Set for Growth as AIP Gains Traction Palantir is poised for growth due to the increasing adoption of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) among both U.S. government and commercial clients. AIP has become popular for its ability to seamlessly integrate AI with complex real-world data and workflows, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.\n\nPalantir expects revenue growth for both the U.S. government and commercial client segments and projects total revenues for 2025 between $4.396 billion and $4.400 billion, as cited on investors.palantir.com.\nWhat’s more, Palantir expects growth to continue due to the expanding U.S. commercial and government clientele. As a result, the company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 42.5%. The company’s $0.73 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 52.1% year over year, and Palantir has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since the start of December alone, analysts at two firms, Wells Fargo and Oppenheimer, have each issued ratings updates.\nAt Wells Fargo, analyst Ken Gawrelski reiterated his \"overweight\" rating on Amazon, raising his price target from $292 to $295 per share. Analysts at Oppenheimer also reiterated their \"outperform\" rating, raising their price target from $290 to $305 per share.\n\nAveraging out these two price targets results in a price target of around $300 per share. And $300 per share is a nice, round number. Split-adjusted, hitting it would also represent a new share price milestone.\nBetter yet, besides these two factors, there's something else about $300 per share: Hitting it is perfectly attainable within the next 12 months.\nOne reason why there's a clear path to $300 per share Yes, when it comes to share price appreciation, it's typically several factors, working together, that drive a stock to materially higher prices. In the case of Amazon and its potential to reach $300 per share by December 2026, a similar dynamic is at play. Earnings growth remains a major catalyst for the Magnificent Seven component.\n\nThe top end of sell-side forecasts call for Amazon to report earnings of $8.92 per share next fiscal year. This implies that shares sell for as little as 26 times forward earnings right now. That's a fair multiple, in line with the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of other Magnificent Seven stocks. Still, these stocks could experience valuation expansion in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nBefore fears of an AI slowdown fueled a pullback earlier this year, top tech stocks like Amazon were selling for nearly 35 times forward earnings. A return to such high valuations may be in the cards. With inflation easing, the chances of further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve may be climbing higher.\n\nLower interest rates are typically a positive for growth stock valuations. Moreover, further evidence may emerge that the AI boom will continue unabated in 2026, fueling a sectorwide rerating for AI-exposed major tech stocks.\nThe bottom line If Amazon meets or beats current earnings projections, and rerates to a mid-30s forward P/E, the stock could climb above $300 per share, specifically to around $312 per share.\nConsidering this path to the upside, as Amazon shares start slowly bouncing back, you may want to consider grabbing a position before this rebound gains further momentum.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Where do they go? Are there under the radar tech names people can play that still get them exposure to AI?\n00:15 Speaker B\nWell, it's interesting. I mean the AI trade itself is sort of evolved, right? So the initial push was into the pure uh picks and shovels. Nvidia of course being the massive winner. uh continues to be a winner there of course. Um but now we're seeing it evolve, right? We just mentioned a moment ago a company like Sandisk. What's now investors are saying is what memory do we need in order to actually run uh these large language models sort of in perpetuity. Um and that's one of the reasons why stocks like uh Micron, Sandisk and others have done so well. So I actually think the trade is now evolving, not necessarily into the where the most obvious winners are. Uh what the big question mark is sort of what's going to happen in the software space. Uh names like Service Now, Salesforce have sort of been disappointing in their ability to produce return on investment in their AI build out, um which is one of the reasons why, you know, a company like uh Alphabet was really the big winner last year because they're the triple play when it comes to AI. You know, they have large language models, they're a hyperscaler themselves, um and they can deliver that sort of in uh enterprise and uh consumer applications. Um so I think the trade is still is still on. Uh it's going to be a little bit more volatile because investors are going to start kind of really being more discerning about that spending just as we saw uh with disappointments around Oracle's build out because it's going to be debt funded as opposed to funded from free cash flow.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "‘We’ve Done Our Country a Great Disservice’ by Offshoring: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang Says ‘We Have to Create Prosperity’ for All, Not Just PhDs\n\nCaleb Naysmith\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:56 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBottom Line Up Front: In a recent speech, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined his plan for bringing manufacturing jobs back to America: force companies to build AI infrastructure in America. Huang says this is essential to ensure that everyday Americans can prosper in the age of AI, not just those with PhDs and college degrees. This is something he is fully aligned with President Donald Trump on, and they’re already taking noticeable action to make sure it happens.\n\nThe Details: At a Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) fireside chat on securing U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang addressed his thoughts on federal industrial policy and the best path forward for the United States. When asked about policy approaches spanning energy, regulation, and ownership frameworks, Huang focused on what he described as foundational constraints to long-term growth, linking energy availability, manufacturing capacity, and technological change.\nMore News from Barchart NVDA, NKE, and CM: Bet on These 3 Stocks With Surging Unusual Options Activity for 2026 Gains\nAfter Record Runs for Western Digital and Sandisk in 2025, Consider This 1 Data Center Storage Stock for 2026\nCrowdStrike Insiders Are Offloading CRWD Stock. Should You?\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nSpecifically, Huang said, “President Trump walked into a situation where dramatic actions needed to be taken. The first dramatic action that needed to be taken is to reverse the mistakes in energy growth over the course of the last decade. We’ve done our country a great disservice. There are no new industries you can grow without energy.”\nThe idea is simple: if there is no electricity to power America’s manufacturing hubs, then there’s no chance they can thrive. Simply building the manufacturing first and the electricity later will skyrocket costs, further making build-out unsustainable.\nHe extended that argument to social and economic outcomes, adding, “If we want to fix our social issues, domestic social issues, we have to create prosperity, not just for people with PhDs and college degrees. We have to create prosperity for every segment of the economy. The largest segment of the economy is manufacturing. And we’ve offshored that for too long. For 20 years. We got to bring that back. And we have the ability to do so. And this AI industrial revolution, this flashpoint, is precisely when we should do it.”\n\nNvidia, through its various partners, is helping build out at least $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the U.S. during Trump’s 2024 term alone. Nvidia plans to use its leverage as the company at the center of all of this to ensure America is the AI manufacturing hub of the world. This, he says, will help bring those needed and prosperous manufacturing jobs back to the States.\n\nStory Continues\nThe remarks came amid a broader discussion of how governments respond to structural shifts driven by AI, automation, and advanced computing. Rather than focusing on specific regulatory mechanisms or fiscal tools, Huang emphasized the importance of building energy supply and industrial capacity. While politicians focus on demonizing nuclear and coal, or the environmental impact of energy buildout, Huang says we should be focusing on ramping up energy production exponentially across every available vertical.\n\nHuang’s perspective is informed by decades at the intersection of technology and manufacturing. Since founding Nvidia in 1993, he has overseen its transformation into a central supplier of computing platforms for AI, data centers, and high-performance systems. That position provides direct exposure to the industrial requirements behind digital innovation, including power generation, fabrication capacity, and workforce availability. From this vantage point, energy is the basis of the economy from which everything is built.\nWhile Huang has spoken highly of the Trump administration, the relevance of these remarks extends beyond any single administration or moment. Markets consistently treat energy infrastructure and manufacturing investment as leading indicators of long-term productivity. AI intensifies that relationship by increasing demand for power-intensive facilities such as semiconductor plants and data centers. In that sense, Huang’s comments align with a broader recognition that advanced technologies remain limited by the infrastructure built out to support them.\n\nBy framing AI as an “industrial revolution” rather than solely a software breakthrough, Huang tied social outcomes to industrial strategy. His argument implies that widespread prosperity depends on whether technological change is paired with domestic production and accessible employment.\nOn the date of publication, Caleb Naysmith did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 7% in the morning session after the stock's positive momentum continued as Nvidia acquired $5 billion in the company through a private placement, while the U.S. Treasury also obtained a 10% non-voting equity stake.\nThe investment from Nvidia was part of a previously announced plan to support Intel's finances to enhance production capacity. The Treasury's stake fell under the 2025 CHIPS Act and a 'National Resilience' deal.\n\nIs now the time to buy Intel? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Intel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 37 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 3% on the news that the company confirmed that rival chipmaker Nvidia completed a previously announced $5 billion investment.\n\nThe deal, which was finalized through a regulatory filing, involved Nvidia purchasing approximately 214.8 million Intel shares at $23.28 each. This purchase gave Nvidia a stake of about 4.4% in the company. The investment provided crucial funding for Intel's turnaround efforts. The agreement also included a technology partnership, with both companies planning to co-develop advanced chips for data centers and personal computers. This collaboration aimed to combine Intel's custom processors with Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chips to create faster and more efficient systems.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $784.94.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

      "Content": "Why Are AMD (AMD) Shares Soaring Today\n\nAnthony Lee\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 8:01 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nWhat Happened? Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 5.3% in the morning session after investor optimism grew following favorable analyst predictions for 2026 and anticipation of new product announcements.\nThe move came as top Wall Street analysts predicted a potential 32% jump in the stock's value for 2026, building on significant gains from the previous year. This positive outlook was tied to AMD's role in the artificial intelligence sector, driven by demand for high-performance computing and data centers. Adding to the excitement were rumors that the company planned to reveal a new, faster Ryzen chip and a new generation of processors at the upcoming CES 2026 conference. AMD's stock also benefited from a broader rally in tech stocks, as fresh excitement surrounding the prospects of AI lifted the sector.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $220.34, up 2.9% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us AMD’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 30 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago when the stock gained 6.8% on the news that investor optimism around artificial intelligence fueled broad market gains. Technology stocks with a focus on artificial intelligence once again led the market higher, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Companies at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, saw significant jumps in their share prices. The rally reflects a renewed belief among investors in the transformative potential of AI technology to drive future growth and productivity. The rally was further supported by a surprise cooling in the November consumer price index (CPI) report, which triggered market pricing for additional rate cuts in the coming year. This created a more favorable environment for growth-oriented companies.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,387.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas.

We heard Micron talk about it. I I asked uh HP's CEO about it too. They've had to raise computer prices. How much of a focus will that be at CES?\n00:13 Speaker B\nI think it's going to be uh kind of a a side conversation to, you know, the the big announcements, but it's the reality of the situation now in the tech industry. Look, they're raising prices on certain products. Uh if they're not raising prices, there's the uh potential for them to downgrade some devices and sell them that way so that they don't have to use as much memory. And, you know, this is all obviously from the data center build out where, you know, the DRAM is being kind of pushed off uh onto the high bandwidth memory for the data centers and that kind of leaves all the other uses for DRAM kind of in the wind. Uh and so, you know, I I think this is going to be a topic of discussion. Uh it could be a bottleneck for some time uh for the consumer tech industry and the and the enterprise tech industry. You know, don't forget, basically everything that is a computer uses DRAM. Uh and so they're all going to take a hit. All all of those types of products. So, you know, whether it's as you said, HP, uh Dell, Lenovo, um Asus, those those computer makers. Uh we could start to see it leak into smartphones. Um you know, I don't necessarily think Apple would be uh impacted as much because of their supply chain know-how. Um but we could start to see it hit there. Uh and then, look, cars also use DRAM. Uh and so that could be a component there uh that again hits the cartech uh industry for a while.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Investors will be watching and listening closely to commentary from top CEOs. Last year's CES featured a flashy robot filled speech from Nvidia CEO Jensen Wang, who is scheduled to deliver a January 5th keynote. Here with the top three things to watch at the conference this year is Yahoo Finance Tech editor Dan Howley. Dan, great to see you here. What should investors keep in mind?\n00:27 Dan Howley\nYeah, Jaren, as you kind of pointed out, the the first things are going to be uh Jensen's keynote, uh as well as rival AMD CEO Lisa Sue's keynote. Uh both of them will be speaking on January 5th about their various offerings. This is the Consumer Electronics show. So, naturally, you can expect a number of consumer announcements, consumer focused announcements. That could be things like new graphics cards for gamers, uh new partnerships, things along those lines, but they've also expanded out\n01:00 Dan Howley\nto try to push more of their AI side uh of the business. So, you know, last year we saw Jensen talk about the robots as you kind of mentioned, uh their software offerings through Nvidia, as well as some of their future plans for smaller uh form factor devices which they released this year, uh a desktop kind of AI server that individuals can use on their own. Uh AMD did the same thing basically uh with their own event. And we're also going to be seeing some some announcements from Intel and Qualcomm. So, it really is going to focus primarily\n01:39 Dan Howley\nout of the gate on Nvidia uh and AMD. And then, you know, AI hardware is going to be another large part of the show. We've had uh, you know, companies like Microsoft, HP, Dell, uh any computer maker kind of discussing this idea of AI hardware when it comes to AI PCs. Not just that though. You could see some wearables that are AI focused, maybe some pendants, you know, things along those lines. Um, there's sure to be some vaporware mixed in there. Uh, you know, just products that get announced and then\n02:20 Dan Howley\nnever really see the light of day or they're just kind of looking for acquisitions down the line. Uh and so that those are some of the the other products. And then, you know, I think one of the other things that people really have uh kind of noticed over the years is the change for a lot of CES towards kind of an auto show uh motif where, you know, an entire hall is dedicated to automotives. and not just cars though, there's uh flying car concepts, uh different types of drones.\n02:56 Dan Howley\nLast year or the year before, there was a uh multi-ton uh Caterpillar dump truck that was supposed to have autonomous capabilities. John Deere uh is there. Uh there's a bunch of different boating companies. So transportation in general gets a lot of love uh at CES and we're expected to see more of that this year. Of course, AI will be a big part of that. Uh self-driving is a huge push, uh seeing a huge push. It's it's been kind of, you know, what one of the biggest announcements that we see at CES every year or\n03:33 Dan Howley\nkind of the prediction of when we'll get actual full self-driving. You know, there's still a bunch of kings to be worked out if you've seen any of the latest news out of Weimo. But uh it is much better than it was. Um but yeah, I mean it it it does seem as though this year is going to just be completely dominated by AI.\n03:55 Jared\nYou know, I love that we're still trying to make flying cars a thing. It's only been about 70 years. Maybe it's going to happen this year. But I want to talk to you about AI and the broad picture for 2026 because AI is appearing in everything right now and we're used to talking about large language models or LLM's. Now I've been talking about small language models or SLM slim with a number of guests and that is you you can put these these language models in a device and it can compute its own\n04:29 Jared\nAI. That's one trend, but uh what are some of the others or any comments on what I've said here?\n04:36 Dan Howley\nYeah, I mean, the those smaller language models, you'll see on uh things like those uh AIPCs, you know, uh Microsoft's been making a huge push with that. Uh as I said, along those, along uh the partner manufacturers, the HPs, uh Dells, things along those lines. Uh smartphone makers also lean heavily on those. But I think we'll just continue to see these kind of questions circle around the the eventual payoff with AI. Where where this actually does go. And you know, there's been survey after survey saying, oh, some companies are\n05:17 Dan Howley\nare doing great when it comes to AI, when it comes to getting a return or seeing improved uh uh efficiencies. Others times we've seen things where it says, well, companies aren't really seeing a return. I think that's going to continue to be a big part of this conversation with regards to AI. Uh also, how much money is going to be funneled into it uh is going to continue to be a big part of the conversation. You know, the the hyperscalers, hundreds of billions of dollars are being pumped in through uh data center build out. Uh that's going to\n05:54 Dan Howley\nbe a big topic of conversation, whether or not there'll be a pull back on spending, if Nvidia can keep it up. But, you know, I I think really it's going to be that kind of up and down that we saw over the last year where, you know, there was this sense of everything's great, you know, euphoria reigns, and then kind of the the storm clouds come in when there's any hint of bad news. Uh I think it's going to continue to kind of be that way in this year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is This Fund the Ultimate Buy and Hold Investment for the Age of AI?\n\nWilliam Dahl, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nKey Points Analysts are hotly debating whether Nvidia's position in the age of AI is unassailable.\nYet, it's impossible to know which winners will emerge in a few years' time.\nOne diversified fund with low fees and stellar performance offers a potential solution.\n10 stocks we like better than VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF ›\n\nSome analysts say that semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , whose chips have formed the backbone of the AI revolution so far, should be worried about Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) $900 billion project around tensor processing unit chips.\nOthers say that the OpenAI partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is suddenly threatening Nvidia's 90% market share for graphics processing units. Still others view Nvidia's position as unassailable, with Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya stating the company operates in a \"different galaxy\" than its competitors.\nYet many of us are old enough to remember when Nvidia stock lost a sixth of its value in January 2025, as China's AI chatbot DeepSeek rattled markets, with Wall Street terrified that an AI app made at a fraction of the cost of U.S. rivals could upend the industry.\nThis will be another year of record-breaking AI infrastructure spending, with the \"hyperscalers\" (companies building AI data centers at massive scale) forecast to spend $452.7 billion, according to Morningstar. Their combined capital expenditures will be four times greater than what the publicly traded U.S. energy sector spends to drill oil, refine and transport gasoline, and run large chemical plants.\n\nAnd here's one stunning fact: In the age of AI, Amazon 's capital expenditures are greater than that of America's entire energy sector combined.\nWith multi-trillion-dollar companies sparing no expense to win the AI boom, it's impossible to know which will rise or stumble in the looming wave of disruption. And apart from being unknowable, the question of who wins the battle for market share may be the wrong question to ask. At the end of the day, the AI revolution and the $15.7 trillion in wealth it could create may be big enough for everyone.\nA catch-all fund to play the $15.7 trillion wealth wave For investors seeking exposure to some of the most entrenched leaders of the AI revolution, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) is a straightforward play.\nThe exchange-traded fund, with its $37.6 billion in total net assets, is designed to track the returns, as closely as possible before fees and expenses, of the 25 largest and most liquid semiconductor firms. And since ChatGPT ushered in the age of AI in late 2022, its returns have been impressive.\n\nStory Continues\nOver the last three years, the fund has achieved an average annual return of 46.83%. This return leaves the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite , with its three-year average annual gain of 31.12%, in the dust.\nAlas, these gains are in the past, and aren't reliable indicators of how the fund could perform going forward. But there are three reasons I like the VanEck Semiconductor ETF as a catch-all play to tap into the wave of AI-driven wealth creation without betting everything on one or two volatile stocks.\n\nFirst, the fund is diversified, with its largest holding, Nvidia, making up 21% of its portfolio. Its next largest holding, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , makes up just over 10% of the portfolio, while none of its other top 10 holdings crack double digits.\nBecause its methodology allows portfolio selection for both domestic and U.S.-listed foreign companies, the fund is geographically diversified as well. However, it is oriented toward large-cap companies, as it seeks to mirror the returns of the largest and most established semiconductor firms. This doesn't bother me, as I'm more interested in deep-pocketed firms that can spare no expense in protecting their industry leadership and even gain footholds in new markets.\nSecond, the fund offers at least a partial solution to investors who fear overvaluation in AI companies. The average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of its holdings, weighted as a percentage of its portfolio, amounts to 41.3. That means its shares trade at a premium relative to the broader market, but when you consider how fast its top holdings are growing earnings (at 65% year-over-year in Nvidia's case) it's far from the \"nosebleed valuation\" P/E ratios of around 200 seen at the eve of the dot.com bubble collapse.\n\nThirdly, the fund carries a modest expense ratio of just 0.35%, compared to the industry average of 0.56%. The below-average fee means that for every $10,000 invested, just $35 goes toward management fees.\nGiven the fund's stellar performance, both over the last three years and since its 2011 inception, in which shares have returned 26.8% on average each year, this management fee seems reasonable, to say the least. For investors who prioritize capital appreciation, diversification, and a simple and effective way to play the ongoing AI boom, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF is worthy of consideration.\nShould you buy stock in VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF right now?

The 2026 Consumer Technology Association (CES) will kick off in Las Vegas on Monday, January 5, with a keynote speech from Nvidia ( NVDA ) CEO Jensen Huang.\nYahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley discusses what to expect from this year's CES event and what new tech Jensen Huang could unveil in his speech.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Brian\nNvidia and CEO Jensen Wong and we're about a couple days away from him speaking at CES, which I know you'll be there. It's a big uh big speech and the market will be hinging on it.\n00:10 Speaker B\nYeah, that's right Brian. There's going to be a number of uh high profile keynotes from some of the biggest chip companies in the world, but obviously, Jensen Wong's keynote, uh uh keynote will be the the largest of them all.\n00:24 Speaker B\nLast year, they showed off some new gaming chips as well as uh a new uh smaller desktop-sized AI processing unit. Uh they called that Digits at that point. Uh they've since released it uh with various partners. You know, they discussed their push into physical AI, you know, robots, we just that's just called physical AI for some reason now. Uh self-driving cars, things along those lines.\n00:48 Speaker B\nUh and so you can expect to hear more of that this year as well. We'll have to see exactly what they announce. Don't expect uh their high-end chip. Don't don't expect to hear anything about uh Vera Rubin or or any kind of announcement related to that.\n01:04 Speaker B\nThat they save for their GTC conference in March. Uh and so this will likely be uh some of the smaller announcements that they would normally have at other events around the world that they tend to host. But really, you know, I I think last year they came in uh to CES and kind of knocked everyone on their socks, out of their socks rather. and I I think that you're going to see the same thing this year. It's going to be the hottest ticket in town. Uh it will be uh the talk of the strip for the, you know, majority of the week.\n01:38 Speaker B\nUh but you know, as I said, AMD will also be there with their own announcements, uh Intel will be there, Qualcomm will be there. So that the chip makers are are going to be kind of running the show there and it's it's frankly all going to come down to AI.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

HBM3E and HBM4 help power AI servers that run alongside GPUs, and Micron supplies memory that data centers need to accelerate those workloads.\n\nIn Q1 2026 Micron reported $13.6 billion in net revenue, up 21% quarter-over-quarter, and its gross margin expanded sharply to about 57%, a clear sign that higher-margin HBM sales reached meaningful scale.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MU.\nIs MU fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe HBM shortage has pushed customers to pay more and reserve capacity, and Micron says much of its HBM capacity for late 2025 and all of 2026 already carries committed orders. That setup gives Micron near-term visibility into sales and profit growth, especially because large GPU makers such as NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) buy HBM to pair with their accelerators.\nWhile NVIDIA earns most headlines for GPUs, Micron captures the memory side of the same AI stack, and its forward P/E near the low single digits makes the stock look inexpensive relative to NVDA's multiple.\n\nCompetition matters: SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics supply HBM as well, and storage rivals such as Western Digital ( NASDAQ:WDC ) operate in adjacent markets. Still, the connection between GPU demand and HBM demand forms Micron's main growth thesis.\nAnalysts and investors should weigh cyclical memory risks, demand can swing quickly, against the clearer margin tailwind HBM provides today.\nFor investors building exposure to AI infrastructure, Micron offers a value play on memory, while NVIDIA remains the growth engine on the GPU side.\nWall Street Opinion Based on the one year price targets offered by 40 analysts, the average target price for Micron Technology Inc is $290.92 with a high estimate of $500.00 and a low estimate of $86.28. The average target implies a upside of +1.93% from the current price of $285.41.\nBased on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Micron Technology Inc in one year is $322.47, suggesting a upside of +12.98% from the current price of $285.41. gf value is gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. it is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and the future estimates of the business' performance.

In a paper co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng, the Hangzhou-based startup introduced a framework called Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections, which the authors say could improve scalability while reducing the computational and energy demands associated with training large AI models. The research reflects how Chinese startups, operating under US semiconductor restrictions, have been pushed to explore unconventional system designs and alternative architectures.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nDeepSeek's academic releases have historically preceded major product developments. A year ago, the company surprised the industry with its R1 reasoning model, which it developed at a fraction of the cost of comparable systems from Silicon Valley rivals. Since then, DeepSeek has rolled out several smaller platforms, while expectations have been building for its next flagship model, widely referred to as R2, which is expected around the Spring Festival in February. Bloomberg Intelligence has said the forthcoming R2 model, which could launch in the coming months, has the potential to disrupt the global AI landscape again, even as Google's Gemini 3 recently overtook OpenAI in November to secure a top-three ranking on LiveBench's global large language model performance list.\n\nThe latest paper was published this week on arXiv and the open-source platform Hugging Face and lists 19 authors, with Liang's name appearing last. The research addresses challenges including training instability and limited scalability, noting that the approach incorporates what the authors describe as rigorous infrastructure optimization to enhance efficiency. Tests were conducted on models ranging from 3 billion to 27 billion parameters, building on ByteDance's 2024 research into hyper-connection architectures, and the authors said the technique holds promise for the future evolution of foundational AI models.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 6:45 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Nvidia remains well positioned to benefit from the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout.\nTSMC has become an invaluable player in the semiconductor space.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe biggest trend driving the market right now is artificial intelligence (AI) , and with the game-changing technology still in its early innings, there's no reason to think this won't continue over the next decade.\nLet's look at two leading AI stocks to buy and hold for the next decade.\n1. Nvidia The biggest AI winner thus far has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and the company is still one of the best positioned to benefit over the next decade. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, holding an approximate 90% share in the space. However, Nvidia isn't sitting still, as seen by two recent important acquisitions.\n\nIts recent acquisition of SchedMD, the developer of Slurm, only widens its software moat. Slurm is an open-source software platform that's used to orchestrate AI chips, and while Nvidia will keep it open source, by controlling the platform, it can ensure that its chips will be managed the most efficiently using the platform.\nThe company also made a smart deal for Groq, where it signed a technology license and will bring on the bulk of its employees. Groq was founded by the makers of Alphabet' s popular Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and has developed a chip designed specifically for AI inference called language processing units (LPUs). Nvidia will be able to tightly integrate these chips with its software and networking system to better take on the inference market, where cost-per inference becomes a much more important factor.\n\nNvidia's position in the AI data center market stems from the ecosystem it has built around its chips. Its CUDA software platform is where all early AI foundational code was written, and today, the libraries and tools built on top of CUDA to optimize its chips for AI workloads create a huge moat, especially when it comes to large language model (LLM) training. In addition, its proprietary NVLink interconnect system enables its chips to function as a single, powerful unit, discouraging the mixing and matching of chips in AI clusters.\nOverall, Nvidia is set to continue to reap the rewards from the ongoing AI race and data center buildout that is likely to continue well into the future.\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Another company uniquely positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI data center buildout is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) . TSMC is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world and has a tight grip on making advanced chips, like GPUs.\n\nStory Continues\nMaking advanced chips is a difficult process, and Nvidia's competitors have struggled to manufacture advanced chips with high yields at scale. In fact, Reuters recently reported that Nvidia decided, after testing, not to go forward with using Intel's 18A production process. Rival Samsung , meanwhile, after struggling with yields, has turned its focus more toward high-bandwidth memory chips, a market that TSMC does not participate in directly.\n\nThis has made TSMC arguably one of the most important companies in the AI value chain, as without it, chip designers like Nvidia would not be able to produce their chips at scale. As such, TSMC has become a valued partner, working closely with advanced chipmakers to help them shrink the nodes of their chips and increase capacity to meet soaring demand.\nThe company sees AI chip demand increasing at an over 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years, and it has also been raising prices for its services. This includes a nice price hike scheduled for 2026.\nOverall, TSMC is one of the best-positioned companies to benefit from the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout. Meanwhile, it is set to win no matter which chipmakers gain share over the next decade.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced on December 15 that it had purchased AI software company SchedMD in an effort to combat growing competition by doubling down on open-source technologies and increasing investments in the artificial intelligence ecosystem.\nSchedMD is the company that created Slurm, an open-source workload manager that is vital in high-performance computing (HPC) and large-scale artificial intelligence applications. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) affirmed that Slurm will remain open source and vendor-neutral following the acquisition. As a result, the software will remain appropriate for varied setups containing hardware from various vendors.\n\nIn recent months, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has sought to expand its open source and open AI products.\nAt the beginning of December, the company launched Alpamayo-R1, a new open reasoning vision language model aimed at autonomous driving research. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) also stated at the time that it had introduced new workflows and guidance for its Cosmos world models, which are open source according to a permissive license, helping developers better leverage the models to construct physical AI.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and sells specialized processors, initially for gaming but now also crucial for AI, data centers, professional visualization, and the automotive industry.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Now rinse out that champagne glass and pop some Advil because the tech industry’s biggest show of the year, CES, kicks off on Jan. 6 under the bright lights of Las Vegas.\nCompanies big and small will take over the famed Strip and Las Vegas Convention Center, debuting their latest and greatest offerings, and a good helping of fly-by-night products that’ll never see the light of day.\n\nWhile the show officially begins on Jan. 6, the festivities start a few days earlier with events like CES Unveiled and press conferences featuring Nvidia ( NVDA ) CEO Jensen Huang and AMD ( AMD ) CEO Lisa Su. And that means you can expect artificial intelligence to be front and center at the trade show.\nThat will include everything from AI-focused PCs to new chips. But robots are looking like they’ll steal the spotlight in 2026.\n“​Every year CES has a theme. And sometimes you don't know what it is until you get to the show, and everybody's talking about it” explained Kinsey Fabrizio, president of the Consumer Technology Association trade organization, which runs CES.\n“But we can tell you right now, robotics is going to be talked about … big time at CES.”\n\nYahoo Finance will be live and in person in Vegas bringing you all of the latest news and announcements. Here’s what we’re anticipating at CES 2026.\nWhat to expect at CES CES has become a kind of battleground for chipmakers and designers to show off their wares to the world right alongside their biggest rivals.\nLast year, Nvidia was the talk of Las Vegas when Huang held a keynote in front of a massive audience at the Michelob Ultra Arena, debuting the company's newest lineup of gaming chips, a desktop-sized AI rig, and a variety of AI software services and platforms.\nThis year, you can expect even more from the company that closed out 2025 with a $4.5 trillion market cap. Huang, who is scheduled to take the stage at 1:00 p.m. PT on Jan. 5 will likely unveil new gaming offerings, as well as a host of AI apps and capabilities.\nAMD’s Su will then host her own keynote a few hours later at 6:30 p.m. PT, giving that company’s rebuttal to Nvidia’s announcements and providing updates on its own gaming and AI products.\n\nJim Johnson, Senior vice president and GM of Intel's ( INTC ) Client Computing Group, which covers sales of the company’s chips for consumer and enterprise PCs, will also hold a keynote at CES 2026 where he’s expected to provide updates on Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3, codenamed Panther Lake, chips.\nThe processors, which Intel initially revealed in October, are the first to use the company’s highly anticipated 18A chip technology, and are a key part of its broader turnaround effort.\n\nStory Continues\nQualcomm ( QCOM ) will also be on hand at CES, with CEO Cristiano Amon set to participate in a fireside chat with Fortune’s Andrew Nusca. Qualcomm launched its Snapdragon X-series processors for Windows PCs during CES 2025 and will likely build on that momentum at this year’s event.\nEach of the chipmakers will likely provide insights into their plans to power physical AI systems, a technical term for robots, during the show.\nExpect to see humanoid robots on display, as well as a number of robotic arms, AI-powered drones, and self-driving cars scattered across Las Vegas this year, as the industry looks to rapidly advance the technology.\nSpeaking of cars, CES has become a major showcase for the auto industry’s tech ambitions, and this year will be no different. The show will likely include flying car concepts, a mainstay in recent years, as well as a variety of ways car companies are looking to capitalize on the AI trend by incorporating the technology into their vehicles’ dashboards.\n\nAI-powered wearables and fitness trackers could also make their debut at CES 2026. Those can come in the form of smart rings, glasses, or pins. The smart glasses space in particular has gained plenty of attention with the launch of Meta’s ( META ) Ray-Ban Display glasses in September, and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Samsung planning their own smart glasses.\nApple ( AAPL ) is also reportedly looking to get into the smart glasses game, though the company eschews making an appearance at CES in favor of hosting its own highly polished events at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., throughout the year.\nNaturally, there are sure to be some outlandish products at CES 2026. Over the years, we’ve seen everything from smart toilets to forks designed to help you eat healthier foods.\nIt’s sure to be an interesting show, and Yahoo Finance will bring you all of the biggest announcements as they happen.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "We Asked ChatGPT What the Top-Performing Stocks of 2026 Will Be: Do Investing Experts Agree?\n\nVance Cariaga\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:49 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\n^DJI\n\nNVDA\n\nThe stock markets have a hard act to follow in 2026 after setting record highs in 2025. As of the market close on Dec. 30, 2025, the S&P 500 was up by about 17.5% for the year, while the Nasdaq had gained 21.5% and the Dow was up 14.1%.\nWhile it’s hard to predict what’s in store for 2026, some stocks seem poised to keep pushing higher. Which ones will be the top performers in 2026? GOBankingRates asked ChatGPT — and the stocks it picked include some of the hottest names on Wall Street.\n\nHere are the top four stocks picked by ChatGPT, along with its key points about the picks and what other experts have to say .\nNvidia (NVDA) The first stock pick on ChatGPT’s list was Nvidia. Here were its strengths, risks and what to keep an eye on, per ChatGPT.\nStrengths: It’s considered a “top growth stock” thanks to its leadership in graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. “As long as data center build-out and AI compute demand continue, NVDA could benefit,” ChatGPT said.\nRisks: It has a very high valuation, and there’s also supply chain/export/competitive risk. “If AI hype slows, the multiple could contract,” ChatGPT explained.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Earnings growth, new GPU launches, data center contract pipeline and margin trends.\n\nNot everyone believes Nvidia’s momentum is sustainable. Among the skeptics is Chad Cummings, an attorney and CPA at Cummings & Cummings Law who previously worked in finance and tax with American Airlines, PwC and JPMorgan Chase.\n“The Nvidia train is running out of steam,” he told GOBankingRates. “We are advising clients to exit their positions before year-end. Its growth depends on hyperscalers continuing unsustainable data center expansion. One slowdown or energy bottleneck unravels the narrative.”\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Next up on ChatGPT’s list was Microsoft, and it cited these strengths, weaknesses and key factors to keep an eye on.\nStrengths: It’s considered a leading AI infrastructure/cloud play moving into 2026 with a “strong recurring revenue base” and “large market share in cloud, enterprise and AI tools,” per ChatGPT.\nRisks: Its stock growth could decelerate due to “valuation crowding,” meaning shares might soon be seen as overvalued.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Growth in Microsoft’s cloud computing service business, as well as continued AI product launches.\nDespite Microsoft’s robust growth and strong AI position, Cummings called the company “particularly worrisome” because of potential legal and performance problems.\n\nStory Continues\n“Embedding AI in core enterprise tools without clear indemnity invites securities fraud, employment discrimination and professional malpractice claims,” he said. “Several memes have been making the rounds on finance blogs … showing that Microsoft’s integration of AI into Excel produces comedically false mathematical results.”\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) The parent company of Google also made ChatGPT’s list. Here are some key things to note.\nStrengths: Growth in its ad/search business, along with potentially lucrative AI investments , are key strengths.\nRisks: Ad revenue could slow, while the company’s ambitious, innovation-focused Moonshot Factory business “might not pay off” in 2026.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Ad revenue trends, cloud growth and new product/AI service announcements.\n\nMany analysts remain bullish on Alphabet’s prospects. In November, Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson changed his rating from a “Hold” to a “Buy” on the stock, per TheStreet .\nHis reasoning for the upgrade was that Google has proved that its dominance isn’t going anywhere, as reported by TheStreet.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Last on the list for ChatGPT was Advanced Micro Devices. Here are some of its key strengths and risks, as well as what investors should eye in 2026.\nStrengths: It’s seen AI/data center revenue growth and recent large contract wins.\nRisks: It faces competition from companies such as Nvidia and Intel, along with “margin pressure” and “execution risk,” per ChatGPT.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Data-center GPU revenue growth and contract announcements.\n\nIn a recent analysis, The Motley Fool predicted that Advanced Micro Devices will become a trillion-dollar company by 2030. To get there, its market cap (currently about $350 billion) will have to rise by around 185% over the next four years.\nTo back up its claim, The Motley Fool pointed to a deal the company recently signed with OpenAI to deploy six gigawatts of AMD data center chips by 2030. It also praised AMD’s CPU/GPU business for PCs, which has “steadily gained market share over the past decade.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nNearly 1 in 3 Americans Hit by a Costly Holiday Scam, Norton Survey Shows -- How To Avoid This\nHere's What Retirees Wasted the Most Money On in 2025 -- and How To Avoid It in 2026\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : We Asked ChatGPT What the Top-Performing Stocks of 2026 Will Be: Do Investing Experts Agree?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "4 Reasons Why Nvidia Can Beat the Market Again in 2026\n\nRick Munarriz, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:37 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia revenue has topped 60% in four of the past five years.\nAnalyst estimates keep inching higher, pricing Nvidia at a forward earnings multiple that is less than half its current growth rate.\nIf you were waiting for a pullback to hop on, Nvidia is trading 12% below October's all-time high.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shareholders had their ups and downs in 2025, but -- like most of the past few years -- it was worth it by the time the ball dropped. Nvidia stock rose 39% last year, more than doubling the market's return.\nIs 2026 the year that Nvidia's gravity finally meets its match? I don't think so. Let's go over some of the reasons why I believe the world's most valuable company by market cap will continue to outpace the general market returns in the year ahead.\n1. Revenue keeps soaring If you're wondering why Nvidia became the first company to top $5 trillion in market cap -- albeit briefly in late October -- take out your radar gun. Revenue has been on a tear in recent years. Just check out how Nvidia's top line has shot higher through all but one of the last five years.\nFiscal 2021: Up 53%\nFiscal 2022: Up 61%\nFiscal 2023: Up 0%\nFiscal 2024: Up 126%\nFiscal 2025: Up 114%\n\nNine months into fiscal 2026 -- yes, that's where we are now -- Nvidia's revenue has climbed 62%. Its guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends later this month, calls for a 65% jump. Revenue has risen by at least 53% in five of the last six years. Move the starting line up, and Nvidia's top line has soared by 61% or more in five of the last six fiscal years.\n2. This year is being sandbagged by trade war noise Seeing revenue decelerate in fiscal 2026 after more than doubling in back-to-back years isn't a good look, but there's a showdown behind the slowdown. China is the world's second-largest economy. The country accounted for a healthy chunk of Nvidia's business until the U.S. rocked the world with the threat of tariffs during the chip giant's fiscal first quarter.\n\nTrade restrictions blocked Nvidia's ability to sell its high-end artificial intelligence (AI) chips in China. The current framework of the deal to resume sales will prove costly to Nvidia. Analysts expect revenue growth to slow to 50% in fiscal 2027, but this outlook could improve dramatically if Nvidia can compete on a level playing field again.\n3. AI isn't going away You've probably had your fill of AI chatter lately. Everyone seems to have an opinion on the topic, and it may seem that this will only end in AI fatigue or the burst of an AI bubble. Have you considered a rosier alternative?\n\nStory Continues\nGenerative AI is making complicated tasks easier and breathing new life into even stodgy businesses. Companies aren't ramping up their AI investments because a theme is trendy. AI is the most game-changing revolution since the smartphone, and getting left behind isn't an option.\nThe Motley Fool's 2026 AI Investor Outlook Report -- our latest research on the bar-raising reality -- points out that 9 of 10 AI investors plan to hold or buy more AI stocks this year. It's hard to bet against the market bellwether when demand is everywhere.\n\n4. Nvidia is still cheap Nvidia's torrid path to becoming a 14-bagger over the past five years may lead you to believe that Nvidia's is priced at a rich premium to the market. You're right -- but also wrong. Revenue has grown 12-fold over the past five years. Net income has exploded 23-fold in that time.\nThe rearview mirror's reflection may seem rich. Nvidia is trading for 46 times trailing earnings. Now check the windshield for the road ahead. Nvidia is trading for less than 25 times forward earnings. That's certainly more than reasonable for a stock expected to grow at least twice that fast on both ends of the income statement.\n\nCould Nvidia stock get even cheaper without having to move lower? Absolutely. Consider that analyst earnings per share estimates for the new fiscal year, which ends later this month, have grown from $6.36 to $7.57 over the last three months. How much higher do you think that target will be in a year? Now start asking yourself how much higher Nvidia can go in that time. If I'm right, Nvidia will outrun the market in the 2026 footrace.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $505,641 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,143,283 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 974 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Billionaire Peter Thiel Sold Nvidia and Tesla to Buy This Other AI Stock\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nKey Points Thiel sold a ton of Nvidia and Tesla stock during Q3.\nHe scooped up shares of Apple and Microsoft.\nMicrosoft is well positioned to thrive in 2026 thanks to Azure.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nFew names carry as much weight in the tech realm as Peter Thiel. He has a legendary track record, including being a part of the founding groups of both Palantir and PayPal . He was also the first outside investor in Facebook, now Meta Platforms , making it clear that he has an eye for spotting promising opportunities. When Thiel makes a move, investors should pay attention.\n\nBecause his portfolio is worth more than $100 million, his hedge fund, Thiel Macro, must report its end-of-quarter holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission within 45 days of the end of that quarter via a Form 13F . Those forms are made available to the public. So the most recent information we have on his stock moves is as of Sept. 30, but those moves are noteworthy enough to consider even three months later.\nThiel sold Tesla and Nvidia during Q3 At the end of Q2, Thiel held more than 272,000 shares of Tesla and more than 537,000 shares of Nvidia . At the end of Q3, he owned 65,000 Tesla shares and zero Nvidia shares. Those were huge divestitures, and the Nvidia sale in particular flew in the face of the trends in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm. However, Thiel didn't take these funds and invest them in completely different sectors, like industrial or healthcare. Instead, he put the proceeds of those sales into two other tech megacaps: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) .\n\nApple's AI strategy has been a flop, and it will need to make some major changes to get back in the race. As a result, I don't think Thiel was buying Apple for AI-related reasons (unless he knows something that we don't). I'm more interested in his Microsoft purchase.\nMicrosoft isn't a new holding for Thiel. He has had an on-again, off-again relationship with the stock. As of the end of Q4 2024, he owned no Microsoft shares. By the end of Q1, he owned nearly 80,000 shares. He sold all of them in Q2, then bought nearly 50,000 shares in Q3. Since Sept. 30, Microsoft's stock has declined by around 6%. So unless he has lost his faith in Microsoft, the buying opportunity now could be better than when this information was fresh.\nThe stock is also down by around 2% from June 30. This suggests that right now presents a better buying opportunity than the one that Thiel took advantage of. So should investors follow his lead and buy Microsoft?\n\n繼續閱讀\nMicrosoft is acting neutral in the AI buildout Unlike some of its peers, Microsoft chose not to build a generative AI model in-house. Instead, it opted to forge a partnership with OpenAI, and bought a meaningful stake in it. Today, Microsoft owns about 27% of the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC.\nMicrosoft has integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT into its Copilot product, which acts as an AI assistant for its Office products, Bing search engine, and Windows OS, among other software titles. However, OpenAI's not the only generative AI model maker that Microsoft has a partnership with.\n\nIn its cloud computing segment, Microsoft Azure offers its customers access to multiple models to build applications on. Users can choose from Anthropic's Claude, xAI's Grok, R1 from DeepSeek (a cheaper large language model from China), Meta's Llama, and others. This places Microsoft in a neutral position as a facilitator of the AI software trend. That status helped Azure achieve a jaw-dropping growth rate of 40% in Microsoft's fiscal 2026 first quarter, which ended Sept. 30.\nAzure has become the crown jewel of Microsoft's business, and if it continues to have monster success throughout 2026, Thiel's investment will pay off. Based on its results so far, Microsoft appears well positioned to remain a winner in the AI boom.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Nvidia-Groq licensing deal is a 'less clear' problem for FTC\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Josh Lipton\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: NVDA\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) announced a deal to acquire and license the assets of private AI hardware and software designer Groq ( GROQ.PVT ) for $20 billion last week.\nEpistrophy Capital Research Chief Market Strategist Cory Johnson speaks with Josh Lipton about the regulatory risks tied to this deal and how the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may react to it.\nAlso catch Cory Johnson's assessment of Groq's \"deterministic processing\" models. Johnson is also the host of The Drill Down Podcast.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nAll right, so smart to get in there. You've laid out the strategic rationale. Is there regulatory risk for Nvidia with this deal? Is there FTC risk?\n00:06 Cory\nRight. Hell, yeah. This is a huge risk. It's why they structured the deal this way, one would think, because the biggest company in the world with 95% market share in the GPU market, going out and buying maybe their biggest competitor in the future, not AMD, not Intel, uh, not Huawei, right? But this this Groq company has a very uh different approach to doing this. And and to be sure,\n00:46 Cory\nI've invested in a company called Positron AI that is in some ways a competitor to Groq and has some former Groq employees. Um, so I've got some conflict here. I want to make sure all the viewers know what I'm talking and why I'm, you know, hedging my bets here. But, um, I think that, you know, what's interesting here is that if this were a clear acquisition, it would be a clear problem with the FTC.\n01:14 Cory\nThis is a less clear problem except that the FTC has already gone out there and done some investigations of similar kinds of deals at Google and Microsoft and others uh as it relates to AI and chips. So, the FTC is going to take notice of this and notice of the the uh uh nimble yoga that Jensen Wong is doing in in putting this deal together uh in a way that might avoid a Hart Scott Rodino review but might not after all. Now, with a Trump FTC and with a with President Trump's\n01:50 Cory\nreported friendship with Jensen Wong, who knows if that matters as much. But clearly, this is Nvidia trying to take a competitor off the board.\n01:57 Speaker A\nWell, let me ask you. I I am curious, the potential consequences of this deal, Cory, what would be in your opinion, some of the ripple effects investors would need to look out for in terms of that just broader competitive landscape?\n02:13 Cory\nLook, it's really it's really exciting for the investors in this deal. I've talked to a number of them over the course of this holiday weekend because my friends have nothing else to do but text me with their celebratory moments before Christmas. But uh, you know, if this deal goes through, it'll be a huge gain for a lot of the investors in this company. But it it also will show how Nvidia has really got a lock on things going forward as they both own the GPU market, expand into the work world of networking, uh uh as they build out more and more of the systems,\n02:51 Cory\nnot just the chips and even the network that happens within those systems and connecting those systems. But now the notion that they can just go out and use the power that they've achieved with the success of their GPUs to acquire their future competitors. Uh it it you know, it's it's it's a sign of the sign of the times that they might be stifling competition down the road.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Entire market has a 'bubble nature' right now: Strategist\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:30 AM PST\n\nIn this video: COST\n\n^DJI\n\nWMT\n\n^IXIC\n\n^GSPC\n\nCostco Wholesale stock ( COST ) is trading at premium multiples compared to the rest of the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ), similar to Nvidia ( NVDA ).\nJonesTrading Chief Market Strategist Michael O'Rourke and Yahoo Finance senior markets reporter Ines Ferré weigh in on how much further the market may have to run, referencing recent trends in precious metals commodities.\nAlso watch Michael O'Rourke share his perspective on the AI bubble heading into 2026, while EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson compares Nvidia with his so-called pizza and retail bubbles risks.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nHe brings up a good point here. You have a Costco and Walmart trading at premium multiples to the broader market. Yet you look at the health of the US consumer, they're not exactly doing great. The high end doing great, they've enjoyed a lot of gains on Nvidia and stocks, but that middle income and especially the lower income shopper have been really pressured. So it is almost bizarre to see those two stocks trading at a premium or maybe they just trading at a premium because they're they're viewed as defensive trades.\n00:36 Speaker B\nWell, it's funny. Uh, you know, I don't think it's specifically an AI bubble. I think it's it's a bubble, you know, there's the entire tape has a bubble nature to it. whether it's the dig you know, the digital asset treasury companies where, you know, people are buying stocks where the company's business models to perpetually dilute the shareholders, or and the case of, you know, a Walmart, it's it's a great company. It's executing great premium valuation. Yeah, it's it's it's a tough, you know, it's a tough environment out there that to find stocks that are attractively valued. The interesting thing with Walmart is it's last push to 30 plus times earnings had to do with its announced with its announcement with uh, you know, Open AI and integrating chat GPT. So there's an AI element to that as well. But you know, I did speak of about the top 20, you know, the 20 largest market capitalization names in the S&P 500. I didn't say a specific sector, it's just a 20 largest market capitalization names. They represent half the index by market cap and they are expensive and if you add Tesla's multiple in there, they're even more expensive. I was trying to be a little generous.\n01:46 Speaker A\nFair enough. You know, I'm coming to you on Costco. I know you're a big Costco devotee. Uh maybe I'm just making too much of this, but I think Costco is being viewed as a is a quasi play on gold. Of course, they sell gold bars and I would venture to say people, while they respect what Costco's selling, they have steady membership income. A lot of folks out there just say, if they're selling gold bars, I can get my exposure to gold via Costco.\n02:26 Speaker C\nYeah, sure, and those gold bars tend to go very quickly when it comes to uh their uh selling gold bars and what's and look, I mean, the the metals trade in general this year. I mean, if you uh there there are some strategists that say it's gone too far, too too quickly. Um but if you take a look at what Wall Street is also expecting for next year, since you mentioned gold. I mean, you're looking at strategists that are pointing to 5,000 for gold going into next year. You've got the silver bulls that are talking about silver uh being traded uh like an industrial metal because it's it's being treated like an industrial metal because it is uh also used in pretty much everything that has to do with electronics. uh it's it's one of these uh metals that countries are now uh hoarding. Um so there's there's a there's a case to be made for this trade to continue into 2026 despite these massive gains that we've seen in the space.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

And we're uncovering which names exactly can help make some investing magic. Barbara Doran, BD8 Capital Partner CEO and CIO joins us now. Thank you for joining us here. And uh I just want to get yes. I I'm I want us to show the Wi-Fi interactive because you have a few picks for uh the next year and we're showing the 2025 year-to-date totals and you can see some big ones there. NVIDIA, Alphabet, uh Broadcom, Goldman Sachs, Uber, Netflix, Gold, uh Boeing, Starbucks. What's the theme here? Or are there a couple different themes that you like?\n01:05 Barbara Doran\nI think there's I think there's a bunch of different themes. Um even among the technology stocks, there's clearly an AI theme. I think Nvidia and Broadcom, um people keep getting spooked about overbuilding, too much capacity, it's uh a bubble. I don't see it. In Nvidia right now is a 26 times, you know, earnings next year and those earnings will come up. And so I think by a lot of accounts and I certainly believe this that we are still in the early innings. And if you look at for instance, the number of corporations that have yet to really integrate AI fully into their operations. We're talking single digits. A lot of people are really working with consultants trying to understand what they need, how they implement and so I think you're going to continue to see this happen and you're going to see ongoing productivity increases.\n01:54 Barbara Doran\nYou know, the other names, I mean you have one is a turnaround. Um obviously that's\n01:58 Speaker A\nWould that be Starbucks? All right.\n02:00 Barbara Doran\nYeah, you got it, you got it. It has not done that well this year because there's always a question of timing in these things. And I think here you had Brian Nichols, the star CEO who came in after turning around Taco Bell and Chipotle, you know, it was a big hire because Starbucks had lost its way. A great franchise, premium franchise, but they sort of had lost its uh lost its step there. So he's putting a lot of initiatives into place whether it's about operational efficiencies, changing the ambiance, the experience of the customer, the staffing, etc. But a lot of those big initiatives are not going to really bear fruit unt fully until this year. However, in the last quarter, we saw for the first time in almost two years, they had positive same-store sales. and to me that's an indication that the turnaround is working and at these prices, I think the risk reward is very attractive on Starbucks.\n02:44 Speaker A\nI want to talk to you about another kind of outlier here. We got GLD on your list. That is the gold ETF and we saw gains in the precious metals. Gold was on the small side. We saw silver 150 plus percent. What do you like about the precious metals in 2026? Specifically gold.\n03:02 Barbara Doran\nWell, Yeah. Well, I think that for me there's two categories. You know, one is gold and I think what gold is going through, Gold always was the refuge in terms of uh if there was fears, geopolitical uncertainty, inflation. But I think what's been happening over the last few years since Russia's um foreign reserves got impounded, um when they invaded Ukraine back in early '22, and that was some I think 600 billion. A lot of other smaller central banks are saying, hey, wait a minute, we don't really want to be hostage, you know, to foreign powers. And gold is an easy one to up um in the portfolios. I mean if you look at at um the percentage of gold that we hold or Germany or some of the European countries, it's over 70%, you know, in our foreign reserves, but other countries it can be under 10%. So I think that is what you're seeing is steady central bank buying and I don't think that stops anytime soon. So I think gold despite its big run this year can go higher.\n04:02 Barbara Doran\nNow the other metals, you're talking silver, um copper, aluminum, you know, nickel. These are all things that are so important in data center build outs and that as we know is just going gangbusters and there's a lot of building to do over the next few years and probably longer. So I think the demand for that, it's almost like that the supercharged commodity cycle we saw when China was just beginning to ramp up and really transition from this very rural backward economy to where they are today. So the commodity cycle was not just a typical cyclical okay, yeah, supply demand was critical to watch for a year or two then it would be over. I think this has legs and for the reasons that you know we just discussed.\n04:42 Speaker A\nI've heard a lot of talk about a possible super cycle as well. So, I want to move on. Netflix, only up 5% this year, but uh admit it has found itself in a lot of M&A drama, shall we call it that. Warner Brother's Discovery. Um what do you think happens at with Netflix and with some of those um some of those headlines that we've seen on the M&A front?\n05:07 Barbara Doran\nYeah, you know, Netflix is down some 30% but I I think there's probably 40% upside because these are, you know, they they have won the streaming awards. I think it's not I think it's been more than M&A in the last quarter, they disappointed in terms of subscriber growth. Um churn was a bit higher than people expected. but I think that's a lot of noise because even if as growth can slow, they have so many levers to pull. They just continue to churn out new content and really new content, I think it's over 60% um of what viewers watch. and plus if they get this the uh you know, the library, um, you know, of whether the HBO, oh, it's that's 100 years of film and TV and franchises like um Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. and that would be a win-win. but people it's hard to measure what that's going to be because they are paying a premium for that. But I think Netflix is still, I think it's down here, especially the risk reward is extremely attractive.\n06:11 Speaker A\nI want to ask you about Boeing. Uh this is a stock uh we know it had a huge troubles in 2019, 2020 coming into the pandemic. It's gone basically sideways for five years, but it's up 20% 2025. What do you like about Boeing? Have things changed? Is it the year of the Boeing comeback?\n06:34 Barbara Doran\nWell, there's been a lot of false starts. You know, I thought a year ago it was the year of the comeback and then they kept having delays. But it looks like what we're seeing in the last four, five, six months is that deliveries on their some of their key planes are really ramping up. And of course, the stock was moving up nicely then we had a drop because a new plane has been delayed, certification, all that sort of thing. But they are actually the I think the key tell here is that they're they expect to have positive free cash flow next year for the first time in a long, long time. So I think with the ramp up of two critical planes and the third one will be coming on next year, fingers crossed, but they really seem to have up their quality game with new management etc. So again, the risk reward, I think is attractive here.\n07:26 Speaker A\nAll right, Barbara, we got to leave it there, but it has been a pleasure talking tickers with you. Thank you.\n07:31 Barbara Doran\nAnytime. Thank you. Happy New Year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But with as we head into 2026, the story is shifting from pure growth to execution, competition, and also risk. So for more on this, we're going to bring in Bob O'Donnell. He is the president of Techlysis Research. Bob, it is great to see you here and we talked about this earlier in the year on stocks in translation. So give us an update. What do you see the AI, what has been the dominant theme of AI excuse me, I was leading you there of the AI trade this year and you know, kind of heading into next year. What are you keeping your eye on?\n00:48 Speaker B\nNo, fair enough, Jared, thanks for having me, of course. Uh yeah, I mean look, one of the things we talked about back on on that program was this notion of hybrid AI. And by hybrid AI, what I was referring to and continue to talk about is this idea that we're seeing AI being deployed of course in the big clouds and and we're seeing a lot of benefit from Google and Amazon, Microsoft and those kinds of companies, um meta as well. But we're also starting to see businesses themselves start to deploy AI. And so this hybrid AI idea is that the fact that you can do some of this uh AI computing in the cloud with the big uh LLMs, but you can also do it on your own premises or within data centers and things like that. So, that's where a lot of the excitement is because that's where there's a huge long ramp of growth and opportunity. And so that's from companies uh like Dell and HPE, Cisco, some of these other companies who sell some of the servers that the companies are buying. Of course, they include Nvidia chips or AMD chips and I think we'll see a lot more uh competition in AI accelerators in 2026 as well. But the point is a lot of those companies and then the software that they're building and creating with that is driving a whole new wave of opportunity and that's like I said, that's sort of that hybrid AI story. We saw the beginnings of it in 2025. I think we'll see a lot more of that uh in 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: This Unstoppable BlackRock ETF Will Beat the S&P 500 Again in 2026\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 2:21 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: BLK\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Investors with little or no exposure to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks like Nvidia and Palantir probably underperformed the S&P 500 in 2025.\nAI will likely remain a key driver of stock market returns in 2026, and the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF offers broad exposure to the entire industry.\nThe iShares ETF has outperformed the S&P 500 every year since its inception in 2001, and I predict more of the same in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than iShares Trust - iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF ›\n\nBlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with $13.5 trillion in client funds in its custody. Around $5 trillion of that total is spread across over 1,600 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by the company's iShares subsidiary.\nOne of them is the iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGM) , which has a concentrated portfolio of technology stocks that includes many of the giants leading the artificial intelligence (AI) race. It soared by 27.5% in 2025, comfortably outpacing the 17.5% return in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) .\nBut last year's result wasn't a one-off, because the iShares ETF has beaten the S&P 500 every year (on average) since its inception in 2001. Here's why I predict it will outperform yet again in 2026.\nAmerica's best tech stocks packed into one ETF The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF holds 291 stocks. It focuses on the technology sector, but it also invests in tech-adjacent companies from the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors. Zooming in even further, almost 27% of the value of its entire portfolio is parked in semiconductor stocks, which supply the data center chips and components powering the AI boom.\nSeveral of the world's best semiconductor stocks have made it into the iShares ETF's top 10 holdings, where they sit alongside many leading developers of AI platforms and software:\nStock\niShares ETF Portfolio Weighting\n1. Nvidia\n8.92%\n2. Microsoft\n8.87%\n3. Apple\n8.55%\n4. Alphabet\n8.54%\n5. Broadcom\n7.37%\n6. Meta Platforms\n4.67%\n7. Palantir Technologies\n2.55%\n8. Netflix\n2.42%\n9. Advanced Micro Devices\n2.13%\n10. Micron Technology\n2.01%\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Dec. 29, 2025, and are subject to change.\nConsidering those 10 stocks alone have a combined weighting of 56%, they have a significant influence over the ETF's performance. They delivered an average return of 66% in 2025, so it's no surprise the ETF comfortably beat the S&P 500.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia, Broadcom, AMD, and Micron Technology are four of the semiconductor industry's top suppliers of data center chips and networking equipment for AI workloads. Alphabet is one of the largest buyers of those chips, but it also designs its own hardware in-house. Its latest Ironwood Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) -- which it developed with Broadcom -- are so powerful that AI start-up Anthropic placed $21 billion worth of orders for them last year.\n\nAlphabet and Microsoft operate cloud computing platforms where they rent data center capacity to other businesses, who use it to develop AI software. This is a very lucrative practice, and both companies have massive order backlogs from customers who are waiting for more infrastructure to come online.\nPalantir Technologies also deserves a special mention. The incredible 139% gain in its stock last year was fueled by soaring demand for its Gotham and Foundry AI software products, which help companies and government organizations extract maximum value from their internal data. Palantir stock isn't cheap right now , but this company is an early success story in the AI software space.\nLooking beyond its top 10 positions, the iShares ETF holds several other top AI stocks including Oracle , Salesforce , CrowdStrike , and Snowflake , just to name a few.\n\nThe iShares ETF has a great track record against the S&P 500 The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 11.6% since its inception in 2001, which is much higher than the average annual return of 8.5% in the S&P 500 over the same period. The 3.1-percentage point difference might not sound like much at face value, but it would have resulted in substantially higher returns in dollar terms thanks to the magic of compounding:\nStarting Balance in 2001\nCompound Annual Return\nBalance in 2025\n$20,000\n11.6%\n$278,593\n$20,000\n8.5%\n$141,691\n\nCalculations by author.\nBut thanks to the surging adoption of technologies like cloud computing, enterprise software, and AI, the ETF delivered an accelerated compound annual return of 22.9% over the last decade. That's an even bigger gap to the S&P 500, which climbed by 13.4% per year over the same period.\n\nTech giants spent a record amount of money on AI data centers and infrastructure in 2025, and by most accounts, they will likely spend even more in 2026. That will support further returns in stocks like Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, and Micron. Cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud also delivered accelerating revenue growth throughout last year, which suggests their AI infrastructure spending is paying off. If that continues, expect further gains in those stocks during 2026, too.\nBut the tech sector is extremely dynamic, so even if the AI boom unexpectedly cools off this year, other next-big-thing technologies like robotics, autonomous vehicles, and even quantum computing could step up to boost the tech sector and, therefore, the iShares ETF.\n\nThat's why I think there is a high chance this fund beats the S&P 500 yet again in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust - iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF right now?

DefiLlama data shows $616 million in Ethereum ETF selling in December, adding to November’s $1.4 billion in liquidations.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 stock index is still hovering near all-time highs.\nOther assets, such as gold, are also pushing to record highs amid strong macroeconomic tailwinds.\nTo be sure, Ethereum has plenty of bullish institutional supporters.\nTom Lee, chairman of digital asset treasury firm Bitmine, said on X that he expects Ethereum to have a good 2026.\n“Gold moves lead crypto,” Lee said. “If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?”\nCrypto market movers Bitcoin is up 1.7% over the past 24 hours, trading at $89,135.\nEthereum is up 2% over the past 24 hours and trading at $3,040.\nWhat we’re reading Six blockbuster crypto IPOs to watch in 2026 — DL News\nBitcoin miners to tap Zaporizhzhia nuclear power — if there’s a peace deal in Ukraine — DL News\nCrypto.com to Hire In-House Market Maker for Prediction Markets — Unchained\nAlt season ‘26: What it will take — Milk Road\nFive crypto airdrops to watch for in 2026 — DL News\nLance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

I think that&rsquo;s very firmly what&rsquo;s happened over the last six months or so,&rdquo; he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs in November pointed to a boom in foreign funds buying UK stocks while Bank of America data has also suggested an uptick in stockpickers buying British. According to its figures, global investors were net 24pc underweight UK stocks in December, an improvement on November&rsquo;s figure of 29pc.\nBank of America&rsquo;s survey has only ever recorded investors being overweight the UK on two occasions since August 2021 &ndash; but it does suggest the tide could be turning.\nWhile concerns about the US have been an important factor in overseas flows into the UK, the FTSE 100&rsquo;s strong performance last year has also been a major selling point.\nBritain&rsquo;s stock market enjoyed its biggest annual gain since 2009 in 2025, beating performance on Wall Street.\n\nThe rising interest from overseas investors comes in marked contrast to UK investors, who have dramatically sold off their holdings in stocks.\nIn the six months to December, UK investors pulled more than &pound;10bn out of global stock markets in the longest and most severe period of selling on record, according to data provider Calastone.\nOver that period, UK-focused equity funds were among the hardest hit, seeing net selling of &pound;847m.\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

But it does provide investors something they don't often get: a clear \"base case\" to examine.\n\nRather than viewing the consensus as a warning sign, see it as a blueprint — a list of things the market wants you to embrace if you want to ride the upswing.\nCFRA’s strategists, cited by TKer by Sam Ro , offer advice for 2026.\nNvidia is the only company that meets almost all of the assumptions in that bullish outlook, such as earnings growth, AI spending, high valuations, and the market's top-heavy leadership.\nThe same question keeps coming back, no matter whether 2026 is another good year, a year with many ups and downs, or a year that breaks the run.\nDoes the AI engine keep going, or does it sputter just enough to send the market into a tailspin?\nAnalysts' consensus isn’t the trade; it’s the checklist A consensus bullish call usually boils down to a few things on which everyone agrees.\nEarnings will grow fast enough to justify prices.\nInterest rates won't make things worse financially like they may when inflation rises.\nAI expenditure is not only intriguing; it is also strong.\nThe market's leaders, who are still mostly big IT companies, won't break.\n\nThat's why the consensus is so helpful. It shows investors what they need to stick to.\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nEven if one pillar fails, the market can still rise, but the journey may become challenging due to drawdowns that test discipline. If those foundations stay strong, the index might have a mid-to-high single-digit year.\nThe most important thing is to stop thinking in terms of \"all in\" or \"all out\" and start thinking like a risk manager: What am I betting on, and what would show me wrong?\nWhy Nvidia is the perfect “anchor stock” for 2026 Nvidia isn't simply good at AI. It's a story about the market in one ticker.\nAI capex proxy: Nvidia is usually the company that gets the most money when big corporations buy AI infrastructure.\nStress test for valuation: Prices go up quickly when expectations are high. That makes the stock (and frequently the whole sector) more sensitive to surprises.\nCheck the breadth: If a small group of leaders conducts most of the work, Nvidia's strength can hide weakness in other areas. The disguise falls off quickly if Nvidia fails.\n\nStory Continues\nThat doesn't imply investors should worry about Nvidia's daily changes. It means that Nvidia is a good way to keep an eye on whether the core engine of consensus optimism is still working.\nSo here's the plan: four questions investors can ask all year long.\nBlueprint Step 1: Track the “AI spend vs. AI hype” gap When the story stays hot but spending slows down, that's when the late-cycle rallies are most perilous.\nInvestors can break down the AI question for 2026 into two groups:\nReal demand involves orders, visibility over many quarters, and more deployments.\nNarrative demand refers to significant headlines that suggest growth and customers who are adopting a \"wait-and-see\" approach, despite actual results that are not improving.\n\nIt's not only about Nvidia's revenue growth; it's also about what management says regarding demand, and whether it's pulling forward from the future or developing steadily.\nNot every AI business has to do well for the stock market to have a good year. But the AI theme needs to avoid the kind of shock that makes investors doubt whether the spending surge was just a short-term high.\nBlueprint Step 2: Assume valuations are a headwind, not a tailwind When everyone expects gains, the market often isn’t priced for “good.” It’s priced for “great.”\nThat impacts what investors can expect in 2026:\nMore gains will depend on how well results are handled, not how much the stock price goes up.\nBad news doesn't have to be terrible to hurt. Sometimes \"less good than hoped\" is enough.\n\nNvidia is right in the thick of this. Even if a company shows it's the best, the stock might still go down if the market thinks the future isn't as good as it thought it would be.\nBlueprint Step 3: Watch market breadth like it’s a smoke alarm A bull market is healthy when more than one trade is going on at the same time. When a few big companies make most of the returns, the index can look strong, even when many equities are doing poorly.\nThat's why the uniform bullishness for 2026 needs to be looked at more closely: It can still be an \"up year,\" even if the average investor's portfolio feels a lot worse, especially if they own the same stocks as everyone else.\n\nNvidia can also help with this.\nIt's not \"broad strength\" if Nvidia is going up, but everything else is flat.\nIf Nvidia stays consistent and other parts of the market get involved, that's usually better.\nBlueprint Step 4: Plan for volatility, even if you’re bullish One of the easiest ways to lose money in a year when things are going well is to not realize how terrifying the middle of the year might be.\nYou should expect some combination of these to happen at some point, even if the market ends 2026 higher:\nA scare from the Fed\nA hiccup in earnings guidance\nA shock in world politics\nAn AI mood reset after a bull run\n\nA recession isn't necessary for any of those. All investors need to do is acknowledge that the \"perfect\" route they priced in isn't certain.\nThe bottom line on Wall Street's optimistic view of 2026 You shouldn't just follow Wall Street's rare, unified optimistic call for 2026, nor should you instantly fade it.\nUse an investment strategy that keeps you from getting too comfortable.\nIf your time frame allows it, stay invested.\nUse Nvidia as a real-time test of whether the AI part of the bull thesis is still valid.\nSet your positions so you can handle market swings without making emotional decisions.\nDon't put all your eggs in one basket; spread them out.\nIf the consensus is right, this blueprint keeps you in the game. If the consensus is wrong, it reduces the odds that you learn that lesson the expensive way.\nRelated: Warner faces a surprise new bid as investors do the real math\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 2, 2026, where it first appeared in the Economy section.

      "Content": "5 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 1:35 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: LMND\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet all have strong AI moats in different ways that give them an edge over the competition.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the backbone of AI creation and is trading at an excellent price.\nLemonade is expecting to reach adjusted EBITDA breakeven in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has driven the market to the tune of an 81% gain over the past three years. The eight most highly valued companies in the world are all AI companies, and it looks like many of them are just getting started.\nWill 2026 be another winning year for AI, or is the bubble about to burst?\nSince there's no way to know, you can feel comfortable buying great AI stocks to gain exposure to the massive potential, but make sure your portfolio is well-diversified with other stocks, too. If you're looking for a top AI stock, here are five great recommendations.\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is a foundry, which means the company produces the semiconductors that its clients design. It's not developing the AI of the future but plays a key role in making it happen. On top of that, TSMC produces chips for all kinds of companies and technology, and that diversification gives it multiple growth drivers.\n\nEven though TSMC is a well-established industry giant, it's still reporting high growth. In the 2025 third quarter, sales were up 41% year over year, driven by smartphones and autonomous vehicles. The company is also highly profitable, with a gross margin of 59.5% in the third quarter, up from 57.8% last year, and an operating margin of 50.6%, up from 47.5% last year.\nTrading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31, TSMC stock looks very attractive today, and AI tailwinds should push it even higher in 2026.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is mostly known for its Google internet search engine, which has around 90% of global market share. That's an incredible moat, and it's a self-reinforcing moat. More searches give it more data, which the company uses to provide improved products and a better search experience.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is monetizing its user base with a robust advertising business. It uses AI in multiple ways to both increase user engagement with its ecosystem -- making it more attractive to advertisers -- and refine algorithms to get ads in front of the right people. It also offers its Gemini large-language models (LLM) for personal and business use.\nHowever, Alphabet is a lot more than Google these days, with many segments, including YouTube and Android, that diversify its business and make it an excellent stock to own for the long term. It also trades at 31 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is a great entry point.\n\nStory Continues\n3. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the largest cloud services provider in the world, with almost a third of the global market. That gives it an edge in the space, and it's working hard to keep its dominant position.\nCEO Andy Jassy is always talking about the shift from on-premises spend to the cloud and sees a huge change happening over the next 10 to 20 years. That's a long growth runway for Amazon.\n\nThe company plans to spend more than $125 billion on AI development in 2026, more than any other rival hyperscaler. Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth accelerated in the third quarter to more than 20% year over year, and at its size, that's an impressive feat.\nAI is a huge growth driver for Amazon today but the company has a varied business that makes it a strong bet for long-term growth. Amazon stock trades at an attractive P/E ratio of 33, giving it extra room to expand in 2026.\n4. Nvidia Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) growth may be slowing, and as more companies enter the AI development race, it's facing stiffer competition. But there's no question that it has built up a formidable AI platform, with a large array of vertically integrated products its clients are invested in, giving it a leg up on newer options. The company is not letting up on innovation and keeps launching new products with even better technology to protect its moat and industry dominance.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is expensive, trading at 47 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is why the stock will fall if growth begins to decelerate. However, the company is a profit machine, and analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) to more than triple through 2028. Nvidia tends to beat on the bottom line, and if it can continue to demonstrate high growth and soaring profits, it should keep beating the market in 2026.\n5. Lemonade Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) is a different type of AI company. It's an insurance company first but has used AI and machine learning from the ground up to create a better system for pricing and handling insurance claims. It has attracted young customers from inception who appreciate its digital technology, and as it becomes more well-known, it's onboarding millions of new customers for all kinds of policies.\n\nThe company has reported strong sales growth from the beginning, and growth has been accelerating. In-force premium, its top-line metric, was up 30% year over year in the third quarter. As its algorithms improve and it scales, Lemonade is also heading toward profitability, and management is expecting to hit adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven this year. If it does, expect the stock to soar much higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "'Can That Be Sustainable?' Says DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis As Startups With No Revenues Raise Tens Of Billions\n\nCasey B. Renner\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 12:01 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMoney is pouring into artificial intelligence startups even when little more than a pitch deck exists.\nThe surge is raising questions about how companies without revenue are reaching multibillion-dollar valuations, including from Google DeepMind co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis .\n\"They're raising at tens of billions of dollars in valuations just out of the gate,\" Hassabis said on a recent episode of \"Google DeepMind: The Podcast,\" pointing to AI startups with limited traction as evidence that some corners of the market are likely in a bubble.\n\n\"It's sort of interesting to see, can that be sustainable? My guess is, probably not, at least not in general.\"\nDon't Miss:\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\nGM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nEarly-Stage Valuations Hassabis told podcast host Hannah Fry that some seed-stage startups \"basically haven't even got going yet,\" while they secure massive funding rounds. He drew a distinction between those funding rounds and capital flowing into large technology companies that are investing heavily in AI infrastructure.\n\nHe said there is \"a lot of real business\" underpinning valuations at established technology firms. Hassabis also repeated his view that AI is \" overhyped in the short term\" while \"still underappreciated in the medium to long term,\" describing that imbalance as part of how major technologies tend to develop.\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nShifts In Attention And Investment \"When we started DeepMind, no one believed in it,\" Hassabis said. \"Fast forward 10, 15 years, and now, obviously, it seems to be the only thing people talk about in business.\" He said the shift reflects how dramatically sentiment around artificial intelligence has changed.\nThat shift, he said, can push valuations higher in a short period. \"It's almost an overreaction to the underreaction,\" Hassabis said, adding that an \"overcorrection\" often follows when technologies move rapidly from skepticism to intense focus.\n\nBig Tech And AI Development While discussing whether AI is in a bubble, Hassabis said he is not focused on labeling the market. Instead, he said his attention remains on long-term AI development at Google DeepMind, rather than short-term valuation debates.\nSee Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\nHe told Fry that AI investment by large technology companies is supported by existing products and infrastructure, tying development to ongoing operations and research programs.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestor And Industry Signals Questions about AI valuations have also surfaced among investors. Oaktree Capital Management co-founder Howard Marks raised similar concerns in a recent memo , pointing to uncertainty around pricing and long-term returns in AI investments.\nIndustry leaders have also addressed how artificial intelligence may reshape work. \"Everybody's jobs will be different,\" Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) CEO Jensen Huang said during a panel discussion at the U.S.–Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C., in November. He said AI tools will become part of everyday workflows rather than fully replacing workers.\n\nRead Next: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

      "Content": "NVDA, NKE, and CM: Bet on These 3 Stocks With Surging Unusual Options Activity for 2026 Gains\n\nWill Ashworth\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 10:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNKE\n\n^GSPC\n\nI hope everyone had an enjoyable, restful holiday season. I sure did. Later today, I’ll sit down and watch Indiana face off against Alabama in the Rose Bowl. My niece went to IU, so I’ll most definitely be cheering for the Hoosiers' dream season to continue.\nAs we move into 2026, part of my focus will be on the options market in general and unusual options activity, more specifically.\n\nMore News from Barchart Unusual Activity in Occidental Petroleum Call Options - A Signal Investors Expect a Dividend Hike\nTesla Ratio Spread Targets A Profit Zone Between 410 and 430\nEthereum Has Crashed, but the Option Strategy I Showed You 3 Months Ago Is Hanging Tough. Now What?\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nThis past year was full of ups and downs for investors, but it’s hard to complain about the fourth consecutive year of gains for the S&P 500. Valuations continue to be a concern.\nThat said, it is New Year’s Day, a time for optimism for the year that lies ahead. I don’t know where the index will finish by the end of 2026 — Bloomberg’s survey of 21 analysts suggests a 9% gain — but, as always, there will be pockets of strength.\nWhen it comes to unusual options activity heading into 2026, these three stocks look like good bets for gains in 2026. I’ve rated them mild, medium, and hot based on their option volume and unusual option activity heading into January.\nMild - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM) Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM), commonly known as CIBC, is Canada’s fifth-largest bank. As of Oct. 31, 2025, it had CAD$1.12 trillion ($815.9 million) in total assets.\nJPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has expressed concern about a 2026 recession. His economists believe the chances of a recession are 33% heading into the new year.\n\nIf you’ll remember, the Big Five Canadian bank stocks outperformed their American counterparts during the 2008-2009 financial crisis — JPMorgan stock lost 65% of its value between Oct. 3, 2008, and Jan. 20, 2009, compared to 39% for CM -- and should another big crisis hit, the Canadian banks are positioned to handle the downturn.\nHowever, Canadian bank stock valuations have crept up. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, CIBC’s P/E ratio based on the latest 12 months is 14.77; the five-year average is 11.94x, so you’re not getting CM for a bargain.\nIn Dec. 26 trading, CM had options volume of 155,863, 1,788% higher than its 30-day average.\nAll eight of its unusually active options on Dec. 26 were in the top 100. All eight were expiring on Jan. 16; all were calls. Its Q1 2026 results don’t come out until Feb. 20, so it’s not earnings-related volume.\n\nStory Continues\nThe 16 analysts covering CIBC are lukewarm on the bank's stock, giving it an Outperform rating according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, but only 2.44 out of 5.\nOf Canada’s Big Five banks, CM stock has the second-best performance in 2025, up 39% through Dec. 26, lagging only Toronto-Dominion Bank’s (TD) 69% gain. I see the momentum continuing in 2026.\n\nMedium - Nike (NKE) The past four years have been a nightmare for long-time Nike (NKE) shareholders, who’ve seen their shares lose nearly 57% of their value, including 19% in 2025.\nAs someone who mostly wears Adidas (ADDYY), it’s not surprising to me that the Beaverton footwear behemoth has lost its mojo. Their shoes are generally bland and uninspiring.\n\nSince founder Phil Knight stepped aside as CEO in 2004, the company has had some poor chief executives — William Perez lasted 13 months, and John Donahoe lasted four years — forcing it to draw from its alumni, bringing back Elliott Hill in October 2024, who retired in 2020 after 32 years of faithful service.\nFifteen months into Hill’s tenure, the brand appears to be on the rebound, even if it doesn’t show in the share price. UBS’s Evidence Lab just released its 11th global sportswear survey, and Nike appears to be building momentum.\n“Two key elements of Nike’s strategy appear to be working under CEO Elliott Hill’s leadership. First, Nike’s prioritization of re-entering the wholesale channel has resulted in a higher percentage of global consumers reporting that Nike products are easy to find in stores and online, reversing a downward trend from 2019 through 2022,” Investing.com reported on Dec. 29.\n\n“... Second, Nike’s refocused emphasis on sports has resonated with consumers. The percentage of consumers who say Nike is ‘good for doing sports’ has rebounded to its 2019 peak level, likely attributable to Hill’s strategic direction.”\nAdd to this better-than-expected revenues and profits in Q2 2026 -- its earnings per share were 53 cents, 15 cents higher than Wall Street’s estimate, while revenues came in at $12.43 billion, $210 million higher than the consensus.\nUnfortunately, the 17% decline in China sent the stock lower. On the plus side, North American revenue was 9% higher in the quarter.\nAs for Nike’s options volume on Dec. 26, it was 60% higher than its 30-day average. Further, the put/call volume ratio was bullish at 0.70. It had 14 unusually active options on Dec. 26 with Vol/OI ratios above 1.24 and expiring in seven days or more.\nIt’s a work in progress.\nHot - Nvidia (NVDA) Not surprisingly, Nvidia (NVDA) had the highest option volume on Dec. 26 at 3.26 million, 45% above its 30-day average, slightly higher than Tesla’s (TSLA) volume on the day, and a put/call volume ratio of 0.46, which is very bullish.\nAs for its unusual options activity, it had 25 call and put options on Dec. 26 with Vol/OI ratios above 1.24 and expiring in seven days or more. None is particularly attractive.\nWhat can be said about Nvidia that hasn’t already? It’s a cash-generating machine like few others.\nIn May 2024, I debated whether Nvidia's or Tesla’s 939-day LEAP (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Security) option was the better buy. I sided with CEO Jensen Huang and Nvidia.\n“I think AI is as generationally important as the smartphone, perhaps even more so,” I wrote on May 24, 2024.\n\n“So, even though your initial outlay is four-fold higher for Nvidia, I do see it as the better call option to buy for long-term gains.”\nHow’s that worked out?\nThere are 354 days remaining until expiration, so the jury is still out. Shortly after my article was published, Nvidia completed a 10-for-1 stock split, which changed the numbers by a factor of 10. The $1,100 call strike is now $110, and the $329.55 ask price would be $32.96 today.\nAs I write this on Dec. 29, the share price is 41.14% ITM (in the money), with an ask price of $86.75, more than double its May 2024 level.

      "Content": "This Artificial Intelligence Stock Could Be the Biggest Bargain Buy of 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 6:04 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nNVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Micron Technology has remarkable earnings growth potential.\nIt is benefiting from the favorable dynamics of the memory market, particularly due to the AI infrastructure buildout.\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology ›\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks delivered another year of impressive returns to investors in 2025, as is evident from the 30% jump in the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF -- the largest AI-focused exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe sector did well despite starting 2025 on the back foot for reasons that included President Donald Trump's tariff-induced trade wars and concerns about the huge amounts of money being spent on AI infrastructure. Those concerns were amplified after Chinese tech startup DeepSeek claimed that it had been able to train its large language model for a fraction of what the likes of OpenAI have been spending.\nFollowing their remarkable surges over the past year, most of the top AI stocks -- names like Nvidia , Palantir , Broadcom , and Snowflake -- are trading at expensive sales multiples, lofty earnings multiples, or both. However, there is one AI stock that can be bought at an incredibly cheap valuation right now, despite having risen 250% in the past year -- Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) .\nHere's why this semiconductor company could be the biggest bargain buy of 2026.\nMicron Technology is too cheap to ignore right now For a company that reported a 57% year-over-year increase in revenue and a 167% increase in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings in its latest quarter, a trailing earnings multiple of 27 is a massive bargain. Even better, Micron anticipates that in the current quarter, its top line will jump by 132% year over year to $18.7 billion, and its adjusted earnings will jump more than fivefold.\n\nTherefore, Micron's valuation suggests that the market has not yet fully priced its growth potential into the stock. Consensus estimates are projecting its earnings will increase nearly fourfold in its next fiscal year to $32.14 per share. Not surprisingly, Micron has a forward earnings multiple of just 9, well below the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.\nIf the market decides to reward Micron with a higher multiple and it trades at a forward P/E in line with the Nasdaq-100's average after a year, its stock price could shoot up remarkably. More importantly, Micron is indeed capable of hitting Wall Street's earnings expectations.\nThe memory market boom will be a big catalyst for the stock Demand for memory chips is far outstripping supply. A significant chunk of the available high-bandwidth memory production is being deployed in AI accelerator chips such as graphics processing units. As a result, there is a shortage of the memory chips used in smartphones and personal computers. This shortage has driven a massive increase in memory prices.\n\nStory Continues\nThose prices are likely to go higher in 2026. Server memory prices could even double, driven by the booming demand for the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that goes into data center chips. At the same time, memory manufacturers such as Micron are expected to keep a check on the production capacity they bring online to support the higher prices.\n\nMarket research firm IDC anticipates that memory supply growth in 2026 will be around 16% to 17%, which is lower than the usual rate. For comparison, the HBM market alone is poised to grow at an annualized rate of 42% through 2033.\nSo Micron's stunning share price growth could continue beyond 2026, especially considering that spending on AI data centers could hit a whopping $1.2 trillion in 2030. All this suggests that Micron could turn out to be a long-term winner, which makes buying the growth stock at its current dirt-cheap valuation a no-brainer decision.\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now? Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer talked about recently.\nAI giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares are up by a modest 35% year-to-date and have lost 7% since November start. The stock has struggled as markets worried about an AI bubble and a slowdown in the data center buildout. Recently, however, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has made some big news. For instance, the firm entered into a licensing agreement with AI chip startup Groq. After the announcement, Bernstein dubbed the deal a “tech and talent grab” instead of an acquisition. Over the past couple of weeks, Cramer has focused on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s exposure to China sales and the firm’s upcoming Vera Rubin AI GPUs.

      "Content": "3 High-Conviction AI Stocks With 10x Potential by 2036\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 4:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: UPST\n\nAMD\n\nCRWV\n\nNVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points AMD is on track to become a growing competitive threat to Nvidia.\nCoreWeave's artificial intelligence (AI)-specific cloud ecosystem is benefiting from rapidly rising demand.\nUpstart could disrupt the loan evaluation market with its AI-driven tool.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have sent the market higher, as some stocks in this part of the tech industry have brought outsized gains to numerous investors. Palantir 's gain of more than 32-fold from its low in 2022 is one notable example.\nThe best part of the AI story is that it has probably just begun. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31% through 2033.\nThat probably means other stocks hold the potential for 10-fold gains by 2036. While a lot can happen in 10 years, these stocks are on track to make such gains as they help advance AI.\n1. AMD Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) may seem like a strange choice. For one, it lags market leader Nvidia in the AI chip industry, and it's up more than 13,000% from its 2015 lows.\nStill, AMD is on track to become the first company with the potential to match or possibly catch up to Nvidia in the AI accelerator market. The company has made the claim that its upcoming MI450 accelerator will accomplish that goal, and it will probably be onward and upward if it can meet that expectation.\n\nAdditionally, AMD's CPUs still make it a force in the PC market, and its gaming and embedded segments will also benefit from the technology it has developed.\nMoreover, AMD forecasts a 30% CAGR for revenue over the long term, with that rising to a 60% revenue CAGR for the data center segment that designs its AI accelerators.\nInvestors may have already begun to take notice, as AMD stock is up over 70% over the last year. Also, while its 105 P/E ratio could deter some investors, it's probable that others will buy shares at its current forward P/E ratio of 53. Such levels make it easier to take a chance on this increasingly influential AI giant.\n2. CoreWeave CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) has begun to emerge as a leading AI cloud platform.\nIndeed, tech giants like Amazon 's AWS and Microsoft 's Azure lead the overall cloud market. Still, CoreWeave has built a competitive advantage with a cloud specifically tailored for AI workloads, particularly when its ecosystem works with Nvidia's GPUs.\nAdditionally, CoreWeave takes on a task most companies don't want to do themselves, namely building and maintaining data centers. This means more organizations will probably turn to CoreWeave rather than taking on this task in-house.\n\nStory Continues\nThat demand is so strong that in the first nine months of 2025, revenue rose by 204% yearly to almost $3.6 billion. Still, costs and expenses surged 263% over the same period due to the cost of meeting that fast-growing demand.\nConsequently, interest expenses nearly quadrupled to $841 million during that time. Despite that increase, the net loss in the first three quarters of 2025 was $771 million, down from the loss of $857 million in the same year-ago period.\n\nAdmittedly, those losses and a sell-off in AI stocks in recent months may partially explain why CoreWeave stock sells at around a 60% discount from its 52-week-high. Still, with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just above 7, that bargain valuation and its rapid growth potentially set the stock up for massive gains.\n3. Upstart Holdings Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST) has drawn attention for its AI-driven loan evaluation tool. Fair Isaac 's FICO score has dominated this market since 1989. However, that model has not significantly changed over the years. This creates the potential opportunity for Upstart to disrupt the market and capitalize on the \"$1 trillion opportunity\" in its industry.\n\nUpstart's model utilizes more than 2,500 variables, applying AI to make its assessments. Moreover, its model now makes 91% of these assessments without human intervention. Also, in 2024, it's estimated that it could approve 101% more applicants than traditional tools due to its model's risk separation abilities.\nLike numerous tech stocks, Upstart tumbled earlier in the decade amid rising interest rates. Now, with interest rates falling again, revenue in the first nine months of 2025 was $685 million, a 57% rise from year-ago levels. With that, it has returned to profitability, earning $35 million during the same period.\nDespite those improvements, macroeconomic worries have weighed on Upstart this year, and the stock is still down 88% from its post-pandemic high.\n\nNonetheless, at a P/S ratio of about 5, investors can buy Upstart stock at a relatively low price. Considering the company's disruptive potential in the loan evaluation market, an eventual recovery is well within the realm of possibility.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

On December 29, Reuters reported that Nvidia purchased Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) shares worth $5 billion. The share price went up by around 2% after the announcement. According to the report, this move is based on Nvidia’s previous announcement in September, where the company announced that it would buy Intel’s share at $23.28 per share to support its finances to enhance production capacity.\nOn December 29, Nvidia bought 214.7 million shares of Intel at the price that was established in the September agreement. As per Reuters, the antitrust agency of the United States approved this investment.\nThat said, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has gained more than 61% over the past 6 months. However, Wall Street remains cautious with analysts’ 12-month price target reflecting around 7% upside from the current levels. Recently, on December 19, William Stein from Truist Financial reiterated a Hold rating on the stock, with a $39 price target. Earlier on December 16, Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities raised the firm’s price target from $34 to $40, while maintaining a Sell rating.\n\nAnalyst Arya of BofA noted that he improved the price target based on the growing opportunity for the company’s foundry. BofA expects Intel to secure external wins in advanced packaging and wafer design. However, the analyst cautioned that the uncertainties in the manufacturing sector continue to distort the outlook, hence the firm maintained a Sell rating.\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services worldwide. It operates through Intel Products, Intel Foundry, and All Other segments.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

It's an excellent opportunity for a fresh start, which means new ideas for your stock portfolio.\nAlthough the calendar is turning a page, artificial intelligence (AI) remains a hot theme for 2026, just as it has been for most of the past few years. Despite immense hype and soaring share prices, some AI stocks still represent compelling value today.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , also known as TSMC, was no slouch in 2025. The stock rose by more than 50%. Yet, it may still be the best AI stock to buy in January. Here's why shares could continue heading higher.\nGobbling up market share in the AI era Everything electronic, from data centers for AI to your smartphone, uses microchips. Many companies that sell them, such as Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices , design them and outsource the manufacturing to companies called foundries, which have the expertise and equipment to build them.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest foundry, and to say that it dominates its industry could somehow be an understatement. According to estimates from Counterpoint Research, TSMC's market share (by revenue) of the global foundry market was approximately 72% at the end of the third quarter. Samsung was the closest competitor at just 7%.\n\nPerhaps what's more impressive is that despite surging demand for AI chips, TSMC has actually increased its market share amid this AI investment cycle. Its share was 65% midway through 2024.\nManufacturing chips is a complicated task. Given the money at stake -- there are hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into AI -- chip companies are flocking to TSMC's scale, equipment, and proprietary processes.\nNo other company can build as many high-end chips as quickly as this one can. They are the sure thing, and that has value.\nNvidia's Rubin chip is arriving soon The top AI company, Nvidia, has partnered closely with TSMC for its graphics processing units (GPUs), including its Hopper architecture and its successor, Blackwell. Naturally, innovation continues, and its Rubin architecture is next in line, set to arrive on the market in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nTSMC is building Rubin using its advanced 3-nanometer process, to achieve higher performance with less power consumption. Nvidia recently touted a $500 billion order backlog -- meaning that a company with $187 billion in sales over the past four quarters is poised to continue its impressive growth trajectory.\nNvidia's AI success is affecting TSMC, whose own revenue growth has accelerated dramatically over the past few years. In fact, Nvidia has challenged Apple as TSMC's largest customer at this point.\nFantastic growth at a compelling price Barring an unexpected widespread collapse in AI spending, Nvidia's huge backlog is likely to help propel TSMC's business to new heights as those orders flow through its foundries. Fortunately for investors, there appears to be room for the stock to continue its ascent.\nIts price-to-earnings ratio is just under 30 times TSMC's full-2025 earnings estimates. While that may seem high, the company is likely to continue growing rapidly, as discussed above. Analysts estimate that it will increase earnings by an average of nearly 29% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nUsing the price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) to compare TSMC's growth rate to its valuation, its ratio of roughly 1 signals the stock is very attractive at its current price. I am often willing to pay up for a PEG ratio of about 2 to 2.5 for a high-quality stock, and TSMC certainly meets that standard as the world's leading chip foundry.\nSo even if TSMC's growth falls a bit short of analyst estimates, investors still have a good chance of achieving strong returns over the long term. The company's mission-critical role in the AI boom gives the stock a relatively high floor with enough upside to make it a leading investment idea heading into January.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "NVIDIA Corp: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic Value\n\nGuruFocus News\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2026-01-01, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $125.00. It's currently trading at a price of $186.5. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -49.2%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$4\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.16%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 47.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n262.67\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n491.67\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n125.00\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $98.31. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -89.71%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This Super Semiconductor Stock Crushed Nvidia in 2025. Is It a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2026?\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 2:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nANTH.PVT\n\nKey Points Demand continues to outstrip supply for the data center chips and networking equipment used in artificial intelligence (AI) development.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerators are increasing in popularity, with leading start-up Anthropic placing a whopping $21 billion worth of orders.\nBroadcom stock outperformed Nvidia stock in 2025, but its valuation could limit further blistering gains in the short term.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) development requires an astronomical amount of computing power, which can only be delivered through large, centralized data centers fitted with thousands of specialized chips. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang predicts annual spending on this infrastructure could hit $4 trillion by 2030, creating a massive financial opportunity for hardware suppliers.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are currently the best chips in the world for AI development, but Broadcom 's (NASDAQ: AVGO) alternative chips -- called AI accelerators -- are increasing in popularity among tech giants because they can be fully customized.\nBroadcom stock soared by 50% in 2025, comfortably beating Nvidia stock, which climbed by 36%. But is it too late for investors to board this train, or are the best gains yet to come?\nServing some of the biggest AI companies Nvidia's data center GPUs are a great plug-and-play solution for most AI companies, but as workloads become more complex, some developers see value in custom solutions that can be tailored to their specific needs. Alphabet , for instance, enlisted Broadcom's help to create its own AI accelerators called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which it used to develop its industry-leading Gemini family of AI models.\n\nAlphabet recently started selling its latest Ironwood TPUs to other developers, which is a big win for Broadcom as the designer and manufacturer. Anthropic, which is the AI start-up behind the Claude chatbot, placed a $10 billion order for Ironwood TPUs earlier this year, followed by another order worth $11 billion more recently, which is scheduled for delivery in late 2026. Broadcom says Anthropic is just one of four customers so far.\nBut the chipmaker's AI opportunity doesn't stop there, because demand is also soaring for its data center networking equipment. Its Tomahawk Ethernet switches, for example, regulate how fast data travels between chips and devices, and they deliver industry-leading low latency and high throughput. The result is faster processing speeds with less data loss, which is a winning combination for AI developers.\n\nStory continues\nBroadcom's AI revenue continues to soar Broadcom generated $18 billion in total revenue during its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (ended Nov. 2), beating management's forecast of $17.4 billion. It was a 28% increase compared to the year-ago period, and this was the second straight quarter in which that growth rate accelerated.\nBroadcom's AI semiconductor business fueled the strong fourth-quarter result, with its revenue soaring by 74% to $6.5 billion. That growth rate also accelerated from 63% in the previous quarter, which highlights the significant momentum in the company's AI business.\n\nBut it gets better, because Broadcom's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ends in early February) points to $8.2 billion in AI semiconductor revenue, representing further accelerated growth of 100%, led by surging demand for AI chips and networking equipment.\nTurning to the bottom line, Broadcom produced a massive generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit of $8.5 billion during the fourth quarter, a whopping 97% increase from the year-ago period. For fiscal 2025 overall, the company's GAAP profit almost quadrupled to $23.1 billion.\nThese results are a welcome payoff for patient investors who endured Broadcom's near-$100 billion merger and acquisition spree between 2019 and 2023, which led to substantial short-term losses, but ultimately turned the company into what it is today.\n\nIs Broadcom stock a buy, sell, or hold in 2026? Broadcom's operating performance is exceptional right now, but whether investors should buy this stock might depend entirely on their time horizon, because it isn't cheap.\nBased on the company's fiscal 2025 earnings of $4.77 per share, its stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 73.3, which is more than double the P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 technology index. It's also far more expensive than Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/E ratio of 46.6.\nBroadcom is also extremely expensive when we value the company based on its annual revenue. It's trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 26.5 as I write this, nearly triple its 10-year average of 9.1.\nBroadcom's premium valuation isn't a surprise in light of the company's soaring growth. However, even if we assume its revenue will continue growing at the current pace, it might still be a couple of years before its stock looks attractively valued (unless it declines significantly in the meantime).\n\nThat means investors who are thinking about buying Broadcom stock -- or those who already own it -- should plan to hold it for at least a few years to maximize their chances of earning a positive return. This probably isn't the right stock for short-term investors who want to see big gains in 12 months or less.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "The Best AI Semiconductor Stock to Buy for 2026, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts (Hint: Not Nvidia or Broadcom)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 12:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Nvidia is the market leader in AI accelerators, and its full-stack strategy means its systems often have the lowest total cost of operation.\nBroadcom is the industry standard in Ethernet switching and routing chips, and it is the market leader in custom AI accelerators.\nMicron is gaining market share in DRAM and NAND memory, and the company should benefit from the ongoing DRAM supply shortage.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are cornerstones of the artificial intelligence trade. But while Morgan Stanely analysts led by Joseph Moore have buy ratings on both chip stocks, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is their top pick within in the semiconductor industry for 2026.\nReaders should be aware that most Wall Street analysts have a different opinion.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 33% upside from its current share price of $187.\nAmong 52 analysts, Broadcom has a median target price of $460 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $350.\nAmong 44 analysts, Micron has a median target price of $305 per share. That implies 4% upside from its current share price of $293.\nHere's what investors should know.\n1. Nvidia Nvidia is well known for its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs), chips used to speed up compute-intensive data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI) training and inference. However, the company is truly formidable because of its full-stack strategy that spans adjacent hardware and software development tools.\n\nNvidia develops rack-scale systems that pair GPUs with CPUs and networking equipment, which lets the company optimize performance across the entire data center, while saving clients the trouble of integrating hardware from multiple suppliers.\nIn addition, Nvidia's CUDA software platform provides developers with an extensive suite of code libraries, frameworks, and pretrained models that simplify application development across numerous of use cases, from predictive analytics and content generation to conversational agents and autonomous machines.\nConsequently, while custom AI chips designed by rivals like Broadcom may be cheaper, Nvidia systems often have the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) when every expense is include. \"Our TCO is so good that even when the competitors' chips are free, it's not cheap enough,\" according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nNvidia dominates the AI accelerator space today with more than 80% market share, and the company is likely to maintain its dominance for the foreseeable future because it offers customers the lowest TCO. Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to grow at 37% annually in the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 46 times earnings look attractive.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Broadcom Broadcom is a key player in two parts of the AI supply chain: networking chips and custom accelerators. The company has 80% market share in high-speed Ethernet switching and routing chips, a market forecast to grow at 20% to 30% annually in the next few years, per JPMorgan Chase . Its latest Tomahawk 6 (switching) and Jericho 3 (routing) chips offer industry-leading performance.\n\nBroadcom is also the leading supplier of custom AI accelerators, also called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), with 70% to 80% market share. The company has five major ASIC customers: Alphabet 's Google, Meta Platforms , TikTok parent ByteDance, OpenAI, and Anthropic. However, Broadcom has other prospective customers in the pipeline, including Apple , Arm Holdings , and xAI. The AI accelerator market is projected to expand at 29% annually through 2033, according to Grand View Research.\nBeyond semiconductors, Broadcom subsidiary VMware is a leader in virtualization software. Consultancy Gartner recently recognized the company as a leader in distributed hybrid infrastructure, a setup that uses virtualization to combine public and private clouds into one manageable system. The data center virtualization market is forecast to grow at 21% annually through 2033, according to Grand View.\n\nWall Street estimates Broadcom's adjusted earnings will grow at 36% annually during the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 51 times earnings look attractive.\n3. Micron Technology Micron develops memory and storage solutions for personal computers, mobile devices, data center servers, and automotive systems. The company sells DRAM (dynamic random access memory) products, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) created by stacking DRAM chips, and NAND products.\nDRAM products offer fast, short-term memory for active applications, and NAND products provide slow, long-term memory for file storage. Both are important for artificial intelligence workloads; DRAM (especially HBM) products offer the bandwidth needed for training and inference, while NAND products provide the storage needed for datasets and AI models.\n\nImportantly, Micron is not the market leader in DRAM or NAND products, but the company is gaining market share in both categories and its primary competitors, Samsung and SK Hynix , are losing market share. Particularly important, Micron gained 10 percentage points of market share in HBM over the past year.\nWhy is Morgan Stanley so bullish? The analysts argue the ongoing AI buildout has led to the most severe DRAM and NAND shortage in the last three decades. That shortage is driving prices higher and Micron is well-positioned to benefit. Indeed, Wall Street expects Micron's earnings to grow at 48% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 28 times earnings look quite cheap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "After Soaring In 2025, Is It Time to Take Profits on This High-Flying AI Stock? Or Is It Time to Double Down?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 6:51 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Building on a huge upward move in 2024, the growth stock once again crushed the S&P 500 this year.\nNvidia's recent business performance has been nothing short of extraordinary.\nCompetition isn't a big threat to Nvidia yet. But that could change.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWith 2025 finally coming to a close, graphics processing units (GPUs) maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock put up yet another year of extraordinary growth as its AI (artificial intelligence) products flew off the shelves and the company's revenue and profits soared. In total, shares rose about 39% in 2025. And that's on top of a 171% gain in 2024.\n\nThe big question for Nvidia investors now is whether it's time to take some profits on the stock.\nThis article will take a look at Nvidia's business and the valuation of its stock to determine what investors should do with their shares of this high-flying AI stock.\nFinishing 2025 strong The boom in AI infrastructure spending has led to explosive growth at Nvidia, with recent results demonstrating an acceleration.\nIn fiscal Q3 (the period ended Oct. 26, 2025), the chipmaker saw its quarterly revenue hit $57.0 billion, up 62% year over year. That marks an acceleration from 56% growth in fiscal Q2, showing how powerful the tech company's growth story is.\n\nAnd profits have continued soaring this year. Nvidia reported $26.4 billion of net income in fiscal Q2, up 59% year over year. Then it grew net income 65% year over year in fiscal Q3 to $31.9 billion.\nZooming out to look at the trailing nine months ended Oct. 26, Nvidia grew revenue 62% year over year to $147.8 billion and grew net income 52% year over year to $77.1 billion.\n\"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings release.\nThis wild growth and staggering demand for its products help explain why investors have remained so upbeat about the growth stock throughout the year.\nWhat about Nvidia stock's valuation? But does Nvidia really deserve to trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 46?\nThis depends on how sustainable you view the demand boom the company is seeing for its products. While it's tempting to quickly call the AI infrastructure demand surge a bubble, it's better to look deeper.\nHuang addressed concerns about an AI bubble directly in the company's most recent earnings call, noting that it sees \"something very different.\" He thinks this demand surge is sustainable because there are three \"massive platform shifts\" occurring at once -- and Nvidia is at the center of each. The first is a transition from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs. The second platform shift is occurring because AI is both transforming existing applications and enabling entirely new ones. And the third platform shift driving demand for AI computing is the rise of agentic AI systems.\n\nStory Continues\nFor investors who believe these three platform shifts are still in the early innings, Nvidia shares probably look attractive. But for those who, like me, are more skeptical, it may be a good time to take some profits on Nvidia stock.\nWhile I do think all three of these platform shifts are real, I'm not sure about how strong the demand waves from each of these shifts will be, or if there will be a consolidation phase at some point in which spending on AI infrastructure pauses and companies digest the computing power they've already purchased. In addition, I worry that formidable competition to Nvidia's GPUs could arise from well-capitalized technology giants like Amazon and Alphabet . Indeed, Alphabet and Amazon are finding some reasonable in-house built alternatives .\n\nSo, should investors sell their Nvidia shares? Not necessarily. But should they trim their position? If it has grown to become an oversized position in an otherwise well-diversified portfolio, I think this could make sense. After all, if competition intensifies, and if today's demand boom turns out to be a bubble, both Nvidia's sales and profit margin could suffer -- and the stock could get crushed. But keeping a small position in the stock will still let investors benefit if it turns out that we are still in the early innings of this AI demand boom.\n\nShould investors double down? No matter how bullish you are on Nvidia, the time to do something like this is probably on a big pullback -- not after the extraordinary run the stock has had in recent years. Additionally, even if you believe in the company and the stock, there's no reason to increase your exposure and, in turn, your risk of loss if things don't work out as expected.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Wall Street ends 2025's final session lower but posts big annual gains\n\nReuters Videos\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:18 PM PST\n\nIn this video: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\nSTORY: U.S. stocks ended the year on a down note Wednesday. The Dow fell about six tenths of one percent while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropped about three-quarters of one percent each. However for 2025, the Dow added about 13%, the S&P 500 climbed 16.4% and the Nasdaq jumped 20.4%. The major indexes advanced by double-digits for the third consecutive year, a run last seen during 2019-2021. Wall Street made a stellar comeback from April's lows when Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs sparked a meltdown in global markets, sent investors away from U.S. stocks and threatened growth by clouding the interest rate outlook. A rally in AI-related shares drove stocks higher with bellwether chipmaker Nvidia up 39% year-to-date, becoming the first publicly-traded company to hit a $5 trillion market valuation. Dennis Follmer, chief investment officer with Montis Financial says he thinks these technology stocks are in a bubble but it may not deflate for a couple of more years. “So this whole year has been sort of what I call a low quality rally where speculation in a lot of places has won out over profitability and earnings. So I think there's definitely some undeniable signs of market euphoria. That doesn't mean it can't last for another couple of years. But I think what it does mean is that price matters. The price you pay for an investment matters. So you know, history would tell us if we're buying the S&P 500 at these current valuations, we really shouldn't be expecting to see a lot in terms of returns for the next 5 or 10 years.” Stocks on the move Wednesday included Nike which gained four percent after an SEC filing showed CEO Elliott Hill bought about $1 million dollars of stock on Monday. And Vanda Pharmaceuticals surged 25.5% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its drug for the prevention of motion-induced vomiting.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Stocks end the year up a solid 16% as AI hype powers gains\n\nJennifer Sor\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 1:28 PM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDATA-USD\n\nNEAR-USD\n\nMTL-USD\n\nOP-USD\n\n2025 was a volatile year for stocks, crypto, and other asset classes.\nThe S&P 500 ended the year up 16%, a far cry from the near-bear-market it fell into several months ago.\nDetailed below are the 10 wildest moments that defined 2025 for investors.\n2025 was a wild year for markets of all kinds.\nEverything from stocks to crypto to commodities experienced a rollercoaster ride that amounted to what felt like an especially volatile year.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the benchmark S&P 500 rose 16%, a solid return, although it still fell short of 2023 and 2024. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fared slightly better, posted a 20% gain.\nSome of the key events feel like ages ago. (Remember when China's DeepSeek AI model spurred a panic across US tech ?) Others are more recent. (It's been hard to miss the record-setting rallies in metals .)\nAll in all, it ended up another solidly green year for stocks and commodities, while bitcoin ultimately fell. Here's the final scorecard for some of the most high-profile parts of the market:\nS&P 500 : +16%\nNasdaq 100 : +20%\nDow Jones Industrial Average : +13%\nNvidia : +39%\nGold : +64%\nBitcoin : -7%\nWith that in mind, detailed below — in rough chronological order — are the wildest moments that defined the year for investors:\nThe Trump family launches its own crypto tokens\nPresident Donald Trump and his wife unveiled their own crypto tokens the day leading up to the presidential inauguration.\nThe move, which was unprecedented for a US president and raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest within the new administration, also kicked off a flurry of interest in meme coins .\n\nPerformance-wise, the Trump-branded tokens have floundered throughout the year. $Trump , which soared to around $45 the night leading up to the inauguration, has plummeted 90% from its peak. $Melania, which climbed to $8.48 in late January, has endured a 98% plunge.\nDeepSeek sparks a $1 trillion sell-off\nAI stocks were shaken by the launch of DeepSeek in January, the Chinese AI chatbot that appeared to rival ChatGPT's abilities despite using cheaper and inferior Nvidia chips. In a single day, fears around DeepSeek wiped away around $1 trillion in value , largely in the US tech sector.\nThe LLM was one of the first catalysts to spark concern about the billions mega-cap tech firms in the US are spending on AI , and whether the investment would be worth it from an ROI perspective. It also sparked fear that the US could be losing its dominance in the artificial intelligence space.\nCrypto's post-election crash\nCrypto suffered a brutal sell-off in the months following Trump's inauguration, undoing much of the rally that sent tokens rocketing higher after the self-branded \" crypto president \" first won the election in November.\n\nStory Continues\nBitcoin , the OG cryptocurrency, rallied to a peak of around $106,000 in late January before tumbling 28% to $75,000 in early April.\n\nEthereum , the second-largest crypto token, plunged around 60% from its peak in December through mid-April.\nCrypto markets got a big boost when Trump first secured his second term in office, with investors being excited by the prospect of a more crypto-friendly administration. That optimism has fluctuated at various points throughout the year, tied to factors like concerns about Fed rate cuts and broader risk sentiment in the market.\nTrump announces his Liberation Day tariffs\nWho could forget the stock market crash that ensued when Trump unveiled his Liberation Day tariffs ?\nThe president, who had teased April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" for the US in posts on Truth Social, followed through with his threats to impose sweeping tariffs on the US's top trading partners, which included a 10% universal tariff and reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 nations.\n\nInvestors immediately panicked over the economic implications of tariffs and whether they could stoke higher prices, burdening an already slowing US economy.\nThe S&P 500 plunged 12% from its closing price on April 2 through the following Tuesday. At its low, the index was down 19% from its peak in mid-February, on the cusp of bear-market territory.\nTrump suggests he could fire Powell\nPresident Trump intensified his attacks on the Fed Chair at various points throughout the year.\nTrump, who appointed Jerome Powell to the role during his first term, has long pressured Powell to lower rates at his whim. But his feud with the central bank chief appeared to reach a new level this year as he called on rates to be lowered ASAP and referred to Powell as \"stupid,\" \"Too Late,\" and other names on Truth Social.\n\nIn April, Trump said that Powell leaving the Fed couldn't come soon enough, leading US stocks to drop sharply.\nStocks sold off again in July when Bloomberg reported that Trump could fire Powell soon. The 10-year US Treasury yield, a reflection of long-term rates in the economy, also rose in these instances.\nThe comments from Trump's administration are considered by many to be unprecedented, given that most past presidents have let the Fed operate independently. They've also sparked fear that inflation could rise if the president were to intervene in monetary policy, which could raise rates in the long run.\nIn April, Trump clarified that he had no intention of firing Powell from his post. But the president still appeared to flirt with the idea as a hypothetical when speaking to reporters at the Mar-a-Lago this week.\nTesla's historic plunge (and recovery)\nTesla staged a massive turnaround this year after plummeting over the first four months of 2025.\nShares of the EV maker were down more than 50% from their peak in December 2024, driven largely by declining Tesla sales, concerns about tariffs, and CEO Elon Musk 's presence on Capitol Hill.\nThe stock is now up more than 100% from its April low, driven by a handful of catalysts.\n\nMusk, who has long frustrated Tesla investors with his many side-projects and growing involvement in US politics, appeared to ignite the rebound in April when he said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency on Tesla's first quarter earnings call.\nThe stock moved higher in the coming months as the Tesla board approved a pay package with ambitious targets for Musk, and Musk signaled his commitment to the company by purchasing another $1 billion worth of Tesla stock.\n\nThe US and China strike trade agreements\nThe US struck a series of trade agreements with China, which helped stocks grind higher to new records this summer. Here's the timeline of what happened:\nMay: The US and China agree to lower tariffs for 90 days . Stocks immediately surged on the news, with all three indexes climbing more than 2%.\nJune : The US and China agree to a framework trade deal . US stocks ticked slightly higher, but were mostly unmoved.\nAugust : The US and China extend their trade truce for another 90 days. Stocks jumped, with the Dow rising more than 400 points.\nOctober: The US and China reach another trade deal framework . The indexes closed at record-highs, with the S&P 500 breaking through 6,800 for the first-ever time.\n\nThe long-running rift between the US and China on trade has been one of the biggest issues weighing on investors this year, particularly within the context of Trump's latest tariffs. When trade tensions were at their peak, the US was threatening to slap a 145% tariff on goods imported from the nation, and China was threatening to impose a 125% tariff on US goods.\nPresident Trump and Elon Musk have a public breakup\nTesla shares swung in June as Elon Musk and Donald Trump had a massive falling out online.\nThe two billionaires began to spar on their respective social media platforms after Musk published a post criticizing the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Tesla shares plunged 17% in the two days following June 3, when Musk first posted about the bill.\n\nIn the heat of the conflict, Trump threatened to slash government contracts with Musk's sprawling empire of companies. The White House also said Trump was considering giving away or selling the Tesla he purchased earlier in the year to support Musk.\nOn X the following week, Musk said that he believed his posts about Trump \"went too far.\" In an interview with The New York Post on the same day, Trump said he thought the gesture from Musk was \"very nice,\" which appeared to alleviate the selling pressure on Tesla.\nThe stock ended up climbing 6% to end the week.\nNvidia hits a $5 trillion valuation\nNvidia , the world's most valuable company by market cap, became the first-ever to hit a $4 trillion valuation in July. It was also the first to hit the $5 trillion milestone in October.\nShares of the chipmaker are up 35% year-to-date and up 1,338% over the last five years, speaking to the enormous hype surrounding AI hardware.\nGold, silver, and copper hit all-time highs\nGold, silver, and copper each rallied to all-time highs as investors sought out alternative investments that could hedge against risk and took interest in metals related to the AI trade.\nAll of the metals are also facing a supply-demand imbalance, another factor that's pushed up prices.\nHere's how each performed in 2025:\nGold : up 66% year-to-date\nSilver : up 153% year-to-date\nCopper : up 41% year-to-date\nGold and silver are on track for their best year since 1979 . Copper, meanwhile, is on track for its best performance since the Great Financial Crisis .\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "LIVE\n\nStock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq post double-digit gains in 2025 as AI trade powers market once again\n\nBrett LoGiurato · Front Page Editor\nUpdated Wed, December 31, 2025 at 1:01 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ^IXIC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\nGOOG\n\nBTC-USD\n\nStocks fell slightly during the final trading session of an eventful 2025 that saw the S&P 500 clinch a third-straight double-digit gain and the Nasdaq rise more than 20% for the third year in a row.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ), S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ), and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) all lost around 0.7% on Wednesday, dimming hopes of a Santa Claus rally.\nFor the year, the benchmark S&P 500 rose over 16%, marking its sixth year of 15%-plus gains over the past seven. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite paced gains with a 20% rise, while the blue-chip Dow gained roughly 13%.\n\nTech ( XLK ) and Consumer Discretionary ( XLY ) stocks fueled the gains this year over AI optimism. Tech giant Alphabet ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) outperformed the \"Magnificent 7\" group, rising 65% in 2025. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia ( NVDA ) followed in second place, rising 39%.\nBitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a record high — then fell more than 30%. Gold ( GC=F ) enjoyed its best year since 1979. The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\n\nThe year was not without challenges.\nThe Nasdaq briefly entered a bear market a little over eight months ago, and the S&P stood on the brink of one, after President Trump imposed his most sweeping tariffs in April before largely backtracking.\nWall Street didn't look back from there, despite blips amid concerns over those tariffs, as well as geopolitical developments, the health of the US economy, and — perhaps most of all — soaring AI-fueled valuations .\n\nThe outlook for 2026 calls for more optimism. Every Wall Street forecaster tracked by Bloomberg is predicting that stocks will rally for a fourth consecutive year . But plenty of risks remain: The AI boom could falter, the economy could surprise, and the US president remains a wild card.\nThe Federal Reserve's interest rate path is also in focus into next year, with the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 likely to continue — and with a new chair set to replace Jerome Powell by mid-year. Minutes from the central bank's December meeting , released Tuesday, showed this month's decision was a close call — and that many officials felt it could be \"some time\" before another rate cut.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Could Overtake Nvidia as the Largest in the World in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 12:55 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Nvidia's dominance in the computing world is coming into question.\nTech giant Alphabet might start selling a product to rival Nvidia's.\nIts custom TPUs could replace Nvidia's GPUs in some applications.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nNvidia is the world's largest company at about a $4.6 trillion market cap . It has risen to these lofty heights thanks to huge data centers focused on artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia is projected to have another incredible year in 2026, so knocking it off its perch on top of the world will be no small task.\n\nThere are only a few stocks that have a realistic chance to surpass Nvidia, namely Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , and Microsoft , which are valued at $4.1 trillion, $3.8 trillion, and $3.6 trillion, respectively. Outside of these, there's a significant drop in companies' valuations that would make the gap too big to close in 2026.\nSo, will any of these three topple the leader?\nThere's only one true candidate to overtake Nvidia Of the three, one stands out as a company that probably will not overtake Nvidia: Apple. Although it's the second-largest company in the world, it doesn't have the growth potential to drive it past the leader.\nApple has struggled to post anything above 10% growth for the last three years, and there isn't a catalyst that will suddenly ramp it up in 2026, either. As a result, I think there's almost no chance Apple can pass Nvidia, unless there is an unforeseen event like a halt in data center construction.\n\nThat leaves Alphabet and Microsoft, and of the two, I think Alphabet has the better chance.\nMicrosoft has a great AI strategy of being a facilitator, rather than a pioneer. However, it doesn't have its own generative AI model. Instead, it allows its clients to deploy whichever model they want. While this is smart from a neutrality standpoint, it could become an issue for Microsoft someday because it doesn't control its own destiny.\nThat leaves Alphabet as the lone remaining company that could topple Nvidia as the world's largest in 2026.\nPassing Nvidia will be no easy task Alphabet entered 2025 with several question marks surrounding its core business, its AI prowess, and what the company may look like in the future. And investors received resolutions on all of these issues throughout the year -- all of them positive.\nGoogle Search, thanks to its AI Overviews, maintained its dominance and has firmly established itself as the go-to search engine. Google Gemini has also emerged as one of the top generative AI platforms and is seen as a growing threat to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Lastly, Alphabet received a positive ruling in a court case seeking to break up the business due to monopoly concerns, and it is free to operate mostly as it did before the court case.\n\nStory Continues\nThis allows the market to value Alphabet for the impressive business it is, rather than needing to include caveats for future events.\nIn 2026, the company could gain ground on Nvidia by beating it at its own game. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are reportedly in talks to sell their custom tensor processing units (TPUs), which can replace Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) in some applications. If TPUs become widely available and turn into a popular and cheaper alternative to GPUs, Alphabet could have a brand-new growth division while eating into some of Nvidia's market share.\n\nAlphabet also owns about 7% of SpaceX, which could go public sometime in 2026 at a valuation of over $1 trillion. Still, there's no saying that it would sell its stake even if it did go public. The initial public offering could boost Alphabet's stock, but will it be enough to overtake Nvidia? I'd say no.\nUnless an unforeseen event slows data center capital expenditures significantly, Nvidia's projected growth and profitability will continue to make it the largest company in the world. But if its business is disrupted by alternative chip suppliers, such as Alphabet, its market cap may slip, and Alphabet could easily slide in and take its place.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

The U.S. government, Nvidia , and SoftBank injected billions of dollars through equity investments, bolstering Intel's balance sheet , while layoffs and other cost-cutting measures reduced expenses.\nSeveral factors must align for Intel in 2026 for the stock to continue its rally, and the company will need to overcome a major headwind.\nFoundry, CPUs, and memory prices First and foremost, Intel needs to secure a major customer for its foundry business. Rumors have emerged that Apple is considering a version of the Intel 18A process, which would be a huge win if a deal can be worked out. Intel will also need to show tangible progress in securing customers for its upcoming Intel 14A process, which is scheduled for 2027.\n\nThose process nodes will also play a critical role in Intel's product business. Panther Lake and Nova Lake, two PC CPU families that will use the Intel 18A process, are set to launch in 2026. Intel has been losing market share to AMD for years, partly due to Intel's manufacturing edge evaporating. Intel's new manufacturing processes should at least close the gap with TSMC , AMD's manufacturing partner.\nWorking against Intel is the current state of the memory chip market. Memory chip prices are soaring as demand outstrips supply amid the AI boom, and there's little hope for relief anytime soon. This situation will push up the price of PCs, which could hurt demand and make it difficult for Intel's PC CPU business to grow in 2026.\n\nFor long-term investors, it's important to remember that the memory chip headwind is temporary. Intel's foundry represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, particularly as custom-designed chips proliferate. While Intel stock could go either way in 2026, when you zoom out, the picture looks promising.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now? Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Will Nvidia Stock Boom in 2026?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 9:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Despite phenomenal growth in 2025, Nvidia's stock is still relatively affordable compared to its growth and earnings.\nInvestors should watch the spiraling cash burn situation with some of its major data center customers.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nIt's been roughly three years since OpenAI's ChatGPT introduced the world to generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the boom shows no signs of slowing anytime soon.\n\nThis trend is excellent news for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) because companies continue to spend billions on its cutting-edge computing hardware. Demand still outstrips supply, allowing the chipmaker to maintain incredibly high growth and profit margins.\nGoing into 2026, the factors that helped Nvidia soar in 2025 are still in play. And the company's core business is so strong that its $4.63 trillion market cap looks reasonable compared to earnings and growth. That said, the future of the generative AI opportunity is uncertain, which could have negative implications for the stock.\nLet's dig deeper to see what might come next.\nNvidia's stock is not a bubble Perhaps the most surprising thing about Nvidia stock is how reasonably priced it is. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25, shares are actually slightly cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 estimate of 26 and trade at a sharp discount to other big tech stocks like Amazon and Apple , which boast forward P/Es of 28 and 33, respectively. This fact is even more surprising when you consider Nvidia's explosive growth.\n\nThird-quarter revenue soared 62% year over year to a record of $57 billion, driven by strength in Nvidia's data center segment, where it records sales of its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for running and training large language models (LLMs). According to CEO Jensen Huang, sales of the new Blackwell GPUs are \"off the charts\" with demand accelerating exponentially. Nvidia's margins remain high, and net income soared 65% year over year to $31.9 billion.\nNvidia returns this cash to shareholders through a massive stock buyback program (with $62.2 billion authorized), which will reduce the number of shares outstanding to boost earnings per share (EPS). With numbers like these, Nvidia stock is far from a bubble. In fact, it looks like a fantastic deal going into 2026. But unfortunately, there is a catch.\n\nNvidia stock isn't a bubble, but the AI industry might be When an outstanding company like Nvidia trades for a very average valuation, it suggests the market is skeptical about the sustainability of its business. And going into 2026, an increasing number of analysts are getting worried about AI spending in the U.S. economy.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to Goldman Sachs , AI capital expenditure from hyperscalers (these are essentially cloud computing companies) could climb to an eye-popping $527 billion in 2026. The management of these companies likely believes they will eventually get a return on this spending -- or they simply don't want rivals to get a long-term edge. But it is unclear how much longer shareholders will tolerate these highly speculative outflows when the money could go to other things, like buybacks or dividends.\n\nMeanwhile, there is surprisingly little profit being generated on the consumer side of AI. For example, analysts at Deutsche Bank believe industry leader OpenAI could burn through an eye-popping $143 billion by 2029. The ChatGPT creator's planned initial public offering (IPO) in the second half of 2026 could actually be a significant risk factor for the industry because it could expose the public to the alarming economics behind the AI boom.\nAs a pick-and-shovel hardware provider, Nvidia will probably be one of the last to feel the impacts of AI uncertainty. It can still win when others lose. But if demand slows, the company's fantastic gross margin of typically more than 70% could begin to come back down to earth.\nWill Nvidia stock boom in 2026? The tech industry has already signaled that it plans to double down on AI-related spending in 2026, which means Nvidia's operational boom will likely continue -- especially as the company releases new products such as the Rubin class of GPUs designed specifically for AI video generation. That said, Nvidia's stock price growth will likely remain modest as investors grapple with the increasingly uncertain future of this new technology.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

The share price of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) fell around 3.54% on December 24, driven by Nvidia stopping the test run of Intel’s 18, which is a manufacturing process. The stock price has gained back 3.2% since the drop on Wednesday.\n\nIntel’s 18 is a process that makes chip-making more efficient and faster. According to a report by Bloomberg released on the same day, the investors are mainly concerned because this process, which Nvidia has halted, was expected to help Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The news has raised concerns regarding the company’s ability to push forward in this competition. Moreover, this halt comes despite Nvidia’s $5 billion investment in Intel.\nThat said, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has gained around 80% year-to-date, surpassing the S&P 500 and Nvidia’s performance. Recently, on December 22, Bank of America Securities upgraded the credit rating of the company to Overweight from Market Weight. The firm noted that the company’s lower exposure to the AI demand cycle can act as a protection from the broader AI investment overheating concerns.\n\nMoreover, the firm also raised its fiscal 2025 and 2026 EBITDA estimates by 20% and 18%. BofA sees the company’s leverage improving further in 2026, driven by improving balance sheets, strong AI-driven demand, and attractive valuation compared to its peers.\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services worldwide.

The fund is currently developing data center projects in France, Qatar, and Sweden.\nIn November, Brookfield launched a $100 billion AI infrastructure program, anchored by the Brookfield Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Fund. Half of the fund’s $10 billion commitments target has already been fulfilled by a group of institutional and industry partners, including Nvidia and the Kuwait Investment Authority.\nThe move would give Brookfield end-to-end control of the AI value chain. With its energy and real estate-heavy portfolio, adding a cloud business would allow the company to control inputs of the AI value chain in a way that pure-play cloud providers cannot.\nThis development could put additional pressure on traditional cloud giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle, which are already facing challenges to generate returns on their capital expenditures. These companies may need to further optimize their energy logistics and capital efficiency.\nRelated articles\nBrookfield reportedly launching cloud business for AI chip leasing\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\nGold: $4K Breakout Faces First Real Test as Stocks and Sentiment Rise Together\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Specifically, the levels of demand for high-performance GPUs, networking equipment, and data centers have dominated the bulk of the AI narrative to date.\n\nBut what about monetization? Assessing which companies -- other than Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- are truly generating measurable AI-driven growth can be challenging.\nIn my view, AI-focused investors should keep Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) on their radar in 2026. While its megacap peers are receiving the lion's share of the attention, the social media leader could be on the cusp of becoming AI's next big contributor.\nMeta's AI revenue is leaving the competition in the dust Meta owns and operates four massive social media platforms -- Facebook, Messenger, Instagram , and WhatsApp. Across its \"family of apps,\" the company serves 3.5 billion daily active users, on average. So it's not surprising that advertisers are eager to get in front of Meta's massive audience.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Meta generated $51.2 billion in revenue, $50 billion of which came from its advertising segment. This represented 26% growth year over year. While that's impressive, it was not enough to get Wall Street excited.\nWhere things get interesting is how Meta is maintaining its growth profile. Within its AI division, Meta introduced a product called Advantage+, a suite of machine learning tools that helps advertisers improve their targeted campaigns.\nOn the company's third-quarter earnings call, CFO Susan Li told investors that Advantage+ is now operating at a $60 billion annual revenue run rate. That was nearly a threefold increase from the first quarter.\nBeth Kindig, lead tech analyst at the I/O Fund, drew an interesting parallel between Meta's growth and that of OpenAI. ChatGPT was released to the public in November 2022, just over three years ago. According to numerous media outlets, OpenAI is expected to achieve a $20 billion revenue run rate in 2025. During this same period, Meta grew its AI ads business from essentially nothing to $60 billion -- 3 times more than OpenAI.\nTaking this one step further, Kindig wrote that \"it would require a step-up from 175% growth YoY to 460% year-over-year for Microsoft to match Meta's AI revenue.\"\n\nStory Continues\nAgainst this backdrop, Kindig posits that Meta has quietly become the second-largest AI monetizer next to Nvidia.\nCash flow could be modest in 2026 While Kindig's analysis is interesting, investors shouldn't get too hung up on the hierarchy of AI-related sales. The more important takeaway from her analysis is that Meta's top-line growth appears muted compared to the accelerating sales growth of its emerging AI products.\nAs I alluded to earlier, most of the chatter surrounding AI over the last few years has been about spending. Perhaps no other company is under more scrutiny in this regard than Meta.\nIts capital expenditures are far outpacing the rate at which its revenue is increasing. In the long run, this is unsustainable.\n\nIt's no wonder investors became spooked after Meta's management said that its capex would be \"notably larger\" in 2026. The combination of aggressive spending and a new revenue stream that has not yet matured will almost certainly hinder Meta's ability to generate excess cash flow in 2026.\nIs Meta stock a good buy right now? While I agree with Kindig in the sense that most investors are probably overlooking the magnitude and potential of Meta's new AI ads business, prudent investors aren't going to jump into the stock based on one metric.\nOver the last year, Meta's stock has traversed a number of peaks and valleys. The pronounced sell-offs were in large part influenced by investors' wariness about the company's spending.\nGiven its achievements so far and the trajectory of Advantage+, I'm personally cautiously optimistic about its prospects. However, it still has a lot to prove against Amazon , Alphabet , and others.\n\nFor these reasons, smart investors should be on the lookout for specific updates regarding Advantage+ and Meta's other AI ambitions. If these products continue to blossom and position the company to grow faster than its current spending trajectory in the long run, I would take advantage of any selling pressure and buy the dip in the new year.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

On December 18, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Iren with a Neutral rating and $39 price target. The firm sees Iren as a primary beneficiary of the AI infrastructure boom, forecasting a 7x revenue increase by 2028. While the company’s massive deal to provide GPU capacity to Microsoft provides a clear near-term catalyst, Goldman Sachs warned that the stock is already trading at a premium. The firm remains on the sidelines due to a full valuation.\n\nThe centerpiece of Iren’s growth strategy is a landmark $9.7 billion AI cloud contract with Microsoft. Under the five-year agreement, Iren will provide Microsoft with access to 200MW of critical IT load powered by NVIDIA’s latest GB300 GPUs. This single contract is expected to contribute $1.94 billion in annual recurring revenue at an estimated 85% project EBITDA margin. To support this, Iren is accelerating construction of its Horizon 1–4 liquid-cooled data centers at the Childress, Texas site, which are engineered to Tier 3 standards and capable of supporting extreme rack densities of 130kW to 200kW.\nIn FQ1 2026, Iren reported revenue of $240.3 million, which was a massive 355% year-over-year increase compared to the $52.8 million reported in FQ1 2025. This momentum translated into a record net income of $384.6 million, largely supported by unrealized gains on financial instruments.\nIren Limited (NASDAQ:IREN) operates in the vertically integrated data center business in Australia and Canada. The company owns and operates computing hardware, as well as electrical infrastructure and data centers.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of IREN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Is TSMC (TSM) One of the Best Stocks for the Next Decade?\n\nMaham Fatima\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 8:13 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nNVDA\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE: TSM ) is one of the best stocks for the next decade . Wall Street analysts continue to be bullish on TSMC.\nEarlier on December 7, Bernstein raised the firm’s price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) to $330 from $290 with an Outperform rating. The firm highlighted that TSMC is ramping up its Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate capacity to 125,000 wafers per month by the end of 2026. While an increase, Bernstein noted that this capacity will barely suffice to meet the demand for Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell and Rubin chip architectures through 2025 and 2026, leaving little room for additional projects.\nLater on December 10, the analysts at Bernstein SocGen Group reaffirmed their Outperform rating and $330 price target for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) and noted that the firm is currently outpacing both its own fourth-quarter guidance and market consensus. This optimism follows a strong November revenue report, where TSMC recorded NT$344 billion, which marked a significant 24.5% increase year-over-year.\n\nThe company’s strategic importance in the AI ecosystem continues to attract bullish sentiment across Wall Street. Beyond Bernstein’s target, BofA raised its own price objective to $360, citing TSMC’s clear trajectory in the AI sector. With production ramping up for next-gen AI accelerators and the latest mobile processors, TSMC remains the primary gateway for the hardware required to power global high-performance computing.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM), together with its subsidiaries, manufactures, packages, tests, and sells ICs and other semiconductor devices in Taiwan, China, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, the US, and internationally.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Is Nvidia (NVDA) One of the Best Stocks for the Next Decade?\n\nMaham Fatima\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 8:12 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is one of the best stocks for the next decade . Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) sports a consensus Buy rating on Wall Street and its average price target suggests a 31.21% upside.\nOn December 19, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reaffirmed an Outperform rating for Nvidia with a price target of $275. Despite a recent loss in share price momentum, the firm argues that massive capital expenditure from cloud providers and a recovering GPU narrative make this a compelling entry point for the year ahead. A significant upcoming catalyst is the Rubin architecture, scheduled to succeed the current Blackwell chips in late 2026.\nFurther upside may come from a major policy shift regarding the Chinese market. Reuters reported that Nvidia signaled its intent to begin exporting its H200 AI chips to Chinese customers before the mid-February Lunar New Year. This followed a major US policy shift earlier this month, where Trump authorized the sale of high-performance chips to approved customers in China, subject to a 25% government fee. The move is a dramatic departure from previous restrictions and marks the first time the H200 has been cleared for export to the region.\n\nTruist also reaffirmed its Buy rating for Nvidia and increased its price target to $275 from $255 on December 19. This adjustment was part of a broader sector update where the firm established its financial projections for 2027, signaling confidence in the long-term trajectory of the semiconductor and AI markets.\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company that provides graphics and compute & networking solutions in the US, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and internationally.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

I've been seeing a lot of you this year, uh, which makes me very happy.\n00:05 Brian\nEric, I'm going to start with you here. It has been a heck of a year for markets. No pressure, but can this continue into next year?\n00:15 Eric\nI think it can, Brian. I think um, the despite all the talk of a bubble this year, uh, when you look at the forward price earnings multiples now versus six months ago, versus 12 months ago, 18 months ago, they're they're pretty consistent and this is not a runaway train multiple like we saw during the dotcom era at all despite uh, the the bears uh insisting that it is. It's not straight up and to the right. Uh, there's a lot of kind of um,\n00:44 Eric\npausing and reflecting and kind of uh, people not sure that Nvidia can keep posting these, you know, billion dollar quarters and and so forth. So, I think that skepticism, uh makes me optimistic that we can continue to grind higher.\n00:58 Brian\nUh, Michael, of course, Nvidia could keep put printing those billion dollar quarters right next year. I mean, this is just uh, almost like the Fed printing money.\n01:05 Michael\nNvidia is an extremely strong company and a very, uh, very, uh, robust space right now. So, of course, its growth is going to continue to be strong.\n01:14 Brian\nWhat what are you concerned about next year? If I imagine we could be at probably, we could very easily have the same conversation, Michael, next year at the same time, same place, and there really wouldn't be any reason why the market couldn't be up another 15 to 20%. I mean, the rates are likely to stay low, you have AI spending, uh aggressively going on this country. All the factors that drove stocks this year higher are certainly in place for next year. If I would even, I would even argue perhaps they're a little more bullish on the Fed side.\n01:36 Michael\nUh, from my perspective, I'm actually in the bubble camp here. I uh, when you take the top 20 names in the S&P 500, uh, and you drop Tesla out of the mix, they're still trading 28 times forward earnings. So, that, those top 20 names in the S&P 500, their market capitalization is equal to half of the index. So it's a very top heavy tape and I think there's a lot of risk there. There's, there's many, many, uh, you know, attractively valued companies in the US stock market right now. But the the index itself is very top heavy and I think that is a risk.\n02:08 Brian\nAnd as I I was thinking a lot about uh, this AI bubble debate last night. I'm thinking about a lot of it uh this morning too as well. The reality is, we don't know when a bubble has burst until it has burst and stocks have plunged.\n02:20 Speaker A\nRight, and we've spoken to a lot of strategists that talk about the fact that we will be entering a bubble. I mean, I know that you've spoken to some of them as well. Uh, but as far as going into next year, I mean, you've got BFA that uh, has said we're not in a bubble yet. They do see that there is the possibility of an air pocket. Uh, but they're expecting that, you know, some of these companies that are within this uh, the AI space, they have strong balance sheet. I mean, this is what they're all pointing to. Goldman Sachs recently also saying not in a bubble yet. But yes, the expectation is that eventually you do go into a bubble, but you're not exactly, as you mentioned, not it's it's unclear as to when exactly uh that bubble pops or or when you are in the bubble. But look, uh as far as uh the strategists are concerned with respect to the S&P 500 going into next year, you've got 7700 as calls for the S&P. You've got even 8,000 as calls. And you have also a sort of run it hot policy that is expected to power the markets higher as well, uh, and lower interest rates as you just mentioned.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The fund is ‍developing data center projects in France, Qatar and Sweden.\nIn November, Brookfield launched a $100 billion AI infrastructure program, anchored by the Brookfield Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Fund, ​with half of the fund's $10 billion commitments target fulfilled by ‌a group of institutional and industry partners, including tech bellwether Nvidia and the Kuwait Investment Authority.\nBrookfield did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.\nThe move underscores growing unease in the markets about industrial constraints to the burgeoning AI-linked capital expenditures, which have ⁠drawn criticism for the pressure they ​would add to public utilities.\nCombined with ​Brookfield's energy and real estate-heavy portfolio, a cloud business would allow the company to control inputs of the ‍AI value chain ⁠in a way inaccessible to pure-play cloud providers.\nTraditional cloud giants such as Amazon, Microsoft , and Oracle, already facing heat to ⁠churn returns on their capex, could also be pressured further to optimize ‌energy logistics and capital efficiency.\n(Reporting by Ateev Bhandari in Bengaluru; ‌Editing by Varun H K)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Uh right now Walmart and Costco are trading at 40 times forward PE. We never hear about a retail bubble. We never hear about a big box bubble. And even though Domino's Pizza has come down recently and I think in the last six months, I think at this moment Domino's Pizza still trades at a higher forward PE ratio than Nvidia.

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nBeijing's support for the domestic semiconductor industry amid the global AI race is encouraging companies to speed up expansion and fundraising, a dynamic that is drawing comparisons with established leaders such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ). Recent strong performances in some Chinese AI-related names have reinforced investor appetite for potential national champions, while AI firm MiniMax Group Inc.'s IPO has already been several times subscribed since orders opened on Wednesday. Other companies preparing to list in Hong Kong in January include image sensor maker OmniVision Integrated Circuits Group and memory chip producer GigaDevice Semiconductor Inc.\n\nThe early trading picture has been mixed, highlighting both enthusiasm and volatility in the market. Crypto exchange Hashkey Holdings Ltd., whose retail tranche was oversubscribed by nearly 400 times, fell on its first day of trading, while software producer Nuobikan Artificial Intelligence Technology (Chengdu) Co. has risen more than 360% since listing on Dec. 23. Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian Hong Kong, said interest in AI listings could continue into early 2026, possibly supported by investors rotating away from U.S. AI names amid bubble concerns and expectations for favorable Chinese government policies.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe H200 is part of Nvidia's Hopper architecture and uses TSMC's 4-nanometer process. Details on exact volumes and pricing remain private, sources familiar with the matter said.\nNvidia plans to ship the first batch from existing stock before the Lunar New Year in mid-February. Prices are reported around $27,000 per chip, varying by customer and volume.\nThe expansion comes as Nvidia prepares its next-generation Blackwell and Rubin chips.

Discovery ( WBD ) is expected to reject Paramount Skydance's ( PSKY ) latest hostile takeover bid, Nike ( NKE ) shares gaining on CEO Elliott Hill purchase of $1 million in the company's stock, and Reuters reporting that Nvidia ( NVDA ) has asked Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSM ) to ramp up AI chip production to help with H200 orders.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nLet's hit some Yahoo Finance's trending tickers. We're watching Warner Brothers Discovery, Nike and Nvidia. First up, WBD.\n00:05 Speaker A\nThe media giant is reportedly set to reject Paramount's latest takeover bid next week after the board's upcoming meeting.\n00:11 Speaker A\nParamount recently took its bid hostile and made changes to sweeten its offer, including guaranteeing a backstop from Oracle billionaire CEO Larry Ellison, but it didn't raise the $30 per share price tag, which is higher than the Netflix deal.\n00:22 Speaker A\nNext, Nike. Shares are rising ahead of the opening bell, thanks to another insider stock buy, just days after a long time uh board director Tim Cook snapped up the beaten-down stock.\n00:32 Speaker A\nNike CEO Elliot Hill is also jumping in. According to a regulatory filing, he'll purchase roughly $1 million worth of Nike shares.\n00:41 Speaker A\nIt's Hill's first open market purchase of uh stock since taking over as CEO in October 2024.\n00:47 Speaker A\nFinally, Nvidia. The chip giant reportedly seeing strong demand for its H2 chips from Chinese tech companies and, according to Reuters, the company has approached Taiwan Semiconductor to ramp up production.\n00:56 Speaker A\nThe report says Nvidia has got on orders for 2 million chips, but only has an inventory of 700,000.\n1:02 Speaker A\nBut there's still a big risk for Nvidia. Despite the high demand, Beijing still has to approve any shipments of H200 chips, which hasn't happened yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here . The strategy underperformed the benchmark, the S&P 500® Total Return Index, this quarter, but still surpassed the index in dividend growth.

      "Content": "Intel Stock Climbs on Strategic Nvidia Deal, Caps a Pivotal 2025\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 4:18 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nASYS\n\nNVDA\n\nIntel Corporation &rsquo;s INTC shares rose 1.7% on Tuesday, Dec. 30, amid broader market weakness, as investors responded to the completion of a high-profile investment that has been a defining theme for the chipmaker this year. The stock&rsquo;s rise on this day was driven by the recent finalization of NVIDIA Corporation &rsquo;s NVDA $5 billion purchase of Intel shares. This deal catalyzed renewed confidence in Intel&rsquo;s turnaround narrative and underscored deepening industry collaboration.\n\nIntel, part of the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, has had a transformative yet turbulent year. After years of lagging behind competitors in key growth areas such as AI accelerators and advanced manufacturing, the company&rsquo;s stock performance reflected its challenging journey. Earlier in the year, Intel&rsquo;s shares traded near multi-year lows as weaknesses in its core businesses and prolonged manufacturing delays weighed on sentiment. At various points, the stock had significantly underperformed its semiconductor peers, with substantial declines due to operational headwinds and skepticism about its ability to regain a competitive footing.\nThe narrative began to shift as Intel secured multiple capital infusions and strategic partnerships that aimed to provide both financial stability and technological relevance. Among the most notable was the announcement in September that Nvidia would invest in Intel, acquiring roughly 4% of its equity.\n\nBeyond the Nvidia deal, Intel also benefited from government support under the U.S. CHIPS Act and other funding commitments that bolstered its domestic manufacturing expansion. These developments were accompanied by progress in next-generation process technologies, including milestones toward competitive nodes and expanded foundry opportunities. Such catalysts, paired with cost discipline under new leadership, helped reshape investor expectations for the company&rsquo;s long-term prospects.\nINTC has risen 86% in 2025 and currently hovers around the $37 mark. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Amtech Systems, Inc. ASYS, a peer from the same industry, and NVDA have risen 132% and 39.7%, respectively, in the year. The industry in general has gained 37.1%. Both NVDA and ASYS currently sport a #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nBottom Line As Intel heads into 2026, market attention remains focused on its ability to convert these strategic moves into tangible market share gains and sustainable growth, with the Nvidia alliance being one of the most closely watched elements of its evolving comeback story.\n\nStory Continues\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "AI Weekly: Meta wants Manus, AI investors want more in 2026\n\nReuters Videos\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:48 AM PST\n\nIn this video: META\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nSTORY: From Meta's plans for Manus... to the AI outlook for investors in 2026. This is AI Weekly. :: AI Weekly Meta has said it will buy Chinese-founded startup Manus as the tech giant accelerates efforts to integrate advanced AI across its platforms. Financial terms were not released, but a source told Reuters the deal values Manus at between $2 billion and $3 billion. Manus went viral early this year on X after it released what it claimed was the world's first general AI agent, capable of making decisions and executing tasks autonomously with less prompting than ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The company was cheered by Chinese state television, with commentators calling it China's next DeepSeek. Nvidia is reportedly scrambling to meet strong demand for its H200 artificial intelligence chips from Chinese technology companies. And according to sources, has approached contract manufacturer TSMC to ramp up production. They added that Chinese tech firms have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips for 2026, while Nvidia currently holds just 700,000 units in stock. SoftBank Group said it completed a $41 billion investment in OpenAI. The move is one of the largest-ever private funding rounds that would give the Japanese firm a stake of about 11% in the ChatGPT maker. Artificial intelligence software developer Eliza Labs has ended its lawsuit accusing billionaire Elon Musk’s X Corp of extracting valuable information from the company before launching copycat AI products. A federal judge in Texas dismissed the case, after Eliza Labs and X said that they agreed to dismissal with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be refiled. X had denied wrongdoing. And as global markets closed out the year, they remained buoyed by strong fundamentals and rising capital flows into growth markets, amplified by an AI-driven investment boom. And that is expected to continue into 2026 as investors keep channelling capital into AI-linked infrastructure, foundries and supply chains. As well as betting on growth from data centers, advanced chip making, and next-generation computing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Micron Technology and Palantir\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:41 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMU\n\nPLTR\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 31, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\n2 AI Stocks Outpacing NVIDIA in 2025 with Bigger Gains Ahead\nBanking on the rise in demand for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions in 2025, Wall Street&rsquo;s darling, NVIDIA Corp. &rsquo;s shares have gained 40% this year. Incessant demand for its Blackwell chips and CUDA software platform has fueled NVIDIA&rsquo;s growth.\nHowever, riding the AI boom, Micron Technology, Inc . and Palantir Technologies Inc. have significantly outperformed NVIDIA, whose shares have soared 251.2% and 143.1%, respectively, this year. These stocks remain well-positioned for further gains ahead, making them compelling investment options. Let&rsquo;s explore why they are gaining momentum &ndash;\nMicron Soars on HBM Demand and AI-Driven Growth\n\nThe rise in demand for Micron&rsquo;s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips has been a hidden tailwind in 2025, boosting its latest quarterly performance. HBM chips are in demand due to their ability to curb power consumption and process large volumes of data.\nFor fiscal first-quarter 2026, Micron posted revenues of $13.64 billion, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Micron&rsquo;s sales surpassed analysts&rsquo; estimates of around $12.88 billion.\nMicron&rsquo;s all business units reported an increase in sales, with its primary cloud memory business segment reporting a year-over-year sales increase of 99.5% to $5.28 billion. Additionally, Micron&rsquo;s non-GAAP net income reached $5.48 billion, or $4.78 per diluted share, more than analysts&rsquo; projection of $3.94.\n\nWhile Micron&rsquo;s CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, believes that &ldquo;the growth in AI data center capacity is driving a significant increase in demand for high-performance and high-capacity memory and storage,&rdquo; management expects fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. If Micron achieves this level of revenue growth, it would nearly match what the company achieved during the dot-com bubble.\nMicron also forecasted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter of 2026, and with $3.9 billion in cash flow generated in fiscal first-quarter 2026, the company has sufficient resources to fund additional growth initiatives.\n\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, the HBM market is expected to grow in the future, which bodes well for Micron. The HBM market is valued at $1,516.31 million in 2026, and is expected to see a CAGR of 25.5% to $7,721.41 million by 2035, according to Market Growth Reports. Therefore, Micron&rsquo;s projected earnings growth rate for next year is 26.2%. The company&rsquo;s $31.36 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 185.9% year over year.\n\nPalantir Gains as AIP Fuels U.S. Commercial and Government Growth\nPalantir&rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is in demand among both U.S. commercial and government clients. This is because AIP can seamlessly integrate AI with real-world complex data and workflow, which helps in faster decision-making.\nAs a result, Palantir has performed well this year, with revenues for the third quarter coming in at $1.18 billion, up 63% from the same period a year ago and 18% sequentially, as mentioned on investors.palantir.com.\nGovernment segment revenues were $486 million, marking a 52% year-over-year increase and a 14% rise sequentially. Most importantly, revenues from the U.S. commercial client segment soared 121% year over year and 29% quarter over quarter to $397 million.\n\nWhat&rsquo;s more, Palantir expects its fourth-quarter revenues to come in between $1.327 billion and $1.331 billion, and full-year sales to be even better at $4.396 billion to $4.400 billion, and expects to post positive GAAP net income throughout the year.\nAn expanding commercial client base in the United States will drive Palantir&rsquo;s future growth, and rising government contracts will create hurdles for new entrants. Thus, the company&rsquo;s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 42.5%. Palantir&rsquo;s $0.73 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 52.1% year over year.\nWhile Micron has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Palantir has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This shift is characterized by competition for GPUs, energy capacity, cooling systems, and long-term power contracts, as these requirements push AI infrastructure spending to new heights. With an investment prediction reaching up to $5.2 trillion by 2030, according to McKinsey & Co., public markets are increasingly focused on the physical infrastructure that underpins AI technologies. The emergence of \"neoclouds\" and infrastructure-adjacent platforms highlights the ongoing transformation as companies adapt to meet the demand for scalable AI environments. As investors show increased interest, valuation multiples in AI infrastructure reflect confidence in long-term growth potential within this evolving landscape.\n\nElsewhere in the market, Xi'an ESWIN Material Technology was a standout up 3.2% and ending trading at CN¥23.80.

Here's how.\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:30 AM PST\n\nIn this video: ^IXIC\n\nTSLA\n\n^DJI\n\nMSFT\n\nMAGS\n\nSteward Partners Global Advisory partner and managing director, Jason Bottenfield, joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss how investors should be thinking about their investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) trade in 2026.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nAnd how will you know when it's time to rotate out of some of these big cap tech plays?\n00:04 Speaker B\nYeah, well, it it's that's an interesting question because uh, you know, some people might say the Mag 7 or or the lag 7 that may happen. But I think the the the ultimate process here is that the market is broadening out. So, you know, a lot of people should be actually reallocating now. Maybe not today, you know, on a few of the last trading days in the uh in the sessions here, but, you know, from a tax consequence standpoint. But I think, you know, you have an opportunity in the forward, you know, months coming forward here in 2024, whether it's January that you make a decision to kind of come out of those and reallocate. But I think I think the the point is is that you should. Don't just let those run because that could be a problem as we go forward.\n00:54 Speaker A\nWhere do you reallocate to?\n00:58 Speaker B\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I I haven't been a big proponent over the years of international. I think, you know, one out of every 10 years that you know, they've outperformed and we get seven out of 10 on the uh broader markets of out performance. So I like to stay US. So, you know, my thought is is that they've had a good run. They may continue it a little bit into 2024, but, you know, the dollar may, you know, not strengthen, but not go down as much as it has, so that may take a little of the air out of those wings. So I'm thinking, you know, take a little out of international, look at the small caps, dollar cost average in, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping a little cash on the sidelines coming into the front part of the year and just uh hold my nose and buy some of the dips when they happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In April last year it stopped developing its long-running Wordtune product line, described as an AI-based writing and reading tool used for rewriting and generating text.\nAI21 has since shifted its focus towards specialised language models aimed at corporate clients, rather than mass-market products such as ChatGPT, Gemini or Cloud.\n\nThe company is targeting customers where the consequences of mistakes are higher and dependable, verified information is a priority.\nIts enterprise product is called Maestro and is intended to lift the accuracy of language models by 50%, according to the report.\nIn recent months, AI21 has also introduced a reasoning model it says is faster and more advanced than rival offerings, while using less memory.\nDespite these developments, estimates cited in the report put AI21’s revenue at around $50m, far below competitors that are already generating billions of dollars.\nSeparately, Nvidia is planning an expansion in Israel, including a new R&D campus in Kiryat Tivon, south of Haifa, intended to support up to 10,000 employees.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia has said the campus would include up to 160,000m² of office space, parks and shared areas across 22 acres, modelled on its Santa Clara, California, headquarters.\nConstruction is expected to begin in 2027, with initial occupancy planned for 2031.\n\"Nvidia in talks to buy Israel’s AI21 Labs for up to $3bn – report\" was originally created and published by Verdict , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Wall Street is almost unanimously bullish on the year ahead too.\nPowered by the artificial intelligence trade once again, the 2025 financial markets story might seem, on the surface, to be a rerun of what investors lived through in 2023 and 2024.\n\nShine a bit of light on the subject, however, and we see the inner workings of the market's path in 2025 spun an eventful story that won't soon be forgotten.\nDonald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president.\nThe largest company in the world lost nearly 20% of its value in a single day.\nThe S&P 500 registered its worst week since the COVID crash of 2020, crashing 10% in just two days.\nBitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a record high — then fell more than 30%.\nGold ( GC=F ) enjoyed its best year in two generations. The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\nInvestors poured more than $150 billion into startups trying to ride the AI boom, while the big four hyperscalers — Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) — committed to investing over $300 billion this year in the opportunity.\n\nElon Musk's foray into government came and went, while Tesla ( TSLA ) stock ends the year near a record high and his rocket company SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) eyes an IPO that would value the company at $1.5 trillion in 2026 .\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took on celebrity status in the business world and beyond.\nAnd Warren Buffett will head to Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRK-B , BRK-A ) offices on Wednesday for his final day as CEO.\nWhat follows is a monthly overview of some of the biggest stories that shaped financial markets in 2025. Some are headlines we may have forgotten; others are those we never could. Let us know what we missed too.\nJanuary Jan. 20 — Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as US president. His first hours in office see the president sign a series of executive orders , including the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which will bring Elon Musk to Washington, D.C., for the first few months of the year.\n\nAfter topping $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, bitcoin hits a record high above $109,000 in the hours before Trump's swearing in.\nJan. 21 — Joined by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI chief Sam Altman, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison in the Oval Office, Trump announces the $500 billion \"Stargate\" project to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nStory Continues\nJan. 23 — The S&P 500 closes at a record high , its first of the year, on Trump's third full day back in office.\nJan. 27 — Nvidia stock falls 17%, shedding nearly $600 billion in market value , as investors punish the chip giant after Chinese startup DeepSeek releases an AI model it says can rival those from OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) for a fraction of the cost. This sets of the first of many investor debates about the costs of the AI build-out, and brings the \" Jevons paradox \" to the attention of investors the world over.\n\nFebruary Feb. 1 — Trump's second trade war kicks off, with the president implementing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China using authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). These tariffs will be delayed, altered, and face still-unresolved legal challenges throughout the year.",

The company, with a private market capitalisation of US$500 billion, has built up a chip design unit that employed around 1,000 staff, one of the people briefed on the situation said.\n\nByteDance's internal chip unit has made progress in the tape-out of a processor that matches the performance of Nvidia's H20 chip , a China-tailored chip, but at a lower cost. It is not the only Chinese tech group attempting to develop its own chips for long-term control over supply and costs.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe company, which runs social media platforms TikTok and Douyin , was also investing in memory technologies such as high-bandwidth memory, pursuing a mix of in-house development and stakes in related start-ups, the person added.\nByteDance is also investing in memory technologies such as high-bandwidth memory. Photo: Handout alt=ByteDance is also investing in memory technologies such as high-bandwidth memory.

The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nByteDance's computing needs have climbed rapidly across its portfolio of globally popular apps, its growing cloud business Volcano Engine and its large language models. Volcano Engine is set to serve as the exclusive AI cloud partner for China Central Television 's Spring Festival Gala , the country's most-watched television broadcast.\nDoubao , ByteDance's chatbot, processed more than 50 trillion tokens daily this month, up from 4 trillion in December 2024. Volcano Engine had more than 100 corporate clients that had used more than 1 trillion tokens to date, its president Tan Dai recently said.\nThe chip arm also worked closely with Seed, ByteDance's frontier AI research team, one person said. The unit was transferred to a Singapore-incorporated subsidiary, Picoheart, in September in internal directory amid mounting China-US geopolitical tensions. Some employees in mainland China were being asked about relocating to Singapore, potentially to take on work considered more sensitive domestically, staff said.\n\nStory Continues\nByteDance was preparing to lift overall AI investment sharply to 160 billion yuan in 2026, according to a report by The Financial Times earlier this month.\nNvidia, meanwhile, is hoping to ship its newly approved H200 chips to Chinese customers before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, Reuters reported. Chinese technology groups had shown strong interest in the processor, Nvidia's second-most powerful AI chip, although Beijing had yet to approve any purchases and the timetable could shift depending on regulatory decisions, the report said.\n\nBeijing has sought to strike a balance between accelerating the development of AI and promoting the adoption of domestic chips, including products from Cambricon Technologies , Huawei Technologies' Ascend unit , Moore Threads Technology and MetaX Integrated Circuits .\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) , the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

      "Content": "Exclusive-Nvidia sounds out TSMC on new H200 chip order as China demand jumps, sources say\n\nReuters\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 11:44 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nDec 31 (Reuters) - Nvidia is scrambling to meet strong demand for its H200 artificial intelligence chips from Chinese technology companies and has approached contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to ramp up production, sources said.\nChinese technology companies have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips for 2026, while Nvidia currently holds ​just 700,000 units in stock, two of the people said.\n\nThe exact additional volume Nvidia intends to order from TSMC remains unclear, they said. A third source said Nvidia has asked ‌TSMC to begin production of the additional chips, and work is expected to start in the second quarter of 2026.\nThe moves raise concerns over whether there could be further tightening in global AI chip supplies as Nvidia now has ‌to strike the right balance between meeting robust Chinese demand and addressing constrained supplies elsewhere.\nThey could also intensify risks for Nvidia, as Beijing has yet to greenlight any shipments of H200 chips. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump only recently allowed exports of the H200 to China.\nThe talks between Nvidia and TSMC and details of the Chinese demand have not been reported before. The pricing has also not been reported earlier - Nvidia has decided which H200 variants it will offer to Chinese clients and price them around $27,000 per chip, the sources said.\n\nNvidia said in response to a request for comment that it ⁠continuously manages its supply chain.\n\"Licensed sales of the H200 to authorised ‌customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"China is a highly competitive market with rapidly growing local chip suppliers. Blocking all U.S. exports undercut our national and economic security and only benefited foreign competition.\"\nTSMC declined to comment and ‍China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters spoke to five people for this story, who declined to be named as the discussions are private.\nThe potential order would mark a significant expansion of H200 production at a time when Nvidia has been focused on ramping up its newer Blackwell and upcoming Rubin chip lines. The H200, part of Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper architecture, uses ​TSMC's 4-nanometer manufacturing process.\nNvidia plans to fulfil initial orders from existing stock with the first batch of H200 chips expected to arrive before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, Reuters ‌reported earlier this month.\n\nStory Continues\nCHINESE TECH GIANTS DRIVE DEMAND\nThe bulk of the orders of over 2 million chips for 2026 has come from major Chinese internet companies, which view the H200 as a significant upgrade over chips currently available to them, two of the people said.\nOf Nvidia's current 700,000-unit inventory, around 100,000 are GH200 Grace Hopper superchips, which combine Nvidia's Grace CPU with the Hopper GPU architecture, while the remainder are standalone H200 chips, one of them said.\n\nBoth variants will be offered to Chinese clients, the person said.\nWhile Nvidia has indicated a pricing ballpark to the Chinese customers, it would vary based on purchase volume and specific customer arrangements, said two of the people.\nAn eight-chip module is expected to cost around 1.5 million yuan, making it slightly more expensive than the ⁠now-unavailable H20 module, which previously sold for around 1.2 million yuan, they said.\nHowever, given that the H200 delivers ​roughly six times the performance of the H20 - a downgraded chip Nvidia designed specifically for the Chinese market that ​was later blocked by Beijing from being shipped into China - the sources said Chinese internet firms view the pricing as attractive.\nThe price also represents a roughly 15% discount compared to grey-market alternatives, which currently retail at over 1.75 million yuan, according to the sources.\n\nByteDance plans to spend about 100 billion yuan on ‍Nvidia's chips in 2026, up from roughly 85 billion ⁠yuan in 2025, if China allows H200 sales, the South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday, citing sources.\nREGULATORY UNCERTAINTY PERSISTS\nThe planned shipments follow Trump's decision earlier this month to allow H200 sales to China with a 25% fee, reversing the Biden administration's ban on advanced AI chip exports to China.\nHowever, Chinese officials are still deciding whether to allow ⁠H200 imports amid concerns that access to advanced foreign chips could slow development of the domestic AI semiconductor industry.\nBut they have not signaled immediate opposition. While Chinese chipmakers have managed to come up with products that rival the H20 ‌in performance, there are not yet any equivalents of the H200.\nOne proposal under consideration would require bundling each H200 purchase with a certain ratio of domestically produced ‌chips, Reuters previously reported.\n(Reporting by Liam Mo, Wen-Yee Lee and Brenda Goh; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

You're looking for market leaders, not speculative companies.\nLet's look at four stocks to consider.\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the undisputed market leader in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. The company has been growing rapidly, with its revenue soaring 62% last quarter to $57 billion, and up threefold from just two years ago.\nWhile the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the main product powering its growth, it's the ecosystem it's built around these chips that has created such a wide moat. Its CUDA software platform is where most foundational AI code was written, while its NVLink system lets its chips act as one powerful unit. That has helped it attain around a 90% market share in the GPU market.\n\nWith AI infrastructure growth continuing to heat up, Nvidia is a stock to own.\nAlphabet The dominant player in search, Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) moat comes from its huge distribution advantage, where it owns both the world's market-leading browser in Chrome and smartphone operating system with Android. Meanwhile, it has a search revenue-sharing deal with Apple to cover most of the rest of the world that its own ecosystem doesn't reach.\n\nThe company has a huge opportunity with AI, as it has embedded its Gemini large language model (LLM) through its solutions. Features such as AI Mode and AI Overviews are helping drive search queries and revenue growth. AI is also helping power its cloud computing revenue growth, as well.\nAlphabet's biggest edge, though, is that it has the best AI tech stack in the business, with its world-class Gemini model and battle-tested custom AI chips that it developed more than a decade ago. This gives the company a big cost advantage against competitors that should just continue to grow with time, making it a top stock to own.\nAmazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) owns both the biggest e-commerce and cloud computing businesses in the world. Its e-commerce moat comes from building out the largest logistics and fulfillment network on the planet. Meanwhile, the company has been widening its moat through the use of robotics and AI, which are helping it speed up delivery and save costs. It now operates over 1 million robots at its fulfillment centers, all orchestrated by its DeepFleet AI model.\n\nStory continues\nAt the same time, its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is starting to see its revenue growth accelerate. The company has boosted its capital expenditures (capex) to increase capacity, while it recently signed a large deal with OpenAI for compute services using Nvidia GPUs. It is also ramping up a big project with Anthropic that features its own custom AI chips.\nWith cloud revenue growth starting to accelerate and the company seeing strong operating leverage in its e-commerce operations, Amazon is a stock to own for the long haul.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) has established itself as a vital cog in the semiconductor supply chain and the go-to manufacturer of GPUs and other advanced chips. The company has established a wide moat by being the only semiconductor contract manufacturer that has proven it can make smaller node chips at scale with few defects. Meanwhile, its technological expertise in the area is unmatched.\n\nAs the need for AI and other advanced chips continues to increase, TSMC is in an enviable spot. With little competition for the foundry space for making advanced logic chips, the company is a close partner to chip designers, helping them both with their chip roadmaps and increasing capacity to meet their needs. Its position has also given it strong pricing power. Media outlets have reported that the company will once again raise prices for its services in 2026 and beyond, and that prices for its newest 2-nanometer processing technology could be 50% more than its current leading-edge 3-nanometer technology.\nWith a near monopoly on advanced chip manufacturing, TSMC is a strong stock to buy and hold for the long term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Is All Set to Hit a $5 Trillion Market Cap in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet is currently the third-largest company in the world and on track to benefit from the adoption of AI in multiple areas.\nAnalysts may be underestimating Alphabet's growth potential for 2026.\nThe company's stock is attractively valued right now but could trade at a premium after a year, thanks to a potential acceleration in its growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) officially became the first company in the world to hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2025. The chip giant's rise to this milestone has been deserved, as its business has been growing at a remarkable pace on the back of the fast-growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chips deployed in data centers.\nHowever, a few factors have weighed on Nvidia stock since it hit that mark a couple of months ago. The chip designer has lost 8% of its value after hitting a 52-week high on Oct. 29. Investors have been worried about the viability of debt-fueled AI infrastructure investments, as well as the returns that the huge spending on AI could deliver for the key names in this space.\nThe good news is that Nvidia could overcome these headwinds in 2026 and jump significantly . The stock's 12-month median price target of $250 suggests that it can rise 31% from current levels by next year, which will be enough for it to reclaim the $5 trillion market-cap level once again (it currently has a market cap of $4.64 trillion).\n\nInvestors, however, would do well to take a closer look at another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that looks all set to achieve a $5 trillion market cap in 2026 -- Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Below, I'll look at the reasons this technology giant is capable of hitting that target in the new year.\nAI is going to be a bigger catalyst for Alphabet in 2026 Alphabet is the third-largest company in the world, as of this writing, with a market cap of $3.8 trillion. The stock, therefore, needs to appreciate by another 32% to reach a $5 trillion market cap. It could easily jump by that much in the new year when you consider its full-stack approach to delivering AI tools and services to customers.\n\nWhile Nvidia is primarily in the business of selling AI chip systems powered by its graphics processing units (GPUs), Alphabet offers multiple customer-facing AI apps and tools. These include chatbots, AI-equipped search features, advertising solutions, and AI-focused cloud computing tools, powered by both in-house chips and external processors -- such as those from Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet's diversified presence across multiple AI niches means it's better positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of AI. For instance, the adoption of AI in the advertising space is anticipated to grow at 28% a year through 2033, generating almost $82 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period. Additionally, the overall digital-advertising market that Alphabet serves is likely to cross $1.1 trillion in size by the end of the decade.\n\nAlphabet's AI-focused ad tools should allow it to corner a sizable chunk of this massive addressable market. That's because AI-powered advertising is helping advertisers and brands enjoy higher returns on investment. According to media audience measurement firm Nielsen, AI-enabled video ad campaigns on YouTube are driving a 17% increase in advertisers' returns.\nOther AI-enabled advertising tools from Alphabet, such as Performance Max, Broad Match, and Demand Gen, are also driving double-digit growth in advertisers' returns, apart from driving higher conversion rates when compared to manual ad campaigns. As a result, there's a strong possibility of an acceleration in Alphabet's advertising growth in the future.\nAt the same time, the Google Cloud business is gaining solid traction. That's not surprising, as Alphabet points out that customers using its Google Cloud AI solutions are witnessing a terrific average return of 727% in just three years. Businesses using its cloud AI tools can expect a payback on their investment in around eight months and witness a significant increase in employee productivity.\n\nAll this explains why Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue jumped by 34% year over year in the third quarter to $15.2 billion. That was faster than the 28% year-over-year increase in the overall cloud market's revenue in Q3, indicating that the tech giant is now gaining market share. What's more, Google Cloud's backlog increased by a whopping $49 billion on a sequential basis in the previous quarter to $155 billion.\nAs such, there's a solid chance of Alphabet's growth rate accelerating in 2026, and that should be enough for it to enter the $5 trillion club.\nWhy a $5 trillion market-cap milestone looks like a possibility Analysts are expecting a 14% increase in Alphabet's top line in 2025 to $400 billion. That's almost in line with what it reported in 2024. It's worth noting that Alphabet's revenue estimates for 2025 and 2026 have jumped higher of late.\nConsensus estimates are projecting another 14% jump in the company's top line in 2026, as evident from the chart above. However, the improving backlog in the cloud business, the growing adoption of its AI offerings such as Gemini, and the boost that advertisers are getting from Alphabet's AI tools could help it grow at a faster pace.\n\nLet's assume Alphabet's revenue growth accelerates to 20% in 2026; its top line could jump to $480 billion. If it maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 10 after a year, its market cap could get close to $5 trillion.\nOf course, you may think that Alphabet is falling slightly short of that mark. However, the market could reward it with a higher sales multiple owing to its accelerating growth, which should be enough for it to achieve the $5 trillion milestone.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Intel Investors Just Got Great News for 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points A report states that Intel's 18A process node and production capacity could help it challenge Taiwan Semiconductor's lead in 2026.\nThe chipmaker has had healthy demand for its data center products, and it is ready to fulfill more orders in the new year thanks to its Arizona factory.\nIntel's earnings are expected to grow over the next couple of years, paving the way for potentially more upside.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\n\nInvestors in Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) will look back at 2025 with satisfaction, as the chip giant finally stepped on the gas after years of underperformance.\nThe stock has shot up 80% in 2025, with a significant chunk of its gains coming in the back half of the year thanks to a slew of favorable developments. Substantial investments by the U.S. government and SoftBank have given the company a cushion as it works on a turnaround. And Nvidia 's strategic partnership and $5 billion investment in Intel's shares have further strengthened its balance sheet.\nNow, there is another piece of good news that could help Intel stock get off to a strong start in 2026. Let's take a closer look.\nIntel could give TSMC a run for its money Intel has fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in recent years. It has been hamstrung by delays in the development of its advanced process nodes, allowing Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC for short) to pull ahead with its technology and establish a significantly strong customer base. As a result, Intel has been losing share in markets where it has been historically strong -- server and client central processing units (CPUs) -- and has missed the artificial intelligence (AI) gravy train.\n\nWith TSMC all set to move to a new process node in 2026, Intel needs to step up its game in the new year. The Taiwan company's 3-nanometer (nm) process node has been a huge hit among customers, thanks to its performance advantages and higher power efficiency when compared to what its competitors offer. The 3nm node has been used by Apple , Nvidia, AMD , and others to make chips for various applications.\nTSMC's 2nm process node, which is all set to go into mass production in 2026, is reportedly 15% more powerful and 35% more energy efficient when compared to the 3nm node. Intel, however, has an ace up its sleeve with its 18A process. Tom's Hardware, a website for tech news, reports that Intel's Fab 52 facility in Arizona is \"bigger and better equipped\" versus TSMC's Arizona operation.\n\nIntel reportedly has a production capacity of 10,000 wafer starts per month (WSPM) at that manufacturing site, and it could quadruple that number once it fully ramps up the factory's output. The company has equipped its latest Arizona fab with ASML 's most advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. On the other hand, TSMC's Arizona facility is likely to have a capacity of 20,000 WSPM once it is fully up and running with 3nm chips.\n\nStory Continues\nAlso, Intel's 18A process is reportedly superior to both TSMC's and Samsung 's equivalent process nodes in terms of performance, according to third-party estimates. Given that Intel has already started mass production of its most advanced chips in Arizona and is expected to significantly raise capacity at one part of that factory in 2026, the company should be able to meet the fast-growing demand for those chips.\n\nManagement said on its October earnings conference call that it was supply constrained and was unable to fully meet third-quarter demand. As the company increases the output of its most advanced process node, it should be able to fulfill more orders and experience stronger growth in its revenue and earnings.\nThe stock can deliver more gains in the new year The chipmaker's 12-month median price target of $40 translates to potential upside of 10% in the next year. It is easy to see why analysts are expecting limited gains from Intel in 2026 following its stellar performance this year.\nThe stock has become expensive following its recent run, trading at 606 times trailing earnings. The forward earnings multiple of 62, though significantly lower than the trailing multiple, is still on the expensive side. However, the rapid growth in Intel's earnings, driven by its cost optimization efforts, justifies the valuation.\nThe company is expected to post an adjusted profit of $0.34 per share in 2025 as compared to a loss of $0.13 per share in 2024. And it is projected to clock strong earnings growth over the next couple of years as well.\nWith new catalysts such as its partnership with Nvidia and the 18A node ramp-up, this semiconductor stock could continue to climb higher in 2026 and produce bigger gains than its 12-month median price target suggests.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now? Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

Nvidia and Apple are among firms pouring many billions of dollars into chips, servers and data centres.\nAI-related spending is soaring worldwide, and is expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion by 2025, according to US research firm Gartner, and over $2 trillion in 2026 -- nearly two percent of global GDP.\nTaiwan's dominance of the chip industry has long been seen as a \"silicon shield\" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China -- which claims the island is part of its sovereign territory -- and an incentive for the United States to defend it.\nBut the threat of a Chinese attack has fuelled concerns about potential disruptions to global supply chains and has increased pressure for more chip production beyond Taiwan's shores.\n\nChinese fighter jets and warships encircled Taiwan during live-fire drills this week aimed at simulating a blockade of the democratic island's key ports and assaults on maritime targets.\nTaipei, which slammed the two-day war games as \"highly provocative and reckless\", said the manoeuvre failed to impose a blockade on the island.\nTSMC has invested in chip fabrication facilities in the United States, Japan and Germany to meet soaring demand for semiconductors, which have become the lifeblood of the global economy.\nBut in an interview with AFP this month, Taiwanese Deputy Foreign Minister Francois Chih-chung Wu said the island planned to keep making the \"most advanced\" chips on home soil and remain \"indispensable\" to the global semiconductor industry.\njoy-amj/abs\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia makes good on a key 2025 promise\n\nVuk Zdinjak\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:25 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nINTC\n\nNvidia ’s stock gained about 40% this year, and the company set many new projects in motion that will keep the company at the top of the artificial intelligence boom. I have analyzed the company’s long-term plans in my “ What’s next for Nvidia stock in 2026 ” article, thinking that I was done writing about the company in 2025.\n\nHowever, I was wrong, and the 8-K filing by Intel from 29 December brings more good news for Nvidia investors.\nAccording to the filing, Nvidia completed its investment in Intel for $5.0 billion, at a price per share of $23.28. Considering that Intel closed the Monday trading session at $36.68, that investment is currently a big win.\nHere's why I think Nvidia’s collaboration and investment in Intel was a vital move for the company, and what investors can expect from it.\nWhy did Nvidia invest in Intel? Nvidia’s ( NVDA ) long-term plan was to dominate all of “compute”. When the company failed to acquire ARM due to regulatory hurdles, it had to go back to the drawing board and figure out a different approach to accomplish that goal. The company’s attempt to solve this roadblock was to team up with MediaTek for the design of its ARM cores, which became part of its superchips. This worked out well for superchips, but not so great for anything that would go into consumer-oriented devices.\n\nThe long-rumored laptop chip has been delayed until late 2026, as reported by Tom's guide . While Nvidia was dealing with delays, Qualcomm launched its Snapdragon X chips for PCs, and they haven’t managed to capture any significant market share due to the lackluster experience offered by Windows on ARM (ARM), despite the AI PCs branding and Copilot promotion.\nThis sent a clear signal to Nvidia that going after the laptop market with ARM is a losing proposition. Nvidia needed x86 to win. Getting a license for x86 from Intel ( INTC ) and AMD was never going to happen.\nYes, you read that right: Nvidia would need to secure licenses from both companies. AMD actually won the architecture race many years ago when it designed the 64-bit x86 architecture. Intel and AMD have cross-licensing architecture agreements, where Intel provides AMD with the original x86 architecture license, and AMD provides Intel with the AMD64 license.\n\nRelated: Veteran analyst has blunt message on Intel stock\nLeft with no options, Nvidia began working with Intel in secret as early as 2024, well before the investment deal was announced, as reported by Tom’s Hardware .\nWhen Nvidia decided to invest in Intel, it had good reasons to do so: Since it had been working with Intel for about a year, helping Intel stay afloat was necessary for its long-term plans.\nIntel is working on a very promising manufacturing process (node), 14A, which has the potential to be a superior process. This investment will enable Nvidia to become Intel's preferred customer in its fabs, and being the first to access the best node is a significant advantage.\nA complete acquisition would have been blocked , like the ARM one. And as an accidental bonus, as the US government has invested $8.9 billion in Intel , by also investing in it, Nvidia is putting itself in good graces of President Donald Trump by following his lead.\n\nRelated: History of Nvidia: Company timeline and facts\nWhat can we expect from Intel and Nvidia's collaboration? The primary focus of the collaboration is to enable Intel’s CPUs to work with NVLink . This will result in Intel’s custom-built CPUs for Nvidia to be used in data centers - superchips, but with Intel instead of Mediatek.\n“Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing, and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry,\" said Lip-Bu Tan , CEO of Intel .\n\nThe companies are also working on system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets .\n“There are 150 million laptops sold per year. We’re now creating a system-on-a-chip that fuses two processors into one giant SoC, and that will become a new class of integrated laptops that the world has never seen before,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang , as reported by Wired .\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nThe planned chips and integrations are expected to take approximately 3 to 4 years to materialize. Since the companies began working in 2024, the best-case scenario would be for the first chips to launch in late 2027.\n\nAccording to Notebookcheck.net , leaks indicate that the first chip, part of the collaboration that will launch, is Serpent Lake and will feature an RTX Rubin integrated GPU.\nThis collaboration will, over time, enable more flexibility for Nvidia. When the collaboration began, it was likely too late to redesign the Feynman chips to use Intel cores instead of MediaTek cores, but we can expect the next generation after Feynman to be based on Intel. In turn, this will enable smaller superchips, such as GB10 , to be launched, but with Intel CPU cores. This will, in turn, give us the opportunity to buy small devices that can run state-of-the-art AI models, but can also run any “normal” software without issue, including games.\nThere is one dark side of this deal that I see as a consumer, and that is that Intel may slowly abandon its own GPU development efforts. If that happens, consumers are left with a duopoly of Nvidia and AMD, which is never good; it slows the pace of progress and keeps prices high.\n\nWhat are the analyst ratings for Nvidia? Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a buy rating and the target price of $275 for Nvidia stock in his research note from December 29, which was shared with me. The target price is based on 28 times his earnings estimate (price-to-earnings ratio), excluding cash for calendar year 2027, which falls within Nvidia’s historical forward-year P/E ratio range of 25 to 56.\n\nVeteran analyst Stephen Guilfoyle recently raised the price target for Nvidia stock to $235, in his article on TheStreet Pro .\nCantor Fitzgerald ranks Nvidia a top pick, with a $300 target price .\nAs for Intel, Bank of America upped its price target to $40 from $34 on December 16, citing potential for advanced packaging or wafer design wins at Intel Foundry.\nRelated: What’s next for Nvidia stock in 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 30, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

While Nvidia is the leading designer of the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to handle most AI workloads, TSMC is the global leader in fabricating and packaging advanced logic and memory chips.\nBoth have benefited from the AI megatrend -- but which of these companies looks like a better long-term stock buy from here?\nNvidia Nvidia has visibility into nearly $500 billion in combined Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of 2025 through the end of calendar 2026, of which $150 billion has already been shipped. The company's networking business is also generating multibillion-dollar revenues, with its proprietary high-speed GPU interconnect NVLink, high-performance networking standard InfiniBand, and the AI-optimized Ethernet platform Spectrum-X becoming integral parts of AI deployments worldwide.\n\nProduction of Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin platform is also on schedule to ramp up in the second half of 2026; those platforms, which will combine its new Vera CPU with its Rubin GPU, will support cloud, enterprise, robotics, and physical AI workloads.\nHowever, Nvidia depends extensively on TSMC's ability to manufacture chips using the most advanced process nodes. Also, while President Donald Trump recently loosened some of the trade restrictions he had imposed that were preventing Nvidia from selling AI-optimized chips to Chinese companies, it is still prohibited from selling its most advanced chips to that market.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSMC now earns a bulk of its revenue from producing advanced chips (7-nanometer and below), which are used heavily to handle high-performance computing workloads. The company is advancing its 2-nanometer (N2) process node toward volume production and recently highlighted its plans to start producing chips using its performance-enhanced N2P variant in 2026.\n\nTSMC is also working on its even more feature-dense and power-efficient A16 process node, with volume production scheduled for the second half of 2026.\nAdditionally, TSMC plans to scale its monthly Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) advanced packaging capacity from current levels of 75,000 to 80,000 wafers to as high as 120,000 to 130,000 wafers by the end of 2026, directly addressing the major bottleneck constraining chip shipments.\n\nStory Continues\nYet the geopolitical risks faced by Taiwan cannot be ignored by TSMC investors.\nHence, I must conclude that Nvidia is better suited for long-term investors focused on upside potential, while TSMC may be a good pick for investors who would prefer a more resilient stock.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

The chip maker is reportedly in advanced talks to buy Israel-based AI startup AI 21 Labs. Now according to Calculus Financial Daily, Nvidia has its site set on buying the startup for as much as $3 billion. Nvidia has previously been linked to the company when it participated alongside Alphabet, that's the parent company of Google in a 2023 funding round for AI 21, that valued the company at $1.4 billion. Turning to Under Armor, that stock seeing a pop as Fairfax Financial lifts its stake in the company. According to an SEC filing, Fairfax now owns shares of Under Armor that raises its stake to 16.1% from the previous stake of 9%. This move comes as the company recently reported better than feared second quarter results. Fairfax is also not expected to launch a proxy fight as the firm is considered a long-term investor.

      "Content": "2 AI Stocks Outpacing NVIDIA in 2025 With Bigger Gains Ahead\n\nTirthankar Chakraborty\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 12:00 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nMU\n\nBanking on the rise in demand for artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions in 2025, Wall Street’s darling, NVIDIA Corporation ’s NVDA shares have gained 40% this year. Incessant demand for its Blackwell chips and CUDA software platform has fueled NVIDIA’s growth.\nHowever, riding the AI boom, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR have significantly outperformed NVIDIA, whose shares have soared 251.2% and 143.1%, respectively, this year. These stocks remain well-positioned for further gains ahead, making them compelling investment options. Let’s explore why they are gaining momentum –\n\nMicron Soars on HBM Demand and AI-Driven Growth The rise in demand for Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips has been a hidden tailwind in 2025, boosting its latest quarterly performance. HBM chips are in demand due to their ability to curb power consumption and process large volumes of data.\nFor fiscal first-quarter 2026, Micron posted revenues of $13.64 billion, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Micron’s sales surpassed analysts’ estimates of around $12.88 billion.\n\nMicron’s all business units reported an increase in sales, with its primary cloud memory business segment reporting a year-over-year sales increase of 99.5% to $5.28 billion. Additionally, Micron’s non-GAAP net income reached $5.48 billion, or $4.78 per diluted share, more than analysts’ projection of $3.94.\nWhile Micron’s CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, believes that “the growth in AI data center capacity is driving a significant increase in demand for high-performance and high-capacity memory and storage,” management expects fiscal second-quarter 2026 revenues to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. If Micron achieves this level of revenue growth, it would nearly match what the company achieved during the dot-com bubble.\nMicron also forecasted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter of 2026, and with $3.9 billion in cash flow generated in fiscal first-quarter 2026, the company has sufficient resources to fund additional growth initiatives.\n\nMeanwhile, the HBM market is expected to grow in the future, which bodes well for Micron. The HBM market is valued at $1,516.31 million in 2026, and is expected to see a CAGR of 25.5% to $7,721.41 million by 2035, according to Market Growth Reports. Therefore, Micron’s projected earnings growth rate for next year is 26.2%. The company’s $31.36 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 185.9% year over year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStory Continues\nPalantir Gains as AIP Fuels U.S. Commercial and Government Growth Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is in demand among both U.S. commercial and government clients. This is because AIP can seamlessly integrate AI with real-world complex data and workflow, which helps in faster decision-making.\nAs a result, Palantir has performed well this year, with revenues for the third quarter coming in at $1.18 billion, up 63% from the same period a year ago and 18% sequentially, as mentioned on investors.palantir.com.\n\nGovernment segment revenues were $486 million, marking a 52% year-over-year increase and a 14% rise sequentially. Most importantly, revenues from the U.S. commercial client segment soared 121% year over year and 29% quarter over quarter to $397 million.\nWhat’s more, Palantir expects its fourth-quarter revenues to come in between $1.327 billion and $1.331 billion, and full-year sales to be even better at $4.396 billion to $4.400 billion, and expects to post positive GAAP net income throughout the year.\nAn expanding commercial client base in the United States will drive Palantir’s future growth, and rising government contracts will create hurdles for new entrants. Thus, the company’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 42.5%. Palantir’s $0.73 Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is up 52.1% year over year.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile Micron has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Palantir has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

      "Content": "An AI super-bull who just backed the Nvidia-Groq deal warns of a data center bust: ‘We foresee a significant financial crisis’\n\nEva Roytburg\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 11:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nOne of the most aggressive backers of the AI boom—whose firm most recently facilitated Nvidia’s largest deal ever —has issued a warning to the rest of the market: The “build it and they will come” approach to data centers is a dangerous gamble.\nAlex Davis, chief executive of Austin-based investment firm Disruptive, wrote in a letter to investors he expects a “significant financing crisis” to hit the speculative data-center market as soon as 2027 or 2028, driven by extreme capital expenditure and a growing mismatch between who is constructing AI infrastructure and who will ultimately use it.\n\n“We are seeing way too many business models (and valuation levels) with no realistic margin expansion story, extreme capex spend, lack of enterprise customer traction, or overdependence on “roundtrip” investments – in some cases all with the same company,” Davis wrote.\nDavis’ warning was first reported by Axios .\nThe warning comes just days after Nvidia agreed to license assets from Groq, a high-performance AI chipmaking startup Disruptive has backed since its founding (not to be confused with Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot). The transaction, which Davis has said is valued at roughly $20 billion in cash, represents the largest deal Nvidia has ever completed and underscores how aggressively the company is moving to lock up all the verticals in AI talent and intellectual property.\n\nYet, Davis argues the same exuberance driving landmark transactions at the chip level is also fueling excess elsewhere in the AI stack, particularly among third-party data-center developers betting on what he called the “build it and they will come” model.\n“If you’re a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers,” Davis wrote in the letter. “We want to back the owner-users, not the speculative landlords.”\nThe risk, as the venture capitalist sees it, is not that demand for AI compute disappears, but rather that capital has rushed into the wrong hands. While hyperscalers and well-capitalized tech companies can absorb massive upfront costs, speculative landlords rely on short-term financing and customers that may never materialize at scale.\nDavis didn’t name names in his letter, but if you follow his distinction about “speculative landlords” versus “owner/users” like Microsoft and Meta that will eventually build their own facilities, the most obvious targets could be the legacy wholesale giants like Digital Realty and Equinix .\n\nStructured as something called “real estate investment trusts,” these companies generate returns by developing and leasing capacity to the same tech giants Davis predicts will soon cut out to capture margins themselves. If that shift accelerates, it could leave landlords facing refinancing pressure just as a wave of debt comes due, even if overall demand for AI compute continues to rise. That imbalance, he warned, could place significant stress on private credit markets and ripple outward if financing conditions tighten.\n\nStory Continues\nDigital Realty and Equinix did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nDavis’ argument echoes warnings made on the other side of the aisle, including the thesis of famed short-seller Jim Chanos , who explicitly bets against “neoclouds” and converted crypto-miners like Cipher Mining. Chanos has argued that data center hosting is becoming a “commodity business,” warning clients that “the magic and the money is going to come from what the chips produce ultimately, not where they reside.” Both investors seem to agree that while the AI technology itself is valuable, the third-party landlords rushing to house it are walking into a trap.\n\nYet the caution is startling coming from Davis, who said in the letter that he remains deeply bullish on AI itself. Disruptive has deployed billions of dollars across private technology companies it views as core to the AI economy, including Groq, open-source model developers, and defense-oriented software firms. Davis describes the current wave of AI innovation as a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity.\n“While I continue to believe the ongoing advancements in AI technology present ‘once in a lifetime’ investment opportunities, I also continue to see risks and reason for caution and investment discipline,” he wrote.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 3% in the afternoon session after the company confirmed that rival chipmaker Nvidia completed a previously announced $5 billion investment.\nThe deal, which was finalized through a regulatory filing, involved Nvidia purchasing approximately 214.8 million Intel shares at $23.28 each. This purchase gave Nvidia a stake of about 4.4% in the company. The investment provided crucial funding for Intel's turnaround efforts. The agreement also included a technology partnership, with both companies planning to co-develop advanced chips for data centers and personal computers. This collaboration aimed to combine Intel's custom processors with Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chips to create faster and more efficient systems.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $37.69, up 2.8% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Intel? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Intel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 37 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 11 days ago when the stock gained 3.2% on the news that investor optimism around artificial intelligence fueled broad market gains.\n\nTechnology stocks with a focus on artificial intelligence once again led the market higher, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Companies at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, saw significant jumps in their share prices. The rally reflects a renewed belief among investors in the transformative potential of AI technology to drive future growth and productivity. The rally was further supported by a surprise cooling in the November consumer price index (CPI) report, which triggered market pricing for additional rate cuts in the coming year. This created a more favorable environment for growth-oriented companies.\nIntel is up 86.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $37.69 per share, it is still trading 13.9% below its 52-week high of $43.76 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $773.03.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened.

His $245 price target indicates potential for another 32% upside from here.\nFrom a technical perspective, the AI stock is currently trading decisively above its major moving averages (MAs), reinforcing that the bullish momentum will likely sustain in 2026.\nWhy Groq Deal May Unlock Further Upside in NVDA Shares What’s also worth mentioning is that the $20 billion price tag on the Groq deal, while huge on the surface, is peanuts compared to Nvidia’s market cap.\nThis means the associated risk – both executional and to the giant’s balance sheet – is rather small.\nFor NVDA, it’s more like a “bolt-on” acquisition that strengthens its footprint in AI inference at a minimal financial risk. As Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon put it in a recent CNBC interview:\n\n“They can do a $20 billion deal on Christmas Eve with no press release, and nobody bats an eye.”\nAll in all, acquiring Groq’s assets and talent positions Nvidia shares to widen the gap with rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC).\nWhat’s the Consensus Rating on Nvidia? Note that Mizuho isn’t the only Wall Street firm that’s recommending sticking with NVDA stock heading into 2026.\nIn fact, the consensus rating on Nvidia shares remains at “Strong Buy” with the mean target of $256 indicating potential upside of more than 35% from current levels.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the date of publication, Wajeeh Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "What Are the 2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:45 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia remains the king of AI infrastructure, and its recent acquisitions only add to its strength.\nAlphabet benefits from being vertically integrated and controlling the whole tech stack.\nBoth stocks are reasonably valued given their growth rates and opportunities.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to be the biggest driving theme in the market today, and there is little reason to think that this won't continue. Demand for both AI infrastructure and services appears insatiable, and it still looks as if we're still in the very early innings of this trend.\nAgainst this backdrop, let's look at the top two AI stocks to buy right now.\n1. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the king of AI infrastructure, and the company's recent acquisitions have made it even stronger. It's best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) , which provide the processing power for the majority of AI workloads. GPUs are particularly dominant in large language model (LLM) training, where the company's CUDA software platform adds to its wide moat. Nearly all foundational AI code was written on CUDA, and that code only works natively with Nvidia's chips.\n\nWith its recent acquisition of SchedMD, Nvidia has only expanded its software moat. SchedMD is the developer of Slurm, an open-source software platform that helps manage GPUs by determining which tasks they perform and when. With this acquisition, Nvidia now controls the primary orchestration platform for AI chips. While it says it will keep Slurm open-source, its control over the platform will allow it to more tightly integrate it with CUDA to offer an even more seamless experience.\nThen, on Christmas Eve, the company acquired top talent from Groq and signed a licensing agreement with the company for its technology. The deal essentially gives Nvidia access to Groq's language processing units (LPUs), which are specialized chips designed specifically for AI inference. Demand for AI inference processing is eventually expected to become larger than demand for training, so this deal can be viewed as Nvidia playing both offense and defense to get ahead of that shift.\n\nOverall, Nvidia remains the company best positioned to profit from the continued AI buildout, and its recent acquisitions only strengthen its position. The stock is also reasonably valued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 25, based on analysts' estimates for its fiscal 2027, which will begin in late January 2026.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is arguably the best positioned AI company because it is the only one not reliant on Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile other companies are working on designing their own custom AI accelerator chips, Alphabet's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are now in their seventh generation and have been battle-tested by running Google's workloads for more than a decade. Those years of experience aren't something that its competitors can easily emulate.\n\nAs such, the company enjoys a big structural cost advantage in both AI training (having trained its world-class AI model Gemini) and inference relative to companies that rely largely on Nvidia for chips. Its TPUs have proven so good that Anthropic signed a large deal with Alphabet to deploy TPUs to power its AI workloads. Morgan Stanley estimates that for every 500,000 TPUs that Alphabet rents out, it generates around $13 billion in revenue.\nAlphabet's other advantage over its cloud computing competitors is that it owns a world-class LLM that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. First, this lets it capture more cloud computing revenue by offering its own model. Second, it can monetize its AI model more readily by integrating it into its products, including Google Search, its Android operating systems, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and its workplace productivity tools. With lower costs for training and inference, as well as more platforms upon which it can deploy and monetize its models, Alphabet holds significant advantages over OpenAI and other LLM developers.\n\nAs the most vertically integrated AI company, Alphabet is in a strong position, and its advantages should only widen in the coming years. Meanwhile, the stock is attractively valued, trading at a forward P/E of 28.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Investors should beware of AI's circular financing trap, look for alternatives like Broadcom\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:31 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nCVX\n\nThe AI gold rush has investors cautious that the industry may be feeding itself through a risky cycle of circular financing.\n\"I would be cautious on the financing aspect of OpenAI, the circular financing,\" Miramar Capital co-founder Max Wasserman told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid . \"Given the concentration, you need to diversify the portfolio, and you need to understand what you own and what happens if you're wrong.\"\n\nHe added that if the AI trade \"goes south, it's going to take the indices with it.\"\nAn example of this cycle is where Big Tech titans invest billions into AI startups, which then use that money to buy cloud services or hardware from said investor. For instance, OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ), Yahoo Finance's 2025 Company of the Year , committed to buying 10 gigawatts of Nvidia's ( NVDA ) chips, while Nvidia intends to invest up to $100 billion into the startup.\nWasserman warned that these deals could mask cash burn. \"The stock market valuations are still elevated, given the AI trade, which skews market indices and ignores many inherent risks of the market,\" he added.\nMoreover, as the economy shows signs of cooling, with manufacturing activity dropping and layoffs beginning to tick upward, AI valuations have increasingly veered away from fundamental business reality.\n\n\"I don't think you're going to get these double-, triple-digit returns like you have,\" Wasserman warned. \"I think you have to go to other parts of the market.\"\nFor investors looking to stay in the chip space , Broadcom ( AVGO ) offers a more grounded option.\nUnlike many AI darlings that rely on speculative future software revenue, Broadcom has built a defensive moat through hardware specialization and high-margin integration.\nThis strategy has paid off. Shares are up roughly 51% year to date, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's ( ^GSPC ) 17% gain.\n\nWasserman argued that Broadcom \"is a little misunderstood\" and that its value proposition differs from AI names like Nvidia in three key areas: VMware integration, specialized silicon via custom chips, and consistent dividend discipline.\n\"I think their growth rate and the ownership has been tremendous,\" he said. \"But again, we've been trimming this position because it grew to so much in our accounts.\"\nWasserman forecasts a 2026 shift involving a \"broadening\" of the market. As the Federal Reserve likely cuts interest rates to combat slowing growth, the \"other 493\" stocks in the S&P 500 may finally get their day in the sun.\n\nStory Continues\nThat rotation likely leads back to \"boring\" but reliable cash generators. Retailers and consumer staples like Home Depot ( HD ) and McDonald's ( MCD ) are expected to benefit from lower short-term rates.\nMeanwhile, defensive heavyweights like Chevron ( CVX ), AbbVie ( ABBV ), and Waste Management ( WM ) offer a sanctuary of dividends if the AI bubble begins to leak — or pops, in a worst-case scenario.\nUltimately, investors don't necessarily need to bet against AI, but they should certainly stop betting their entire portfolio on it. \"We continue to caution investors not to become too concentrated in technology,\" Wasserman said.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Google's AI Renaissance (Growth Story is Far from Over)\n\nAndrew Rocco\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 10:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOGL\n\nGoogle Company Overview Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock Alphabet ( GOOGL ) is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily a search engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly accounting for roughly 90% of the online search volume and market share. Over the years, the company has witnessed an increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\n\nAI Cannibalization Fears Overblown\nAlphabet’s dominant search market share and expanding cloud footprint are key growth drivers for the company. Initially, Google’s AI efforts got off to a shaky start. For instance, in Google’s first version AI model named “Bard,” searches often were completely inaccurate. Meanwhile, it appeared that ChatGPT and other models were running away with the AI race. However, several iterations later, and Google’s Gemini 2.5 AI delivers some of the most rapid responses in the industry and is viewed as an industry standard. Meanwhile, investor fears about cannibalization of the search business are unfounded. In fact, Google’s unique hybrid AI search model has driven popularity among younger users. Gemini models are being rapidly embedded across Search, YouTube, Android, and Workspace, enhancing user experience and driving internal productivity (e.g., coding, customer service).\n\nGoogle’s Groundbreaking TPU Google has constructed its own chips to power AI bots. Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-designed Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built to dramatically accelerate machine learning (ML) tasks, especially large-scale training and inference for models like Google's Gemini, powering Search, Photos, and more, available via Google Cloud and functioning as a core component of Google’s AI Hypercompute system. A TPU board fits into the same slot as a hard drive on the massive hardware racks inside the data centers that power Google's online services, the company says, adding that its own chips provide \"an order of magnitude better-optimized performance per watt for machine learning\" than other hardware options. TPU is tailored to machine learning applications, allowing the chip to be more tolerant of reduced computational precision, which means it requires fewer transistors per operation.\"\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Gloud: A Consistent Growth Engine Alphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. In third-quarter 2025, Google Cloud revenues increased 33.5% year over year to $15.16 billion. Google’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics, and AI are positive. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, along with the growing number of data centers are helping Google expand its cloud footprint worldwide. Alphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA ( NVDA ) in the cloud. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3, and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Google Cloud is becoming a preferred choice for enterprises planning to deploy AI agents thanks to the Agent Development Kit and the low-code Agent Designer tool.\n\nAd Business & YouTube Drive Top Line Growth AI is improving ad targeting and effectiveness, making the core business more resilient and profitable even with AI challengers. Meanwhile, YouTube continues to perform exceptionally well, acting as another strong pillar for revenue growth (especially the short-form video side). Zacks’ Consensus estimate sees double-digit top-line growth for the full year 2026.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFuture Growth: Waymo Robotaxis Waymo is completing over 450,000 paid robotaxi rides per week across its operating areas, including Phoenix, LA, SF, and Austin. Reports from late 2025 indicate significant volume, a substantial increase from earlier in the year, with goals to reach 1 million weekly rides by late 2026. While I believe Tesla ( TSLA ) is poised to win the robotaxi race due to its scale and costs, there will likely not be one winner-takes-all and Waymo will have a significant chunk.\n\nImage Source: OurWorldinData\nBerkshire Hathaway Buys Alphabet Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently made a significant surprise investment, buying a $4.3 billion stake in Google's parent company, Alphabet, during the third quarter of 2025, marking a major tech bet for the value investor, likely driven by Alphabet's strong market dominance in search, its lucrative ad network, and potential in AI, despite Buffett's usual tech hesitation.\n\nGOOGL Has a Reasonable Valuation Google consistently has among the lowest P/Es among the Mag 7 stocks. With a P/E of 30x EPS, it’s reasonably priced and unsurprising that Buffett wants a piece. Additionally, the company has about $100 billion in cash and only $20 billion in debt. The strong cash balance provides the flexibility required to pursue any growth strategy, whether through acquisitions or otherwise.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nStrong Trend & Technicals GOOGL shares have outperformed the general market indices and trended higher all year in a stair-stepping fashion. Investors can use the intermediate 10-week moving average as a trend guide.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nBottom Line\nAlphabet remains one of the most strategically positioned companies in technology, combining dominant search economics, accelerating cloud momentum, and expanding AI-driven fundamentals.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Should You Buy INTC Too?\n\nAditya Raghunath\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 9:58 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nNvidia (NVDA) has completed its $5 billion equity investment in Intel (INTC), the semiconductor giant confirmed in a filing on Monday. The announcement finalizes a deal first announced in September that positions the world's most valuable company as a roughly 4% stakeholder in its struggling rival.\n\nThe AI chip leader purchased over 214.7 million Intel shares at $23.28 apiece in a private placement, a price that now sits 36% below Intel's recent trading levels, according to the filing.\nMore News from Barchart Micron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMicron Stock Stole the Show in 2025.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nThe transaction, which received regulatory clearance from the Federal Trade Commission earlier this month, could serve as a major financial lifeline for Intel after years of missteps and capital-intensive manufacturing expansions that have drained its resources.\nThe companies announced they will collaborate on multiple generations of custom data center and PC products, including Nvidia-designed x86 CPUs for AI infrastructure and system-on-chips combining Intel CPU cores with Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets.\n\nHowever, neither chipmaker has committed to moving Nvidia's crown-jewel GPU production away from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to Intel's contract manufacturing services.\nIs Intel Stock a Good Buy Right Now? Valued at a market cap of $175 billion, INTC stock has returned almost 90% in 2025. Despite strong demand for its legacy chip, Intel is wrestling with manufacturing bottlenecks. Intel is undershipping its 10 nm and 7 nm chips for the personal computer and server markets right now. These products still account for the bulk of Intel’s production volume.\n\nCFO John Pitzer acknowledged that supply constraints could peak in Q1 of 2026 and ease gradually over the next few months. However, it suggests that Intel is unlikely to meet demand even beyond Q1. The silver lining is that server shortages are actually worse than PC shortages, as servers carry better margins.\nMultiple factors are driving server demand for Intel:\nFirst, hyperscalers spent the last few years focused on AI infrastructure buildouts while delaying refreshes of their existing server fleets.\nSecond, these same companies are now severely power-constrained, and replacing a five-year-old server with a new one delivers 80 percent better power efficiency.\nThird, and most intriguing, the shift from large language model training to agentic AI appears to be putting unexpected demand on traditional computing infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the technology front, Intel's 18A node is advancing but remains a work in progress. The company shipped its first Panther Lake chip on schedule by year-end, though yields aren't in line with expectations.\nNew CEO Lip-Bu Tan has brought significant cultural changes since joining in March. The organization has been flattened from 11 or 12 management layers down to just five or six. Engineers now sit on the executive staff and are required to participate in customer conversations. The company has also implemented a return-to-office policy with employees back in the office four days per week.\n\nWhat Is the INTC Stock Price Target? Analysts tracking INTC stock forecast revenue to increase from $52.55 billion in 2025 to $74 billion in 2029. Investors are concerned about narrowing gross margins driven by early 18A ramp costs and pricing actions on newer products to manage tight supply. However, the company is projected to improve adjusted earnings per share from $0.34 in 2025 to $2.84 in 2030.\n\nAs Intel continues to invest in capital expenditures, its free cash outflow is expected to total $11 billion between 2025 and 2026. Notably, free cash flow is likely to improve from $640 million in 2027 to $4.32 billion in 2029. If INTC stock trades at 25x forward earnings, which is in line with its 10-year average, it could return 100% over the next three years.\nOut of the 42 analysts covering INTC stock, two recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” 33 recommend “Hold,” one recommends “Moderate Sell,” and five recommend “Strong Sell.”\nThe average INTC stock price target is $36.74, which is similar to the current price.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The deal primarily targets AI21’s workforce of approximately 200 employees, most with advanced academic degrees and rare experience in artificial intelligence development. The acquisition price represents about $10-15 million per employee.\n\nAI21 Labs is one of the few Israeli companies developing a large-scale language model for artificial intelligence. The company’s last known valuation was $1.4 billion following a capital raise in 2023.\nReports from last summer suggested AI21 completed a $300 million fundraising round led by Nvidia and Google, though these publications were never confirmed by the company.\nFounded in 2017 by Amnon Shashua and two others, AI21 has benefited from the boom in artificial intelligence, attracting significant interest from venture capital firms and investors. Shashua is also the founder and CEO of Mobileye.\nRelated articles\nNvidia in talks to buy A21 Labs for $2B-$3B, Israeli media reports\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\nThese Under-$10 Stocks Are Up 100%+ This Quarter - And Some Still Have Room to Run\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The environmental factors evaluate how a company is doing in managing carbon emissions, pollution, waste, water usage and energy efficiency. The social approach examines treatment of employees, including workplace safety and diversity, as well as management of relationships with customers and suppliers. Governance assesses the quality of leadership, board independence, ethical conduct, compliance, transparency and the effectiveness of internal control.\n\nESG is gaining importance due to rising awareness about environmental damage and social rights. Enterprises have been compelled to take up responsible practices as asset managers and institutions incorporate ESG into portfolio strategies. Tightened regulation aimed at curbing greenwashing, which refers to misleading publicity related to ESG policies, has boosted investor confidence. Evidently, companies with high ESG focus are better at handling regulatory, environmental, and social risks, making them desirable stocks for investors over the long term. NVIDIA NVDA, IDEXX Laboratories IDXX and Microsoft MSFT are three stocks that should be on investors’ radar for ESG investing in 2026.\n\nPrice Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n3 Stocks for Sustainable Returns NVIDIA achieved 100% renewable electricity for all its global offices and controlled data centers in fiscal 2025.

      "Content": "Nvidia’s Groq bet shows that the economics of AI chip-building are still unsettled\n\nSharon Goldman\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 9:37 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nNvidia built its AI empire on GPUs. But its $20 billion bet on Groq suggests the company isn’t convinced GPUs alone will dominate the most important phase of AI yet: running models at scale, known as inference.\nThe battle to win on AI inference, of course, is over its economics. Once a model is trained, every useful thing it does—answering a query, generating code, recommending a product, summarizing a document, powering a chatbot, or analyzing an image—happens during inference. That’s the moment AI goes from a sunk cost into a revenue-generating service, with all the accompanying pressure to reduce costs, shrink latency (how long you have to wait for an AI to answer), and improve efficiency.\n\nThat pressure is exactly why inference has become the industry’s next battleground for potential profits— and why Nvidia, in a deal announced just before the Christmas holiday, licensed technology from Groq, a startup building chips designed specifically for fast, low-latency AI inference, and hired most of its team, including CEO and founder Jonathan Ross.\nInference is AI’s ‘industrial revolution’ Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been explicit about the challenge of inference. While he says Nvidia is “excellent at every phase of AI,” he told analysts at the company’s Q3 earnings call in November that inference is “really, really hard.” Far from a simple case of one prompt in and one answer out, modern inference must support ongoing reasoning, millions of concurrent users, guaranteed low latency, and relentless cost constraints. And AI agents, which have to handle multiple steps, will dramatically increase inference demand and complexity—and raise the stakes of getting it wrong.\n\n“People think that inference is one shot, and therefore it’s easy. Anybody could approach the market that way,” Huang said. “But it turns out to be the hardest of all, because thinking, as it turns out, is quite hard.”\nNvidia’s support of Groq underscores that belief, and signals that even the company that dominates AI training is hedging on how inference economics will ultimately shake out.\nHuang has also been blunt about how central inference will become to AI’s growth. In a recent conversation on the BG2 Podcast, Huang said inference already accounts for more than 40% of AI-related revenue—and predicted that it is “about to go up by a billion times.”\n“That’s the part that most people haven’t completely internalized,” Huang said. “This is the industry we were talking about. This is the industrial revolution.”\nThe CEO’s confidence helps explain why Nvidia is willing to hedge aggressively on how inference will be delivered, even as the underlying economics remain unsettled.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia wants to corner the inference market Nvidia is hedging its bets to make sure that they have their hands in all parts of the market, said Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI Research. “It’s a little bit like Meta acquiring Instagram ,” he explained. “It’s not they thought Facebook was bad, they just knew that there was an alternative that they wanted to make sure wasn’t competing with them.”\n\nThat, even though Huang had made strong claims about the economics of the existing Nvidia platform for inference. “I suspect they found that it either wasn’t resonating as well with clients as they’d hoped, or perhaps they saw something in the chip memory-based approach that Groq and another company called D-Matrix has,” said Freund, referring to another fast, low-latency AI chip startup backed by Microsoft that recently raised $275 million at a $2 billion valuation.\nFreund said Nvidia’s move into Groq could lift the entire category. “I’m sure D-Matrix is a pretty happy startup right now, because I suspect their next round will go at a much higher valuation thanks to the [Nvidia-Groq deal],” he said.\nOther industry executives say the economics of AI inference are shifting as AI moves beyond chatbots into real-time systems like robots, drones, and security tools. Those systems can’t afford the delays that come with sending data back and forth to the cloud, or the risk that computing power won’t always be available. Instead, they favor specialized chips like Groq’s over centralized clusters of GPUs.\n\nBehnam Bastani, CEO and founder of OpenInfer, which focuses on running AI inference close to where data is generated—such as on devices, sensors, or local servers rather than distant cloud data centers—said his startup is targeting these kind of applications at the “edge.”\nThe inference market, he emphasized, is still nascent. And Nvidia is looking to corner that market with its Groq deal. With inference economics still unsettled, he said Nvidia is trying to position itself as the company that spans the entire inference hardware stack, rather than betting on a single architecture.\n“It positions Nvidia as a bigger umbrella,” he said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In other words, this is about long-term strategy, not a short-term trade.\nThe Nvidia purchase follows other major Intel share sales in 2025, including $2 billion from SoftBank and an $8.9 billion U.S. government investment. Intel shares are now up 61% over the past 6 months.

      "Content": "Nvidia Becomes a 'Must Own' Stock as AI Boom Fuels 35% Upside Potential\n\nNauman Khan\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:55 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nNvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) capped off 2025 as the unquestioned leader of the AI chip boom, and Wall Street expects further gains in 2026 as demand for data-center GPUs widens.\nSeveral firms reiterated bullish calls. Cantor Fitzgerald's C.J. Muse kept a Buy rating with a $300 target, while Tigress Financial raised its target to $350. Bank of America's Vivek Arya set a $275 target and highlighted semiconductor spending upside next year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAnalysts point to sustained cloud and AI spending, new product cycles, including next-generation Blackwell and Rubin architectures, and stronger networking offerings as the main drivers. Nvidia's cash generation and lead in specialized AI silicon give analysts confidence that the company can monetise soaring demand.\nPrice targets vary, but consensus suggests upside from current levels, driven more by long-term AI adoption than a single quarter's results.\nInvestors should weigh that optimism against execution and valuation risks. Competition, customer cadence and supply dynamics could temper returns, meaning the path to any 2026 gains will likely depend on product rollout and sustained data-center orders.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy? Based on the one year price targets offered by 57 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA Corp is $253.19 with a high estimate of $432.78 and a low estimate of $138.00. The average target implies a upside of +34.76% from the current price of $187.89.\nBased on the consensus recommendation from 66 brokerage firms, NVIDIA Corp's ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) average brokerage recommendation is currently 1.8, indicating a \"Outperform\" status. The rating scale ranges from 1 to 5, where 1 signifies Strong Buy, and 5 denotes Sell.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia’s $20 billion Groq play is a blueprint for 2026\n\nFaizan Farooque\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 8:33 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nBank of America’s Vivek Arya summed up the 2026 setup in a single line:\nNvidia is acting like it believes that and more.\nThe chipmaker didn't want to wait for the next phase of the AI buildout to start, so it made a $20 billion deal with inference chip firm Groq. The agreement appears like an acquisition in terms of its economic impact, but it's not one on paper.\nNvidia gives Groq workers a payday Axios says that Groq's stockholders and employees are getting compensated as if they were leaving the company, even though no equity is changing hands. And Nvidia gets what it needs most for 2026: inference IP, talented engineers, and speed.\nAxios’ reporting answers the question that immediately lit up social media: What happens to Groq employees if Nvidia “didn’t buy” the company?\n\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nAxios adds that Groq stockholders will get cash payments for each share they own based on the $20 billion value, even though \"no equity is changing hands.\" The payments are set up like this: 85% up front, 10% in the middle of 2026, and the rest at the end of 2026.\nRelated: Novo Nordisk just pulled off something nobody saw coming\nThe terms are very generous for employees:\nIt is likely that about 90% of Groq's workers will go to Nvidia. They will get cash for vested shares and Nvidia stock that vests over time for unvested equity.\nAxios said that about 50 people in that category get their share faster and with cash.\nPeople who stay at Groq still get paid for vested shares and earn a package that is related to the company's future.\nAxios claims that even new hires will profit because the usual one-year vesting cliff is being dropped, so employees who have been there for less than a year can still obtain liquidity .\n\nAxios’ bottom line is so blunt: “Everyone gets paid. A lot.”\nGroq’s inference edge is Nvidia’s prize Groq's own release frames the deal as a way to make \"high-performance, low-cost inference\" more widely available. It also says that Groq founder Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other team members are joining Nvidia. It also says that Groq will be independent, with Simon Edwards taking over as CEO, and that GroqCloud will keep running.\nRelated: Alphabet makes a subtle Gmail shift ahead of 2026\nThe move is part of a larger trend in which Big Tech is looking for licensing-plus-talent deals to speed things up and make it easier to cope with rules.\n\nStory Continues\nThis is Nvidia preparing for 2026, which will be all about \"AI factories\" and always-on inference (the term used to describe the continuous use of AI models, rather than their training).\nImpact on Nvidia's balance sheet, income statement The $20 billion Groq deal that Nvidia just made is big news, but it's not too much for a firm that makes money at Nvidia's present rate. Nvidia has $60.6 billion in cash , cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of the conclusion of its quarter on Oct. 26. The free cash flow for that same quarter was about $22.1 billion. This means that the Groq price tag is about \"one quarter of free cash flow\" at the current run rate.\n\nRelated: This $40 PC fix might be the quietest MSFT signal for 2026\nNvidia is also still in a strong position to return cash, which is important. NVDA is aggressively buying back stock and giving cash back to shareholders while it builds up its AI infrastructure. This is one reason why most investors see this move as adding value rather than taking it away.\nThe timing of the cash payments is another aspect that is easy to overlook. The money that Groq stakeholders will get isn't likely to come in one big check. The mechanism reported delivers around 85% of the money up front, 10% in the middle of 2026, and the rest at the end of 2026. That moves some of the cash effect into next year, which fits with the bigger notion that the payout is a strategic bet for 2026 and beyond, not merely a one-time headline.\n\nRelated: Warner faces a surprise new bid as investors do the real math\nFinally, investors should closely monitor the \"hidden\" implications that may appear on the income statement in 2026.\nThe Groq employee transition is set up so that vested equity is paid out in cash and unvested equity is turned into Nvidia stock that vests over time. That's a benefit for keeping employees, but it could also mean more stock-based pay and costs associated with integration. And depending on how Nvidia records the perpetual license, investors may see amortization or other non-cash expenses that are important for GAAP results even if cash flow is robust.\nNvidia’s deal is a blueprint for AI tie-ups Investors should view the Groq structure as an indication that AI-driven dealmaking is evolving. The plan is straightforward: Get the essential IP, employ the leaders, and make sure the target stays \"independent.\"\nIt's easy to see why this happens more often in 2026:\nIt takes too long to examine AI infrastructure.\nRegulators have been wary of big mergers.\nBig companies can pay acquisition-level fees for \"access\" instead of \"ownership.\"\n\nAnd the market conditions make it more likely. Coverage from Bank of America reveals patterns indicating significant chip growth in 2026, with Nvidia consistently being one of the largest companies to benefit from this trend.\nNvidia didn't simply make a $20 billion purchase; it may have shown how major AI companies plan to expand in 2026: faster than regulators can stop them and with enough money to make \"not an acquisition\" feel like one.\nRelated: What’s next for Nvidia stock in 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 30, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

Earlier in December, this transaction received U.S. antitrust approval from the Federal Trade Commission. This purchase gives NVIDIA roughly a 4% equity stake in Intel through a private placement of shares.\n\nThe partnership aims to tightly combine Intel’s custom-designed x86 CPUs with NVIDIA’s AI GPUs and NVLink interconnect technology to create faster, more efficient AI systems and next-generation PCs with stronger AI and graphics performance. This could help Intel remain competitive in the AI era.\nIntel had also secured $8.9 billion in funds from the U.S. government to support semiconductor manufacturing and packaging projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon in order to boost the domestic chip industry. SoftBank has also invested $2 billion, providing funds to support Intel’s restructuring and AI projects.\nIntel is constantly making efforts to bring huge investments to strengthen its balance sheet, supporting heavy spending on new factories and R&D, boosting market confidence and enabling deeper technology collaboration with firms like NVIDIA.\n\nHow Are Rivals Performing? Intel faces competition from Qualcomm Incorporated ( QCOM ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). Qualcomm recently completed its $2.4 billion acquisition of British semiconductor company Alphawave Semi to strengthen its AI, data center and high-speed connectivity technologies, boosting its competitiveness beyond smartphones. By strengthening its PC chip offerings through programs like Snapdragon X, Qualcomm can expand into new markets such as AI infrastructure, edge computing and personal computers. Qualcomm entered the AI infrastructure space by developing AI accelerators like AI200 & AI250.\n\nAMD is set to launch high-performance AI GPUs, EPYC server CPUs and full AI systems like Helios to compete with NVIDIA and provide faster, more efficient solutions for data centers and enterprises. AMD is partnering with companies like OpenAI and Oracle to expand across gaming, PCs and servers to increase revenues and stay competitive.

      "Content": "Ranking the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy for 2026. Here's My No. 2\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for training and running AI programs.\nThe company says it has $500 billion in orders through the end of 2026.\nNvidia's top customers are among those working on alternative chip designs.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) buildout would look much different without Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for training and running AI products, and major companies have been spending billions to buy and package the chips to try to get an advantage in the AI race.\n\nData centers bundle Nvidia chips by the thousands so they can work together to perform high-level AI tasks, which has been a huge windfall for Nvidia and its investors. CEO Jensen Huang has said the company's Blackwell chips cost $30,000 or more each -- so any company investing in AI chips is making substantial purchases.\nThat's helped Nvidia leapfrog other major companies to become the largest publicly traded company in the world by market capitalization. Nvidia even topped the $5 trillion mark earlier this year before pulling back -- it now has a market capitalization of more than $4.5 trillion.\nNvidia took its place as a member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a grouping identified by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett as the most influential stocks in the S&P 500 .\nThis is the sixth article in a series ranking the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026. In previous articles, I identified Apple in the No. 7 spot , Amazon as No. 6, Tesla as No. 5, Microsoft in the No. 4 spot, and Meta Platforms as No. 3. Here's why Nvidia deserves the No. 2 spot for 2026.\n\nAbout Nvidia stock We've already covered what Nvidia does. What we haven't talked about is how much money the company's making and how Nvidia's GPU sales have changed its trajectory.\nIn just five years, Nvidia saw incredible revenue growth of 682%. Profits have been even better, as Nvidia's net income rose by 1,580% in the last five years, and its free cash flow is up by 1,550%.\nEven faced with more challenging comparable numbers, Nvidia continues to shine. Revenue in its fiscal 2026's third quarter (ended Oct. 26, 2025) was $57 billion, up 62% from a year ago. Most of those sales came from the company's data center segment, which saw $51.2 billion in revenue, up 66% from the previous year.\nThe company's gross margin is an impressive 73.4%, with net income of $31.91 billion, a 65% increase year over year. Earnings per share came in at $1.30, up 67% year over year.\n\nStory Continues\nHuang, who has predicted that the global AI infrastructure market could grow from $600 billion to $4 trillion by 2030, says Nvidia is profiting from three simultaneous shifts in computing: an evolution from CPU general-purpose computing to GPU-accelerated computing, the rise of generative AI, and growth in agentic AI systems.\n\n\"Nvidia is chosen because our singular architecture enables all three transitions and thus so [sic], for any form and modality of AI across all industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in the cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots, one architecture,\" he said.\nNvidia says that it has had $500 billion in cumulative orders for its Blackwell and upcoming Rubin AI chips, with $150 billion worth already shipped.\nWhy Nvidia is No. 2 This company is doing things the right way. There's a huge opportunity in AI infrastructure, and Nvidia has massive competitive advantages. But I also think that the waters are going to get a little choppier in 2026. Companies are spending billions of dollars a year on Nvidia processors. Some of them are looking for alternatives or at least trying to create competition.\n\nAmazon, a major Nvidia customer, is now marketing its Trainium3 custom AI chip, which it claims can halve the cost of training and operating AI models compared to systems that use GPUs. Meta Platforms is also reportedly in talks with Alphabet 's Google about purchasing billions of dollars' worth of Google's tensor processing units, or TPUs, to operate in its data centers.\nOpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has signed new deals with Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom to provide additional computing power for its popular AI models.\nNvidia currently holds an estimated 90% of data center AI market share, but that won't last forever. Its biggest customers -- many of them members of the Magnificent Seven as well -- would rather make their own chip infrastructure than continue to feed Nvidia's bottom line.\n\nMy prediction is that Nvidia will have a very good calendar 2026 year. But the stock price will lag behind its 2025 gains (around 40% year to date) as the competitive landscape begins to shift. That's why it gets the No. 2 ranking in the list of top Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "AI Arms Race Drives Capex Boom: 3 AI Stocks to Watch in 2026\n\nSubham Roy\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:04 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMRVL\n\nMU\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence arms race is going to enter a decisive phase after years of heavy investment in chips, data centers and foundational models. The focus is now shifting toward scale, monetization and competitive advantage. The year 2026 will separate long-term winners from those who have not successfully integrated AI-native business models.\n\nAI is no longer an experimental add-on; it has become a core growth driver and customer retention pillar for many companies in 2025. Big Tech, cloud hyperscalers and enterprise software providers are racing to embed AI deeper into products, workflows and infrastructure to get an edge over their competitors.\nAmong the various players within the AI ecosystem, the companies that stand out as the direct beneficiaries of the AI arms race are NVIDIA NVDA, Marvell Technology MRVL and Micron Technology MU, as the rapid expansion of AI inference workloads is structurally dependent on their technologies.\nGrowing Capex Spent to Drive AI Infrastructure Growth According to Gartner, global AI spending is expected to exceed $2 trillion in 2026 compared with an estimated $1.5 trillion in 2025. A major portion of this spending will be on AI infrastructure, which will drive the demand for semiconductor chips providing high bandwidth memory, compute, control, connectivity and deployment.\n\nPer a report by International Data Corp. (IDC), the global AI infrastructure market is expected to hit a massive $758 billion by 2029, driven by strong demand for compute and storage hardware. IDC expects momentum in AI investment to continue in 2026, driven by strong spending from hyperscalers and cloud service providers.\nThree Stocks Expected to Benefit From Rising AI Capex NVIDIA – This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is at the forefront of the AI revolution due to its strong portfolio. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\nNVIDIA is gaining from the demand for its Hopper 200 and Blackwell GPU, used for training and inference of large language models, and have been a key catalyst as cloud providers and enterprises scale their AI infrastructure.\n\nNVIDIA’s strength lies not just in hardware but in its full-stack approach. GPUs, networking products, software platforms and developer tools work together to create a powerful ecosystem. This integration makes it difficult for competitors to displace NVIDIA in large-scale AI deployments.\nNVIDIA’s financials remain rock solid. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues jumped 62% from the year-ago quarter, while non-GAAP earnings per share rose 60%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 earnings is currently pegged at $4.65 per share, indicating an increase of 55.5% year over year.\n\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus NVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\nMarvell Technology – This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company develops custom XPU silicon, electro-optic interconnect products, custom ASICs, PAM4/800G, data center interconnect, next-generation switches and an Active Electrical Cable ecosystem with crucial applications in AI computation and networking across both hyperscale and enterprise spaces.\n\nMarvell Technology has a multi-year strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services to supply connectivity products for AI and data-center workloads. It has also partnered with NVIDIA to integrate NVIDIA’s NVLink Fusion technology into MRVL’s custom cloud-platform silicon solution. The acquisition of Celestial AI will speed up its momentum in the interconnect space. These collaborations make MRVL indispensable in AI infrastructure.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2026, MRVL’s data center revenues of $1.52 billion increased 37.8% year over year and 1.8% sequentially, driven by strong traction in electro-optic interconnect products and next-generation switch offerings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MRVL’s fiscal 2026 earnings is currently pegged at $2.84 per share, indicating an increase of 80.9% year over year.\n\nMarvell Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus Marvell Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Marvell Technology, Inc. Quote\nMicron Technology – Another Zacks Rank #1 company that is benefiting from the rapidly expanding AI-driven memory and storage markets. Micron is capitalizing on the AI boom with its HBM3E solutions, which are increasingly being adopted by major hyperscalers and enterprise customers.\n\nOn the first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call, the company highlighted strong customer interest in its HBM3E portfolio, which is expected to drive substantial revenue growth in the quarters ahead. MU has made steady progress in HBM product development and capacity expansion, positioning itself as a key supplier to leading AI chipmakers. HBM carries higher margins than conventional DRAM, which should support profitability as volumes scale.\nMicron is strengthening its industry partnerships to capitalize on AI and data center growth. The company is deepening collaborations with leading hyperscalers, AI model developers and has partnered with NVIDIA, AMD and Intel. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MU’s fiscal 2026 earnings is currently pegged at $31.36 per share, indicating an increase of 278.3% year over year.\n\nMicron Technology, Inc.

The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing.

( NVDA , Financials ) investing $20 billion in AI inference business Groq shows its desire to dominate the AI ecosystem. Groq may continue operating independently while Nvidia uses its inference tools thanks to its founder Jonathan Ross and several engineers.Nvidia's planned diversification beyond AI training hardware is shown by the deal. Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPUs fuel most large-scale model training, but the company is now targeting inference, which has a far larger and recurring revenue potential.Over 90% of the AI GPU market is Nvidia. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq protects market dominance and adds software and service income streams while Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft construct their own inference processors to save costs.AI applications increase inference workloads considerably. AI token usage at major tech businesses increases every few months, fueling inference hardware and platform demand, say analysts. Beyond inference, Nvidia is entering networking, robotics, and government. Last quarter, networking sales surged 162% to $8.2 billion, while automotive and professional visualization grew double digits.Nvidia's Strong Buy consensus has 39 Buys and one Hold rating with an average price target of $263.58, implying 40% upside over a year.

      "Content": "Buy These 5 Low-Leverage Stocks Amid a Reversal of Santa Claus Rally\n\nAparajita Dutta\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:20 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nHL\n\nENGQF\n\nRMD\n\nRSMDF\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indices slipped at the bourses on Dec. 29, 2025, led by a drop in big technology shares, including Oracle, Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. The move might have disappointed some investors who had been anticipating a &ldquo;Santa Claus rally,&rdquo; a seasonal pattern in which the S&P 500 typically gains during the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the new year.\n\nAt this juncture, investors may want to favor safe-haven assets over high-growth technology stocks, given that declines in AI-driven tech names were a key reason behind the broader market sell-off. So, we recommend companies, such as Engie SA ENGIY, Hamilton Insurance Group HG, Hecla Mining HL, Resmed RMD and Siemens Energy SMNEY. These stocks carry low leverage and, therefore, may offer a safer option for investors seeking stability during periods of market turmoil.\nNow, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let&rsquo;s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock can help investors.\nWhat&rsquo;s the Significance of Low-Leverage Stocks? In finance, leverage refers to the practice of borrowing capital to help companies run their operations smoothly and expand their business. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt financing over equity financing.\n\nHowever, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. To avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, it is advisable to avoid companies that rely excessively on debt financing.\nThe crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.\nThe equity market can be volatile at times. As an investor, if you want to avoid significant losses, we suggest focusing on stocks with low leverage, which are generally less risky.\nTo identify such stocks, several leverage ratios have historically been developed to measure the amount of debt a company carries. The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common of these ratios.\n\nAnalyzing Debt/Equity Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders&rsquo; Equity\nThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.\nWith the fourth-quarter 2025 earnings season ahead of us, investors should be eyeing stocks that have demonstrated solid earnings growth in recent periods.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, if a stock carries a high debt-to-equity ratio during an economic downturn, its seemingly strong earnings could quickly turn into a nightmare.\nThe Winning Strategy Considering the factors above, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.\nYet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To select stocks with the potential to provide steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include additional factors.\n\nHere are the other parameters :\nDebt/Equity less than X-Industry Median : Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to 10 : The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000 : A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\nPercentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median : Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock&rsquo;s price appreciation.\nVGM Score of A or B : Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.\nEstimated One-Year EPS Growth F (1)/F(0) greater than 5 : This shows earnings growth expectations.\n\nZacks Rank #1 or 2 : Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.\nExcluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 18 stocks that made it through the screen.\nEngie : It engages in the power, natural gas, and energy services businesses. On Dec. 18, 2025, Engie announced that its largest onshore wind project globally and one of the largest in Latin America, Serra do Assuru&aacute;, has reached full commercial operations. This should bolster ENGIY&rsquo;s position in the globally expanding wind energy market.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ENGIY&rsquo;s 2025 earnings indicates an improvement of 28.5% from the prior-year reported actuals. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nHamilton Insurance Group : It underwrites specialty insurance and reinsurance risks, principally in Bermuda and internationally. On Nov. 4, 2025, the company released its third-quarter 2025 results.

The year 2025 remains on track to be a positive one for equity investors, but the success of the Santa Claus Rally is by no means assured as some caution and volatility seems to be in play. Along those lines, reading the tea leaves contained in insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research is a challenging task this week. For starters, transaction volume historically is low in the final trading days of any year, diminishing the quality of the data. But this year, the days are 'even quieter' because of two 'added' federal holidays that left the SEC closed for three of the five business days last week (the SEC being the source of the Form 4 documents filed by insiders when they transact). To add some detail, 466 filings meet the criteria for inclusion in Vickers' Weekly Insider Report this week, compared to 1641 last week. Turning to longer-term (eight-week) data to mitigate the short-term (one-week) weakness, we note that the data is solidly neutral, suggesting corporate insiders are not eager to buy stock -- but nor are they selling aggressively. On a scale where the neutral range runs from 2.00 to 6.00, Vickers' eight-week sell/buy ratio for the NYSE is 3.44, the Nasdaq ratio is 3.90, and the Total (all exchanges) ratio is 3.67.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Could Be Among the First to Reach a $5 Trillion Valuation\n\nThomas Niel, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points In October, Nvidia's market cap briefly topped $5 trillion.\nWhile that particular \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has since pulled back, another member could join the $5 trillion club this year.\nGoogle parent Alphabet currently has a market capitalization of $3.8 trillion.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nBack in October, Nvidia became the first company with a market cap exceeding $5 trillion.\nNvidia's stock has since pulled back from that lofty level, but one big rally might be all it takes to lift the AI chip giant back above that value in 2026. Not only that, a few other companies could join that exclusive club, too.\nFor instance, as my fellow Motley Fool contributor Harsh Chauhan noted in an article on Dec. 20, Microsoft could conceivably hit that market cap milestone in the coming year .\nIn my view, another \" Magnificent Seven \" member also looks to be on the verge of joining the $5 trillion club: Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nWhy Alphabet is so close to hitting this milestone Alphabet shares have surged by 65% year to date. The primary reason for this has been the company's success in catching up to early adopters of generative artificial intelligence (AI) like Microsoft and OpenAI. Alphabet's Gemini 3 has given ChatGPT a run for its money.\nMore importantly, the AI Overviews and AI Mode features on the Google search engine have helped to increase user engagement with the platform. This has alleviated investors' initial concerns that the growing use of AI chatbots to answer people's questions would cut into Alphabet's primary profit center, search advertising.\n\nThanks to this year's significant share price run-up, Alphabet now has a market cap of $3.8 trillion. That means all it'll take for the company to reach a $5 trillion market cap is for it to appreciate in value by another 31.6%. Not only is that well within the realm of possibility in the next few years, there's a chance it could happen between now and next December. It all has to do with near-term earnings growth, coupled with the potential for the stock to experience further valuation expansion.\nCould it happen next year? According to sell-side analysts' estimates, Alphabet's earnings per share (EPS) could rise by over 41% between now and the end of 2028. This strongly suggests that it's a matter of when, not if, Alphabet will join the $5 trillion club.\nHowever, a move to that market cap could arrive as soon as 2026. Yes, the average sell-side analyst's earnings forecast may only call for 6% EPS growth next year, but those predictions may be too conservative. Even as Alphabet plans to ramp up spending on AI and cloud infrastructure, the payoff from these investments could take shape sooner than expected.\n\nStory continues\nIn fact, we may already be witnessing this: Google's overall queries and revenue are growing by double-digit percentages thanks to AI integration. The sell-side forecasts at the high end of the range call for earnings growth of as much as 24% in 2026. Even if growth lands somewhere between the average and high end of the forecast range, that may lift the stock price by enough to get the company over the $5 trillion mark.\n\nShares currently trade for around 28 times expected forward earnings. If high growth persists into the coming year and bullishness about AI returns, names like Microsoft could again trade at forward P/Es in the mid-30s, and Alphabet could experience a similar rerating. Considering its plausible path to a $5 trillion market cap, Alphabet may be one of the first stocks investors should buy for the new year.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Nvidia, AMD, and Micron Technology Could Help This Unstoppable ETF Turn $250,000 Into $1 Million in 10 Years\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:33 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMU\n\nAMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution would be at a standstill without advanced chips and components.\nNvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Micron supply some of that critical hardware, and their shares are up by an average of 119% in 2025.\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF exclusively invests in semiconductor companies that stand to benefit from megatrends like AI.\n10 stocks we like better than iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF ›\n\nTop artificial intelligence (AI) developers like OpenAI and Anthropic continue to launch new models, with each one being \"smarter\" and more capable than the last. However, every new model also soaks up more computing power than its predecessors, so it requires significantly more data center capacity.\nSome of the biggest suppliers of AI infrastructure, chips, and components include Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) , and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) . Shares in those three companies have surged by an average of 119% in 2025 alone, crushing the S&P 500 index, which is up just 18%.\nIn other words, investors who had little or no exposure to the AI semiconductor space this year probably underperformed the broader market.\nFortunately, there's a simple way to buy a slice of this hypergrowth industry without having to pick winners and losers. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that exclusively invests in companies like Nvidia, AMD, Micron, and many of their peers. Here's how it could turn an investment of $250,000 into $1 million over the next 10 years.\nThe best AI hardware stocks packed into one ETF The iShares Semiconductor ETF solely invests in American companies that design, distribute, and manufacture chips and components, but primarily those benefiting from opportunities like AI . Its narrow focus is the reason its portfolio only includes 30 stocks. The fund is also quite top heavy, with its three largest holdings sporting a combined weighting of 22.7%:\nStock\niShares ETF Portfolio Weighting\n1. Nvidia\n8.22%\n2. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n7.62%\n3. Micron Technology\n6.88%\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Dec. 24, 2025, and are subject to change.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the best chips on the market for developing AI models. Its current Blackwell Ultra lineup was designed to deliver sufficient computing power for the industry's latest reasoning models, like OpenAI's GPT 5.2, Anthropic's Claude 4.5, and Alphabet 's Gemini 3. I think Nvidia stock is still cheap despite its 41% gain in 2025, which leaves plenty of room for more upside from here.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD is chasing Nvidia in the market for data center chips. The company's latest MI350 Series GPUs have captured some of its key rival's top customers, but they still fall modestly short in terms of performance. Next year, AMD plans to launch its new MI400 GPUs as part of a fully integrated data center rack called Helios, which could deliver 10 times more performance than its MI350 GPUs. This company might be a real threat to Nvidia at that point.\n\nThen there is Micron Technology, which is one of the world's leading suppliers of memory and storage chips. Both Nvidia and AMD have integrated Micron's HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) solutions into their data center GPUs to unlock their maximum processing speeds. Micron is already sold out of its entire 2026 supply of data center memory, including its upcoming HBM4E solution, which is poised to deliver improvements in both capacity and energy efficiency.\nOutside of its top three positions, the iShares ETF holds several other top AI semiconductor stocks like Broadcom , Texas Instruments , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing .\nTurning $250,000 into $1 million over the next decade The iShares Semiconductor ETF is on track to end 2025 with an eye-popping 43% return. That isn't sustainable over the long run, but the ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 27.2% over the past decade, so it's no stranger to high growth. Even its more modest average annual gain of 11.8% since its inception in 2001 is still better than the performance of the S&P 500 over the same period.\nHere's how long it might take for the iShares ETF to turn an investment of $250,000 into $1 million, based on three different average annual returns:\nInitial Investment\nCompound Annual Return\nTime to Reach $1 Million\n$250,000\n11.8%\n13 Years\n$250,000\n19.5% (midpoint)\n8 Years\n$250,000\n27.2%\n6 Years\n\nCalculations by author.\nAccording to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, annual spending on AI data center infrastructure and chips could reach $4 trillion by 2030. If that happens, the iShares ETF is likely to deliver compound annual returns in excess of 20% for the foreseeable future. But to be perfectly clear, that wouldn't be sustainable under normal circumstances because of the law of large numbers.\n\nFor example, Nvidia is already a $4.6 trillion company. If its market cap grew by 27.2% annually for the next decade, it would be worth almost $50 trillion. The output of the entire U.S. economy was less than $30 trillion in 2024, so although AI is a revolutionary technology, it's important for investors to temper their expectations.\nFortunately, the iShares ETF can still turn $250,000 into $1 million over the next 10 years even if its annual returns moderate to slightly below 20%. Per the above table, if investors are a little more patient, the ETF could also help them join the million-dollar club in 13 years even if its returns suffer a significant reversion back to their long-term average of 11.8%.\nBut I think its returns are likely to remain elevated for now, considering practically every chipmaker is experiencing more demand than it can possibly supply.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF right now?

      "Content": "Silver Is Obliterating the Stock Market in 2025 With a 168% Return. Here's a Simple Way to Buy It for 2026\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 1:45 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: SI=F\n\nGC=F\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Silver is a precious metal just like gold, except it's far more abundant.\nSilver is very useful in industrial settings, with electronics manufacturers soaking up almost half of all available supply each year.\nThe shiny metal has more than doubled in value during 2025 on rising political and economic uncertainty paired with a supply shortage.\n10 stocks we like better than iShares Silver Trust ›\n\nGold has increased in value by 72% in 2025, crushing major stock market indexes like the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and the Nasdaq-100 . It has even outperformed shares of artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse Nvidia . Elevated inflation, soaring government debt, and heightened economic uncertainty are just a few factors pushing the yellow metal higher.\nGold's close sibling, silver, is doing even better, with a whopping 168% gain this year. It's benefiting from the same tailwinds, but a supply shortage is acting like rocket fuel for this rally. Could 2026 bring further gains? I'll explore that possibility below, and give investors a simple way to buy the precious metal with minimal fuss.\nWhy silver is soaring right now Gold has been a widely recognized store of value for thousands of years, mainly because it's extremely scarce, with just 216,265 tons pulled out of the ground throughout all of human history. Silver is also a precious metal but it's far more abundant, with miners extracting roughly eight times more of it each year compared to gold.\n\nBut on the flipside, silver is also far more useful in industrial settings thanks to its high electrical conductivity and its much lower cost per ounce. In fact, demand from electronics manufacturers alone soaks up almost half of all available supply each year. That's why a shortage of this precious metal can drive a sharp increase in price in a very short period of time, which is part of the reason for its fierce rally in 2025.\nChina, which is the world's second largest exporter of silver behind Hong Kong, recently announced new restrictions on shipping silver out of the country starting from Jan. 1, 2026. As the biggest manufacturer of electronics on the planet, China is trying to protect its domestic supply chain, but the restrictions also create leverage in global trade negotiations with other economic powerhouses like the U.S.\n\nBut silver was already trending higher this year before China announced the export curbs. It was benefiting from the same political and economic uncertainty fueling gold's powerful rally .\nFor example, the U.S. national debt recently hit a record high of $38.5 trillion, following a $1.8 trillion government budget deficit in fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30). Investors are worried the government can only escape this fiscal mess by aggressively increasing money supply to devalue the U.S. dollar, so they are flocking to precious metals as a hedge.\n\nStory Continues\nCan silver's incredible rally continue? The U.S. government is on track for another trillion-dollar deficit in fiscal 2026, so if China's export restrictions remain active, all of the ingredients will be in place for further upside in the price of silver next year.\nHowever, investors who expect silver to more than double in value again in 2026 might want to temper their expectations. The precious metal has delivered a compound annual return of just 5.9% over the last 50 years, which is probably a more realistic target. Anything above that baseline would be a bonus.\n\nPlus, while silver has generally trended higher over the long term, it's far more volatile than gold. It reached a high of $35 per ounce in 1980 before losing 90% of its peak value, and it then took a whole 31 years before it set a new record price of $48 in 2011. But a 70% decline also followed that bull run, so silver's latest journey to a new all-time high in 2025 was 14 years in the making.\nSimply put, investors who plan to add silver to their portfolios in 2026 need to maintain a very long-term time horizon if they want to maximize their odds of earning a positive return.\nA simple way to buy silver for 2026 Buying physical silver is the surest way to profit from the precious metal's potential upside over the long term, but it also comes with storage and insurance costs. Plus, it isn't easy to sell silver bars or coins in a hurry. Silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs), on the other hand, can be bought and sold instantly with the click of a mouse, and they don't take up any space.\n\nThe iShares Silver Trust (NYSEMKT: SLV) is the biggest ETF in the industry with $38 billion in assets under management, which is fully backed by 528 million ounces of physical reserves. Investors aren't entitled to take delivery of any actual metal, but owning this ETF gives them direct exposure to silver's potential upside all the same.\nThe ETF has an expense ratio of 0.5%, which is the proportion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs. That means an investment of $10,000 would incur an annual fee of $50, but that's probably still cheaper than paying to store and insure physical metal.\nIn summary, buying the iShares Silver Trust is the simplest way for the average investor to add silver to their portfolio.\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Silver Trust right now? Before you buy stock in iShares Silver Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Silver Trust wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "China’s Rich Are Repricing Property Against Bitcoin — and Housing Is Losing\n\nLockridge Okoth\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:08 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nNVDA\n\nBNB-USD\n\nAffluent Chinese investors are increasingly questioning whether luxury real estate still deserves its long-held status as a safe store of value.\nViral discussions on Chinese social media now show ¥60–66 million ($414,000–$455,000) homes in Shenzhen Bay being weighed directly against Bitcoin, Nvidia stock, and BNB. Not as symbols of status, but as competing assets in a global portfolio.\n\nCrypto vs Concrete: Why China’s Wealthy Are Questioning the Value of Owning Homes The shift is striking, with Shenzhen Bay having long been considered one of mainland China’s most prestigious and resilient property markets. Yet recent posts suggest that even this enclave is no longer immune.\nOne widely shared account described touring a ¥66 million property while warning a friend that its value could fall to ¥30 million within three years. According to the post, prices in the area have already dropped by nearly 50%. Further downside is expected if a broader financial crisis hits.\nOther investors echoed the anxiety. One user admitted to taking on a ¥60 million mortgage in Shenzhen, saying they were unsure “whether to be happy or uneasy.”\nAnother joked about becoming a “house slave.” They noted that only paying in full spared them the full psychological burden of debt. Still others urged caution, pointing to high mortgage rates, rising housing supply, and the risks of concentrating capital in a single illiquid asset.\nBeyond price declines, the debate reflects deeper concerns about liquidity and political exposure. Investors argue that high-end properties have become increasingly difficult to exit quickly and are increasingly visible to regulators.\n\nBuying a home worth ¥100 million or more can invite tax scrutiny and investigations. This adds layers of risk during periods of policy tightening. In contrast, crypto and global equities are viewed as easier to hedge, trade, and move across borders.\nHong Kong’s Property Premium Is About Freedom, Not Returns This comparison also reframes why Hong Kong property continues to command a premium. According to one post, the appeal lies less in expected returns and more in “trading money for freedom.”\n\nStory Continues\nEuropean real estate, which can offer residency or passport pathways for far less capital, was cited as another example of property serving mobility rather than prestige. Mainland luxury housing, by contrast, was portrayed as offering neither strong returns nor optionality.\nSome investors likened the current housing market to China’s A-share equities. Domestic assets, they argued, tend to fall during geopolitical stress but fail to rally when global markets rise meaningfully.\n\nReal estate, particularly in Shenzhen Bay, appears to exhibit this asymmetry. It is vulnerable during downturns, yet stagnant during risk-on periods.\nThe implications extend beyond property. Crypto is no longer being framed primarily as a speculative bet, but as a strategic tool for capital preservation and flexibility.\nYounger investors, largely priced out of luxury housing, are opting out altogether. They favor digital assets and international equities, which offer clearer risk profiles and easier access.\nRepricing luxury real estate against Bitcoin and global equities signals a structural shift in Chinese wealth management. As capital mobility becomes paramount and political scrutiny intensifies, liquid global assets are increasingly displacing property as the preferred vehicle for preserving value.\nHow regulators respond, and whether property prices stabilize, may shape China’s domestic markets. It could also influence the next phase of global crypto adoption in the country.\nRead original story China’s Rich Are Repricing Property Against Bitcoin — and Housing Is Losing by Lockridge Okoth at beincrypto.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Aims to Starts Shipping Chips to China Soon\n\nTalha Qureshi\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 9:00 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBABA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) is among the Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 2026 . On December 23, Reuters reported that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) aims to start shipping its second most powerful AI chips to China before mid-February 2026.\nThe update comes after several Chinese companies, including Alibaba, had shown interest in importing the company’s latest H200 chips to speed up their model training and development processes. To cater to this rising demand from Chinese companies, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) earlier on December 15 had announced ramping up its H200 production.\nAs per the latest update, the US chip maker plans to ship around 5,000 to 10,000 chip modules, which is equivalent to 40,000 to 80,000 H200 AI chips. According to people familiar with the matter, as per Reuters, Nvidia has told Chinese companies that the new production capacity for chips will open in the second half of 2026. However, it should be noted that the Chinese government has yet to approve the import of these chips; as a result, the timeline of the shipment can vary.\n\nThat said, Wall Street is bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Recently, on December 26, Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $265 price target. On the same day, C J Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $300 price target.\n​NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and sells specialized processors, initially for gaming but now also crucial for AI, data centers, professional visualization, and the automotive industry.

      "Content": "Nvidia, in the Last Days of 2025, Just Made a Game-Changing Move\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia, with earnings reaching record levels, is one of the first winners of the AI boom.\nThe tech giant says AI inferencing will be a major growth driver in the years to come, so it’s placed a big bet on that area.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has dominated the early stages of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and this is thanks to the company's top-performing chips. These graphics processing units (GPUs) power the training of models, so that they have what it takes to then go on and do the job of solving complex problems.\n\nThough rivals exist, Nvidia has remained in the lead -- the company has kept its promise of innovating on an annual basis to ensure this position. Still, this isn't the only way Nvidia plans on staying ahead, and right now, in the last days of 2025, the tech giant made a game-changing move -- one that could help secure its leadership in the next phase of AI growth. Let's find out more.\nFrom gaming to AI First, though, let's take a quick look at Nvidia's path so far. The AI giant actually started out about 30 years ago with a focus on serving the video game industry. Nvidia still does this, but a decade ago, the company recognized the AI opportunity and put its focus there. As a result, Nvidia developed the world's most sought-after AI chips as well as a full menu of related products -- from enterprise software to networking tools.\n\nBut the star of the show continues to be the GPU , and the biggest tech names, from Microsoft to Amazon , flock to Nvidia for each new release. This momentum has fueled explosive earnings growth for the chip designer, with revenue and net income climbing in the double and triple digits to record levels. In the most recent fiscal year, Nvidia's revenue reached more than $130 billion.\nNow, let's move along to Nvidia's game-changing move. It's key because it not only addresses the risk of competition, but it also strengthens Nvidia's position in what may next drive AI growth: AI inferencing. We'll start with competition. Nvidia faces it from market heavyweights like Advanced Micro Devices and even some of its own customers that are developing their own AI chips, such as Amazon. But Nvidia's biggest threat may not come from these giants. Instead, it may come from small start-ups specializing in technology that could either compete with or replace Nvidia chips -- particularly if these start-ups specialize in the area of AI inferencing.\n\nThe importance of inferencing Before I go any further, I'll explain the importance of inferencing. It's the powering of the \"thinking\" AI models go through to do their job. So even after they're trained, they will need GPUs (or another similar tool) to fuel that process. The AI inferencing market, worth about $103 billion today, may reach $255 billion by 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights.\n\nStory continues\nNvidia has said repeatedly that inferencing is the next major area of growth in this AI boom and has specifically designed its latest architecture, Blackwell, for inferencing strength.\nBut Nvidia isn't stopping there, and instead made this exciting move: The company is acquiring inferencing technology from start-up Groq for $20 billion in cash, according to CNBC. This represents Nvidia's largest deal ever. CNBC reported that in an email to employees, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang said: \"We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the Nvidia AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads.\"\n\nNvidia's financial strength Nvidia, with $60 billion in cash as of the end of the latest quarter, has the financial strength for this deal and potentially others. And, importantly, it shows that Nvidia is ready to invest in the developments of smaller rivals to reinforce its own platform -- this, along with the company's own commitment to innovation, is a surefire way to stay ahead of the crowd.\n\nThe Groq deal is particularly attractive because it involves inferencing, an area that could supercharge Nvidia's growth in the years to come. And the addition of Groq executives to the Nvidia team should facilitate the integration of this new technology with Nvidia's. Groq's chief executive officer, the company president, and other executives will join Nvidia as part of the deal to \"help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" according to a Groq blog post.\nAll of this is great news for Nvidia investors as we head toward a new year -- and a new phase of AI growth driven by inferencing.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Holds $87k As Asia Rally Stalls, Wall Street Tech Slips A Nansen analyst says Bitcoin and Ethereum have traded sideways as year-end seasonality slows volumes rather than signaling a shift in market structure.\n\nShalini Nagarajan\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:28 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\n^NDX\n\n^GSPC\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nBitcoin held near $87,000 on Tuesday, setting a steady tone for crypto as Asian equities took a breather after a seven-day run and investors marked down US tech stocks into year-end.\nMSCI’s gauge of Asia Pacific shares slipped 0.1% in early trading, and S&#038;P 500 futures edged lower after the US benchmark fell 0.3% on Monday.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 dropped 0.5% in that session, with Tesla, Nvidia and Meta among the notable decliners.\nThe softer equity tape arrived alongside another bout of metal volatility. Silver and gold swung after a sharp pullback from fresh all-time highs, as traders booked profits and liquidity thinned after the holidays.\nCrypto traders kept describing the same theme, a market that keeps moving, then does it with less depth.\nMarket snapshot Bitcoin : $87,164, down 1.9%\nEther : $2,929, down 2.3%\nXRP: $1.85, down 2.2%\nTotal crypto market cap: $3.03 trillion, down 2.1%\nBitcoin And Ether Drift Sideways As Year-End Volumes Fade Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, said year-end trading has slowed and volumes have faded across major assets. “Bitcoin and Ethereum have both traded largely sideways over the past week, reflecting seasonal inactivity rather than a meaningful shift in market structure,” he said.\n“Activity has cooled across most chains, with a broad consolidation in active addresses, transactions, and fees generated over the past 30 days. Chains like Base saw notable pullbacks in DEX volumes following a very strong run earlier in the year. Solana remains the dominant venue for onchain trading by volume, even as user activity softened slightly over the week, with BNB Chain a distant second.”\n\n“Overall, trading activity hasn’t disappeared; it has simply slowed and become more selective as the year comes to a close.”\nProfit-Taking Hits Metals After New Highs Macro investors, meanwhile, stayed focused on the policy path. Investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes due later Tuesday, a release that often resets rate expectations when positioning runs crowded.\nThe bigger picture still shows a strong year for risk assets, despite the late-year wobbles. The MSCI All Country World Index has climbed about 21% in 2025, and a broad measure of Asian stocks has rallied almost 26%, according to market-wrap data.\n\nIn metals, the latest move showed how quickly crowded trades can unwind. Spot silver fell 4.8% on Monday after earlier hitting a record, and gold eased after setting its own peak on Friday, with profit-taking doing the heavy lifting.\nFor crypto, Bitcoin’s steadiness looked more like a positioning pause than a conviction push, with traders watching liquidity, flows and volatility pricing for the next move into the first week of 2026.\nRead original story Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Holds $87k As Asia Rally Stalls, Wall Street Tech Slips by Shalini Nagarajan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The chipmaker is currently up an astounding 23,020% over the last 10 years (as of Dec. 26).\nIf you've been thinking about starting or adding to a position in Nvidia, there's one great reason to do so before Feb. 25, 2026.\nNvidia's next earnings report is coming up Feb. 25 is when Nvidia will announce the financial results for the fourth quarter and its full 2026 fiscal year. The company's 2026 fiscal year ends on Jan. 31.\nNvidia's earnings reports have become more like victory laps. It has delivered 11 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, often in double- or triple-digit percentages. Most recently, its third-quarter revenue reached a record $57 billion, a 62% year-over-year increase. Fourth-quarter revenue expectations are $65 billion, which would mean sales of $213 billion on the year.\n\nTaking a long-term perspective, Nvidia is also set up for future earnings growth. It has a $500 billion order backlog through the end of 2026, and earlier this month, the Trump administration authorized Nvidia to begin selling its H200 chips in China.\nNvidia is on the expensive side, trading at 47 times trailing earnings and 41 times forward earnings expectations. However, its sales have consistently grown, and the company's GPUs remain in high demand with other AI companies.

Uh we're wrapping up 2025. You're looking at the Mag 7, Corey. And the divergences here are, they're interesting, Corey, they're noteworthy. and over the past year, Google, it's a rocket ship, we know this. Nvidia, strong. Amazon, not so much. And I'm curious what you make of that, Corey. What what you think investors are looking for? Is is it monetization, Corey, or investors looking for, okay, who controls the whole stack? Explain it for us. What do you think's going on?\n00:46 Corey\nI think the construct of the Mag 7 is a market phenomenon, not a business phenomenon. Which is to say you have very different businesses uh under the the the auspices of the Mag 7 that were gathered together because of kind of the size of the businesses in general, the size of the market caps of the companies, I should say. And and the direction of their stocks. And as those start to fall apart as they naturally those those correlations naturally will because they are in different businesses, the whole notion of a Mag 7 is going to look sillier and sillier over time.\n01:21 Speaker A\nLet me ask you about a name. I'm excited to get your take here. Nvidia. This deal with Grock, Corey. I've not I I I want to get the Cory take here to remind viewers. So licenses the AI technology for reportedly here 20 billion in cash. Key execs join Nvidia. What do you make of that deal, Corey? Was it a smart deal by Jensen Wong? And why did Jensen Wong decide, you know what, I'm going to structure this as licensing, not an acquisition?\n01:54 Corey\nRight, those are two important different questions. So let's talk about what they're doing first and why it's different and we can talk about this for days, except that we can't. But but let's let's see what we can do here. So uh the way that Grock chips are so different than Nvidia chips is the way they profit uh the way they process information. Specifically, uh there's a it's a phrase that's really hot in Silicon Valley right now, deterministic programming. So deterministic or processing, I should say. Deterministic sort of takes a big chunk of data and analyzes it all at once. So, if you were to ask the example that Grock likes to use, if you were to ask a large language model using, you know, if you were to ask chat GPT using Nvidia chips, what uh sentence uses all 26 words in the alphabet, and the answer might be the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Well, as you type that question in letter by letter, Nvidia's uh chips and and the chat GPT model is trying to figure it out letter by letter. W H A T S E N every what sentence? It's it's trying to determine what the next thing you're going to is and it can be kind of slow. Whereas a deterministic model, using a a Grock chip looks at the whole question, figures out the answer and dishes it out to you quickly. It's a different kind of processing that uses less high bandwidth memory, uses less processing power. The chip must be more powerful to do so, but program to do that. It's a very different approach. and as the as the the artificial intelligence world goes from building the models, training, to using the models, inference, the Grock chip is a different approach that might work better. Nvidia had reasons to be concerned that they were going to lose share on the marketplace over time because of this deterministic approach being more simple and more elegant and and cheaper to use over time. They're smart to get in there to try to uh make sure nobody else can take their lunch.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia officially invests $5B in Intel: What's next for the chip giant?\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST\n\nIn this video: NVDA\n\nINTC\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) completed its purchase of $5 billion worth of Intel ( INTC ) shares as part of an agreement announced in September . Yahoo Finance Reporter Laura Bratton discusses the news, recaps Intel's wild 202 5, and what might be in store for the chip giant in 2026.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nNvidia has officially taken its $5 billion stake in Intel, carrying out a transaction announced back in September. And for more on Intel's deals, let's welcome in Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Laura.\n00:09 Laura Bratton\nHow's it going?\n00:10 Speaker A\nVery good. Walk us through it.\n00:12 Laura Bratton\nYeah, so, um, Intel said in a regulatory filing today that over um last week, it had completed the sale of 5 billion worth of shares to Nvidia. Um it was a deal that was initially announced in September and really boosted confidence in Intel. Um, the two companies are co-developing CPUs for data center servers, um and also chips for personal computers. So, um really big deal for Intel to have kind of Nvidia behind it. Um, but notably it doesn't include Intel manufacturing and that's really what investors have been waiting to see um whether Intel's manufacturing business can turn around.\n00:46 Speaker A\nNow Nvidia, that wasn't the only deal Intel struck, right, this year? What else has changed for that chipmaker?\n00:54 Laura Bratton\nYeah, a lot has changed. They have a new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, um that really bolstered kind of investor confidence in Intel because of his wide-ranging industry connections. Um Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO had undergone like a really aggressive turnaround effort and it just cost a lot of money and the manufacturing business, which opened up to outside um customers has been losing a lot of money. Um, other things that happened, the US government really big, they invested in Intel, so did Softbank. Um, and the US government investment was was a really big deal because the thought is that, you know, now Intel might have sway over trade policy. The US government could potentially pressure some of the bigger companies to use Intel's manufacturing business.\n01:40 Speaker A\nSo, and by the way, this stock, I mean, as we we should mention, it's up about 80% this year. Uh it has been just a rocket ship. Uh most analysts, by the way, on on uh maybe not surprising after a move like that. I mean, look at that stock chart. Most analysts at this point are on the sidelines. But what's ahead for Intel? Like if I'm an investor in this name, Laura, what should I be looking for in 2026? What's on the radar?\n02:05 Laura Bratton\nYeah, so, um Intel's latest manufacturing process 18A was a really big milestone for the company. Um but they didn't really get the big external customers that investors are really looking for Intel to get in order to be like, hey, this business has really, you know, turned around. Um, so that instead is being kind of used for Intel's own chips, but now they need outside customers for their upcoming manufacturing processes, 18AP and 14A.\n02:37 Speaker A\nMhm. All right, Laura, thanks so much. Appreciate it.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) also fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) dipped around 0.3%.\n\nMeanwhile, volatility gripped the precious metals trade after a furious rally to all-time highs . Silver ( SI=F ) retreated, plummeting as much as 7% after rising above $80, while gold ( GC=F ) futures fell over 3%.\nStocks fell after ending a shortened Christmas trading week near all-time highs, with the S&P 500 and Dow setting records on Wednesday to start the \"Santa Claus rally\" period — the last five trading days of December and first two sessions in January.\n\nAll three major indexes look set to end a topsy-turvy 2025 with strong gains. The benchmark S&P is up over 17%, and the blue-chip Dow has climbed over 14%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has led gains, adding over 21% so far — even after briefly entering a bear market in April after the rollout of President Trump's most sweeping tariffs .\nIn another otherwise relatively sleepy week for economic releases, one bright spot came on Monday as data showed pending home sales in November jumped the most since early 2023 — a sign that homebuyer momentum is building. But the highlight of the week will likely come Tuesday with the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting earlier this month .\nThe minutes could add fresh insight for investors looking for clues on the Fed's next move in January, with the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 likely to continue into the new year . Around 80% of bets are on the Fed standing pat at current interest rate levels next month, though traders are more split on what the committee will do in March.\nLIVE 15 updates\n6 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nStocks slip as hopes of 'Santa Clause rally' fade Stocks pulled back on Monday as hopes of a \"Santa Claus\" rally during the last week of the year faced a setback.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) fell 0.5% as shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia ( NVDA ) fell 1% while EV maker Tesla ( TSLA ) dropped more than 3%.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) lost 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) also slipped 0.5%.\nCrude prices rose more than 2% while precious metals retreated from all-time highs.

A number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after the technology sector retreated in the intraday session as investors began to lock in profits following a historic rally that recently pushed the market to all-time highs.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq were under pressure as the dominant artificial intelligence trade cooled off.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock gained 3.7% on the news that investor optimism around artificial intelligence fueled broad market gains. Technology stocks with a focus on artificial intelligence once again led the market higher, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Companies at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, saw significant jumps in their share prices. The rally reflected a renewed belief among investors in the transformative potential of AI technology to drive future growth and productivity. The rally was further supported by a surprise cooling in the November consumer price index (CPI) report, which triggered market pricing for additional rate cuts in the coming year. This created a more favorable environment for growth-oriented software companies as borrowing costs decrease.\n\nAppLovin is up 104% since the beginning of the year, and at $697.54 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $733.60 from December 2025.

This news removed a significant legal uncertainty that had loomed over the company. Adding to the positive sentiment, the company reportedly began testing fully driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, without safety drivers, marking a major step toward commercial autonomous driving.

The Consumer Price Index, or CPI, is a key measure of inflation. This encouraging data was welcomed by investors, as sustained lower inflation could give the U.S. Federal Reserve more justification to lower interest rates in the coming year. Wall Street favors lower interest rates because they reduce borrowing costs for companies and can stimulate economic activity, making stocks more attractive. The positive news helped major indexes, including the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, snap a four-day losing streak.\nSkillz is down 15.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $4.51 per share, it is trading 50.4% below its 52-week high of $9.09 from August 2025.

      "Content": "Why anchoring 2026 portfolios in Big Tech and cybersecurity is the way to go\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWD\n\nGOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nANET\n\nThe next phase of the AI trade is more about growth and survival than simply chasing the most coveted names.\n\"I definitely wouldn't just bet on Nvidia,\" Adam Coons, chief investment officer at Winthrop Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. \"We kind of like to barbell this with something like the big hyperscaler, like an Alphabet Google, because that's really the type of name that you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because the AI story is just benefitting an already existing business model that was doing well.\"\nThe \"barbell\" strategy is born out of a growing skepticism toward \"one-trick ponies.\" In this case, Coons says it applies to companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), and Palantir ( PLTR ), which rely almost exclusively on the current AI hardware rush.\n\nWhile these names have led the market higher, their valuations have reached a point where \"margin of safety\" is effectively zero. In Coons's view, when a stock is priced to perfection, even a minor earnings miss can trigger a catastrophe.\n\"You need to position size,\" he said.\nBy anchoring a portfolio in \"behemoth hyperscalers\" like Alphabet ( GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ), investors get exposure to AI through companies with diversified cash flows. Such companies aren't just AI plays, but are advertising and software giants that use AI to optimize businesses that were already succeeding.\n\nIf the \"safe\" end of the barbell is Big Tech, the other side is \"growth,\" and it can be found in the infrastructure required to keep those systems running and secure.\n\"Down the chain, we like the things that overall the AI story will help prop up,\" Coons said. \"For us, it's cybersecurity [as it] becomes more and more important.\"\nHe added that Fortinet ( FTNT ) and CrowdStrike ( CRWD ) are among \"two of our top picks on the security side.\"\nAs AI advances, so does the risk for hacking, Coons noted. Cybersecurity isn't a discretionary expense, but a tax on the digital age that must be paid. Unlike the volatile demand for graphics processing units, the need for protection is more predictable.\nThe sector isn't without its risks, however. CrowdStrike faced a global IT outage in July 2024, caused by a faulty software update. It prompted the \"blue screens of death\" across 8.5 million machines, including airlines, hospitals, and banks.\n\nCoons says the final piece of the 2026 investor blueprint is disciplined position sizing. He suggests building a \"basket\" of smaller, high-conviction names — like Reddit ( RDDT ), which he views as a unique data play for AI training — but with the caveat of keeping those positions small.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to Coons, the average investor should steer clear of trying to find the next Nvidia. The low-hanging fruit has been picked, and winning 2026 is more about leaning into the giants that own the platforms and the specialists who protect the data.\nAdditionally, Chris Versace, chief investment officer at Tematica Research, sees Marvell Technology ( MRVL ) and Arista Networks ( ANET ) as the next logical steps in the AI revolution.\n\nVersace argues that the massive spending on data centers is creating a \"network congestion\" problem. As AI usage explodes, the connection between chips becomes the new bottleneck.\n\"It's the network connection that will be the big bottleneck that I think folks are missing,\" Versace notes, pointing to Marvel because of its dominance in optical and networking hardware.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "AI chipmakers that could steal some of Nvidia's spotlight in 2026\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Jared Blikre\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:30 AM PST\n\nIn this video: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nARM\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) announced a deal to acquire AI hardware and software designer Groq ( GROQ.PVT ) for $20 billion last week. While the semiconductor manufacturer remained a major AI player in 2025, who could be some of Nvida's biggest competition in the fast-approaching 2026?\nTECHnalysis Research, LLC President Bob O'Donnell sits down with Yahoo Finance markets and data editor Jared Blikre on Market Catalysts to discuss which chipmaker could gain more prominence next year.\nAlso catch Bob O'Donnell's predictions for agentic AI in 2026 as it relates to cybersecurity usage.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Jared\nAnd another thing people have been uh some of the critics have been pouuncing on is all the spending, the capital expenditures, so-called CAPEX. Uh we saw that it's been exploding over the last few years. It's set to continue next year. But uh we've seen in the Mag 5, for instance, we used to kind of talk about them or the Mag 7 uh as a whole. It's really only Alphabet and Nvidia, maybe Tesla as a come behind story that have really surged this year. So is it a game of have and have nots or how do you see this playing out?\n00:32 Bob\nNo, it's a great question. I mean, look, I think Nvidia obviously continues to do well, but I also am certain that Nvidia is going to heck get a heck of a lot more competition in 2026. AMD is, you know, an obvious one, but there's a lot of other little players. I mean, you know, Nvidia's uh deal with Grock recently to bring more of their technology in is a reflection of the fact that we're seeing more specialized types of models being developed. We're we're going from the days of big general purpose LLMs that you can use for everything to much more specialized areas. And each of those are going to require different types of hardware and I think in turn that's going to create additional opportunities, but it's going to create more diversity, which is going to be a little harder to figure out. But obviously I think, you know, you're going to continue to see folks like Nvidia and AMD do well. I do, as I said, I think you're going to start to see uh some of the smaller the cloud guys who are doing custom chips often through Broadcom will also start to benefit. We've seen already, you know, Google's been doing more with TPUs, uh Amazon has their Graviton chips. Um, we've got a a bunch of other companies. Microsoft is doing custom chips. A lot of these are arm-based. So arm is another company, you know, we haven't been talking about them a lot lately, but arm's helping drive some of this innovation. Intel, as you've talked about, you know, is doing well. They continue to plug away. Obviously, they had their challenges last year, but things are looking better in 2026. So, I think we're going to see a lot of different players uh from different areas uh all start to come together. And we'll see some smaller companies. Uh there's a little company called SiTime that does uh timing chips and all these networks have to be completely aligned from a timing perspective. They're doing some interesting stuff. So, I think there's a lot of different opportunities in different areas. Um but we're going to have a lot of the bears on the side just again, waiting to pounce on these oper these concerns that get raised, I think around a gentic AI.\n02:29 Jared\nAnd we'll have to see if those are dips worth buying or not. And Bob, what I'm realizing is we got to do another podcast real soon. So thank you for showing up.\n02:39 Bob\nYeah, man, I'd love to.\n02:40 Jared\nIt was great seeing you here.\n02:41 Bob\nThanks, Jared.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The company has a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion as I write this, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a 21% return over the next year if it does cross the $3 trillion milestone.\nRead on, and let's consider Amazon's growth prospects in the year ahead.\nAll eyes on Amazon Web Services Amazon's potential pathway to the $3 trillion club next year starts with its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It used to be a place where businesses would simply store data and host their critical digital applications, but it has evolved to become the center of Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAWS operates state-of-the-art data centers and it rents the computing capacity to AI developers who don't have the financial resources to build their own infrastructure. These data centers are filled with advanced AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia , but Amazon also designed its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium. Top developers like Anthropic are using hundreds of thousands of the latest Trainium2 chips, which offer up to 40% better price performance than competing hardware when training AI models.\nThen there is the AWS Bedrock platform, where businesses can access hundreds of completed AI models from third-parties including Anthropic and Meta Platforms . Developing models from scratch is time consuming and expensive, so using a ready-made solution can help businesses achieve their AI goals much faster.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), which was up 20% year over year. That was the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, which highlights the platform's incredible AI-driven momentum. But it gets better, because AWS has a whopping $200 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online, so the strong top-line results are likely to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's earnings continue to crush Wall Street's estimates The $33 billion in third-quarter revenue that AWS brought in accounted for just 18% of Amazon's total revenue of $180 billion. However, the cloud business is the company's most profitable by far, contributing 65% of its total operating income. E-commerce is actually Amazon's largest source of revenue, but its profit margins are very thin because its Amazon.com site focuses on selling a high volume of products at low prices.\n\nHowever, Amazon is pushing to improve profitability in its e-commerce business by boosting efficiency and implementing new technologies. In 2023, it broke its U.S. logistics network into eight distinct regions, so now the products in each fulfillment center are specific to their geographic region. As a result, orders travel shorter distances to reach customers, which brings down packing and shipping costs.\nAmazon also uses AI-powered software like Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers, which uses computer vision to identify defective products before they ship. This reduces returns and refunds, creating further cost savings.\nThe accelerating growth at AWS combined with improved efficiency in the e-commerce business is driving a huge increase in Amazon's overall profit. The company generated earnings of $5.22 per share during the first three quarters of 2025, which was a whopping 42% jump from the same period in 2024. Plus, Amazon's earnings have beaten Wall Street's consensus estimates in every single quarter of 2025, by an average of 22%.\n\nHow Amazon can cross the $3 trillion milestone in 2026 Amazon stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.8 as I write this. That's roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so Amazon stock is basically sitting at fair value relative to its peers in the tech sector.\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate earnings of $7.86 per share in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6.\nAssuming Wall Street is right, Amazon stock would have to climb by 11% next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 32.8, lifting its market cap to $2.75 trillion. But remember, the company has a habit of beating Wall Street's expectations.\nIf its 2026 earnings beat the consensus estimate by 22% like they have so far in 2025, then its stock could be poised for a 35% gain next year instead. That would catapult its market value to a whopping $3.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, even an earnings beat of just 9% next year would be enough to see Amazon join the $3 trillion club. Given the incredible momentum across its e-commerce business and AWS, I think that's an achievable target.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

In 2025, that changed.\nAMD stock took off handsomely ( up 78% year-to-date ), as Mr. Market stopped calling it “the alternative.”\nThe tech giant landed major AI deals in proving its mettle as more than just a CPU turnaround story.\n\nDespite Nvidia’s dominance in the AI chip space, the narrative has shifted to how much market share AMD can realistically capture.\nThat matters a great deal because breakthrough years, such as 2025, raise expectations much more quickly than earnings can keep pace.\nNevertheless, AMD enters 2026 with solid momentum, real long-term customers, and a fast-growing AI revenue base, but also with a stock price that reflects plenty of that optimism.\nHence, 2026 might not just be a victory lap but a proving ground.\nAMD proved it can compete in AI 2025 was clearly the year when AMD began to land real wins in the AI space.\nThe turning point came in October, when AMD announced marquee AI partnerships with the likes of OpenAI and Oracle, sending its stock up 34% in a single day , according to Reuters .\nRelated: CoreWeave CEO delivers blunt 5-word take on AI debate\n\nOpenAI selected AMD as its go-to GPU supplier , looking to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct accelerators for its next-generation AI infrastructure plans.\nOracle followed suit by showing off its first public AI supercluster built around AMD’s new Helios rack design , covering 50,000 MI450 GPUs slated for release in Q3 2026.\nHere are some of AMD's biggest deals in 2025: OpenAI : Multiyear deal to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs; the first 1 gigawatt of MI450 is expected for deployment in the second half of 2026.\nOracle : Expanded partnership; Oracle plans a publicly available AI supercluster with 50,000 MI450 GPUs starting Q3 2026.\nDOE/ORNL : $1 billion partnership with ORNL, HPE , and Oracle Cloud to build Lux and Discovery supercomputers.\nSanmina : Agreement up to $3 billion to buy ZT Systems manufacturing .\nCisco + G42 : UAE secure AI cluster built and secured by Cisco for G42, featuring Instinct MI350X GPUs.\n\nMoreover, CEO Lisa Su outlined a solid path to double-digit AI share , spearheaded by MI300 chips, which are forecasted to generate over $2 billion in sales and memory advantages favoring large AI models.\nThe financial proof behind AMD’s AI push The bull case for AMD is now clearly showing up in the numbers.\nEarnings snapshot over the past four quarters:\nFQ3 2025 (Sept. 2025): EPS 1.20 , beat by 0.03 ; revenue 9.25 billion , up 35.59% year over year , beat by 487.48 million.\nFQ2 2025 (June 2025): EPS 0.48 , in line; revenue 7.69 billion , up 31.71% year over year , beat by 255.65 million.\nFQ1 2025 (March 2025): EPS 0.96 , beat by 0.03 ; revenue 7.44 billion , up 35.90% year over year , beat by 318.31 million.\nFQ4 2024 (Dec. 2024): EPS 1.09 , in line; revenue 7.66 billion , up 24.16% year over year , beat by 132.12 million.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD’s stellar results were capped off by a standout Q3 2025 .\nRevenue hit a record $9.25 billion , up 36% year over year , Investing.com reported , as GAAP net income surged 61% to $1.24 billion .\nAt the same time, margins moved higher, as AMD’s gross margins skyrocketed 52% , up from 50% a year earlier, while its operating income climbed another 75% year over year .\n\nOn top of that, AMD generated record free cash flow , underscoring how growth is translating into cash.\nGrowth was broad-based:\nData Center: Revenue reached $4.3 billion , up 22% year over year , led by stellar demand for EPYC server CPUs and Instinct MI250 and MI300 accelerators (despite the $1.5 billion revenue headwind linked to China).\nClient and Gaming: Combined sales skyrocketed to $4 billion , up 73% year over year . PC sales reached a record $2.8 billion (up 46%), while gaming revenue was up a whopping 181% to $1.3 billion.\nEmbedded: Revenue dropped 8% year over year to $857 million , a modest drag linked to tougher comparisons following the Xilinx acquisition.\nFor perspective, AI-related products accounted for roughly 21% of AMD’s total sales, pushing expected full-year 2025 sales around $33 billion mark .\n\nGuidance shows momentum isn’t slowing In addition to that, AMD guided Q4 2025 sales to be at $9.6 billion (±$300 million), with the midpoint implying a sizeable 25% increase year over year.\nAdditionally, AMD’s management guided for non-GAAP gross margin to be at around 54.5% and operational expenses near $2.8 billion.\nOn the call, CEO Lisa Su said demand looks remarkably durable heading into next year.\n\nWhere AMD stock could trade in 2026 Wall Street is optimistic about AMD heading into 2026.\nThe bulls see substantial upside if execution holds up. On the other hand, skeptics view a stock that’s already pricing in a lot of good news.\nHere’s how the big firms are lining up:\nGoldman Sachs — $210 (Neutral): Goldman is still cautious, warning that AMD’s outlook is linked to flawless execution of its big AI deals and margin expansion, leaving virtually little room for error.\nBank of America — $300 (Buy): BofA expects AMD to effectively capture a double-digit share of a trillion-dollar AI market by 2030.\nHSBC — $310 (Buy): HSBC points to AMD’s incredible OpenAI win and expects a significant ramp-up in earnings growth as those deals scale.\nWells Fargo — $345 (Overweight): Perhaps the Street’s most bullish calls, spearheaded by healthy data-center momentum and AI product traction.\nMelius Research — $380 (Buy): The most aggressive target, which assumes AMD securing 10%+ AI chip share while sustaining its top- and bottom-line growth numbers.\nAcross roughly 51 analysts in the past three months, AMD stock’s consensus 12-month target sits near $282.82 (32% upside from current levels), underscoring superb confidence.\n\nAMD’s 2026 test: big AI upside, bigger expectations Heading into 2026, AMD’s not exactly easing into the hotly competitive AI race.\nAt its late-2025 Analyst Day , the management laid out some remarkably aggressive goals:\nRevenue growth: Targets 35%+ compound annual revenue growth over the next several years.\nData center engine: Expects 60%+ annual growth in data-center sales as the key driver.\nAI kicker: Projects 80%+ annual growth in AI revenue , implying a growing mix shift toward AI.\n\nMoreover, AMD will be rolling out its MI450 AI accelerators and Helios rack-scale systems in the back half of 2026, with early deployments linked to OpenAI and Oracle .\nWhether it can result in repeatable share gains remains a significant question mark.\nThat’s exactly why Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon framed it as follows, according to Reuters .\nThe risks are real.\nNvidia still commands 80-90% of AI accelerators ; this, along with a misstep in AMD’s ROCm ecosystem, may slow adoption.\nExecution matters too, with delays in MI450 production, customer concentration around OpenAI, or tighter export controls impacting results. Throw in a rich valuation at over 54 times 2026 earnings , and the upcoming year becomes a not-so-simple test.\nRelated: Cathie Wood drops $1.3 million on healthcare stock\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 29, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Title": "Why the electrical grid needs more software",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-electrical-grid-needs-more-170000737.html",
      "Content": "Why the electrical grid needs more software\n\nTim De Chant\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 9:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nOne of the nicest comments people have made about the electrical grid was … nothing. The grid works best when it fades into the background.\nThat low-profile status has changed in recent years as fires in California and freezes in Texas raised awareness of the electrical grid. But it was in 2025, when the electrical grid — and concerns about demand, supply, pricing, and the strain on natural resources — moved into the spotlight. And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch.\n\nElectricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including repurposing supersonic jet engines for data center duty and working on beaming solar power down from space .\nAnd that pace of growth isn’t expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is projected to nearly triple in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled consumer frustration around pricing and drawn the ire of environmental groups that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load — the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.\n\nThis confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.\nFor example, startups like Gridcare and Yottar argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.\nGridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amidst the data center boom.\nSeveral other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it’s needed most.\n\nBase Power, for example, is building one in Texas by leasing batteries to homeowners at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn’t sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.\n\nStory Continues\nOther startups including Texture, Uplight, and Camus are developing software layers to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.\nThere’s also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid.\n\nNvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to develop industry-specific models in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is working with the grid operator PJM to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.\nThese changes won’t happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold.\nUtilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they’re also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it’s costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability.\nSoftware, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction.\nAnd that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power.

Nvidia didn't even put out an SEC filing on this one. I go figure. It also hasn't said anything publicly about this deal. The only one who has had something to say is the likely much wealthier Grock founder Jonathan Ross. Ross pointed out his LinkedIn over the weekend. Clearly he's jazzed about this. He will be joining Nvidia as chief software architect. Big role for Jonathan there, for sure.\n00:46 Speaker A\nWhile this deal gets digested by Nvidia investors are also wondering how any slip ups by the company in 2026 will be received and what is the outlook more broadly for large cap tech stocks after another strong year in 2025. Chris Versachi is Tomoco Research's chief investment officer. Chris, uh got to get your thoughts on Nvidia. I I find it funny. You and I are I think fundamental analysis uh at heart. and I am just I'm surprised there was no filing on this deal. You spent $20 billion and you don't even get a filing.\n01:26 Speaker B\nBiggest acquisition they've ever done, Brian, no filing and they sneak it through on Christmas Eve. Uh, you know, I I agree with you. It's a bit of a head scratcher especially when you take a look at the multiple that they're that they're, you know, seem to be paying. but we've seen other big multiples of late. Service now picking up Armus, you know, 7.75 billion on 340 billion in revenue.\n01:59 Speaker B\nAnd you know, I I think this is a a larger trend that we've seen really over the last year, Brian, where these large cap companies are flexing their balance sheets, filling in technical gaps or holes, um kind of as a competitive move so they can compete on a greater scale in 2026.\n02:16 Speaker A\nChris, I remember being in the streets offices when I worked there and you may have been there too as well. I think 2017 and and the street founder Jim Cramer always would come in very bullish on the video. It's one of the first people that I know championing a bull case on Nvidia and his case was Nvidia essentially dominates the chip market. At the time they were doing gaming, but now they're also of course the main leader in AI. Do you think this acquisition signals that they are concerned that Grock was working on something\n02:50 Speaker A\nthat they didn't have in their pipeline.\n02:54 Speaker B\nSo, I I think it's more of an effort of them to shore up their their inference, uh strength, Brian. You know, again, taking a very strong competitive position, extending it further as we move deeper into AI, moving past, you know, simple training in into figuring out what is next, making their models that much sharper. And I think we're going to see more of this. You you know as well as I that there there's never, you know, one company making a sole move.\n03:32 Speaker B\nThere's always the what what we like to call the competitive response. So, what is AMD going to do? What is, you know, Avago or sorry, Broadcom going to do? What is Marvel going to do and others. And I I think, you know, if you step back too on this, it's another signal that we're likely to see the M&A strength we saw in, you know, the current quarter continue into the new year. and if you're a shareholder of, you know, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, you're going to feel pretty good about that.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia finalizes its roughly 4%, $5 billion stake in Intel\n\nShannon Carroll\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nIntel just cashed Nvidia’s $5 billion check . Intel says it completed the share sale to Nvidia on Dec. 26 after regulatory clearance earlier this month, turning a September announcement into settled cash and issued shares — and making Nvidia’s roughly 4% stake in Intel official.\nNvidia bought 214,776,632 shares at $23.28 apiece in a private placement, a round-number infusion that landed on Intel’s balance sheet like a vote of confidence and on its reputation like a defibrillator. For months, the deal lived in that corporate purgatory where everyone speaks in the future tense and the market politely pretends it can’t hear the lawyers. Now, the cash is in — and the shares exist.\n\nNvidia was off about 1.7% in early morning trading, and Intel was relatively flat (up just over 1%). That’s what happens when a headline becomes a filing. Intel got the money. Now: It has to make the partnership feel like hardware, not hope.\nIt’s a private placement, not a public-market nibble, and Intel’s earlier filing emphasized Nvidia wasn’t getting special governance or information rights beyond what shareholders already get. The deal was conditioned on the regulatory process, and the FTC’s early-termination notice for the transaction is dated Dec. 18.\n“AI is driving a reinvention of every layer of the computing stack,” Huang said back in September at a press conference to discuss the news, which he called a “historic partnership” and a “great business opportunity” for both companies. Huang said the three architecture teams — working across the CPU architecture, as well as product lines for servers and PCs — have been developing this “fairly extensive” architecture for over a year. He added, “Today, we’re taking the next great step.”\n\nYou could feel how unthinkable this pairing once was by the way the Street talked about it. “This is truly like the Yankees and the Red Sox coming together to end their rivalry — the companies did not like each other whatsoever,” David Wagner, head of equity and a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote at the time. “[Using Intel’s fabs to make chips is] a massive step in the right direction for U.S. chip designers and breathes new life into a poorly run company for decades.”\nThis partnership didn’t happen in a vacuum. Earlier this fall, the federal government took the rare step of engineering a roughly 10% equity stake in Intel , converting lectures about industrial policy into a live experiment with an actual balance sheet. The politics were loud, the stakes louder, and the message unmistakable: In President Donald Trump’s America’s AI playbook — a CEO-style , results-first posture toward national champions — Intel is the corporate vessel for “made here” ambition. But Intel didn’t just need capital. It also needed a partner.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Intel-Nvidia partnership pitch stays the same, and the omissions stay just as loud. Intel and Nvidia have said they’ll co-develop multiple generations of products for data centers and PCs, including Nvidia-custom x86 CPUs meant to slot into Nvidia’s AI infrastructure and PC system-on-chips that combine Intel CPU cores with Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets, stitched together with NVLink. Missing, deliberately, is any promise that Nvidia’s crown-jewel GPUs will move off TSMC or that Intel will suddenly become the default factory for Nvidia’s most important silicon. The deal reads like influence and distribution, not a manufacturing surrender. A big check, not a merger.\n\nFor Intel, that’s still a win. It gets cash plus the kind of association that turns a long-suffering turnaround narrative into something procurement teams can cite without blushing. For Nvidia, this is a smoother path into the x86 universe without asking enterprises to torch their software estates — and a convenient way to look less like a solitary superpower while regulators and politicians keep peering at the AI stack like it’s critical infrastructure.\nNvidia’s check has cleared — now, Intel’s story has to.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Shares of nutrition products company Bellring Brands (NYSE:BRBR) fell 10.5% in the morning session after analysts highlighted a murky near-term outlook and rising volatility expected for the company.\nThe shifting views prompted a wave of revised forecasts, adding to the uncertainty around BellRing's performance. This cautious stance from Wall Street helped drive the sharp selloff.\n\nContributing to the weakness, major indices pulled back from record highs reached the previous week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were under pressure in the morning as the dominant artificial intelligence trade cools off. Market leaders like Nvidia and AMD saw significant losses as traders locked in profits following a banner year where the Nasdaq surged over 21%. With the S&P 500 recently hitting intraday highs near 6,945, this dip reflected a shift in internal momentum rather than a response to major economic news.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunties to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy BellRing Brands? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us BellRing Brands’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for BellRing Brands and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago when the stock gained 2.5% on the news that investors flocked to defensive sectors, including consumer staples, amidst the broader tech sell-off.\n\nAs capital fled high-beta AI and tech names (like Broadcom and Oracle) due to margin concerns, investors reallocated into cash-generative, defensive growth stocks. Adding to the momentum, the company's recently authorized $600 million share repurchase program raised market optimism, signaling management's confidence in the stock's value.\nBellRing Brands is down 63.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $26.96 per share, it is trading 66% below its 52-week high of $79.39 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of BellRing Brands’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,143.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

I'm just going to bet on them again next year.\n00:15 Adam\nYeah, I definitely wouldn't uh just bet on Nvidia. I I think you do need to do your homework if you want to buy specific names. I think probably the general investor is probably better finding some sort of basket to kind of play the overall space. Uh but we're very early innings in this and\n00:41 Adam\nobviously Nvidia is the winner right now, but uh to say, you know, in five years that we look back that they're going to be the dominant player still, very, very unlikely. Like I said, this is really an evolving space. So I I would be careful with something that's so specific as Nvidia. Uh we kind of like to barbell this with, you know, something like the the big hyperscaler like a like an Alphabet Google, uh because that's really the type of name that uh you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because they just\n01:14 Adam\noverall, the AI story is just benefiting an already existing business model that was doing well. So, I think you would just want to be careful with what we're calling kind of the one trick ponies, like a Nvidia, uh a Core Weve or a Patier right now.\n01:31 Speaker A\nUh, Brooke, let me get over to you because I think what you're seeing in industrial metals and some of the things that Adam's talking about fits nicely with what we heard from Ed Yardini this morning that he might see it is likely to see we are likely to see a broadening out in this rally. Investors doing their homework, trying to get outside of the tried and true Mag 7.\n01:53 Brooke\nYeah, Brian, what we did hear from Ed Danny over the weekend was really ongoing momentum in this market in 2026. He maintained that year end target for the S&P 500 of 7,700 and he said largely it won't be really led by uh the Mag 7, but also what he called the impressive 493 of the S&P 500 as really this broadening out, this boost in productivity growth really leads to overall returns for the\n02:26 Brooke\nS&P 500 in 2026. Specifically, you know, he went on to say that that is really where exactly investors should be thinking about this mindset. You know, not really overweight technology, but more so thinking about the other users of AI as opposed to just the producers of AI. And so certainly he's not alone in this uh momentum that he thinks will exist within 2026 ongoing from what we've seen so far in the returns in 2025.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Market participants returning from the holiday break were greeted by a landscape of high volatility, as record-setting gains in gold and silver were pared back amid profit-taking and shifting geopolitical signals.\n\nThe S&P/TSX 60 Futures edged lower on Monday morning, trading down 0.14% at 1,875.7 CAD. The subtle decline follows a holiday-shortened session last week where the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite settled at 31,999.76, down 0.2%.\nThin liquidity characterized the Toronto market as institutions finalized year-end portfolios. While the TSX is on track for its best annual performance in years, up nearly 30%, the retreat in mining heavyweights could limit the index’s ability to punch through new highs before the 2026 turnover.\nU.S. Stock Futures Slip Across the border, Wall Street futures signaled a cautious open after the S&P 500 touched fresh record intraday highs on Friday.\nNasdaq 100 Futures: Fell 0.6% as AI leaders like Nvidia and Oracle saw premarket pressure.\nS&P 500 Futures: Slid 0.4%, hovering near 6,952 points.\nDow Jones Futures: Remained slightly down, set for a loss of 0.2% at open.\n\nGold and Metals Reversal The most dramatic action occurred in the commodities pits. Precious metals, which have been the stars of 2025, saw a sharp \"flush out\" as traders locked in gains following the Christmas break.\nThe broader metals complex faced a coordinated sell-off in early Monday trading. Gold Futures for February delivery dropped 2.93% to trade at $4,419.50, while Silver Futures for March plunged a significant 6.77% to $71.97 after failing to hold its overnight record of $83.99. Copper Futures followed the downward trend, slipping 2.10% to $5.71 per pound as the recent rally in industrial metals took a breather.\n\nOil Gains on Geopolitical Friction In contrast to the selling in metals, energy markets found a floor. Crude Oil WTI Futures climbed 2.28% to $58.04, while Brent Crude rose 2.1% to $61.47.\nThe \"tug of war\" in oil remains between:\nDe-escalation Hopes: Progress in Ukraine peace talks between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, with 90% of a peace plan reportedly agreed upon.\nSupply Risks: Intensified U.S. naval activity near Venezuela and ongoing tensions in the Middle East.\n\nLooking Ahead Investors will pivot their attention to release of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes, seeking clarity on whether the central bank will accelerate rate cuts in early 2026. For the TSX, the focus remains on whether energy resilience can offset the sudden cooling in the mining sector.\n\nStory Continues\nRelated articles\nTSX futures drift as commodities retreat from record territory\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\nGold: $4K Breakout Faces First Real Test as Stocks and Sentiment Rise Together\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "SoftBank to Pay $4 Billion for Data Center Firm DigitalBridge\n\nRyan Gould and Josh Sisco\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:41 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SFTBF\n\nDBRG\n\nORCL\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\n(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. agreed to acquire private equity firm DigitalBridge Group Inc. in a deal valuing the data center investor at $4 billion including debt.\nThe Japanese conglomerate will pay $16 per share in cash for New York-listed DigitalBridge, the companies said in statement Monday, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg News. The acquisition is part of SoftBank’s push to invest in the digital infrastructure fueling the artificial intelligence boom.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nSoftBank’s billionaire founder, Masayoshi Son, aims to capitalize on soaring demand for digital infrastructure, driven by the AI boom. The past year has seen a wave of multibillion-dollar deals in the space, largely focused on data centers and the computing power necessary to build and power the technology.\n\nThe need for capacity has fueled massive transactions, including BlackRock Inc.’s $40 billion purchase of Aligned Data Centers and Oracle Corp.’s agreement to supply OpenAI with about 4.5 gigawatts of computing power worth as much as $300 billion.\nDigitalBridge is one of the biggest investment firms focused on digital infrastructure, with about $108 billion of assets under management at the end of September, according to its website.\nDigitalBridge shares jumped 9.7% to $15.28 at 9:33 a.m. in New York, trading slightly below the sale price. The deal represents a 15% premium to DigitalBridge’s closing share price on Dec. 26, the companies said.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, pending regulatory approvals.\nShares of DigitalBridge rose 45% on Dec. 5, when Bloomberg first reported the talks to take the company private. It had a market value of about $2.5 billion and an enterprise value of $3.8 billion including debt as of Friday’s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe deal will bring to SoftBank relationships with more investors keen to deploy money in the data center industry. DigitalBridge is led by Chief Executive Officer Marc Ganzi and its portfolio includes digital infrastructure operators such as AIMS, AtlasEdge, DataBank, Switch Inc., Vantage Data Centers and Yondr Group.\nSoftBank has separately been discussing a potential acquisition of Switch, a data center operator backed by investors including DigitalBridge, Bloomberg News reported earlier in December. Switch’s owners have sought a valuation of around $50 billion including debt in a deal, people with knowledge of the matter have said.\nWhile SoftBank’s most famous bets include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Arm Holdings Plc and WeWork, it has previously done deals in the asset management space. In 2017, it acquired Fortress Investment Group for more than $3 billion. It later sold its stake to a group including Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co. and Fortress management in a deal completed in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\nIn January, SoftBank announced the $500 billion Stargate project, alongside OpenAI, Oracle and Abu Dhabi’s MGX, to build data centers in the US. While Son pledged to deploy $100 billion “immediately,” the rollout of Stargate has been slower than planned, in part because of disagreements over where the data centers should be located.\n\nSoftBank initially sought project financing from outside investors including insurance companies, pension funds and investment funds. Some of the conversations dragged due to market volatility, uncertainty around US trade policy and questions about the financial valuations of AI hardware, Bloomberg News reported in May.\nSoftBank’s newest investment push has meant moving some funds around to free up capital. Son this month said he “was crying” over his need to sell a $5.8 billion Nvidia Corp. stake to reallocate the money to other AI spending.\n(Updates with Monday trading in the sixth paragraph.

Kyiv and Moscow also have yet to make progress on the issue of concessions over land captured by Russia during the conflict.\nSanctions from the US Treasury Department seeking to curtail Russia's ability to sell its oil internationally are likely to remain in place until a peace agreement is reached. The sanctions are likely keeping several hundred thousand barrels of oil off the market, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, even as Russia continues to find buyers in China and India willing to take Russian barrels at a steep discount.\nAt the same time, a monthly decline in output reported by Kazakhstan and escalating rhetoric from Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have put upward pressure on prices from the Middle East.\nKazakhstan's massive Tengiz oilfield, where Chevron ( CVX ) serves as the lead operator, led a decline of 6% in monthly output in December after attacks by Ukrainian drones damaged a Russian export terminal on the Black Sea, according to Reuters.\nProduction also fell in the Tengiz field in December, according to Reuters, even as Chevron has spent the year working on a nearly $50 billion effort to increase production in the field by roughly 1 million barrels per day.\nOil is headed for its fifth straight monthly decline as December comes to a close.\n\n34 mins ago Laura Bratton\n\nStocks slip at the open US stocks pulled back at the market open on Monday, dampening hopes for a so-called \"Santa Claus\" rally — the historic upturn in stocks during the last five trading days of December and first two sessions in January.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) led declines at the open of Monday's session, falling 0.7%, as Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) dropped more than 2%.

Political shifts, leverage and crowded positioning powered sharp rallies across assets, only to reverse when sentiment cracked or liquidity thinned. Crypto trades tied to Donald Trumps return to the White House briefly surged before fading, with Trump-linked tokens and American Bitcoin sliding sharply from their peaks, while Bitcoin itself fell from its October high and is on track for an annual loss. In equities, skepticism crept into the AI boom after Michael Burry ( Trades , Portfolio )s Scion Asset Management disclosed deep out-of-the-money put options on Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Palantir Technologies ( NASDAQ:PLTR ), a filing that jolted markets even as questions lingered over the trades structure and duration.\n\nIs PLTR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nElsewhere, geopolitics and macro stress rewired capital flows. European defense shares rallied as governments boosted military spending, pushing a Bloomberg basket of the sector up more than 70% for the year through Dec. 23 and reshaping ESG playbooks. Gold climbed to repeated records amid talk of a debasement trade, even as Treasuries moved toward their best year since 2020 and the dollar steadied, underscoring how fiscal fears and demand for safety can coexist. Japans bond market flipped a long-standing script, with yields surging past multi-decade levels and turning the once-notorious widowmaker trade into a profitable short, while South Koreas equity market jumped more than 70% as foreign investors piled in, even as local retail money flowed out and pressured the won.\n\nCredit and balance-sheet trades delivered some of the years most pointed lessons. Jim Chanos ( Trades , Portfolio )s short of Strategy Inc. ( NASDAQ:MSTR ) against a long Bitcoin position paid off as the companys premium to its crypto holdings shrank, while aggressive creditor-on-creditor tactics around Envision Healthcare generated sizable gains for select funds after Amsurg sold to Ascension Health for $4 billion. At the same time, speculative fervor lifted Fannie Mae ( FNMA ) and Freddie Mac ( FMCC ) shares on privatization hopes following Trumps re-election, before skepticism resurfaced over timing and feasibility. From Turkeys carry trade collapse after sudden political unrest to a string of smaller corporate credit failures that prompted JPMorgans Jamie Dimon to warn of more cockroaches, 2025 left investors heading into 2026 mindful that powerful narratives can carry prices far but not indefinitely.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This is a paid press release. Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nThe AI Data Center Boom Goes Public: From “Neoclouds” to Power, Cooling, and the Grid\n\nMicrocaps\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nWestlake Village, Dec. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Microcaps.com curates and contextualizes news, analysis, and market data across the public micro- and small-cap ecosystem, with a focus on emerging growth themes shaping investor sentiment. As AI infrastructure spending accelerates and capital flows increasingly target data centers, GPU clouds, and adjacent platforms, Microcaps is examining how these developments are being reflected in public-market valuations, from established leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) to newer, infrastructure-adjacent entrants gaining investor attention.\n\nThe artificial intelligence data center industry has quickly evolved from a niche buildout into one of the most capital-intensive sectors in technology. What began as a race to secure GPUs has turned into a broader competition for energy capacity, cooling systems, high-speed interconnection, real estate, and long-term power contracts. Increasingly, this transformation is moving into public markets, where investors are looking to the physical infrastructure enabling AI as the next frontier of opportunity.\n\nWhy AI data centers are different\nAI-focused data centers are fundamentally different from traditional enterprise facilities. These environments are devised to handle macro model training and inference, requiring accelerators, high rack power density, liquid or advanced cooling, and low-latency networking. According to McKinsey & Co., global investment in AI-ready data centers could reach $5.2 trillion by 2030, reflecting the scale and intensity of demand ( McKinsey ).\n\nThese technical requirements are driving new partnerships, facility types, and capital strategies as AI shifts from experimental to operational at scale.\n\nThe role of GPU supply\nAI infrastructure is often defined by access to high-performance compute, especially graphics processing units. Nvidia, one of the most prominent suppliers of GPUs, plays a central role in powering many of the world’s largest AI compute clusters ( Wikipedia ). Though hardware companies are key players, the larger story involves how power, physical capacity and integration models affect the scale and resilience of AI deployments—particularly as some operators explore hybrid approaches that blend owned infrastructure with third-party and network-based GPU capacity.\n\nValuation multiples and public market signals\n\nInvestor expectations are increasingly reflected in valuation multiples. In both public and private markets, companies exposed to AI infrastructure have seen enterprise value-to-revenue ratios in the 20-to-30-times range, particularly where growth visibility is high ( Aventis Advisors ). By contrast, the average price-to-sales ratio for S&P 500 companies remains around 2.8 times revenue ( Eqvista ).\n\nStory Continues\nThese valuation differences underscore the market’s confidence in the long-term value of infrastructure that enables AI, even when it’s capital-intensive or early in monetization.\n\nAI infrastructure and data centers\nGPU-focused cloud providers have emerged to serve training and inference workloads at scale. Some of these companies have attracted significant attention for their capital efficiency and growth rates. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, such platforms have traded at revenue multiples as high as 13 times, reflecting investor appetite for scalable infrastructure models ( Wall Street Journal ).\n\nData center operators with experience in large-scale buildouts have also benefited. Oliver Wyman notes that infrastructure specialists often trade at 20-to-30-times EBITDA, given the strength of long-term leases and strategic real estate positioning ( Oliver Wyman ).\n\nInfrastructure-adjacent valuations\nSupporting infrastructure providers—including power delivery, thermal systems and high-performance fiber—are increasingly recognized as critical to AI expansion. These companies, while not compute providers themselves, have traded at revenue multiples of 20 or more during periods of elevated interest ( Skeptically Optimistic ).\nTheir role in enabling denser, more efficient compute environments makes them essential to the broader AI infrastructure stack.\n\nThe rise of ‘neoclouds’\nA new class of cloud platforms, sometimes called “neoclouds,” has emerged to address AI-native workloads. These providers specialize in GPU infrastructure and orchestration tools tailored for AI applications. Their ability to secure scarce GPU supply and scale quickly has made them influential examples of how infrastructure strategy meets AI compute demand ( Wikipedia – CoreWeave ).\nHowever, the capital intensity of these models—combined with execution risk—remains a topic of investor debate.\n\nInfrastructure-adjacent public entrants\nSome newer publicly traded firms are entering the AI market from adjacent angles—building data center infrastructure, facilitating energy deployments or offering highly specialized GPU-hosting services. In several cases, companies that originated in AI software or applied research have repositioned toward compute enablement as enterprise demand for flexible GPU access accelerates. Axe Compute (NASDAQ: AGPU), which recently rebranded from its earlier life sciences focus, is one example of this shift, reflecting how public-market entrants are adapting their strategies to align with the infrastructure layer of the AI economy. These companies often see their valuations driven more by future AI-aligned revenue potential than by current earnings. Their presence reflects the growing complexity and diversity of infrastructure models supporting the AI boom ( Global Equity Briefing ).\n\nThe enabling layer: landlords, interconnection and cooling\nData center landlords and interconnection platforms play a key role in the ecosystem, even when they do not directly offer AI compute. These providers benefit from long-term contracts, scarce land and high interconnection demand from cloud platforms and hyperscalers. As AI growth continues, these firms are seeing renewed attention from both investors and partners seeking strategic locations.\nCooling and energy delivery vendors, such as those specializing in liquid cooling or immersion systems, are increasingly vital as AI density grows. Their ability to adapt to next-generation hardware is becoming a competitive advantage.\n\nThe access layer: asset-light models\nAsset-light platforms that aggregate compute capacity—rather than owning it—are emerging to meet short-term demand. These companies act as intermediaries between data center partners and end users, offering flexible pricing and availability; some public operators, including newer entrants like Axe Compute, are pursuing this model to monetize enterprise GPU access without assuming full hyperscale buildout risk. Their value is often measured through recurring revenue and partner depth, rather than hardware ownership.\n\nThis model appeals to developers and smaller enterprises that need scalable compute without long-term infrastructure commitments.\n\nCapital intensity and execution risk define the space\nAcross all categories, AI data infrastructure is shaped by two opposing forces: massive demand growth and extremely high buildout costs. Capital requirements for land, power, cooling and chips can exceed billions per deployment. At the same time, operators must navigate execution challenges such as grid access, supply chain constraints, permitting and sustainability.\nAs McKinsey notes, while AI workloads will continue to scale, so too will the need for long-term infrastructure strategy and financing innovation ( McKinsey ).\n\nLooking ahead\nIf 2023 and 2024 were the years of the GPU race, 2025 is increasingly defined by infrastructure readiness. Power, cooling, interconnection and capital planning are now as important as the chips themselves. In public markets, firms that combine technical leadership with scalable infrastructure and capital discipline are likely to lead the next wave of growth.\n\nAs AI infrastructure continues to expand, the companies positioned across compute, enablement, and access layers will play a central role in how the AI economy is built.\n\nReferences\nMcKinsey & Co.

What about your holiday stock shopping list? Today is Thursday, December 18. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm your host today, Jason Hall, and I'm joined by Motley Fool analysts Dan Caplinger and Jon Quast to discuss some of our favorite hidden gem stocks that look like great buys as 2025 comes to a close. Get ready for a fun, Foolish round table discussion. If I say hidden gems, you probably think I'm talking about small esoteric companies that nobody's ever heard of, right?. That's true. But it's not the only place that you can find hidden gems. On today's show, we have three giants and their respective industries. Airbnb is one of those dominant companies, and Jon, you brought it to the table. It's a name that people think of when describing the entire short-term stays industry now. It's become the verb, too. Since the first day of trading post IPO, the stock's up almost double, but it peaked like a month later, and it's way down since then in early 2021. Jon, why is this on your list as a hidden gem stock worth buying?\n\nJon Quast: Well, let me give you my elevator pitch here for Airbnb to start it off. People aren't giving up this short-term rental model. Airbnb is the dominant player in this space, and I think it has a brand mote, and it's printing cash, like few companies do. Eventually, these factors should make Airbnb stock a winner. I know it hasn't performed great in recent years, but I think that it will eventually catch up. Let's talk about one of the traits I like of a hidden gem, and that's reasonable growth in an expanding market. Airbnb is growing its revenue at a double-digit pace, 10% in the most recent quarter, expecting high single-digit in the upcoming quarter. But it's not red hot, but that is reasonable growth. There's market research pointing to ongoing growth in this space as a whole. Airbnb is one of the third parties that puts out reports on this. What's so interesting to me is that Airbnb has showed that there are rental property owners who are willing to put their listing on multiple platforms, and that's the majority. But if you're only listing exclusively, you're not listing with Airbnb's competitors. You're listing on Airbnb exclusively. It's either Airbnb alone or Airbnb plus, but never without Airbnb. That to me, shows the mot here, and one of the reasons I like it in this expanding market.\n\nStory Continues\nJason Hall: There's more you like, too.\nJon Quast: For sure. I also like companies that exhibit this trait of having this relentless drive and curiosity to finding new business opportunities. Airbnb is definitely one of those. It's invested $200 million this year in experiences and services. When you look at its bookings in the third quarter, half weren't attached to a place to stay. I'm talking about its experiences and services. People stay in a new place, and maybe they'll book an experience on top of that, but half of the experiences now don't have a place attached to it, so they're doing it exclusively for the experience. That's an interesting trend. The company investing in that seems to be paying off. Management's also talked about, hey, we're going to launch a couple new business ideas every single year. This is throwing spaghetti at the wall, for sure, but it has extra cash on hand, so it can't afford to invest in these new ideas you look at the whole thing. It trades at 18 times its free cash flow. That's a valuation I can get behind. It's buying back shares, and the share count is coming down, and it's investing in new opportunities. Here's the thing. Its competitive position does afford investors the luxury of patience. If it was being outcompeted, if it was burning cash, you wouldn't have the ability to be very patient here. But because it is so strong, you can be patient while it waits for some of these new ideas to work out.\n\nJason Hall: Jon, I'm a little less convinced that optionality is going to lead to that next leg of growth. But the core business is a wonderful business. You mentioned the valuation, and that says that other investors don't necessarily think it's a wonderful business. Maybe some margin of safety there. Plus, or maybe interest rates falling a catalyst for the business moving forward, too? We'll find out about that, but, Dan, you say there's something else that stands out to you.\nDan Caplinger: There's a couple of things. One is that co-founder CEO Brian Chesky has done a great strategy where he is actually living in a different Airbnb property. It's like on a weekly basis or every couple of weeks, something like that. As I get older, as I start to travel more, I'm finding that is more appealing an idea for me, as well. I think that that may actually resonate with some older travelers as they get to a point where they're thinking about retirement, have more time to spend on the road. Just suddenly, that hotel mindset, it's just different from what you get from an Airbnb. I think there's a lot of potential there. The other thing that I have run into in my own travels in the past year is that Airbnbs actually starting to get some cross-listings from traditional hotels. What I was shocked at is the pricing on the hotel rooms on Airbnb is sometimes cheaper than what you get from aggregator sites. I even ran into one situation where it happened to be a Marriott property. I'm a Marriott Bonvoy loyalty member. There was a better price on Airbnb than I could get as a loyalty member. It ticked me off as a loyalty member, but it does speak to the appeal that hotel owners have when they're trying to get as much money as they possibly can. Maxing it out, putting it on all platforms is the smart thing to do. I just never expected a traditional hotel to be so interested in Airbnb. I think that's a potential growth driver, as well.\n\nJason Hall: See, that's the optionality that I think could be compelling, and it's a little bit of maybe Amazon's ad business on its own platform for inventory. Where there's a lot of competition for consumer goods, and it's the same way for Airbnb. It also says to me that Airbnb, you know what? We're not afraid of the hotel industry. Come, give us some money. Put your properties on our platform. We'll take a little money from you. We're still going to win. Up next, Dan makes the case for Lululemon in the midst of growing competition and a change in the C suite. Stay with us.\nSpeaker 1: Head home for the holidays with Abercrombie and Fitch . Between family dinners and making time to catch up with friends, my calendar gets booked up. When I need to look put together, Abercrombie makes it easy to find outfits for all of my fans. With their classic jumpers, essential hoodies, and Abercrombie denim, I've got my holiday fits covered for the whole season. Shop Abercrombie in the app, online, and in stores.\n\nJason Hall: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Over the long term, Lululemon has been a huge winner. It's up more than 15X since going public. But in recent years, it has not been a great investment. Investors have lost money from the peak back in 2023. We can go all the way back to 2020. Beginning of 2020, the stock is still down. The business has lost some of its luster. Dan, what's going on with Lululemon today that makes it compelling to you as a buy?\nDan Caplinger: I've been following Lululemon for a long time, and it's interesting to me how stocks that arguably start out more looking like rule breakers can end up emulating hidden gem style stocks later on. We all know Lululemon yoga apparel business, it changed the retail industry. It opened up an entire new category of these so-called Athlesure products. It brought a new meaning to casual Fridays at the office. It's been instrumental. It's spawned a whole bunch of other specialty retail concepts as well. Business is done really well. But after briefly topping $500 a share, late in 2023, early in 2024, we've seen the stock plunge 70%. Well, what happened? Growth trends slowed. They even reversed in the core North American market. Even now, the company is guarded about its immediate outlook. Seems like it's trying to bottom, but even most recent quarter, we saw same store sales in the North American segment drop. There's a lot of questions about Lululemon right now, but the thing I focus on is we have seen Lululemon be resilient before. Turn back the clock, what, 10, 11 years or so. From around 2012-2014, the stock was down about 50%. What happened? Yoga pants were suddenly see through. We had all these quality control issues. That was exacerbated by some comments from the then CEO, now former CEO and founder, which I won't bother to repeat here, but it took a while for the company to write the ship after that big boondoggle. But the payoff was the stock was a 10 bagger by 2021. Come back to today. Now we're facing a similarly interesting moment. Lululemon just announced its quarterly results earlier this month, but it also said CEO Calvin McDonald is stepping down. Shareholders were happy with that move. More recently, we've seen activist investors come in. Elliott Management has apparently taken $1 billion stake in Lululemon stock has suggested a former Ralph Loren executive named Jane Nelson for the job. Very much the stock in play right now a lot of investors trying to see, is this the thing that breaks Lululemon out of its slump.\n\nJon Quast: It's so interesting, Dan, that we're going to experience a change here at CEO, and I'm a little bit worried about a new management team coming in here and overcorrecting because I really don't think things are as bad as it appears. I think you have good apparel businesses and bad ones, and bad ones have piling up inventory, and that leads to markdowns, and it leads to a complete disintegration of its profit margins. You look at Lululemon. That's not what's happening. It's a good business. Inventory is fine. Margins are fine. It's just having a slowdown. I'm worried that a new manager could come in here and overcorrect when in reality, it stay the course and do what you need to do to keep appealing to your customers.\n\nDan Caplinger: I agree with a lot of what you said, Jon, and I will admit, I'm less than convinced that this recent trend of trying to pick up superstar CEOs for consumer goods companies that are going through some temporary problems. I just don't think that's as important as just going back to basics. Let's make some good products. Let's build up a core base of loyal customers, make them feel valued. But here's the thing. Investors have bid down Lululemon stock so far that they're essentially assuming no real chance of successfully reigniting the growth fires here. I'm not that pessimistic. I think somebody new in the corner office might be able to reverse that negative sentiment and get the stock moving in the right direction.\n\nJason Hall: I think competition is a real threat, but it's also an important reminder that it's a really compelling business. Competitors are not jumping in this to lose money. We've seen other retail or other apparel businesses that have struggled because they lost control of distribution. Lululemon is different because it still has so much control over its distribution footprint. I do think that I agree with both of you that this is less a turnaround and more of a recalibration, but the stock is still priced maybe for more trouble ahead. Up next. We've got one more. I've got a Mag 7 seven stock that I think is more hidden Jim than you might think. Stick with us.\nJason Hall: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money to wrap up today's show. I want to talk about Alphabet , guys.\n\nDan Caplinger: But what are we talking about here? I thought you said this was a hidden gem. Alphabet, more like hiding in plain sight. This was April, maybe. But now?\nJason Hall: I think that's fair. From the beginning of the year, the stocks up 55%, but that big sell-off during the lows in April, the stock's basically doubled since then, and it's clearly gone from being perceived as a feared loser from AI eroding that ad-driven search business to now one of the expected winners from artificial intelligence. Now, I think it's true. We're seeing it's getting really serious traction with Gemini, its Cloud services business is booming. We've also figured out that the ad business it's actually holding up pretty well, even as we do see search be affected by AI. But I think the reason it makes a cut for me, and of the stocks that we've discussed today, it's the one that I have actually most recently bought. It's because of those things and all of the other things that Alphabet is positioned to win from. Yes, that includes search. That includes AI and the Cloud. But it's basically got a Netflix bolted onto it with YouTube. It's a cool little thing with YouTube is it's a much lower risk content development engine because it shares in the profits with content creators. By the way, it's emerged as one of the largest cable TV companies in the US, too, with YouTube TV. Also, we continue to creep closer to autonomous vehicles becoming a real thing. Waymo is approaching half a million rides a week, and they're aiming to hit one million rides a week really soon. Eventually, that's going to be a big business. It's going to feel like an overnight success, but it will have actually taken 15-20 years to build out.\n\nJon Quast: Well, I think that's exactly why Alphabet is a hidden gem. It's not because it's undiscovered, but rather because investors tend to think about it one dimensionally, when in reality, as you point out, Jason, this business can win every way from Thursday in so many different ways. As an analyst, I can barely keep up with everything that it is doing and succeeding in. Optionality is a business trait that we can't measure by any valuation metric. There isn't a stock screener that's going to pull this out, but it's so important from an investing perspective. Just looking at the plethora of past stock market winners, they had that trait, and Alphabet certainly has it, and there are underappreciated optionality aspects of the business.\n\nDan Caplinger: Jason, kudos to you for making this purchase recently. I think it's always hard when you've seen a stock really take off before you've had a chance to really add to your position. I was fortunate enough. I saw Alphabet as sort of this mispriced under appreciated stock years ago, and I've been adding even as many commentators dismissed the company for missing out on AI, missing out on cloud computing. Well, Alphabet proved that wrong, and now the stock is much more favorably valued than it used to be. There's still potential, though for future gains good on you, Jason.\nJason Hall: Guys, I got one last question to wrap this up. We've talked about three stocks today. Which do you think is the biggest winner in five years? Jon, you go first.\n\nJon Quast: I hate to say it. Y'all know how much I love Airbnb, but I believe that LuluLemon has the clearest path to doubling in value over the next five years. I think all three of these stocks are really safe. I really do. But LuluLemon, to me, it has a really good balance between its growth rate and its valuation, maybe the most favorable balance between those two factors. For me, it has the nod of the best stock today.\nDan Caplinger: Jason, I've got to say, I agree with Jon 100% and not just because it was my pick. But I have to say this, too, I wish that it would be Alphabet. I wish that Alphabet would be able to outperform LuluLemon over the next five years because I own a lot more Alphabet stock. I think Alphabet is going to do just fine, and I'm really optimistic and hopeful Airbnb might finally catch a break here, start executing well enough, get some appreciation from shareholders, get the stock moving back in the right direction.\n\nJason Hall: Airbnb just keeps landing on my too-hard pile. The valuation is really compelling. I'm waiting to see more evidence that these other things are going to really help it deliver, and we're going to be rewarded with a higher multiple. Alphabet, this is just about the most expensive multiple on a sales basis it's ever traded for. It's not cheap. There's still all the other things I laid out we're counting on. The market is expecting big things from the company. I agree. I come back to thinking of this group, the highest probability. I agree. I think the best margin of safety, the business that's proven, the business that's a lot stronger than the stock is treating it like. I think that's Lululemon, too. I agree. How about that? All three of us?\n\nDan Caplinger: It's a first, Jason. I'm not sure that's ever happened before.\nJason Hall: It's either a really good thing or really bad thing Jon?\nJon Quast: This is a shocking development, for sure.\nJason Hall: Guys, this has been a lot of fun. Dan, Jon, thank you both so much for joining me today.

      "Content": "Could Vertiv Become the Next Essential AI Infrastructure Stock?\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 5:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nVRT\n\nKey Points AI data centers are consuming more increasingly-expensive electricity than the industry anticipated.\nKeeping data centers cool enough to remain operational has also surfaced as a challenge.\nMost investors have yet to realize Vertiv’s book of future business continues to outgrow revenue.\n10 stocks we like better than Vertiv ›\n\nTo date, Nvidia has been the centerpiece stock of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. And rightfully so. The world's been waiting on computer processors powerful enough to turn lofty AI ambitions into reality. Nvidia delivered, with its silicon now serving as the heart and soul of most artificial intelligence platforms.\nAs the AI movement evolves though, unexpected challenges are coming to light. For instance, the planet's power infrastructure isn't quite as ready as hoped to supply data centers with all the electricity they need. These challenges are, of course, presenting new growth opportunities for investors -- opportunities better than Nvidia is at this time.\nAnd one name in particular is rising to the surface as one of the next great stock picks of the artificial intelligence revolution. That's AI infrastructure specialist Vertiv (NYSE: VRT) . Although it's never going to be as big as Nvidia nor likely to dish out the sort of sustained gains that Nvidia did, from here, it does offer tremendous long-term promise.\n\nBuilt for the growth opportunity at-hand It's not the only outfit offering solutions that meet artificial intelligence data centers' complicated needs. Newcomers like Nebius , Applied Digital , and Iren (and others) are in this business as well, each with their own unique offering. Vertiv brings something very special to the table though. That's cost-effective flexible power and cost-efficient cooling solutions.\n\nOne of these cooling solutions is chilled water systems. While not unheard of, it's still relatively rare within the world of data centers. But it shouldn't be. While they can be complicated and somewhat expensive to set up, McKinsey reports that water-cooled platforms ultimately consume about 30% less power than more conventional alternatives.\nIt's not just chilled water cooling that Vertiv offers though, or for that matter, just cooling. Power generation and electricity management are also in its repertoire.\nBattery-based energy storage and highly efficient power transfer switches are also on its menu, for example, with the company reporting that its PowerDirect 7100 Energy hybrid DC power systems are 98% energy-efficient. In an industry where operating costs are soaring because some of this equipment is on the order of 30% less efficient, that's a pretty big deal.\n\nStory Continues\nThe opportunity at-hand isn't ho-hum either. S&P Global Market Intelligence predicts worldwide data center power consumption will nearly double between now and 2030, and still won't be done growing by then. Meanwhile, Precedence Research believes the global data center cooling market itself is set to grow at an average annualized pace of nearly 12% through 2035.\n\nVertiv is well-positioned to plug into both of these growth trends.\nKeep your eyes on the long-term prize These tailwinds don't necessarily mean Vertiv shares will be easy to own anytime soon. They likely won't be, in fact. Although the already-profitable company's top line is expected to grow another 20% in 2026 and pump up per-share profits at a similar rate, this ticker is understandably being lumped in with most other AI stocks, which some believe are in a bubble .\n\nIf that bubble pops, VRT will almost certainly tumble with those other names. In the meantime, it's just plain volatile, sliding from late-October's peak near $200 to this month's low near $150 back to where it was priced as of mid-October.\nJust don't lose your long-term perspective. This stock is currently valued at just a little over 30 times the coming year's projected per-share profits of $5.28, which is cheap by most artificial intelligence stock standards.\nAnd thanks to its recent AI-related volatility, the stock's also trading well below analysts' consensus price target of $200.62. Data center owners and operators desperately need the technology it offers, even if most investors don't see it yet. That's the crux of the opportunity here.\n\nThis might seal the deal, so to speak: Not only was Vertiv's third-quarter revenue of just under $2.7 billion up 29% year over year, the company's backlog of business grew from $8.5 billion as June to $9.5 billion now. The tailwinds blowing here are clearly picking up speed.\nShould you buy stock in Vertiv right now? Before you buy stock in Vertiv, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertiv wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Will Intel Shock the World in 2026?\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:38 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBF\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Intel had an 80% gain in 2025.\nBut the company's market cap is still far below its big tech peers.\nSome unexpected technology and financial successes could be in store for 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nOne of the best performers in the technology sector this year was Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , with its stock up roughly 80% in 2025. Extreme pessimism at the start of the year gave way to hope when new CEO Lip-Bu Tan was appointed to the role in March. Then hope turned to enthusiasm when the U.S. government, Softbank , and Nvidia all invested in the company in the third quarter.\n\nSkeptics may say Intel is due for a pullback in 2026, but investors should consider that Intel's market capitalization is still far below that of other AI leaders, at just $173 billion today.\nThat still leaves room for further upside if Intel can execute and regain its technology leadership. And while many analysts are skeptical this will happen, Intel may very well change the narrative in a big way next year.\nProfits are nearly certain to inflect higher Many don't really understand Intel's current financials, which is understandable. Current profits appear nonexistent; last quarter's adjusted ( non-GAAP ) EPS was a meager $0.23, likely not enough to justify the current stock price of $36.50.\nYet it seems nearly inevitable that Intel's profits will increase throughout 2026. The most direct way this will happen is by relocating more production from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) to Intel's own manufacturing fabs.\n\nThroughout former CEO Pat Gelsinger's turnaround plan, Intel had to reinvest to build its Intel 3 fab in Ireland and its 18A fab in Chandler, Arizona. During that period, Intel still produced older nodes in-house, but outsourced basically all of its leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC as its new fabs were built. As a virtual monopoly, TSMC achieved a very high gross margin of 59.5% last quarter. Meanwhile, Intel's foundry is yielding large operating losses, to the tune of $2.3 billion last quarter alone.\nBut Intel foundry's losses are entirely due to Intel having invested heavily in expensive leading-edge fabs, while having very little product running through those fabs as of yet. However, as Intel moves production back to both Intel 3, which began high-volume manufacturing in late 2024, and especially 18A, which just began high-volume manufacturing this quarter, those underutilization losses will not only reverse but should eventually turn into profits by 2027.\nSo there will be a double-positive effect of Intel beginning to utilize the fabs it has already built, while also not having to pay TSMC's huge margins.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile yields on the 18A process are currently lower than normal, according to Intel management, it's early in that node's ramp. Management remains confident yields will improve throughout next year, which should lead to steady margin increases throughout 2026.\nTechnology leadership could add even more profitability Speaking of 18A, it is still the node by which Intel believes it will meet or exceed TSMC's technology in the industry. Now, there is some debate about this, with some industry participants arguing that TSMC's 2nm remains superior.\nYet while both Intel and TSMC will be using gate-all-around transistors for the first time with their 18A and 2nm nodes, Intel will be bringing at least one technology to market ahead of TSMC: backside power.\n\nBackside power moves the power delivery wires of a semiconductor from the front of the chip to the back part of the chip. This leaves more room on the front for more transistors, which leads to better performance and efficiency.\nIn addition, while Intel has been close-lipped about the tooling for its 18A node, there is also the possibility that Intel may utilize high-NA extreme ultraviolet lithography (HNA) tools for 18A.\nHNA can \"write\" chip patterns in a thickness of just 8nm, more precisely than the 13nm light beams of low-NA EUV. If Intel implements high-NA for the 18A node, it can eliminate several processing steps that would be required by double or triple-patterning designs with LNA tools, thereby saving on other equipment lines and fab space. At a technology conference back in February, Intel noted that a high-NA machine can do the same work with a single-digit number of process steps that it took three low-NA machines and 40 steps to accomplish.\n\nNow, for the record, Intel has only stated that it will integrate HNA production into its upcoming 14A node. However, management has never explicitly ruled out the possibility of inserting the technology into 18A. Meanwhile, Intel has publicly disclosed it has already purchased at least three high-NA machines, and potentially more. Moreover, Intel just revealed two weeks ago it had completed \"acceptance testing\" for the production-grade HNA system, meaning it is manufacturing-ready. With Intel having first received HNA tools in late 2023 and the tool seemingly ready for production, it would be odd if the company doesn't use these next-gen tools until 2028's 14A.\nExternal customer announcements? Finally, in addition to improving its technology and margins for its own chips, Intel is also attempting to become a rival foundry to TSMC and break its monopoly. In fact, Intel has stated it may not even develop its next 14A node if it doesn't secure a large external customer -- although executives remain confident that this will happen.\n\nIf Intel does land an external customer for 14A, which is scheduled to enter risk production in 2027 and high-volume production in 2028, that customer win may very well be announced in 2026.\nAlready over the past month, rumors have circulated that Apple may utilize the 18AP node variant, a more refined version of 18A, for its lower-end M-series processors. Meanwhile, Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead recently wrote, \"Intel customers I've talked with who have seen this one say that 14A is the real deal.\" And GF Securities in Hong Kong recently reported Nvidia and even Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices are considering the 14A node.\nIf these rumors are already circulating in 2025, there will likely be a lot more activity surrounding external customer announcements in 2026.\n\n2026 could see the rally continue 2025 was the first stage of Intel's turnaround. The company returned to meager profitability, implemented its new 18A process, and reduced the company's bloated expense base. It attracted investment from the U.S. government and others, and new CEO Lip-Bu Tan is beginning to make his presence felt.\n\nYet 2026 could see even more tangible more breakthroughs across profitability, technology, and landing external customers. In other words, it will be another fascinating year for the most consequential U.S. chipmaker -- with potentially much more upside for the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

The round was led by Banyan Tree , Silver Capital , ZhaoTai Group , and NYX Ventures , with participation from Starting Gate Fund , Jade Capital , and renowned tech investors including VPs from NVIDIA , Julian Qian (Member of technical staff at Anthropic) , Weihe Zheng (Founding Partner, Cowin Capital) , Jia He (Founding Partner, Nanshan Capital) , Peter Xu (CEO, Plug and Play China) , and Zach Zhang (Founding Partner, Edgewater Investments) . Existing investors Tao Foundation and Xiaomi Co-founder Feng Hong also participated. The proceeds will be used primarily for technology R&D, product iteration, and market expansion.\n\nPrior to this, Traini also received investments from senior management at Google, Meta, and Palo Alto Networks and institutional investment from FutureX Capital , BlueSea Partners , Tao Foundation , Mint Capital , and Valkyrie Fund .\nFollowing this round of financing, Traini will launch its first smart hardware product—the world’s first cognitive pet wearable , the Cognitive Smart Collar . This device is also the world’s first human–dog \"language\" translation device built on generative AI. It is now available for pre-order through the Traini App and the website, traini.app .\nTraini founder Arvin Sun stated, \"Our mission is to develop an intelligence that reignites the natural instincts of our furry companions and builds a true spiritual bond between pets and their humans.\" Traini’s founding team brings extensive experience from companies like OpenAI , Chewy , and ByteDance .\n\nTraini is the world’s first—and so far the only—technology company to translate pet behavior using multimodal generative AI. Its breakthrough technology has pioneered a new way for humans to communicate with their pets.\nThe defining feature of Traini’s product lies in its ability to enable real-time voice conversations through its proprietary multimodal models. Traini’s core product, PEBI (Pet Empathic Behavior Interface) , supports multimodal interaction across text, images, video, and audio. By analyzing pets’ vocalizations, facial expressions, and behaviors, PEBI delivers a precise understanding of pets’ psychological and emotional states and expresses them in a human-like conversational form—achieving true, two-way communication between humans and pets.\n\nStory continues\nTraini’s models cover nearly 120 dog breeds, with emotion translation accuracy reaching up to 94% . PEBI can be applied to behavior translation, emotion recognition, personalized service matching, and pet-assisted healthcare diagnostics. In addition, Traini provides APIs to veterinary clinics and hardware companies, empowering medical services and intelligent device interactions. Traini has established deep partnerships with leading smartphone and electric vehicle brands, and soon users will be able to communicate with their pets in real time directly through mobile operating systems and in-car infotainment systems.\n\nIn product quality validation, beyond collaborating with pet behavior experts for extensive data annotation, Traini has innovatively adopted a \"human–pet vocal spectrogram comparison\" methodology. By using the spectrogram of human speech—captured when expressing corresponding emotions and intentions—as a baseline, Traini compares it against pet vocal patterns to enhance emotional mapping accuracy.\nTraini‘s smart dog collar integrates advanced AI with real-time emotion tracking. It is powered by Traini’s proprietary Valence–Arousal model, 3D Pet Emotion Model and Instant Emotion Vector . Developed in close collaboration with pet behaviorists, the model is built upon insights from more than 900 peer-reviewed studies in animal behavior and trained on behavioral data from over 2 million dogs . Designed to deepen emotional bonds between pets and their owners, the Cognitive Smart Collar helps pet parents gain a richer understanding of their dogs’ emotional well-being and overall mental health.\n\nThe collar's most remarkable feature lies in its ability to autonomously identify and track kinds of emotional states in dogs, including joy, anxiety, excitement, and distress. Translating them into human-understandable language enables real-time, meaningful two-way communication — including vocalizations, emotions, behaviors, and even what the dog \"wants to say.\" Using a combination of sound analysis from the dog’s barks and vital signals like heart rate, temperature, and body movement, Traini’s AI-powered collar interprets these data points to provide a comprehensive emotional profile of the pet. Traini's collar offers actionable feedback that can enhance the bond between owner and pet.\nBeyond everyday care, the collar also has significant potential in the realm of pet healthcare. By continuously monitoring a dog’s emotional and physiological signals, it can help detect early signs of health issues.\n\nOn the user side, Traini has already served over 2 million dogs and received widespread coverage from major media and influencers. Its videos on YouTube have surpassed 70 million views . In 2023, Traini launched PetGPT , a natural-language and behavior-analysis model with 99% coverage across users, improving service engagement by 70% . Earlier this year, it unveiled T-Agent , an AI-powered product recommendation and purchasing system that autonomously identifies dogs’ real needs—allowing pets to make decisions, with their owners acting as co-pilots . Traini now collaborates with nearly 40,000 local pet stores across the U.S.\nTo realize this vision, Traini had to overcome two major challenges: data scarcity and environmental complexity . Traini addressed these through multimodal fusion , integrating image, video, and audio data to train its PPI (Pet Perception and Interaction) model. Powered by transformers, PPI combines real-time perception, adaptive reasoning, and feedback generation.\n\nTraini also introduced a \"train-as-you-use\" mechanism , where every anonymized user-pet interaction feeds back into model training, enhancing personalization and continuously expanding the behavioral dataset. This approach strengthens the model’s precision while building a sustainable data moat. Traini has achieved breakthroughs at both data and model levels , developing a rich, high-quality pet audio-video dataset across multiple breeds, scenes, and emotions. As a result, users can detect early signs of pet stress, loneliness, or health risks, transforming Traini from a passive tool into an emotional interface for daily companionship.\nInvestors describe Traini as a breakthrough example of AI in vertical applications—where technology, empathy, and consumer experience converge.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251229406590/en/\nContacts\ntrainipet@gmail.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Will AMD Be a Must-Own AI Stock in 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points AMD is starting to make a comeback in the AI revolution.\nAMD's management believes it can deliver 60% data center growth through 2030.\nThe stock has a premium price tag over its chief rival.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nAMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has spent most of the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout in second place to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . This has caused AMD's stock to dramatically underperform Nvidia since 2023, with AMD rising aboiut 230% while Nvidia is up around 1,160%. However, AMD flipped the script in 2025, as it outperformed Nvidia stock significantly. AMD is up nearly 80% while Nvidia rose around 35%.\nThat's strong performance from both stocks, but AMD's 2025 comeback made it a must-own stock this year. The question is, will AMD be a must-own stock in 2026? Let's find out.\nAMD's comeback is real Nvidia was, and still is, the preferred graphics processing unit (GPU) vendor for the AI hyperscalers. Its GPUs and technology stack truly lead the industry, with AMD serving as a viable alternative. However, AMD has started to close the gap, particularly with controlling software.\nNvidia's CUDA software was one of the major differentiators between the two offerings, as AMD's wasn't nearly as good. However, thanks to various acquisitions and partnerships, AMD's ROCm software has dramatically improved. In fact, AMD reported that downloads for ROCm software increased 10 times year over year as of November 2025. This shows AMD is gaining ground, and there's another important consideration as well.\n\nDuring Nvidia's Q3 FY 2026 results, its CEO, Jensen Huang, noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. This is a huge deal, as its cloud clients aren't going to sit around idle while Nvidia fulfills demand. Instead, they're going to go looking for alternative computing providers, and AMD is near the top of the list. This could allow AMD to build a strong position in the computing hardware industry. If AI clients find out that AMD's hardware offers similar performance at a much lower price point, you could see more clients begin to use AMD's hardware stack instead of Nvidia's. This would be a huge shift for AMD, making it one of the best AI stocks to own in 2026 and beyond.\nAMD's internal projections reflect this, as management believes the data center division can achieve a 60% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030. In Q3, its data center growth rate was a mere 22%. This is a lofty goal AMD set for itself, but if it can achieve it, AMD will become a top artificial intelligence stock to own for the next few years.\n\nStory Continues\nCompanywide, AMD expects its CAGR to come in around 35%, because its consumer hardware and embedded processor divisions are only expected to grow at around a 10% CAGR over the next five years. Still, a 35% growth rate is nothing to be disappointed with, and if AMD's growth starts to accelerate in 2026, the stock could go on an incredible run. But there's one factor holding it back.\n\nSome of AMD's comeback is already priced in The market is well aware of the situation laid out above, which is why AMD's stock has done so well in 2025. Part of that success is already priced into its stock, as it trades for a significant premium over rival Nvidia when next year's earnings are used as the forward earnings valuation metric.\nInvestors must pay nearly 50% more to own AMD's stock versus Nvidia's. That's a hefty premium to place on a company that hasn't started its comeback yet; it's only talked about it. That's concerning to me, as I want to see some progress before I'm willing to say that AMD is the better stock to own for 2026. However, I still think that AMD will be successful, but just maybe not as successful as Nvidia will be in 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

Can you imagine being a short seller in this market and trying to bet against the the Mag 7 or the AI trade or anything. I mean, you get carried out. Short selling's been like the worst uh possible thesis on the market you could have the last 15 years other than maybe going long oil and gas stocks.

If you look at Johnson and Johnson, which basically just lagged in the 140s to 170s, uh kind of era era for a long time and now it's well over 200. You've already seen somewhat of a healthcare rally. If I was going to move chips around the table, I would stay focused on small caps and international. And believe it or not, even though I just ridiculed them, I'd I'd look at oil and gas stocks. They're incredibly cheap, they're incredibly out of favor and the risk reward of that is is pretty compelling from a one to two-year perspective in my view.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Nvidia Is Hands-Down a Better Stock to Buy Than Palantir for 2026\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:04 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia and Palantir have similar growth stories.\nNvidia's valuation is much more attractive than Palantir's.\nOverall, Nvidia appears to offer a better risk-reward proposition than Palantir.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is on track to deliver another sizzling performance in 2025. The chipmaker's gain, though, won't come anywhere close to matching that of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) . Unless Palantir's stock implodes in the final trading days of the year, it should finish 2025 up more than 150%.\nDoes Palantir's momentum make it the more attractive choice going into the new year? I don't think so. Instead, I believe that Nvidia is the hands-down better stock to buy than Palantir for 2026.\nTwo similar growth stories Don't get me wrong: Palantir has an impressive growth story. In the third quarter of 2025, the software company reported that its total revenue increased 63% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter to $1.18 billion.\nAs it has in the past, Palantir continues to generate the majority of its revenue in the U.S. Over half of its U.S. revenue stems from contracts with the federal government. However, that might not be the case for much longer. The company's U.S. commercial revenue is growing at a much faster pace than its government revenue.\n\nNvidia's growth is remarkably similar to that of Palantir. The GPU maker reported Q3 revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter.\nWhich company has the stronger momentum as 2025 draws to a close? I'd give the nod to Nvidia, based on the revenue guidance from both companies. While Palantir forecasts quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 12.5% in Q4, Nvidia projects quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 14%.\nBoth artificial intelligence (AI) leaders also have CEOs who hype their growth stories. Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in his company's Q3 update, \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.\" That seemed downright modest, though, compared to Palantir founder and CEO Alex Karp's proclamation that his company delivered an \"unworldly growth rate\" in the third quarter.\n\nTwo dissimilar valuations I don't think that Nvidia's relatively small momentum advantage as 2025 draws to a close makes it a hands-down better stock to buy than Palantir in the new year. However, I believe that Nvidia's valuation does.\nGranted, Nvidia doesn't seem to be cheap at first glance. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio is roughly 24.8. It's essential to factor in the company's growth prospects over the next few years, though. Nvidia's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, based on analysts' five-year growth projections, is only 0.72, according to Yahoo! Finance. Any PEG multiple below 1.0 is typically considered an attractive valuation.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other hand, Palantir's valuation looks downright scary. The AI and data analytics software stock trades at 192.3 times forward earnings. Yes, Palantir's outstanding growth helps make its valuation somewhat more palatable. However, the stock's PEG ratio remains over 3.0, indicating that it appears to be significantly more expensive than Nvidia, even with growth projections taken into account.\n\nKarp tried to shrug off his company's sky-high valuation in his Q3 letter to Palantir shareholders, stating, \"It has indeed been difficult for outsiders to appraise our business, either its significance in shaping our current geopolitics or its value in the vulgar, financial sense.\" The problem, as I see it, with his perspective, though, is that valuing stocks must always be done using financials, whether one views doing so as vulgar or not.\nRisk vs. reward Ultimately, investing comes down to trading risk in exchange for potential rewards. Which of these two stocks provides the better risk-reward proposition? I think the answer is clearly Nvidia.\nAlthough Palantir's revenue growth is impressive (and perhaps even \"unworldly,\" as Karp argues), it's essentially on par with that of Nvidia. However, Nvidia's stock trades at a much lower valuation. That's true whether we incorporate growth projections for one year or five years from now.\n\nTo be sure, Nvidia faces some risks. The AI infrastructure boom could slow down. Customers could increasingly turn to chips from rivals. But these are \"maybe\" kind of risks. Palantir's valuation risk isn't so speculative.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia got there first. Who will hit a $5 trillion market cap next?\n\nCatherine Baab\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIt was a landmark year for corporate valuations, especially among the world’s most famous tech companies.\nMarket cap milestones once considered mythical — $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $3 trillion, etc. — are now routine financial news. On one side, they’ve been driven by explosive growth in consumer tech, cloud computing, and AI; on the other, by simply massive inflows of capital from ETFs, money managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and the global investor class.\n\nOf course, the sheer most eye-catching headline has already been written. In October 2025, Nvidia became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation , propelled by its central role in powering AI workloads and tremendous demand for its chips. The achievement cements Nvidia’s role as a heavyweight of the current mega-cap era — a status that just a few years ago seemed out of reach for any hardware business.\nBefore we look at which company is likely to be the next in the race to the $5 trillion mark, let’s review who reached the $4 trillion threshold in 2025.\nThe $4 trillion club Microsoft passed the $4 trillion threshold in the middle of the year, powered by accelerating cloud and AI services growth and strong enterprise demand for its AI-integrated software platforms . Apple also rose above $4 trillion late in the year — the third company in history to do so — on the back of device sales and services revenue. Late in the year, Google parent Alphabet briefly brushed the $4 trillion market cap mark, too.\n\nConsidered together with Nvidia, these four companies represent the frontier of size in the global stock market, occupying a tremendous chunk of market-cap-weighted indices.\nWhat about the rest of the Magnificent Seven ? Amazon, smaller than the very largest four, derives much of its $2.4 trillion valuation from Amazon Web Services and long-term bets in logistics and AI-driven commerce. But the stock lagged behind its Big Tech peers in 2025, moving sideways so that it’s set to finish the year with low single-digit gains.\nMeanwhile, even sitting below the $2 trillion mark, Tesla, Meta, and the semiconductor and hardware maker Broadcom remain firmly in the upper tier of global market caps.\nWho will be the next to $5 trillion? It may seem tautological, but the tech companies that have recently crossed into or flirted with a $4 trillion market cap are the most obvious candidates to hit the $5 trillion mark.\nThus, Microsoft — with its vast cloud business, deep enterprise software penetration, and increasing AI integration — may be the most obvious of any contender. Continued multiple expansion alongside consistent earnings growth are likely to steadily push the stock higher. Ditto Apple. Its ecosystem generates enormous recurring revenue from services and hardware, and its ventures into AI-enhanced products could, at least in theory, prove to be future growth catalysts. If innovation accelerates in ways that reenergize — or simply meet? — investor expectations , hitting $5 trillion is within the realm of possibility.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's a similar story with Alphabet’s strength in AI, plus its core business in search, YouTube, Android, and everything cloud. Few companies on earth boast such broad and defensible franchises. And as the investor story catches up , the company could break out to emerge as an even bigger winner.\nWhy scale begets scale In the past, investor logic — invoking “ trees don’t grow to the sky ” and a loose reading of the law of large numbers — cast mega-caps as destined for slower growth. But the 2010s and 2020s turned that longstanding wisdom on its head, and a fresh reversal doesn’t look likely.\nIt’s simple. As companies reach multi-trillion-dollar valuations, index weight, passive ownership, and benchmark dominance don’t just reflect success — they arguably help to perpetuate it, making further gains more likely. Earnings still matter, yet they’re also amplified by the structure of contemporary capital markets.\nThe logic may feel circular, but new $5 trillion behemoths rarely emerge out of nowhere. The next entrant is far more likely to come from the ranks of the giants than from anywhere else.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year.

      "Content": "Prediction: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Will Outperform Nvidia in 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 4:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points This AI company is making popular AI chips and developing a leading large language model.\nIt should see strong sales growth across its hardware business while more developers license its model.\nThe stock trades for a value relative to Nvidia, and strong growth across multiple businesses could send shares higher in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nNvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks in the current bull market. The stock has increased by more than 1,000% since the release of ChatGPT , which kicked off the artificial intelligence (AI) spending spree among big tech stocks. Nvidia has been a huge beneficiary of the growing spend on artificial intelligence infrastructure, as its GPUs are best in class for training large language models .\nDespite its status as the largest company in the world with a market cap of around $4.5 trillion, analysts think Nvidia could keep climbing higher in 2026. The median price target on the stock is $250, about 30% higher than the stock price as of this writing. That would make it a $6 trillion company.\nBut another AI leader looks poised to outperform the chipmaker in 2026 thanks to its momentum across hardware, software, and real-world applications of AI. Here's why I expect Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to outperform Nvidia next year.\nChallenging the AI leaders Alphabet has made tremendous progress in artificial intelligence in 2025, and that should show up in continued financial strength in 2026.\nIts Google Cloud division saw revenue growth accelerate to 34% last quarter while its operating margin continued to expand, reaching 24%. Those trends should continue in 2026, as management reported a backlog of $155 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 46% year over year.\n\nAlphabet is seeing notably strong demand for its custom-built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). The AI accelerator chips are a more cost-efficient alternative to Nvidia GPUs for AI training and inference. Anthropic plans to use TPUs for some of its workload starting in 2026, and Alphabet is reportedly in discussions with Meta Platforms to use the chips and port popular AI framework PyTorch to the hardware. The relative performance of TPUs to Nvidia's GPUs and other custom AI accelerators should continue to fuel growth for Google Cloud in 2026 with significant margin improvements.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet also saw strong relative performance for its large language models. Gemini 3.0, released in November, scored highly on most benchmark tests, outperforming top models from both Anthropic and OpenAI at the time. The release spurred OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare \"code red,\" as the model performed better than GPT 5.1 and pushed more consumers to download Google's Gemini app, which had 650 million monthly active users as of November.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet could have a big customer for its LLM next year as well, as Apple is reportedly going to use Gemini for some of its new AI-powered Siri features starting next spring. The iPhone maker will pay $1 billion per year to license the model. Apple will run the model on its own servers, so it would be practically all profit for Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet benefits from using its own AI innovations Alphabet isn't just out-innovating the biggest competitors in the field; it's also able to use those innovations in its own business.\nAs a large language model developer, it's able to take advantage of its massive cloud computing business and TPU development. But Alphabet's also using that large language model to improve its core search engine, which remains a cash cow for the business. It's also continuing to refine various machine learning algorithms, improving its advertisement placement and YouTube engagement.\n\nIn search, features such as AI Overviews and AI Mode have increased the types and number of search queries users make. And with Google monetizing those searches at roughly the same rate as those without AI-powered results, it's been a net positive for revenue. Over the last two years, the company has drastically cut the cost of generating AI Overviews, improving profitability. Overall, Google Search revenue accelerated through the first three quarters of 2025, up 15% in the third quarter.\nYouTube, likewise, saw revenue growth accelerate, climbing 15% in the most recent quarter. AI features, such as tools that help edit videos and create thumbnails, as well as identify shoppable products in videos, have helped improve engagement and monetization.\n\nAlphabet's also seeing progress with Waymo, its self-driving car business, which is part of its Other Bets segment. The robotaxi service completed 14 million trips in 2025, more than triple the number of trips completed in the previous year. Management says it's on track to complete 1 million rides per week by the end of 2026 as it expands to 20 new cities. The business could be a key source of revenue growth as it scales next year.\nThe value is there With growth across hardware, software, and its core businesses, Alphabet presents a diversified growth stock that trades at a good value. Investors can currently pick up shares for less than 30 times forward earnings expectations. By comparison, you'll pay over 40 times earnings for Nvidia shares.\n\nAlphabet should experience strong earnings growth as the cloud computing business scales and operating margin expands. It already generates tens of billions in cash every year, providing room to increase its share repurchase program, further boosting earnings per share. As a result, paying less than 30 times earnings could prove a bargain.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia may struggle to build on its gains in 2026, especially as Google's TPUs, competing GPUs, and other companies' custom AI accelerators make progress in eating into its market share. At its current price, it'll have to outperform already high expectations to produce returns like the last few years. It seems more likely that Alphabet will be the better-performing stock in the coming year.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "4 Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 2:43 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nIREN\n\nCRDO\n\nNVDA\n\nBTC-USD\n\nKey Points Palantir and Nvidia are large companies at the forefront of the AI revolution.\nIren Limited is a Bitcoin miner, but it just inked a huge deal with Microsoft to supply cloud computing capacity.\nCredo Technology's wiring solutions may not be sexy, but they help data centers function better.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nOne of the greatest appeals of cryptocurrencies is their massive potential. That market can be very challenging, and investors are often swept away by some of the sudden, huge gains they read about each year. There are dozens of cryptocurrencies with more than a 100% gain in the last seven days.\nHowever, chasing these kinds of gains can be frustrating, as for every success story, there are digital coins that fade away just as quickly, leaving investors with a proverbial pile of dust. It's impossible to predict which cryptocurrencies will be the next big winners and which will vanish into obscurity.\nHowever, you don't need to chase crypto to build wealth. You can find some great companies in the stock market that will give you outsize gains and make crypto investors green with envy. Tech stocks have been some of the best investments you can make in the last year, and I'm expecting that to continue in 2026.\nIf you want explosive growth potential, I'd wager that these four tech stocks are great possibilities -- and all of them have a compelling growth story that makes them superior to cryptocurrencies.\n1. Palantir Technologies It's true that Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) isn't a perfect company. Its valuation is a major concern, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 267 and a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 104 at the time of this writing. Those numbers indicate that for a typical company, these shares are extraordinarily expensive and the stock could be ripe for a correction.\n\nBut Palantir isn't a typical company. The data analytics company is growing fast thanks to its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which allows users to access Palantir's powerful network with minimal training. Palantir saw 63% revenue growth in the third quarter as it closed 204 deals valued at more than $1 million each. It's in high demand among both military and commercial clients.\nPalantir stock is up 155% so far this year -- the third-best performance in the Nasdaq-100 -- and that follows gains of 167% in 2023 and 340% in 2024.\nI would be shocked if Palantir stock doesn't grow another 100% or more in 2026.\n2. Nvidia Semiconductor maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been slowing down as of late -- but who can really expect the stock price to maintain its torrid pace? Nvidia shares rose 819% from 2023 to 2024, and followed that up with a 37% gain in 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are bundled by the thousands in data centers to train and run high-level artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning programs. Nvidia holds a substantial lead in the data center chip market, with estimates ranging from 86% to 92% of its market share. Its huge advantage stems from chip superiority as well as its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel computing architecture that allows developers to write and develop code on Nvidia GPUs.\n\nNvidia reported in its last quarter that it sold out of data center GPUs, and its Blackwell line is flying off the proverbial shelves. When Nvidia rolls out its next-generation architecture Rubin line in 2026, I'm expecting equally strong demand.\n3. Iren Limited We're seeing incredible growth in data centers, and that's going to continue through 2026 and beyond. As more companies develop AI products to help manage their businesses or draw in new customers, there's an increasing demand for data centers to cluster GPUs and run AI programs. Researchers at BloombergNEF estimate that at least 150 data center projects have been announced in the U.S. over the last year, and data center power demand in the U.S. is expected to grow from 25 gigawatts to 106 gigawatts by 2035.\n\nIren Limited (NASDAQ: IREN) has six data centers in Texas and Canada with 2.9 GW of capacity. And it has a new $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft to provide cloud computing capacity using Nvidia GPUs.\nBuilding data centers is really expensive, but Iren has an advantage because it makes most of its money from Bitcoin mining, which allows it to operate at a profit while other data center companies are operating in the red. It made $232.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 from Bitcoin mining, accounting for nearly all of its $240.3 million of total revenue.\nIren gives you the advantage of Bitcoin -- the most stable cryptocurrency -- without holding the coins yourself. And you also get to invest in a tech stock that has its fingers in data center expansion.\n\n4. Credo Technology This one may sound a little out of left field, as Credo Technology (NASDAQ: CRDO) is down 21% since Dec. 22. But I'm confident that this is just temporary weakness, as Credo is an indispensable company for the data center expansion already discussed.\nCredo makes the wiring that links GPUs together in data centers. Instead of traditional wiring, Credo's active electrical cables (AECs) include signal processors that help the data move faster and more efficiently. Management says they are 1,000 times more reliable and consume half the power as optical wiring.\n\nCredo's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending Nov. 1, 2025) was $268 million, up 272% from a year ago. Income of $82.6 million resulted in earnings of $0.44 per share.\nDespite the recent pullback, Credo stock is up 121% this year and has a strong runway ahead of it.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?

      "Content": "11 big trades of 2025: Bubbles, cockroaches, and a 367% jump\n\nBloomberg News\nUpdated Sun, December 28, 2025 at 2:08 PM PST 16 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nGC=F\n\n^IXIC\n\n(Bloomberg) — It was another year of high-conviction bets — and fast reversals.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nFrom bond desks in Tokyo and credit committees in New York to currency traders in Istanbul, markets delivered both windfalls and whiplash. Gold hit records. Staid mortgage behemoths gyrated like meme stocks. A textbook carry trade blew up in a flash.\n\nInvestors bet big on shifting politics, bloated balance sheets and fragile narratives, fueling outsized stock rallies, crowded yield trades, and crypto strategies built on leverage, hope, and not much else. Donald Trump’s White House return quickly sank — and then revived — financial markets across the world, lit a fire under European defense stocks, and emboldened speculators fanning mania after mania. Some positions paid off spectacularly. Others misfired when momentum reversed, financing dried up or leverage cut the wrong way.\nAs the year draws to a close, Bloomberg highlights some of the most eye-catching wagers of 2025 — the wins, the wipeouts and the positions that defined the era. Many of those bets leave investors fretting over all-too-familiar fault lines as they prepare for 2026: shaky companies, stretched valuations, and trend-chasing trades that work, until they don’t.\n\nCrypto: Trumped It looked like one of crypto’s more compelling momentum bets: load up on anything and everything tied to the Trump brand. During his presidential campaign and after he took office, Trump went all-in on digital assets — pushing sweeping reforms and installing industry allies across powerful agencies. His family leaned in, championing coins and crypto firms that traders treated as political rocket fuel.\n\nThe franchise came together fast. Hours before the inauguration, Trump launched a memecoin and promoted it on social media. First Lady Melania Trump soon followed with her own token. Later in the year, Trump family–affiliated World Liberty Financial made its WLFI token tradable and available to retail investors. A set of Trump-adjacent trades followed. Eric Trump co-founded American Bitcoin, a publicly traded miner that went public via a merger in September.\nEach debut sparked a rally. Each proved ephemeral. As of Dec. 23, Trump’s memecoin was floundering, off more than 80% from its January high. Melania’s was down nearly 99%, according to CoinGecko. American Bitcoin had sunk about 80% from its September peak.\nPolitics gave the trades a push. The laws of speculation pulled them back down. Even with a friend in the White House, these trades couldn’t escape crypto’s core pattern: prices rise, leverage floods in, and liquidity dries up. Bitcoin, still the bellwether, is on track for an annual loss after slumping from its October peak. For Trump-linked assets, politics offered momentum, but no protection.\n\nStory Continues\nAI Trade: The Next Big Short? The trade was revealed in a routine filing, yet its impact was anything but routine. Scion Asset Management disclosed on Nov. 3 that it held protective put options in Nvidia Corp. ( NVDA ) and Palantir Technologies Inc. ( PLTR ) — stocks at the center of the artificial intelligence trade that’s powered the market’s rally for three years. While not a whale-sized hedge fund, Scion commands attention due to the person who runs it: Michael Burry, who earned fame as a market prophet in book and movie about the mortgage bubble that led to the 2008 crisis.\n\nThe strike prices were startling: Nvidia’s was 47% below where the stock had just closed, while Palantir’s was 76% below. But some mystery lingered: Due to limited reporting requirements, it was unclear if the puts — contracts that give an investor the right to sell a stock at a certain price by a certain date — were part of a more complicated trade. And the filing offered just a snapshot of Scion’s books on Sept. 30, Yet skepticism about the lofty valuations and massive spending plans of major AI players had been building like a pile of dry kindling. Burry’s disclosure landed like a freshly struck match.\nNvidia, the largest stock in the world, tumbled in reaction, as did Palantir, though they later regained ground. The Nasdaq also dipped.\nIt’s impossible to know exactly how much Burry made. One bread crumb he left was a post on X saying he paid $1.84 for the Palantir puts; those options went on to gain as much as 101% in less than three weeks. The filing crystallized doubts simmering beneath a market dominated by a narrow group of AI-linked stocks, heavy passive inflows and subdued volatility. Whether the trade proves prescient or premature, it underscored how quickly even the most dominant market narratives can turn once belief begins to crack.\n\nDefense Stocks: New World Order A geopolitical shift has led to huge gains in a sector once deemed toxic by asset managers: European defense. Trump’s plans to take a step back from funding Ukraine’s military sent European governments into a spending spree, giving a huge lift to shares of regional defense firms — from the roughly 150% year-to-date rally in Germany’s Rheinmetall AG as of Dec. 23, to Italy’s Leonardo SpA more than 90% ascent during the period.\nMoney managers who once saw the sector as too controversial to touch amid environmental, social and governance concerns changed their tune and a number of funds even redefined their mandates.\n“We had taken defense out of our ESG funds until the beginning of this year,” said Pierre Alexis Dumont, chief investment officer at Sycomore Asset Management. “There was a change of paradigm, and when there is a change of paradigm, one has to be responsible and also defend one’s values. So we’re focusing on defensive weapons.”\n\nFrom goggle makers to chemicals producers, and even a printing company, stocks were snapped up in a mad rush. A Bloomberg basket of European defense stocks was up more than 70% for the year as of Dec. 23. The boom spilled into credit markets as well, with firms only tangentially linked to defense attracting hordes of prospective lenders. Banks even started selling “European Defence Bonds,” modeled on green bonds except in this case ringfenced for borrowers like weapons manufacturers. It marked a repricing of defense as a public good rather than a reputational liability — and a reminder that when geopolitics shifts, capital tends to follow faster than ideology.\nDebasement Trade: Fact or Fiction? Heavy debt loads in major economies such as the US, France and Japan — and a lack of political appetite to confront them — pushed some investors in 2025 to tout gold and alternative assets like crypto, while cooling enthusiasm for government bonds and the US dollar. The idea gained traction under a bearish label: the “debasement trade,” a nod to historic episodes when rulers such as Nero diluted the value of money to cope with fiscal strain.\nThe narrative reached a crescendo in October, when concerns over the US fiscal outlook collided with the longest government shutdown on record. Investors searched for shelter beyond the dollar. That month, gold and Bitcoin both rose to records — a rare moment for assets often cast as rivals.\nAs a story, debasement offered a clean explanation for a messy macro backdrop. As a trade, it proved more complicated. Bitcoin has since slumped amid a broader retreat in cryptocurrencies. The dollar stabilized somewhat. Treasuries, far from collapsing, are on track for their best year since 2020 — a reminder that fears of fiscal erosion can coexist with powerful demand for safe assets, particularly when growth slows and policy rates peak.\n\nElsewhere, price action told a different story. Swings in metals from copper to aluminum, and even silver, were driven at least as much by Donald Trump’s tariff policies and macro forces as by concerns about currency debasement, blurring the line between inflation hedging and old-fashioned supply shocks. Gold, meanwhile, has kept powering ahead, reaching new all-time highs. In that corner of the market, the debasement trade endured — less as a sweeping judgment on fiat, more as a focused bet on rates, policy and protection.\nKorean Stocks: K-Pop Move over, K-drama. When it comes to plot twists and thrills, it’s hard to beat this year’s action in South Korea’s stock market. Fueled by President Lee Jae Myung’s efforts to boost the country’s capital markets, the benchmark equity index rocketed more than 70% in 2025 through Dec. 22, headed toward his aspirational goal of 5000 and handily topping the charts among major stock gauges worldwide.\n\nIt’s rare to see a political leader publicly set an index level as a goal, and Lee’s “Kospi 5000” campaign drew little attention when it was first announced. Now, more and more Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) and Citigroup Inc. ( C ) think it’s achievable in 2026, helped in part by the global AI boom, which has increased demand for South Korean stocks as Asia’s go-to artificial intelligence trade.\nThere is one notable absence from the Kospi’s world-beating rally: local retail investors. While Lee often reminds voters that he was once a retail investor himself before entering public office, his reform agenda has yet to persuade domestic investors that the market is a durable buy-and-hold proposition. Even as foreign money has poured into Korean equities, local mom-and-pop investors have been net sellers, channeling a record $33 billion into US stocks and chasing higher-risk bets ranging from crypto to leveraged exchange-traded funds overseas.\n\nOne side effect has been pressure on the currency. As capital flowed outward, the won weakened, a reminder that even blockbuster equity rallies can mask lingering skepticism at home.\nBitcoin Showdown: Chanos v Saylor There are two sides to every story. In the case of short-seller Jim Chanos’s arbitrage play involving Bitcoin hoarder Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc., there were also two big personalities, and a trade that was fast becoming a referendum on crypto-era capitalism.\nIn early 2025, as Bitcoin soared and Strategy’s shares went through the roof, Chanos saw an opportunity. The rally in Strategy had stretched the premium the company’s shares enjoyed relative to its Bitcoin holdings, something the legendary investor saw as unsustainable. So he decided to short Strategy and go long Bitcoin, announcing the move in May when the premium was still wide.\n\nChanos and Saylor started publicly trading barbs. “I don’t think he understands what our business model is,” Saylor told Bloomberg TV in June about Chanos, who in turn, called Saylor’s explanations “complete financial gibberish” in an X post.\nStrategy’s shares hit a record in July, marking a 57% year-to-date gain, but as the number of so-called digital asset treasury firms exploded and crypto token prices fell from their highs, Strategy shares — and those of its copycats — began to suffer and the company’s premium to Bitcoin shrank. Chanos’s wager was paying off.\nFrom the time Chanos made his short call on Strategy public through Nov. 7, the date he said he exited from the position, Strategy shares dropped 42%. Beyond the P&L, it illustrated a recurring crypto boom-and-bust pattern: balance sheets inflated by confidence, and confidence sustained by rising prices and financial engineering. It works until belief falters — at which point the premium stops being a feature and starts being the problem.\n\nJapanese Bonds: Widowmaker to Rainmaker If there was one bet that repeatedly burned macro investors in the past few decades, it’s the infamous “widowmaker” wager against Japanese bonds. The reasoning behind the trade always seemed simple. Japan carried a vast public debt, and so the thinking was that interest rates just had to rise sooner or later to lure in enough buyers. Investors, therefore, borrowed bonds and sold them, expecting prices to fall once reality asserted itself. For years, however, that logic proved premature and expensive, as the central bank’s loose policies kept borrowing costs low and punished anyone who tried to rush the outcome. No longer.\n\nIn 2025, the widowmaker turned rainmaker as yields on benchmark government bonds surged across the board, making the $7.4 trillion Japan debt market a short-seller’s dream. The triggers spanned everything from interest rate hikes to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi unleashing the country’s biggest burst of spending since pandemic restrictions eased. Yields on benchmark 10-year JGBs soared past 2% to reach levels not seen in decades, while those on 30-year paper advanced more than a full percentage point to an all-time high. A Bloomberg gauge of Japanese government bond returns fell more than 6% this year through Dec. 23, the worst-performing major market in the world.\nFund managers from Schroders to Jupiter Asset Management to RBC BlueBay Asset Management discussed selling JGBs in some form during the year and investors and strategists are betting the trade has room to run, as benchmark policy rates edge higher. On top of that, the Bank of Japan is trimming its bond purchases, pressuring yields. And with the nation boasting the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio in the developed world by a wide margin, bearishness to JGBs is likely to persist.\n\nCredit Scraps: Playing Hardball Pays Some of 2025’s richest credit payoffs didn’t come from turnaround bets, but from turning on fellow investors. The dynamic, known as “creditor-on-creditor violence,” paid off big for funds like Pacific Investment Management Co. and King Street Capital Management, who waged a calculated campaign around KKR-backed Envision Healthcare.\n\nWhen Envision, a hospital staffing company, ran aground after the Covid-19 pandemic, it needed a loan from new investors. But raising new debt meant pledging assets already spoken for. While many debt holders formed a group to oppose the new financing, Pimco, King Street and Partners Group broke ranks. Their support enabled a vote to allow the collateral — a stake in Envision’s valuable ambulatory-surgery business Amsurg — to be released by the old lenders and used to back the new debt.\nThe funds became holders of Amsurg-backed debt that eventually converted into Amsurg equity. Then Amsurg sold to Ascension Health this year for $4 billion. The funds who spurned their peers generated returns of around 90%, by one measure, demonstrating the payoff from waging such internecine battles. The lesson: in today’s credit markets, governed by loose documentation and fragmented creditor groups, cooperation is optional. Being right is not always enough. The bigger risk is being outflanked.\n\nFannie-Freddie: Revenge of the 'Toxic Twins' Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance giants that have been under Washington’s control since the financial crisis, have long been the subject of speculation over when and how they would be released from the government’s grip. Boosters such as hedge fund manager Bill Ackman loaded up on the two in the hopes of scoring a windfall on any privatization plan, but the shares languished for years in over-the-counter trading as the status quo prevailed.\n\nThen came Donald Trump’s re-election, which catapulted the stocks into a meme-like zeal on optimism the new administration would take steps to free up the companies. In 2025, the excitement ratcheted up even more: The shares soared 367% from the start of the year to their high in September and remain big winners for 2025.\nDriving the momentum to its peak this year was word in August that the administration was contemplating an IPO that could value the enterprises at around $500 billion or more, involving selling 5% to 15% of their stock to raise about $30 billion. While the shares have wavered from their September high amid skepticism about when, and whether, an IPO will actually materialize, many remain confident in the story.\n\nAckman in November unveiled a proposal he pitched to the White House, which calls for relisting Fannie and Freddie on the New York Stock Exchange, writing down the Treasury’s senior-preferred stake and exercising the government’s option to acquire nearly 80% of the common stock. Even Michael Burry joined the party, announcing a bullish position in early December and musing in a 6,000-word blog post that the companies which once needed the government to save them from insolvency may be “toxic twins no more.”\nTurkey Carry Trade: Cooked The Turkish carry trade was a consensus favorite for emerging-market investors after a stellar 2024. With local bond yields above 40% and a central bank backing a stable dollar peg, traders piled in — borrowing cheaply abroad to buy high-yield Turkish assets. That drew billions from firms like Deutsche Bank, Millennium Partners and Gramercy — some of them on the ground in Turkey on March 19, the day the trade blew up in minutes.\n\nIt was on that morning that Turkish police raided the home of Istanbul’s popular opposition mayor and took him into custody, sparking protests — and a frenzied selloff in the lira that the central bank was unable to contain. “People got caught very much by surprise and won’t go back in a hurry,” Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale SA in Paris, said at the time.\nBy the end of the day, outflows from Turkish lira-denominated assets were estimated at around $10 billion, and the market never really recovered. As of Dec. 23, the lira was some 17% weaker against the dollar for the year, one of the world’s worst performers. The episode served as a reminder that high interest rates can reward risk-takers, but they offer no protection against sudden political shocks.\n\nDebt Markets: Cockroach Alert Credit markets in 2025 were unsettled not by a single spectacular collapse, but by a series of smaller ones that exposed uncomfortable habits. Companies once considered routine borrowers ran into trouble, leaving lenders nursing steep losses.\nSaks Global restructured $2.2 billion in bonds after making only a single interest payment, and the restructured debt is itself now trading at less than 60 cents on the dollar. New Fortress Energy’s newly-exchanged bonds lost more than half their value in the span of a year. The bankruptcies of Tricolor and then First Brands wiped out billions in debt holdings in a matter of weeks. In some cases, sophisticated fraud was at the root of the collapse. In others, rosy projections failed to materialize. In every case, investors were left to answer for how they justified taking large credit gambles on companies with little to no proof they’d be able to repay the debt.\nYears of low defaults and loose money eroded standards, from lender protections to basic underwriting. Lenders to both First Brands and Tricolor had failed to discover the borrowers were allegedly double-pledging assets and co-mingling collateral that backed various loans.\nThose lenders included JPMorgan, whose chief executive Jamie Dimon put the market on alert in October when he colorfully warned of more trouble to come, saying, “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” A theme for 2026.\n—With assistance from Benjamin Harvey, Kerim Karakaya, Youkyung Lee, Cormac Mullen, Michael P.

      "Content": "Nvidia's \"Aqui-Hire\" of Groq Eliminates a Potential Competitor and Marks Its Entrance Into the Non-GPU, AI Inference Chip Space\n\nBeth McKenna, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 12:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia is entering into a non-exclusive licensing agreement for Groq’s AI inference technology.\nNvidia's reportedly paying $20 billion for this deal, about three times Groq's most recent valuation.\nGroq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross -- who will join Nvidia along with other Groq personnel -- is widely considered the creator of Google’s TPU.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOn Friday, artificial intelligence (AI) chip start-up Groq announced via a very brief press release that it \"has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) for Groq's inference technology.\"\nThe deal also includes Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, Sunny Madra, Groq's president, and other members of the Groq team joining Nvidia to \"help advance and scale the licensed technology.\"\nThis was a smart move by Nvidia, in my view. Nvidia has tons of cash, and it makes sense to use it to accomplish two goals at once: eliminate a potential competitor and obtain a new chip technology to offer its customers.\nHere's what investors should know.\nAs close to an acquisition as it gets That Nvidia is not only entering into a non-exclusive license with Groq, but also hiring its founder-CEO, president, and reportedly key engineering talent, makes this deal an \"acqui-hire\" and as close to a full-fledged acquisition as possible.\nGranted, Groq will reportedly continue to operate, with its CFO taking over the CEO position, and operate its GroqCloud. However, with the founder -- who is the mastermind behind the company's tech -- leaving, it appears that all advancements in Groq's tech will now be made under Nvidia.\n\nNo doubt, Nvidia structured the deal to avoid potential regulatory scrutiny. The company already dominates the AI chip space, so any acquisition that could potentially increase its current or future market share further would likely garner a very close look from regulators.\nNvidia-Groq deal size The deal's size wasn't disclosed by the companies involved, but one major financial outlet has reported it at $20 billion, which would be Nvidia's largest deal to date, by far. Its prior largest deal was its $6.9 billion acquisition of high-performance networking specialist Mellanox Technologies in 2020. That acquisition proved to be extremely successful, as Nvidia's networking business is booming.\nIf the $20 billion is accurate, it represents a huge premium over Groq's most recent valuation. After a $750 million financing round in September, Groq's valuation was $6.9 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia tried to buy leading central processing unit (CPU) chip designer Arm Holdings in 2020, but that massive deal was called off due to significant antitrust concerns from regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nGroq's chip technology Groq's chips are language processing units (LPUs) designed for AI inferencing. Inferencing is the second step in the two-step AI process, following training. Training involves using vast amounts of data to teach an AI model, while inference is the deployment of that model to generate answers to a user's questions, images, and other outputs.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have long dominated the AI training stage. They're also leaders in AI inference, but they face growing competition in this area. Competitors include Advanced Micro Devices ' (AMD) data center GPUs, as well as custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that Broadcom and Marvell Technology are making for big tech company customers. Until now, the big tech companies have just used their custom AI chips internally and, where applicable, also in their cloud computing services.\nHowever, it was recently revealed that social media giant Meta Platforms is considering buying Alphabet 's Google custom AI chip, called a tensor processing unit (TPU), for inferencing purposes in its data centers.\n\nThe big tech companies are exploring alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs for two reasons: to reduce costs and to diversify their supply chains. Relying on just a single supplier for anything can be risky.\nGroq's goal was for its LPUs to be a big player in the AI inference market. The company claims its technology is faster than alternatives for specific inference applications. Its plans included selling its chips for less money than Nvidia GPUs and perhaps other offerings.\nIt makes good sense that Nvidia views Groq's tech as potentially very valuable and evidently viewed the company as a potential, significant future rival. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross is widely considered the creator of Google's TPU. Granted, he didn't create this chip alone, but he was the force behind the effort to develop it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "What’s next for Nvidia stock in 2026\n\nVuk Zdinjak\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:50 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nTo understand what is in the cards for Nvidia in 2026, we need to go back and take a look at the most important moves the company made in 2025 and estimate how they will develop in 2026.\nNvidia ( NVDA ) ended the year with a deal that has left many investors and analysts surprised, and even a little bit confused. Contributing to the confusion was the fact that when CNBC broke the news, it reported that Nvidia would acquire Groq for approximately $20 billion, but once the official announcement from Groq came out, it turned out that the deal was a non-exclusive licensing deal and talent grab rather than a company acquisition.\n\nHere are key questions Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya raised about the deal, in a research note shared with TheStreet:\nWhat does the “non-exclusive licensing agreement” referred to by Groq imply?\nCould Nvidia have developed this technology on its own?\nCan Groq cloud, still an independent company, undercut Nvidia’s LPU-based\nservice with lower pricing?\nDespite having these questions and calling the deal surprising, Arya also said the deal is strategic and complementary. He reiterated a buy rating and the price target for Nvidia stock of $275.\nTo understand the Groq deal, we need to delve into what Groq technology is about and what the dominant strategies in the tech industry have morphed into.\nWhat is Groq? Groq’s main business is GroqCloud, an artificial intelligence inference platform. AI inference is the process of generating a response from the AI model that has already been trained.\nGroq offers developers a way to run AI models on the company’s hardware and obtain responses very quickly for a competitive price. The reason a relatively small startup can compete with big players and offer competitive pricing for AI inference is its hardware.\n\nThe company’s inference platform uses application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips, which it calls the Language Processing Unit (LPU), developed and optimized specifically for LLM inference.\nGPUs can be used for many different calculations including gaming, 3D rendering, crypto mining, AI training, and AI inference, but Groq’s LPU chips have only one purpose — AI inference.\nThis means they have razor-sharp focus, and that makes them many times as efficient at that particular task.\nWhat is Nvidia getting from the deal with Groq? When Gemini 3 launched, Google touted that it had been trained 100% on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and of course, it is doing inference on TPUs, too. You may have guessed correctly that TPUs are also ASIC chips.\nFollowing the news about Gemini Nvidia’s post on X ( formerly Twitter ):\n\"We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google. NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions.\"\n\nRelated: Bank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\nThe fact that Nvidia felt it needed to address Gemini in its post showed that the company is worried about the competitive power of well-designed ASIC chips, and now we have proof.\nGroq’s announcement about the deal with Nvidia says: “As part of this agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq’s founder, Sunny Madra, Groq’s president, and other members of the Groq team will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology.”\nCan you guess what Jonathan Ross’s job was at Google? He was one of the designers of Google’s first generation of TPUs, of course. Nvidia’s decision to license Groq’s LPU tech stack and to “acqui-hire” its talent team is a quiet admission that ASIC chips represent the future of AI.\n\nWhat does the non-exclusive licensing part of the deal with Groq mean for Nvidia? A non-exclusive licensing deal was the only way to avoid government scrutiny. The approach here is a combination of Apple and Meta strategies. Apple manufactures custom ARM chips and has a non-exclusive licensing agreement with ARM.\nBut what makes Apple chips great is the talent that only Apple can attract; so far, competitor ARM chips have been unable to catch up.\n\nNvidia has secured top talent in this transaction by mimicking Meta’s move, which was an investment in Scale AI. The whole deal with Scale AI turned out to be a lot more about getting Alexandr Wang to lead Meta’s Superintelligence unit than about investing in Scale AI.\nThis is the new dominant strategy in the tech space where talent is more valuable than whole companies.\nAssuming that Nvidia's contract with Groq doesn’t have some special quirks, non-exclusive licensing should mean that other companies can license the LPU designs and build similar LPUs. Nvidia is content, as it isn’t getting the talent, and it's betting they won’t be building anything impressive with just the license.\nThe second of Arya’s questions, whether Nvidia could have built LPUs on its own, seems like a superfluous one. Even if the company could have developed such chips (assuming no patent issues), it could not have done that in a desirable timeframe.\n\nThis underscores my thesis that Nvidia started to worry about TPUs a little late.\nWider implications of the Groq-Nvidia licensing deal To answer the third of Arya’s questions, we need to first determine Nvidia’s game plan for LPUs. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wrote the following.\n“We plan to integrate Groq’s low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads.”\n\nHuang has promoted the idea of AI factories for some time, and he appears increasingly focused on it. This new LPU plan has finally made the whole thing click for me, and the sudden shift to inference is extremely interesting and revealing.\nAfter all the hype of chasing AGI or Superintelligence, the market is shifting toward inference. You’d think that as long as we haven’t reached that amazing life-changing technology, the training capabilities would be of paramount importance.\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nThe problem is that LLMs have peaked, and although the shift to inference and “AI factories” is Huang’s stealthy pivot, LPUs are just one part of the puzzle. Nvidia recently announced the Nvidia Nemotron 3 family of open models, data, and libraries. These models are the key component of the latest pivot, which is AI factories and sovereign AI.\n\nData ownership, privacy, and model fine-tuning are some of the reasons any company or organization that can afford to have a sovereign AI would want it. This is why open-source, and at least open-weight, models are the future, just like ASIC chips.\nWe can see a slow, ongoing shift toward this, as hundreds of academic papers presented at NeurIPS, the premier AI conference, used Qwen, as reported by Wired .\n“A lot of scientists are using Qwen because it’s the best open-weight model,” Andy Konwinski, cofounder of the Laude Institute, a nonprofit established to advocate for open U.S. models, told Wired.\nHuang’s plan seems to be a complete sovereign AI solution that offers the fastest inference for the lowest power consumption offered by LPUs, combined with GPUs for training, and Nemotron as a starter software platform.\n\nArya also wrote this in his note: “We envision future NVDA platforms where GPU and LPU co-exist in a rack, connected seamlessly with NVDA’s NVLInk networking fabric.”\nI will adamantly say that this idea is incorrect.\nRelated: Bank of America resets Micron stock price target, rating\nLPUs have a completely different memory model, based on so-called SRAM memory, which is very expensive and very fast. According to Groq, its LPUs connect directly via a plesiosynchronous protocol, aligning hundreds of chips to act as a single core.\nGroq calls its chip-to-chip interconnect technology RealScale. LPUs have one other key difference compared to GPUs: they are deterministic. These architectural differences mean that LPU and GPU chips can’t work together to run the same software (perform inference), and placing them in the same racks would only cause problems and complicate matters.\n\nEvery LPU has very little memory; a vast number of LPUs are needed to run big LLM models. This will be the deciding factor on how many racks of LPUs will be needed to run the model.\nIt is certainly possible for Nvidia to develop its LPUs to be a lot different compared to Groq’s, to allow for the mixing with GPUs in the same racks, but in that case, they would take a lot more time to develop. I believe that for Huang’s plan for AI factories, speed of development takes priority.\nIn any case, a launch of Nvidia’s LPUs in 2026 is highly unlikely, considering that chip design takes at least a year. The Groq deal and inference pivot tell us we need to watch what happens to OpenAI very closely.\nNvidia deal with OpenAI remains in question On December 19, Reuters reported that SoftBank Group is racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI. Considering that SoftBank’s pledge was to invest that money by the end of the year, they are cutting it pretty close.\nWaiting until the last moment to follow through makes the company look unsure if it is a good investment.\n\nNvidia’s agreement with OpenAI to invest up to $100 billion in the startup is still not finalized, according to a Reuters report from December 2. OpenAI doesn’t expect to be cash flow positive until 2030, according to Forbes .\nIt's easy to see why Nvidia isn’t rushing to finalize the deal with OpenAI. The best-case scenario for OpenAI is that Nvidia is waiting for it to have an IPO first, while the worst-case scenario, of course, is that there is no deal.\nOpenAI failing to secure more investments will have a domino effect that will hurt Oracle, Nvidia, and Microsoft the most. Nvidia’s AI factories strategy is a good way for the company to protect itself from dependence on OpenAI as a customer.\nWhat can we expect from Nvidia's partnership with Intel? According to the leaks, Intel Serpent Lake is the first chip that will feature an integrated Nvidia GPU, which won’t launch before 2027. Even that is optimistic, and 2028 is more likely, as reported by PC GAMER .\nNvidia’s revenue mix and estimates for 2026 The latest Bank of America research note that includes estimates for Nvidia is from November. Arya and his team estimate that Nvidia's revenue for fiscal year 2026 will be $212.83 billion, and non-GAAP EPS will be $4.66. Nvidia missed consensus estimates in Q3 for its revenue from gaming by 4%. There have been rumors that Nvidia is looking to cut gaming GPU production by up to 40% in 2026 due to VRAM supply issues, as reported by PC GAMER .\n\nWe can expect that due to the memory industry going all-in on AI, skyrocketing RAM prices will have a side effect of fewer gaming PCs being sold and built, so the gaming revenue could easily miss the consensus again.\nIn the automotive segment, a similar situation is evident, as Nvidia missed consensus estimates for Q3 by 6%. The company's guidance for Q4 is significantly lower than consensus estimates of $700 million, at $592 million.\nThe company’s guidance for the pro visualization segment for Q4 is optimistic at $760 million and higher than the consensus $643 million. OEM, including the crypto segment outlook for Q4, is close to consensus at $174 million compared to $172 million.\nNon data-center revenue segments look tiny compared to Nvidia's outlook of $51.2 billion and consensus estimates of $57 billion for Q4. As the company focuses more on its highest-margin products, revenue from non-data center segments will continue to shrink.\n\nThe Vera Rubin line launch will be the defining moment of 2026, because if the chips bring the promised performance and efficiency uplift, it will destroy any doubts regarding Nvidia’s supremacy.\nThe next year will be the year of Nvidia, especially if the rumor that Google failed to secure HBM shipments for its TPUs, as reported by Android Headlines , proves true.\nI wouldn’t be surprised if this rumor is true, as Huang is always several steps ahead of the competition, except for the moment when he underestimated Google TPUs.\nRelated: Veteran analyst has blunt message on Intel stock\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 28, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "The Next Stock-Split Stock That Could Make You Rich\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:11 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nAAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms is trading at a price where big tech peers have announced stock splits.\nIf Meta splits its stock, it could benefit from increased liquidity and broader investor participation.\nWith nearly 3.5 billion daily active users and aggressive capital investments in AI infrastructure, the company’s core digital advertising business continues to grow at an impressive pace.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have soared 443% over the past three years, closing at $661.50 on Dec. 22. At this share price, Meta now trades in the same range where companies such as Apple , Nvidia , and Tesla previously announced forward stock splits .\nWhile Meta has never executed a forward stock split since going public, the company's rising share price and growing earnings power have meaningfully increased the probability of a split in 2026.\nStock splits don't change the value of any investor's holdings, but here's why a Meta stock split could prove beneficial for investors, if it were to enact one.\n\nUpside drivers Although stock splits do not change a company's fundamentals, they tend to improve liquidity and broaden the investor base as they lower the per-share price (while increasing the number of shares), which can support higher trading activity and market valuation over time. While the availability of fractional shares has reduced some barriers to entry in stocks with high nominal share prices, research suggests that many retail investors still prefer owning full shares.\n\nAccording to data from Bank of America 's Research Investment Committee, companies that split their stock reported an average total return of 25.4% in the 12 months following the split announcement, more than double the 11.9% average return of the benchmark S&P 500 index in the same time frame. Hence, Meta's stock could see an incremental upside from improved liquidity and broader participation following a stock split.\nMeta reaches almost 3.5 billion people daily across its family of apps, giving it unmatched global scale and pricing power in digital advertising. Management has also guided for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, mainly for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nThese investments are already showing results. Meta's AI-driven ad tools are improving ad targeting efficiency and advertiser returns on ad spend. The company is also expanding its addressable market with newer ad surfaces, including on WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nHence, for long-term investors, a potential stock split could serve as an accelerator on top of the company's robust fundamentals, which can drive up its share prices in the coming months. I think Meta could be a stock-split stock that could make investors rich.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now? Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Wall Street remains bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) despite the ongoing challenges stemming from increased competition in the AI chip sector and uncertainty regarding exporting to China amidst the geopolitical challenges.\n​Amidst this situation, Wall Street’s 12 month average price target on the stock represents more than 38% upside from the current level. A recent December 21 report by CNBC highlighted recent analysts’ ratings explaining the Street’s optimism.\n​The report noted Bernstein’s analyst Stacy Rasgon’s December 19 rating. The analyst maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $275 price target. Rasgon maintained his bullish sentiment after a virtual meeting with Stewart Stecker, senior director of investor relations at Nvidia. The analyst noted that the company’s $500 billion outlook released in October is expected to see further upside, driven by new recent deals with Anthropic, OpenAI, and the collaboration with the Middle East.\n\n​Moreover, the talk with Stewart Stecker highlighted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) acknowledges that Google is at least two years ahead of the company due to its TPU program. However, the senior director of investor relations at Nvidia noted that Google will find it difficult to deploy these chips as they are designed for specific model structures. Therefore, Nvidia’s programmable platform solutions remain the best for cloud infrastructure.\n​In addition, on December 14, Blayne Curtis from Jefferies also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $250 price target.\n​NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) highlighted that Nemotron 3 Nano is capable of delivering 4x higher throughput than Nemotron 2 Nano. Also, it delivers the most tokens per second for multi-agent systems at scale through the breakthrough hybrid mixture-of-experts architecture.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "What’s next for IonQ stock in 2026\n\nMoz Farooque\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:31 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nNVDA\n\nNot too long ago, AI felt like something you’d argue about after watching a sci-fi movie on the weekend.\nThen ChatGPT hit the screens in late 2022, and all of a sudden, the conversation stopped being theoretical.\nInvestors who paid attention benefited immensely by investing in pure-play AI and AI-adjacent stocks.\n\nFor perspective, since late 2022, Nvidia alone has surged from nearly $422.5 billion to about $4.63 trillion in market cap (adding nearly $4.2 trillion in value)\nQuantum computing stocks feel like they are at that same juncture at this point.\nAt its core, quantum computing is about doing math differently.\nPut simply, traditional computers handle problems one step at a time, sort of like checking doors at a hotel one by one.\nOn the flipside, quantum computers can check several doors at once. It might not seem like much until it starts solving impossible problems and changing how drugs are developed, products are moved, and data is secured.\nIn fact, according to McKinsey, quantum technologies could potentially create more than $1.3 trillion in value by 2035.\n\n2025 in particular was a huge year for quantum. Companies started showing real-world progress, governments began paying attention, and investors took notice.\nPerhaps the clearest beneficiary of this shift has been IonQ ( IONQ ), a rare pure-play in a space still dominated by tech giants.\nThat said, the question heading into 2026 is likely to be a ‘show me’ year for quantum players like IonQ, which, if they could turn scientific progress into something Wall Street easily understands in terms of revenues, customers, and long-term expansion.\n2025 was the year quantum got real 2025 will probably go down as the year quantum broke the perception around it perpetually being in ‘almost there’ mode.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nProgress became visible, measurable, and a lot more commercial at the same time.\nHere are some of the biggest milestones making the shift impossible to ignore.\nGoogle’s Willow chip: Google showed off its powerful 105-qubit processor in late 2024, crossing a critical threshold in error correction. In 2025, it moved from theory to action, solving a Quantum Echo physics problem with a 13,000× speedup that would have taken a classical supercomputer far longer to complete.\nIBM ’s long-term roadmap: IBM laid out a powerful fault-tolerant plan as it looked to target a massive 200 logical qubits by 2029 and scale toward a mind-boggling 1,000 logical qubits in the early 2030s.\nMicrosoft’s topological bet: Microsoft introduced its “Majorana 1” prototype while demonstrating 28 logical qubits encoded within 112 physical qubits, underscoring a future where error correction is significantly less resource-intensive.\nFunding and adoption accelerated: North of $2 billion was poured into quantum startups in 2024 , followed by another $1.25 billion in 2025, as governments and enterprises expanded cloud-based pilots, signaling a critical shift.\n\nStory Continues\nIonQ is a different kind of quantum bet IonQ is one of the few pure-play stocks you can invest in, which is taking a much more patient approach compared to its rivals.\nRelated: Cathie Wood drops $1.3 million on healthcare stock\nAlthough larger businesses, such as IBM and Google, continue to focus on building machines with as many qubits as possible, IonQ is focusing more on how these qubits actually function. Hence, it’s essentially chasing accuracy over raw horsepower.\n\nThat level of focus has paid off.\nIn 2025, IonQ reached a massive performance milestone, showing its machines are able to handle significantly more complex problems than their size would suggest.\nCompetitors like Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum take different approaches, and have also found success, but IonQ has done the best job so far in effectively turning complex science into an investment vehicle.\nHere are major U.S.-listed quantum stocks with 2025 year-to-date gains as of 12/26/2025:\nIonQ : +10.13%\nRigetti Computing : +46.66%\nD-Wave Quantum : +201.07%\nQuantum Computing Inc. : −35.59%\nDefiance Quantum ETF : +38%\nSource: ytdreturn.com\nIonQ’s major milestones in 2025 IonQ ’s 2025 was essentially a combination of technical breakthroughs, early commercial wins, and growing investor attention.\nRelated: Moody’s offers sobering view on Fed rate cuts\nHere are the main highlights of the year:\nReached #AQ 64 performance: IonQ’s powerful new Tempo system struck #AQ 64 three months ahead of schedule, doubling its previous computing power while opening the door to powerful real-world applications such as drug discovery and energy optimization.\nSet a fidelity record: IonQ achieved 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity , the first business to go past that threshold, reducing errors and laying groundwork for much larger systems, including a planned 256-qubit system in 2026 .\nLanded a landmark system sale: IonQ inked an agreement to deliver a massive 100-qubit system to South Korea’s national research institute, KISTI .\nProved real-world advantage: In partnering with Ansys , IonQ beat classical supercomputers by 12% on a practical engineering simulation.\nExpanded aggressively: IonQ’s fundamentals are in good shape, backed by timely acquisitions and partnerships, along with cloud availability through AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, boosting sales to $39.9 million in Q3 2025 , up 221% year-over-year .\n\n\"I am pleased to report that we once again beat the high end of our revenue guidance, this time by 37%. We are also raising our revenue expectations for the full year to $110 million at the high end of guidance,” said Niccolo de Masi, Chairman and CEO of IonQ.\nIonQ in 2026: What to watch next After a breakout 2025, IonQ heads into 2026 with a ton of expectations.\nRelated: Veteran analyst has blunt message on Intel stock\nHere’s what investors should be watching:\nA push to 256 qubits: As mentioned earlier, IonQ is planning to show off its 256-qubit system in 2026 , and if successful, that could move its computing power into triple digits.\nDelivering the KISTI system: The development and deployment of its 100-qubit Tempo system for South Korea’s KISTI will be a critical real-world test, unlocking more government and enterprise orders.\nExpanding partnerships and use cases: IonQ has existing relationships with businesses such as Amazon, NVIDIA, Hyundai, and Airbus, and new deals would help validate commercial demand.\nTurning progress into revenue: With 2025 sales still under $100 million annually, even doubling or tripling sales in 2026 is possible.\n\nKey risks to keep in mind:\nScaling risk is real: Moving from dozens of qubits to hundreds is a tremendous engineering leap, to say the least, and any delays or other issues can quickly reset expectations.\nCompetition is closing in: Tech giants, including the likes of IBM and Google, have significantly deeper pockets and parallel roadmaps.\nIonQ's latest price targets IonQ stock is currently trading at nearly $46 ; that said, here are three major analyst price targets heading into next year:\nJefferies: $100 (Street-high)\nMizuho : $90 (Buy)\nWedbush: $60 (Outperform, initiated December 2025)\nRelated: Longtime analyst resets Nvidia stock price target ahead of 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 28, 2025, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

      "Content": "What Is the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 8:36 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Chip designers such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom serve as the backbone of generative AI development.\nWhile chip designers steal the spotlight, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is playing a hugely important supporting role in the background.\nAs demand for AI chips and data centers accelerates, Taiwan Semi is poised for explosive long-term growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nFor the last three years, investing in semiconductor stocks has proven to be a profitable decision given the critical role chips play in the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Companies such as Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices , Broadcom , and Micron Technology have been some of the biggest contributors to the semiconductor industry throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nFlying under the radar is another chip company whose storyline seems muted compared to its peers. That's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , the pick-and-shovel specialist of the chip realm.\nLet's dive into Taiwan Semi's increasingly important role for the future of AI and assess why the stock looks like a no-brainer buying opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon.\nHow does Taiwan Semiconductor benefit from AI? Throughout the AI revolution, hyperscalers such as Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and OpenAI have collectively poured hundreds of billions of dollars into AI-related capital expenditures (capex) -- namely, chips and networking gear for data centers.\nOn the surface, this is great news for the likes of Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. But underneath the surface, it's even better news for Taiwan Semi. Why is that?\n\nTSMC is the largest chip manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue. While Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom design the most-in demand GPUs and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) on the planet, each of these giants relies heavily on Taiwan Semi's cutting-edge fabrication processes.\nIn other words, if Nvidia and its competitors represent the body of the car moving the AI narrative forward, TSMC holds the keys to the ignition.\nTSMC's growth is off the charts Over the last year, Taiwan Semi's revenue has been growing strongly thanks to ongoing demand for AI accelerators. What's interesting to point out is that the company's revenue trajectory is actually steepening. This is largely driven by rising demand for Nvidia's and AMD's next-generation Rubin and MI400 Series chips, as well as increasing investment in custom hardware from cloud infrastructure providers.\n\nStory Continues\nThe more subtle aspect from the financial picture above is Taiwan Semi's expanding profitability profile. Given its near-70% market share, TSMC is able to command enormous pricing power relative to competitors like Intel or Samsung .\nAgainst this backdrop, Taiwan Semi's gross margin is widening -- with excess cash flowing straight to the bottom line. The company is making the most of this new wave of capital by expanding its geographic footprint -- building additional foundries in Arizona, Germany, and Japan.\n\nIs Taiwan Semi stock a good buy right now? At the moment, TSMC boasts a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28.4 -- hovering near its highest level during the AI revolution. If you were to base your investment decision purely off of this metric, you may think Taiwan Semi is overvalued.\nSmart investors understand that TSMC's premium valuation could be warranted, though. McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion market through 2030 -- with the majority of spend allocated toward refining AI workloads.\nIn essence, building out AI-equipped data centers is expected to accelerate throughout the rest of the decade as training and inferencing models becomes more sophisticated and demanding. This is great news for TSMC as it paves the way for long-run visibility across the business.\n\nThe AI infrastructure chapter is still in its early innings. Over the course of the next several years, Taiwan Semi is positioned to benefit from the secular tailwind of rising investment in infrastructure both domestically and abroad.\nTaking this one step further, physical applications such as autonomous systems and robotics are yet to be deployed in a commercial sense. Looking beyond into the 2030s, these use cases are expected to drive additional trillions in economic value.\nShould they achieve some form of adoption and set the stage for the next wave of AI, Taiwan Semi has the potential to benefit immensely beyond where AI stands today -- building large language models (LLMs) and other software-based applications.\nWhen you consider the bigger picture and begin to think longer-term, TSMC's growth potential relative to its valuation looks compelling. So while the stock may not appear dirt cheap at first glance, I think there is ample room for meaningful valuation expansion over the course of the next decade -- making the stock a no-brainer buy right now in my eyes.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

The share price moved further up on December 17, after South China Morning Post reported the company’s chair and CEO, Lisa SU met with the Chinese minister of industry and information technology.\nAccording to the report, Lisa Su affirmed the commitment to deepen its investment in China. The chief executive also noted that China will offer greater corporate opportunities for foreign enterprises, including Advanced Micro Devices.\n​This report comes as President Trump released a statement suggesting eased export control on Nvidia’s H200 chips and also indicated potential relaxation for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. This is an important update for the company as during fiscal 2024, China and Hong Kong combined generated roughly $6.2 billion in revenue for the company, thereby making it the second largest market for AMD.\n\n​That said, Wall Street also maintains a positive outlook on the stock. On December 19, Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but slightly lowered the price target from $279 to $277. On the same day, William Stein from Truist Financial also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $201.06 price target.\n​Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company that manufactures GPUs, microprocessors, and high-performance computing solutions and serves a number of high-growth industries like gaming, data centers, and AI.​\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the First New $2 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTSLA\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Broadcom each have market caps around $1.6 trillion.\nAI is the driving force behind all three stock prices.\nOne of these tech leaders is seeing immediate results from AI spending, and its stock valuation is more attractive right now.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is responsible for adding trillions of dollars in value to a handful of companies over the last few years. Nvidia , for example, briefly touched a $5 trillion market cap this year, thanks to its dominant position in the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). Four other companies sit firmly above the $2 trillion threshold as we approach the new year.\nBut three AI stocks currently have similar market caps around $1.6 trillion as of this writing, and are vying to become the first new $2 trillion company of 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Here's my prediction for the next company to top the milestone, and it could come as soon as next year.\nArtificial intelligence is fueling all three Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom have all seen their stock prices heavily influenced by advances in AI this year.\nMeta stock climbed higher early in the year as its efforts to improve its recommendation algorithms bore fruit. Ad revenue climbed higher as time spent on its apps increased, and ads became more effective. However, the stock took a step back recently as management shared plans to increase its AI-related spending.\n\nTesla's value is heavily tied to its robotaxi service and AI innovations. The stock received a boost over the summer when it launched its robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas. Investors added to those gains on promising progress on the company's next-generation AI chip for its vehicles.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator business has gained momentum in 2025, as the company signed big contracts with OpenAI and Anthropic, the latter of which is buying Alphabet 's Broadcom-designed tensor processing units (TPUs). To that end, Alphabet and Broadcom are seeing excellent progress in shifting more developer workloads to TPUs, which offer greater energy efficiency and cost savings versus Nvidia's GPUs.\nBroadcom stock took a step back after its last earnings report, as many analysts were disappointed with management's expectation that greater AI chip sales would come at a lower gross margin.\nWhile all three of these stocks have a path to a $2 trillion valuation in 2026, I expect Meta Platforms to reach the milestone first. Here's why.\n\nStory continues\nAI-powered earnings growth at an attractive valuation Even with its run rate of $200 billion in annual revenue, Meta is still growing its bottom line quickly. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 20% in the third quarter, and improvements in AI are the reason.\nMeta has seen an increase in both ad impressions and price per ad for eight straight quarters. That indicates that it's increasing user engagement and opening new places within its apps for advertising while making ads more effective.\n\nManagement attributes a shift in its recommendation algorithm to make it more general across formats as the primary reason users are spending more time on its apps. Meta has seen similar improvements by applying the same methodology to its advertising algorithm. In other words, bigger models have directly translated into more revenue.\nThat trend should continue in 2026, as Meta opens up more opportunities for advertising, including on Threads and WhatsApp. It could also begin monetizing Meta AI, its generative AI chatbot. The improvements in its algorithms over the last couple of years should enable it to ramp up advertising quickly without as much negative impact on its pricing as we've seen in the past.\nThe bigger opportunity for Meta in 2026, though, may be the expansion of its generative AI features. It's reportedly working on an AI agent that can manage advertising campaigns for small businesses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly talks about the opportunity to handle everything involved with creating, testing, and optimizing ad campaigns on its platform through an AI agent.\n\nAnd chatbots specializing in sales and customer service for a company could open the door for more businesses to push Facebook and Instagram users to start messaging them through Meta's chat apps.\nWith small- and medium-sized businesses accounting for the bulk of advertisers on Meta's platform, these innovations have the potential to dramatically increase the amount they're willing to spend on ads. If the overhead for these clients is much lower, they can increase their ad spending and scale up their businesses faster.\nThose efforts should fuel another year of strong revenue growth. And while depreciation expense from the increase in AI-related capital expenditures could eat into earnings growth, Meta should be able to manage continued improvements in earnings per share with the help of share repurchases.\n\nThe stock trades for just 26 times forward earnings expectations, which is much lower than Broadcom's multiple and less than one-tenth the multiple Tesla stock trades for. I expect Meta to fetch a higher earnings multiple as it proves its AI spending to be well worth it once again in 2026, pushing its valuation to $2 trillion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy and Hold for at Least a Decade\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:35 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNFLX\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Amazon's AI solutions are getting a lot of attention, but its advertising business is another key tailwind in addition to e-commerce.\nNetflix is getting a lot of coverage for a potential acquisition, but its flagship businesses are sticky on their own.\nNvidia is arguably one of the most popular AI stocks, and for good reason.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCompanies usually perform a stock split when their stock price has risen due to strong performance and management is optimistic about continued growth. The announcement of a split can be interpreted as a bullish signal by company insiders, which may attract more investor interest. Plenty of stocks have initiated splits over the last few years, but not all of these companies are created equal.\nOn that note, here are three stock-split stocks to buy and hold for at least a decade if you have investment capital to put to work right now.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has split its stock four times, with the most recent being a 20-for-1 split in June 2022 following earlier splits in June 1998, January 1999, and September 1999. The 2022 split was a significant event, as it was the first in over two decades. Since that recent split, shares have soared by around 170%.\n\nAmazon Web Services ( AWS ) is the world's leading global cloud infrastructure provider and the key catalyst behind Amazon's exceptional operating profits. The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) presents a significant tailwind for AWS, as companies require massive computing power and infrastructure to support AI applications. Amazon's heavy investment in custom AI chips (like Trainium and Inferentia) positions it to offer cost-effective solutions and maintain its market leadership in the AI era.\nAmazon's advertising business has emerged as a major profit driver, growing faster than its e-commerce business and operating at high margins. By owning the point of sale and leveraging vast amounts of first-party customer data, Amazon provides highly effective, intent-driven advertising opportunities that are a major draw for sellers and brands.\n\nWhile the e-commerce segment's growth rate is maturing, it still has an unrivaled scale and a strong competitive moat built on its vast logistics network, wide selection, and low prices. The company's investments in automation and robotics are expected to further boost efficiency and expand profit margins in the coming years.\nThe Prime membership program, with over 240 million members worldwide, creates strong customer loyalty and a powerful network effect. Its integrated benefits, including fast shipping, streaming business (Prime), and healthcare (Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical), encourage members to spend more within Amazon's ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nIn Q3, net sales grew 13% year over year to $180.2 billion. Amazon reported operating income of $17.4 billion, and AWS delivered accelerated growth to 20% (totaling $33 billion), thanks to its dominance in supporting AI workloads. The advertising segment's revenue rose 22% to $17.7 billion. Amazon still looks like a compelling buy to hold on to for many years to come.\n\n2. Netflix Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has split its stock multiple times, with three significant stock splits in its history: a 2-for-1 split in 2004, a 7-for-1 split in 2015, and most recently, a 10-for-1 split in November 2025. That most recent split took effect Nov. 17.\nWhile subscriptions remain core to its revenue and profitability model, Netflix is successfully expanding into new, high-growth areas. The ad-supported tier is growing rapidly and is on track to double its revenue in 2025. The company is also venturing into gaming, live sports events, and merchandising, all of which could create multiple avenues for future growth.\n\nNetflix has shifted its focus from pure subscriber growth to profitable expansion, which has effectively to expanded its operating margins and achieved significant free cash flow generation. In Q3 2025, Netflix's revenue was $11.5 billion (up 17% year over year), but its operating margin was 28%, while its free cash flow surged to $2.7 billion. Netflix also expects to report free cash flow of approximately $9 billion in 2025 on the whole.\nNetflix has established itself as the preeminent global streaming service. While the U.S. and Canadian markets are nearing saturation, there remains significant room for subscriber growth in international markets, such as Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The company's strategy of producing high-quality, localized original content that resonates globally (e.g., Squid Game , Stranger Things ) helps drive retention and attract new subscribers.\n\nNetflix has also demonstrated robust pricing power, increasing subscription costs without experiencing significant subscriber losses. The brand name is synonymous with streaming, and its vast library of content, combined with data on viewer habits, creates a strong competitive advantage that is difficult for rivals to match.\nProposed acquisitions, such as the potential purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery studios (though it certainly faces regulatory hurdles), could further solidify its content library and market dominance. Now looks like a great time to scoop up some shares of Netflix.\n3. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has split its stock six times, with the most recent split being a 10-for-1 split enacted on June 10, 2024. Before that, Nvidia executed a 4-for-1 split in 2021. Since the 2024 split, Nvidia shares have increased by about 55%.\nNvidia's strong position as the foundational technology provider for the AI revolution, combined with its robust financial performance and competitive moat, has driven the company to new heights of financial growth. Its most recent results for its 2026 third quarter (ending October 2025), included record revenue of $57 billion (up 62% from a year ago) and EPS of $1.30, thanks to booming data center and Blackwell GPU sales. Its data center division delivered $51.2 billion in revenue, up 66% from one year ago.\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 80% to 90% market share in the data center AI chip market, and its GPUs are considered the gold standard for AI training and inference. The company's key competitive advantage lies in its proprietary CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software platform, which has become the de facto standard for GPU-accelerated computing.\nMajor AI frameworks are optimized for CUDA, and the platform boasts an ecosystem of millions of developers globally who rely on CUDA to build and accelerate their applications. This large community creates a powerful network effect, offering extensive support, shared code, and third-party tools that competitors struggle to match.\nThe deep integration of CUDA into existing workflows and institutional knowledge creates prohibitively high switching costs for developers and organizations. Nvidia continuously optimizes the CUDA software stack for its latest GPU architectures, which ensures top-tier performance that often outpaces hardware-only competitors.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's next-generation chips (Blackwell and Rubin architectures) remains exceptionally high, with an order backlog of $500 billion through the end of 2026. Beyond data centers, Nvidia is expanding into robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial digital twins, which positions the business to tap into new, multitrillion-dollar market opportunities. That's a value proposition many long-term investors won't want to miss out on.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "'I don't see a bubble': Why Wall Street thinks the stock market can keep climbing even as AI anxiety grows\n\nInes Ferré · Senior Business Reporter\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nAs stocks sit near all-time highs, strategists are brushing off concerns of an AI bubble.\nAt least for now.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is on pace to close out the year with a gain of over 17%, powered by a 26% jump in technology stocks ( XLK ).\n“I don't see a bubble at all. However, I do believe we're going to be going into a bubble,” Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist Mary Ann Bartels told Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nBatels compared the current market to prior bubbles, including the late 1920s and the dot-com bubble.\n“We're tracking pretty similarly. In fact, it's kind of eerie how we're actually tracking that pattern,” she said. “I see a bubble occurring but not out until maybe ’29 into ’30.”\nBut for the time being, Sanctuary strategists forecast that tech will continue leading the market higher out into the end of the decade. They place the S&P 500 anywhere between 10,000 and 13,000 by 2030.\n“That's why we're calling 2026, you know, to be fearless, that there's still significant upside in this market, particularly for technology,” she said.\nPart of the upside comes from semiconductor stocks. Once treated as commodity plays, they become growth stocks, with Nvidia ( NVDA ) “basically rewriting the path for semiconductor chips.”\n\nThe AI chip powerhouse has surged over 40% so far this year, pushing its market cap to $4.6 trillion and making it the most valuable publicly traded company. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose after the company announced a $20 billion licensing deal with specialized chipmaker Groq ( GROQ.PVT ).\nThe deal was announced as the chip space has heated up, with Alphabet's Google ( GOOG ) making headlines with its specialized customer chips called TPUs.\nAlphabet stock has soared some 65% year to date.\n\nUBS strategists also expect the AI boom and robust profit growth to underpin market gains in 2026.\n“We note that forward price-to-earnings multiples are only marginally higher than at the start of the year, reinforcing the fact that earnings growth and not valuation bubbles have driven market gains,” wrote the strategists last week.\n\nUBS forecasts S&P 500 earnings per share to grow about 10% year over year, pushing the index to 7,700 by the end of next year.\nVeteran strategist Ed Yardeni also sees the index reaching 7,700 next year, with the probability of his \"Roaring 2020s\" scenario at 60%. He cited, among other reasons, tax benefits from the \" One Big Beautiful Bill \" that passed this year and the AI boom.\nIn October, Goldman Sachs analysts argued the stock market isn’t in a bubble because tech stocks have risen mostly due to actual growth, not speculative bets. The firm noted that top-performing companies have strong balance sheets and the AI sector is still mostly led by a few big players, while most bubbles occur when many new entrants rush into a hot sector.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile most of the earnings growth this year has been led by the largest seven stocks in the S&P 500, Goldman Sachs analysts also see participation broadening.\n\"We expect macro tailwinds from accelerating economic growth and a fading tariff drag on margins will support an acceleration in the earnings growth rate for the remaining 493 stocks,\" wrote Goldman's Ben Snider earlier this month.\nMeanwhile, AI productivity is expected to lift earnings for companies outside the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks, said Joseph Shaposhnik, founder of Rainwater Equity.\n\"I think some of them will take a break — some of them will perform well,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\"But really, the opportunity for outsized returns next year are going to be outside those seven businesses,\" he added.\nInes Ferre is a Senior Business Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "These 4 Billionaires All Have 1 Genius AI Stock in Common, and It's Set to Skyrocket in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor is a broader way to play the AI buildout trend.\nData center capital expenditures are expected to rise through at least 2030.\nChip designers have one thing in common: they all turn to Taiwan Semiconductor.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nLooking at what stocks billionaire hedge fund managers own can be a smart investment strategy. While blindly following their trades isn't a smart move because of information delay, seeing what stocks they all have in common may reveal some great insights to investors.\n\nThe reason for the information delay is due to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements. Any money manager with more than $100 million in assets must report end-of-quarter holdings to the SEC. Then, that information is made available to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . So, if you see that your favorite fund manager bought a position in a hot AI stock, they may have done it months ago.\nThe key is to find fund managers who don't make massive trades every quarter on a single position. Instead, they add or trim as necessary to manage their risk. One stock that popped up in multiple funds I follow is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , also known as TSMC. It's a huge holding in many portfolios, and I think it's set to skyrocket in 2026 as artificial intelligence demand ramps up.\nTaiwan Semiconductor plays a key role in the AI realm The four billionaires who all own shares of Taiwan Semiconductor are:\nChase Coleman at Tiger Global Management (4% of portfolio)\nSteve Mandel at Lone Pine Capital (6.2% of portfolio)\nDavid Tepper at Appaloosa Management (4% of portfolio)\nDaniel Loeb at Third Point (3.7% of portfolio)\nClearly, these four billionaires are very bullish on Taiwan Semiconductor's prospects, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out why.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine whose computing units are the best at any given time. For most of the AI arms race, Nvidia and its leading graphics processing units (GPUs) have dominated this conversation. However, rising competition from Advanced Micro Devices and custom AI accelerators from Broadcom has made this analysis more difficult.\nBut all three of these companies have one thing in common: They get most of their chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. This places TSMC in the ultimate neutral position, as it is supplying chips to competitors. So, as long as there are massive data center buildouts ongoing to develop generative AI technologies, Taiwan Semiconductor will be in an excellent position.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia informed investors that it expects global data center capital expenditures to total $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030 -- a huge expansion from 2025's $600 billion. That's total capital expenditures, which is far broader than just computing. AMD offered a similar projection, estimating that computing will be a $1 trillion market opportunity by 2030.\n\nThis bodes well for one of the key providers of chips in the world, making it no surprise that these four billionaires own shares.\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a buy now? As mentioned above, the information we have on the ownership of Taiwan Semiconductor among the four billionaires is old information. All we know is that they owned shares on Sept. 30. Since then, TSMC's stock has basically been flat, up around 3%. This likely means they still own the shares, as there haven't been any huge drops.\nFurthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is reasonably valued heading into 2026.\nAt 23 times 2026 earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor isn't all that expensive compared to its peers. Factor in its critical position and monster growth that's expected to persist for several years after 2026, and Taiwan Semiconductor looks like one of the best buys in the market.\nI think investors should follow these four billionaires' lead and take a hefty position in Taiwan Semiconductor. It's a critical company, and with massive spending expected to occur over the next five years, it's well-positioned to be a huge winner and could skyrocket in 2026 as a result.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Stocks sit near record highs as 'Santa Claus rally' builds, 2026 approaches: What to watch this week\n\nJake Conley · Breaking Business News Reporter\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nADP\n\n^IXIC\n\n^DJI\n\nGC=F\n\nStocks finished trading on Friday — the second session of the so-called \"Santa Claus rally\" — down just slightly on the day after a run of five straight positive sessions, with the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) hovering right near record levels set on Christmas Eve.\nFor the holiday-shortened week, the benchmark S&P 500 gained roughly 2.3%, while the blue-chip Dow and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) picked up about 1.6% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nWall Street enters another relatively sleepy holiday week. Employment figures from labor market data provider ADP and minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting, both released on Wednesday, will take center stage as Wall Street looks to enter 2026 on a high note.\n'Santa Claus rally' looks to continue 2025 has been a year of fresh highs throughout the market.\nAfter a sharp downturn in the wake of President Trump's springtime tariff policy rollout , all three major stock indexes have rallied back to notch multiple records. Gold ( GC=F ) and silver ( SI=F ) have headlined a monster rally for precious metals, both cresting their historical highs as investors turned to safety investments, while copper ( HG=F ) hit its own high-water mark on the back of supply chain disruptions and tariff policy uncertainty.\n2025 also saw Nvidia ( NVDA ) become the first company to cross a market capitalization of $5 trillion as the biggest players in technology ballooned their spending to keep up in what has become an AI arms race.\n\nNow, with stocks hitting fresh records near the tail end of last week, the market is looking primed for a positive \"Santa Claus rally\" — typically the last five trading sessions of December and first two of January.\n\"Momentum heading into year-end suggests a favorable setup for a positive Santa Claus Rally — a historically bullish signal for January and the year ahead,\" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said in emailed commentary.\n\nWall Street strategists are predicting that the indexes will keep the party going in 2026.\nThe S&P 500 closed Friday's trading session at 6,929.94. Strategists at JPMorgan Chase and HSBC see the index reaching 7,500 by year-end in 2026. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank are even more bullish, setting their 2026 targets at 7,800 and 8,000, respectively. The latter number would represent a more than 15% increase from current levels.\n\"Despite AI bubble and valuation concerns, we see current elevated multiples correctly anticipating above-trend earnings growth, an AI capex boom, rising shareholder payouts, and easier fiscal policy,\" said JPMorgan lead equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas.\n\nStory Continues\n'Cautious optimism' But investors are also stepping into 2026 with an economy on somewhat shaky footing.\nEven as GDP growth has jumped and inflation has cooled, the US economy is growing increasingly fragmented, or \"K-shaped.\" Higher-income households have been drivers of spending and wealth growth, while lower-income households have struggled.\n\nWorries about overspending by Big Tech companies and potentially unsustainably lofty valuations in the sector have remained persistent. Balance sheet stressors in the private credit and corporate debt spheres have continued to accumulate.\nInvestors also have to grapple with a series of geopolitical unknowns: the war in Ukrain, tensions around the energy market in Venezuela and predictions for a global supply glut in the oil market, a more isolationist stance from US political leaders, and the booming demand for electricity to power the AI revolution.\nAs of Friday, traders were pricing in about 80% odds that the Federal Reserve will hold rates steady at its January meeting, signaling a belief that Chair Jerome Powell's wait-and-see approach will continue to drive rate decisions.\n\nWhile strategists at State Street Global Advisors are approaching 2026 with a largely bullish outlook on the US economy, the firm wrote in a note to clients, given that factors such as elevated valuations and market capitalizations remain a concern, they are \" underlining the importance of being selective in exposures .\"\nThat hasn't kept strategists from looking forward with hope for a strong 2026. Going back 75 years to 1950, the Santa rally has never seen negative returns for more than two years in a row. (2023 and 2024 were both down years in the period.) If this week's Santa rally notches a positive return, LPL Financial's Turnquist wrote, it will signal a likely strong start to next year — but history is no sure bet.\n\nThe key will be whether the market can maintain its delicate balance.\n\"The economy is demonstrating a Goldilocks scenario with above-potential U.S. economic growth, and declining but elevated inflation and a less robust labor market,\" Eric Teal, chief investment officer of Comerica Wealth Management, wrote in a client note.\n2026, Teal said, is \" characterized by cautious optimism .\"\nEconomic and earnings calendar Monday Economic data: Pending home sales, month-on-month, November (0.8% expected, 1.9% previously); Dallas Federal Reserve manufacturing activity, December (-5.0 expected, -10.4 previously)\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nTuesday Economic data: ADP weekly employment change, week ended Dec. 13 (11,500 previously); Federal Housing Finance Authority house price index, month-on-month, October (0.1% expected, 0.0% previously); MNI Chicago purchasing managers' index, December (39.5 expected, 36.3 previously); Dallas Federal Reserve services activity, December (-2.3 previously); Minutes released for Dec. 10 FOMC meeting\n\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nWednesday Economic data: Initial jobless claims, week ended Dec. 27 (214,000 previously); Continuing claims, week ended Dec. 20 (1.923 million previously)\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nThursday Economic data: Market is closed for New Year's Day.\nEarnings calendar: Market is closed for New Year's Day.\nFriday Economic data: S&P Global US manufacturing purchasing managers' index, December final reading (51.8 expected, 51.8 previously)\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Making fortunes and letting it ride: 13 New Year investing resolutions\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nYou can always be better.\nA better family member. A better friend. A better human toward others. A healthier person. And, of course, a better investor.\nAnyone that tells you they have the investing game all figured is, well, a dope. You can tell them that cold hard reality came from Brian Sozzi at Yahoo Finance — and feel free to send me their replies on X @BrianSozzi .\n\nWhile it feels as if making money in the market is easy right now — if not for all of 2025 — the market could turn on a dime and run you over.\nThink what would happen if Nvidia ( NVDA ) came out in a few months and had a key growth rate that slowed sequentially. What if that was backed up with a surprise dose of cautiousness from CEO Jensen Huang? Or, what if the new Fed chair in 2026 isn't as dovish as the market is currently pricing in? That would severely damage the bull thesis on stocks.\nWhatever the case, markets do not go up in a straight line, and that should mean you try each and every day to improve at the craft of making money. One way to do that is to make some investing resolutions and tape them to one of the eight screens you have at your investing command post.\nThese are my 10 investing-related resolutions for 2026:\n\nTake less management BS on earnings calls as gospel.\nBetter understand the intricacies and motives behind executive compensation packages.\nHold more weight toward GAAP financial results compared to non-GAAP financial results.\nAssign better investing scores for companies clearly seeing profit gains from new AI actions.\nFind five companies that seem ripe for an activist investor attack.\nGo and see an AI data center being built.\nTrack capital expenditures at the 15 largest tech companies.\nScreen for the 10 \"cheapest\" members of the S&P 493 (the ex-\"Magnificent Seven\" names).\nBecome better at spotting the top five stock formations.\nFind one small-cap company doing something amazing.\nAnd here are three additional resolutions investing pros told me this week on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid .\n\nSam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist \"I'm a big rules follower. Even though history is a good guide, it's never gospel. But one of the rules that I follow is if last year was an up year, you want to let your winners ride. If last year was a down year, you want to own the three worst-performing sectors. Using this alternate kind of investment strategy, you would have added about 300 basis points to the market's return and beat the market 70% of the time. Obviously not a guarantee, but it's an encouragement that the market says it has further to run.\"\n\nStory continues\nGeorge Seay, Annandale Capital founder \"Don't time the market. Stay on the ride, enjoy it while it lasts.\"\nThomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital chairman \"I think we're going to keep doing what we did in 2025 because it worked. I think the thing that is going to surprise people is that equal weight indices could outperform cap weighted indices. I think people who are just stuck in regular cap weighted indices, like the S&P 500, are going to be underwhelmed with their returns in 2026, and the people that venture out a little bit, such as the stock pickers, I think there's going to be fortunes made under the surface.\n\"But the easy way to get exposure to that is with an equal weight index, in which case would be the first time in some time where the broadening and that participation overwhelms what people expect in the indices. And that's a sign of health. That's a good thing, not a bad thing.\"\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Ahead of 2026, According to Wall Street Analysts (Hint: Not Palantir)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Morningstar analysts recently ranked Nvidia and Microsoft as the two best artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now.\nBrian Colello at Morningstar says Nvidia has an economic moat due to its leadership in GPUs, networking, and software tools needed for artificial intelligence.\nDan Romanoff at Morningstar says Microsoft’s cloud computing unit has emerged as a leader in artificial intelligence due to investments in OpenAI.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nPalantir Technologies has been one of the best-performing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in recent years. Shares have advanced 1,000% since January 2024, but many analysts worry about its valuation. That may explain why Palantir did not appear on Morningstar 's recent list detailing the best AI stocks to buy now.\nInstead, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) took the top two spots, followed by Amazon , Broadcom , and Meta Platforms . But optimism concerning Nvidia and Microsoft is not limited to Morningstar. Most Wall Street analysts believe the stocks are undervalued.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $190.\nAmong 63 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 29% upside from its current share price of $488.\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft.\n1. Nvidia Morningstar analyst Brian Colello writes:\nTo summarize, Nvidia has an important competitive advantage in its full-stack strategy. The company is best known for its GPUs, chips that accelerate demanding data center workloads like AI training and AI inference. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it pairs best-in-class GPUs with CPUs, high-speed interconnects, and networking platforms, such that the company essentially builds entire data centers.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has spent the better part of two decades creating its CUDA software platform, which comprises an unparalleled number of code libraries, pretrained models, and application frameworks that assist developers. While custom AI chips developed by Broadcom may be cheaper, the total cost of ownership is often higher because they lack pre-built software tools.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia has over 90% market share in data center GPUs, a market where sales are projected to grow at 36% annually through 2033, and the company is likely to maintain its dominant position due to its full-stack strategy. Wall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 48% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2028. That makes the current valuation of 47 times earnings look cheap.\n\n2. Microsoft Microsoft is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for Microsoft 365 (a suite that includes office applications like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word), the company also has a strong position in other software verticals, including business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning.\n\nMicrosoft has added generative AI copilots to several software products and monthly active users surpassed 150 million in the September quarter, up from 100 million in the June quarter. And CEO Satya Nadella told analysts, \"Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot faster than any other Microsoft 365 suite. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.\"\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services sales. \"Azure has several distinct advantages, including that it offers customers a painless way to experiment and move select workloads to the cloud,\" according to Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff. \"Based on its investment in OpenAI, the company has also emerged as a leader in AI.\"\n\nMicrosoft owns a 27% equity stake in OpenAI and it has exclusive rights to the AI start-up's most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 and GPT-5). Also, The Information reports that OpenAI shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft under the agreement. Those payments will top $1 billion this year, up from about $500 million last year, according to TechCrunch.\nWall Street estimates Microsoft's adjusted earnings will increase at 16% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look somewhat expensive. But Microsoft topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 8% during the last four quarters, which makes the current valuation look more reasonable. Nvidia is still the more attractive option, but I think patient investors should consider buying a small position in both stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "This AI Stock Is Quietly Outperforming Nvidia in 2025\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 10:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia has climbed 40% so far this year, but this other AI player has advanced 65%.\nThis company’s stock has picked up momentum in recent months.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the artificial intelligence (AI) stock everyone has been watching over the past few years. The company has established itself as the leading AI chip designer and launched an entire ecosystem of products that make it the one to turn to for anything AI. All of this has resulted in revenue exploding higher -- and the stock price has followed. Nvidia shares have soared a mind-blowing 1,300% over the past five years.\n\nThe tech giant has continued with this momentum in 2025, reporting record levels of revenue and high demand for its products. The stock also has climbed, advancing in the double digits -- but it's far from being this year's biggest stock market winner. In fact, the following unassuming AI stock is quietly outperforming Nvidia in 2025. Let's find out more.\nEarnings strength over time Nvidia is on track for a 40% increase this year, but fellow tech player Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is heading for a gain of more than 65%. Alphabet picked up significant momentum in recent months, buoyed by its overall earnings strength, its position in AI , and the outcome of an antitrust suit.\n\nWe'll start out by talking about Alphabet in general. You may know this company very well, as it's the owner of something most of us use pretty regularly: Google Search. The world's No. 1 search engine, with more than 90% market share, has been Alphabet's ticket to billion-dollar revenue and steady growth year after year. This is as advertisers rush to the Google platform to catch us where they know they can find us -- and these ads generate the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue.\nBut Alphabet also has another significant, and growing, revenue source, and that's Google Cloud. This business sells a variety of cloud services to customers -- and here's where AI comes in. Google Cloud offers AI tools and platforms to those aiming to develop and use AI, and this has supercharged revenue in recent quarters. In the most recent period, for example, Google Cloud's revenue advanced 34% amid demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI services. Alphabet also has built its own large language model, Gemini, which it offers to customers -- and the company uses Gemini to improve its own business, for instance, making the advertising experience better and more productive for advertisers.\n\nStory Continues\nA first $100 billion quarter The strength of Alphabet's ad business, as well as growth in Google Cloud, helped the company reach its first-ever $100 billion quarter in the latest period. This shows that Alphabet not only offers you a solid track record but also potential for growth as this AI story develops. It's important to keep in mind that analysts predict the AI market may reach into the trillions of dollars in just a few years. A company like Alphabet is well-positioned to benefit as customers turn to Google Cloud for various AI needs.\n\nFinally, Alphabet recently received excellent news from the judge in a U.S. antitrust case against the company. The federal judge ruled out the worst-case scenario: the possible breakup of Google. He said Alphabet would not be required to sell Chrome or the Android operating system. Instead, the company faces other penalties that should be much less detrimental to the business. This news, in early September, clearly offered the stock a lift as it removed the biggest risk for Alphabet and its investors.\nA look at valuation Now, as we look ahead to the new year, you may be wondering: Does Alphabet have what it takes to continue outperforming AI market star, Nvidia? I think it's possible. Alphabet, trading for 29x forward earnings estimates, is considerably cheaper than Nvidia.\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nThis could attract buyers looking for a reasonably priced AI stock and one that may be heading for a new phase of growth. Alphabet not only offers access to Nvidia systems, but it also offers its customers access to a wide variety of alternatives too -- so, as I mentioned earlier, it's likely to benefit as the AI market grows.\n\nI also like the fact that the company's main profit engine -- advertising -- is likely to keep on delivering revenue increases regardless of the AI spending climate. This offers investors who are worried about the pace of AI growth an element of security.\nAll of this means that there's reason to be optimistic about Alphabet's performance next year -- and it may even continue to outperform Nvidia.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Leave Behind in 2026\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 5:00 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nAI\n\nRGTI\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Palantir's stock appears priced for perfection.\nA CEO change and dramatically lower revenue guidance bode poorly for C3.ai.\nFalling revenue and a high valuation could lead to further declines for Rigetti Computing.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\nSince the end of the 2022 bear market, several artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have delivered massive returns for investors as they transform the technology landscape. Not surprisingly, one of the top stocks in this category is Nvidia , which delivered returns of over 1,640% since its low in mid-October 2022.\nUnfortunately, such success has not made every AI stock an automatic buy. In fact, given the state of the stock or the company, it may be time to part ways with some of the stocks, and these three names probably belong at the top of such a list.\nPalantir Technologies Admittedly, Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) may seem like a strange choice for a \"stocks to sell\" list. It is up nearly 33-fold from its 2022 low, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has brought eye-popping productivity gains to several of its clients.\nHowever, its success has arguably taken its stock into bubble territory. The problem with bubbles is that they can take stocks to such high levels that it may take years or possibly decades to recover.\n\nEven though bubbles are typically identified after the fact, the valuation metrics look like a bubble in the making. Palantir's trailing P/E ratio is just above 450. While investors could dismiss that, its forward P/E of around 270 and the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio above 125 prove the trailing earnings multiple is not a fluke. Also, considering that investors often balk at sales multiples that are one-fourth of Palantir's P/S ratio, it is likely a sign that investors should turn cautious.\nIndeed, revenue for the first nine months of 2025 rose by 51% year over year. Amid that performance, Palantir stock certainly deserves to trade at a premium. Nonetheless, with the market pricing the stock beyond perfection, one has to question whether the stock has any near-term upside left.\n\nC3.ai C3.ai (NYSE: AI) stock has often drawn investor interest in recent years. The company has developed over 130 software applications to help organizations adopt AI quickly, and companies from a variety of industries use its tools.\nUnfortunately, the company has faced considerable struggles, the latest of which is the news this summer that the company's founder and CEO, Thomas Siebel, would step down. He departed in September due to health issues, and the current CEO, Stephen Ehikian, faces a daunting turnaround task.\n\nStory Continues\nOne issue to tackle is C3.ai's falling revenue. After issuing fiscal 2026 guidance between $448 million and $485 million six months earlier, it reduced that guidance to between $290 million and $310 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Oct. 31).\nAmid that adjustment, revenue is down 20% year over year in the first half of fiscal 2026. Also, operating expenses continue to far outpace revenue, and its $221 million loss in the first two quarters of 2026 was higher than its $129 million loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nConsequently, the stock trades down over 60% from one year ago. That decline took its P/S ratio to 5, a two-year low and a level that could attract some investors. Still, with deteriorating financials and an uncertain direction for the company under new management, one has to wonder whether C3.ai stock is worth the risk of owning.\nRigetti Computing Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) competes in the burgeoning quantum computing field, which is on track to become a player in next-generation AI.\nRigetti has a competitive advantage in developing faster technology. Unfortunately, this does not necessarily lead to the highest accuracy, a factor that could lead to Rigetti losing out to competitors.\n\nMoreover, it is not only smaller companies like IonQ that compete in this field. Alphabet and IBM are among the mega-techs investing in quantum computing, and they generate sufficient free cash flows to invest in the necessary research and development.\nThis is not the case with Rigetti, which has to issue shares periodically simply to fund its continued existence. Additionally, it may be losing out to competitors, as its revenue in the first nine months of 2025 was just $5.2 million, a 39% decline from the same period in 2024.\nThat drop and a $149 million change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities led to a net loss in the first three quarters of the year of $198 million. In comparison, the company lost $48 million over the same timeframe in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Rigetti had benefited from a rising stock price, but the stock now trades down nearly 60% from its October 2025 high. Considering the falling sales and the price-to-book ratio of 22, this stock seems to offer more risk than reward to its investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?

(NYSE: BLK ), Neuberger Berman , Samsung Electronics Co.

      "Content": "Prediction: AMD Stock Will Jump 60% in 2026, Thanks to President Donald Trump\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 3:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points AMD was getting a nice chunk of its revenue from the Chinese market before the U.S. government's export controls took effect in April 2025.\nAMD will soon be allowed to sell advanced AI chips to Chinese customers, which should benefit AMD's business in 2026.\nThis could help AMD exceed Wall Street's growth expectations next year, which could send the stock soaring.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock clocked stellar gains in 2025, rising 78% this year as of this writing. However, recent trading suggests that some investors are booking profits. AMD stock is down 19% since hitting a 52-week high on Oct. 29.\nThis pullback could be a buying opportunity for investors looking to add a fast-growing company that's benefiting from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) . Additionally, a recent announcement by President Donald Trump, which will allow companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD, and Intel to sell their advanced AI chips to Chinese customers, is going to give AMD an additional boost in 2026.\nLet's take a closer look at AMD's catalysts for the new year and see why this stock has the potential to soar once again.\nThe Trump administration's announcement could give AMD a big shot in the arm AMD's business grew at a nice clip in 2025. It is on track to deliver $34 billion in revenue for the year, up 31% over 2024 revenue. It might have been even better, but AMD hasn't been able to sell its chips into the Chinese market since April, when the Trump administration imposed export controls on sales of advanced AI data center chips to that country.\n\nAs a result, AMD incurred an $800 million inventory charge in the second quarter. Moreover, the company lost a significant chunk of its revenue stream thanks to the Trump administration's move. That's because China accounted for nearly a quarter of AMD's 2024 revenue of $25.8 billion, or almost $6.2 billion.\nDespite the headwind, analysts expect a 20% increase in the company's earnings for 2025 to $3.97 per share. Consensus estimates suggest that AMD's earnings could jump 62% next year to $6.46 per share. I think it could end up doing much better than that.\nTake Nvidia, for example. The Trump administration now allows Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to Chinese customers. Nvidia was previously only selling its downsized H20 chips in China to comply with export regulations. Those chips were significantly cheaper and less powerful than Nvidia's flagship Hopper processor, the H200.\n\nStory Continues\nWith the change, Nvidia will likely see a significant bump in its revenue next year, even after paying the 25% tax that the administration plans to charge on sales to China. President Trump pointed out in his Truth Social post that the \"same approach will apply to AMD,\" suggesting that the company may be able to sell its high-end chips to Chinese customers.\n\nIt was earlier selling the downgraded MI308 processor to Chinese customers. It may now be able to ship its more powerful chips into that market, just like Nvidia has been allowed to. So, there is a possibility of AMD regaining the lost Chinese revenue in 2026, even with the 25% export fee.\nThat's because a full-fledged AMD data center graphics processing unit (GPU) will carry a significant premium over the nerfed MI308. This is why AMD's sales next year could turn out to be much higher than expected.\nThe stock could skyrocket in 2026 Analysts anticipate AMD's revenue to jump by 31% in 2026 to $44.6 billion. Assuming its revenue from China next year lands at 2024 levels of $6.2 billion, its top line could be somewhere around $51 billion. What's worth noting is that analysts haven't adjusted their 2026 revenue expectations for AMD following the Trump administration's rule change, suggesting that the company's potential gains from China aren't baked in just yet.\nAssuming AMD does achieve $51 billion in revenue next year and maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 11 at that time, its market cap could jump to $561 billion. That points toward a potential jump of 60% from its current market cap. So, now it would be a good time to buy this semiconductor stock following its recent pullback, as it has the potential to soar impressively in the new year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

Here's What's Next.\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia was the first $5 trillion stock, but it's declined over the past few weeks.\nThe chipmaker has an edge in its vertically integrated ecosystem of products.\nHowever, it's facing new competition from the likes of Amazon and Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) made stock market history, again, when it reached a $5 trillion market value at the end of October. However, it has since fallen almost 10% from those highs and currently sports a $4.4 trillion value. What's next for the artificial intelligence (AI) giant?\nCompetition and new products One way Nvidia has stayed on top of the AI mountain is by constantly upping its game and releasing new, groundbreaking products. It's best known for its expensive and powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), but it's increasingly focused on vertically integrated products that draw high-paying clients into its ecosystem.\n\nThese companies are spending vast amounts of money on their AI development using Nvidia products, creating high barriers to entry for other vendors. That gives Nvidia an edge on top of the one it already has from having the most powerful program.\nHowever, there are other top companies, including Amazon and Alphabet , that are creating their own AI chips and finding the white space to drive AI.\nWhat seems likely is that Nvidia will keep launching new and improved technology and keep its lead, but as competition heats up, the landscape continues to change, and the company gets bigger, growth will decelerate. The price is already coming down to a more realistic valuation , and it could still beat the market next year, but it isn't likely to deliver the life-changing gains it has in the past.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "From Power Grids to Data Centers: The Overlooked Winners in the AI Gold Rush\n\nMatt DiLallo, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 12:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Companies need to invest $5.2 trillion in AI infrastructure by 2030.\nData centers are the physical homes of AI hardware.\nPower is vital to AI.\n10 stocks we like better than NextEra Energy ›\nThe AI revolution is driving nearly insatiable demand for hardware like high-performance GPUs, CPUs, networking equipment, and storage. Demand for this hardware is so strong that AI companies are buying Nvidia 's GPUs and memory chips from Micron hand over fist. As a result, the share prices of AI hardware companies have skyrocketed in recent years.\n\nHowever, hardware is only part of the estimated $5.2 trillion in capital spending McKinsey sees on AI infrastructure through 2030. Companies will also need to invest heavily in developing the physical data center shells, power grids, and electricity-generating capacity to support the AI boom. Here's a look at some of the overlooked pick-and-shovel plays that are crucial to the AI gold rush.\nThe cloud is a physical space AI technology requires specialized computing infrastructure. The centerpiece is an AI factory, a purpose-built data center that houses critical hardware. In addition to the hardware, this physical building shell requires advanced cooling systems and access to a substantial amount of reliable power.\nSeveral companies specialize in developing data centers (shells and operating facilities). For example, data center REITs such as Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX) and Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR) play a crucial role in helping develop physical real estate to support AI. Equinix is building out several xScale data centers (large-scale, AI-ready facilities). In 2024, it formed a $15 billion joint venture to purchase land and build several new state-of-the-art xScale facilities. Meanwhile, Digital Realty launched its first U.S. Hyperscale Data Center Fund in 2025 to support up to $10 billion of data center investments. It also partnered with Blackstone in late 2023 on a $7 billion joint venture to build large-scale data centers.\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC) (NYSE: BIP) is another notable data center developer. The company has acquired several global data center platforms over the years to build up its capabilities. It currently operates over 140 data centers worldwide, with a total capacity of 1.6 gigawatts (GW). It sees potential to develop an additional 3.4 GW of capacity across its platform in the future. Additionally, Brookfield is investing in other data infrastructure to support AI, including plans to deploy advanced fuel cell technology from Bloom Energy to power data centers.\n\nStory Continues\nPowering the AI revolution The advanced GPUs, cooling systems, and other hardware required to support AI demand a massive amount of electricity. Many AI data center campuses need over 1 GW of electricity, enough to power about 750,000 homes. According to an estimate by leading AI company Anthropic , the U.S. will need at least 50 GW of power for AI by 2028 alone .\n\nSeveral energy companies are investing in expanding the energy infrastructure necessary to support AI. They're constructing new energy transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and clean power generation assets.\nOne of the leaders in energy infrastructure development is NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) . The company is exploring the potential to invest over $25 billion in the coming years in developing additional electricity transmission projects to support the grid. Additionally, it has an extensive gas pipeline network that it expects to expand in the future to support growing demand for gas power. On top of that , NextEra is a leader in developing renewable energy. The company also formed strategic partnerships with Google to advance the deployment of nuclear energy and co-develop multiple large-scale data center campuses.\n\nWilliams (NYSE: WMB) is another leader in helping support the AI power boom. The natural gas pipeline company has several projects underway to increase the supply of gas across the country that should enter commercial service through 2030. The company is evaluating another 30 projects totaling over $14 billion of investment that it could build in the 2027 to 2033 time frame. Additionally, Williams has $5.1 billion of projects under construction to develop and operate gas-power generating capacity for data center customers. It has several additional power innovation projects in the backlog.\nBuilding the physical infrastructure to support AI AI has the potential to be one of the most impactful technologies in history. It can't achieve its immense potential without the physical infrastructure needed to turn chips into AI supercomputers. As a result, companies from Brookfield Infrastructure to NextEra Energy will play a vital role in supporting the AI era, enabling their investors to cash in on the gold rush.\n\nShould you buy stock in NextEra Energy right now?

I mean, was it because okay, Uncle Sam's going to get a taste, Brennan? Is it because Trump thinks, hey, for now at least Xi has leverage when it comes to where Earth? What's the reasoning there, do you think?\n00:18 Brennan\nI think President Trump, you know, his his, he's not a career politician. He's he's been a business person and I I think he looks to corporate leaders as almost like a a shadow cabinet where I think he he wants to meet and and hear the views of if it's Tim Cook or Jensen Wong or, you know, you know, other corporate leaders, you know, as we've seen earlier this year that, you know, after the CEOs of Walmart and Target and Home Depot met with him, you know, the tariffs were kind of de-escalated. So I think President Trump is unique in that he does listen to corporate leaders and I think Jensen Wong, you know, arguably said, you know, this is really, really critical for for Nvidia, but at the same time, I also think, you know, Chinese companies want Nvidia chips. So why why would you, why why would you turn your back on that, that revenue opportunity?\n00:54 Speaker A\nWell, and here Brennan, on this great AI race, you know, AI hardware, AI software, who in your opinion, Brennan, still is in pole position, still is in the lead? Is it is it the US and if so, how long do you think?\n01:03 Brennan\nI mean, certainly, uh, uh, you know, using Nvidia as, you know, they're, Nvidia is very, very far ahead of of its Chinese equivalents. Uh, so I don't I don't think there's any catch up on a Blackwell like chip, uh, coming from a Chinese competitor anytime in the near future. I think I think the two the two countries and really the ultimately the underlying companies are looking at AI very differently. You know, in the US, it's really about an enterprise sale from Anthropic or Open AI really. Uh, at same, in China, the large language models, those are open source. They're literally basically free. You know, there's no mode to, um, a lot of these large language models in China where where the revenue is coming in is going to be on the cloud computing and that's where an Alibaba, 10 cent and Baidu, uh, really are going to be the main beneficiaries of AI via cloud computing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 Genius Stocks Nvidia Owns That You Should Buy for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 11:25 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNBIS\n\nAPLD\n\nKey Points Nvidia is a part owner of Nebius and Applied Digital.\nBoth companies benefit from the huge construction projects in data centers.\n10 stocks we like better than Applied Digital ›\nThe reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) say that companies that own more than $100 million in other companies' stocks must report those holdings to the SEC at the end of the quarter. Then, 45 days after the quarter ends, that information is released to the public in a Form 13F . These disclosures tend to capture the attention of investors curious about what stocks are being bought and sold by specific companies they follow.\n\nSome of these investors use this information to influence their own investing choices. While it isn't wise to blindly follow what others are doing, this information can provide some sense of what top-level investors and industry leaders think are the top stocks to own.\nOne industry leader that investors might want to pay attention to is Nvidia , currently the world's largest company. It makes the most popular graphics processing units (GPUs) on the market, giving it significant insight into the industry overall, including what's going on in the artificial intelligence (AI) world.\nNvidia is making so much money from its products that it can't spend it all on growing its own company, so it has started investing in other companies it sees having growth potential. Given its deep knowledge base, investors stand to benefit by paying attention to the companies Nvidia is interested in.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, Nvidia owned shares in six publicly traded companies. There are two that are particularly intriguing, and investors should take a look at them for potential 2026 purchases.\nNvidia owns shares of Applied Digital and Nebius Nvidia reported owning shares of Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) and Nebius Group (NASDAQ: NBIS) . Both of these companies are involved in the data center building boom in different ways. Applied Digital designs, builds, and operates data centers for various clients. These data centers require computing hardware from Nvidia to function, and it's possible that Applied Digital used its stock as a way to finance some transactions with Nvidia.\n\nAnother possibility is that Nvidia believes in Applied Digital, so it took a position in the company as a result. It owns about 7.7 million shares of Applied Digital, or about 2.8% of the overall company.\nThis investment did well for Nvidia in 2025, since Applied Digital's stock price is up 238% this year. Its price spiked on news of 15-year leases with various AI companies, including another major Nvidia investment, CoreWeave . Applied Digital is not profitable right now, but once it has built up its computing footprint, it could turn into a long-term cash-generating machine for investors like Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nNebius is similar: It operates full-stack data centers for its clients. Its growth has been incredible, and it expects that to persist into 2026, with annual recurring revenue (ARR) reaching $900 million to $1.1 billion by the end of 2025. By 2026, this metric is forecast to be between $7 billion and $9 billion. That's huge growth in a short time, and it reflects the insatiable demand for AI computing power.\n\nNvidia also recognizes this and knows that Nebius is a great company to invest in. It owns 1.2 million shares of Nebius, or about 0.5% of the company. Although that's a small chunk of Nebius, if it can continue growing at a rapid pace for multiple years, this small investment could turn into a huge win.\nIs Nvidia a better investment pick? Should you follow Nvidia's lead and buy these two? Both Applied Digital and Nebius have been great picks in 2025. But could Nvidia be an even better pick? Nebius and Applied Digital are both deeply unprofitable and will likely be that way for a few years as they build out to meet the demand created by generative AI workloads.\n\nBut one company that isn't unprofitable and is thriving at the moment is Nvidia. So investors need to ask themselves: Do I want increased risk with potential of higher returns with Applied Digital or Nebius, or do I want great returns with far less risk? The latter would indicate that an Nvidia investment is a better option.\nIt's up to each investor to decide which is the better answer, as the ultimate 2026 winner is impossible to predict.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Applied Digital right now? Before you buy stock in Applied Digital, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Applied Digital wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire David Tepper Loaded Up on Nvidia Shares in 2025. Should You Follow Him?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points David Tepper increased his Nvidia position by over 6x in 2025.\nNvidia's GPUs are still the most popular computing option available.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTracking the moves of billionaire hedge fund managers is a smart move for investors. While simply following their trades isn't a good idea, seeing what they're doing to confirm your moves is a good gut check. Fortunately, any fund with over $100 million in assets is required to disclose its holdings 45 days after the end of a quarter through a Form 13F.\n\nOne billionaire I keep tabs on is David Tepper, and he spent most of 2025 loading up on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock. At the end of the first quarter, his fund, Appaloosa Management, owned 300,000 shares of Nvidia. As of the end of the third quarter, it now owns 1.9 million. That's a huge number of shares to load up on throughout the year, and it is now the company's fourth-largest holding.\nClearly, there's something here, and I think loading up on Nvidia is a smart move for all investors heading into 2026.\nThe AI buildout still has a long way to go Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , which have been the go-to computing unit since the AI buildout began in 2023. Nvidia's technology stack is second to none, and even as more competition emerges, its chips have remained a top option.\nDemand for Nvidia's GPUs has been incredible, and its CEO Jensen Huang noted during its Q3 fiscal year 2026 (ending Oct. 26) that it's \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. So, while some investors are concerned that an AI bubble will burst, that doesn't reflect reality.\n\nAI hyperscalers are spending all their available cash flows (and sometimes more) to build as much artificial intelligence computing capacity as possible. While headlines suggest that companies are starting to choose computing devices other than Nvidia's GPUs, the reality is that Nvidia cannot meet the computing demands of its clients. Instead of decreasing demand, they are turning to alternative computing suppliers.\nNvidia is still working to ramp up production, which will allow it to deliver monster growth next year and many years beyond, as the demand for AI computing power is expected to last for multiple years. Nvidia's official projection is that global data center capital expenditures will continue to rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. That's incredible growth, especially since the total for 2025 is expected to be about $600 billion.\nTepper can see this, which is why he chose to load up the fund on Nvidia stock in 2025. I think that's a brilliant move, and the recent stock price decline has opened up a massive buying opportunity.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's stock is on sale Nvidia's stock is around 10% off from its all-time high. While that's not a fire sale price, it is a decent chunk off one of the world's largest and fastest-growing businesses. Thanks to the decline, Nvidia now trades for 24 times next year's earnings.\nThat's a reasonable price to pay for any big tech company, let alone Nvidia. With the monster growth expected in 2026 and beyond, today's stock price is a no-brainer. After all, it's cheaper than others like Apple (30 times next year's earnings) and Alphabet (28 times next year's earnings).\n\nNvidia is in a fantastic position to capitalize on the massive data center buildout. The recent sale price is a gift for investors, and I think everyone should be taking advantage of it by scooping up shares. While investors may be growing fatigued by the AI focus, we still have several years to go before we've built enough computing capacity to meet what's necessary. As a result, Nvidia will continue to be an excellent buy.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Nvidia Investors Just Got Incredible News for 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 8:24 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nKey Points A Reuters report claims that Nvidia could start shipping H200 chips to China from mid-February.\nThe company is expected to increase its capacity to fulfill more orders from Chinese customers.\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to deliver respectable gains in 2026, but the company could potentially do even better based on the latest developments.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nNvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) gains on the stock market this year may not have been as great as in 2023 and 2024. However, the semiconductor bellwether still managed to clock respectable gains of 37% despite being under pressure at certain times owing to various factors.\nNvidia stock outperformed the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite 's 21% jump by a nice margin. And now, the chip designer is entering the new year with a potentially solid tailwind on its side. President Donald Trump announced earlier in December that Nvidia will be allowed to sell its advanced H200 data center graphics processing units (GPUs) to approved Chinese customers. It looks like the wheels are already in motion, and Nvidia will soon be able to tap the Chinese market once again, according to an exclusive Reuters report.\nLet's take a closer look at this news, and check why it is going to be a big boost for this semiconductor stock in the new year.\nNvidia's Chinese revenue inflow could begin from February 2026 Reuters spoke to three people familiar with Nvidia's Chinese plans. The news agency learned that Nvidia informed its Chinese customers that it plans to start shipping the H200 processors before the mid-February Lunar New Year holiday.\nThe Reuters report claims Nvidia will initially ship between 40,000 and 80,000 H200 chips. Nvidia will fulfill these shipments from its existing H200 stock. Given that each H200 processor is priced at around $32,000, Nvidia could sell $1.28 billion to $2.56 billion worth of these chips into the Chinese market in the first quarter of fiscal 2027, which begins at the end of January 2026.\n\nOf course, Nvidia's agreement with the Trump administration is that it will hand over a quarter of its Chinese revenue to the U.S. government. However, it is still a start, nonetheless, for a company that was frozen out of this market in April 2025 following export controls restricting sales of its advanced AI chips to Chinese customers. More importantly, the third source cited by Reuters in its report stated that Nvidia will bring additional production capacity online for its Chinese customers.\nThe company will start taking orders for the newly added capacity in the second quarter of 2026. This suggests Nvidia is confident regarding the demand for the H200 processors in China. That isn't surprising, as the H200 is around six times more powerful compared to the China-specific H20 processor it was selling there earlier. So, it is easy to see why Chinese tech giants Alibaba , ByteDance, and Tencent are looking to get their hands on these chips.\n\nStory Continues\nAnother point of note is that Chinese government officials may mandate companies to purchase homegrown chips, along with the H200, to support the growth of local technology. This could further reduce the friction for Nvidia to sell its advanced chips in China, a market where it was on track to sell $30 billion worth of AI chips in the current fiscal year before the restrictions kicked in.\n\nThe stock's returns next year could be better than in 2025 Nvidia already has a significant backlog of data center chip orders to fulfill in 2026, standing at around $275 billion. That number is now likely to head higher following the reopening of its access to the Chinese market, which could pave the way for a stronger jump in its revenue and earnings.\nNvidia has a 12-month median price target of $250, per 69 analysts covering the stock. That suggests a potential jump of 36% from current levels, almost in line with the stock's appreciation this year. However, the recent developments have led analysts to boost their earnings expectations from Nvidia in 2026.\nThe current $7.52 earnings per share estimate for next year points toward a potential 60% increase from the ongoing fiscal year's estimated earnings of $4.69 per share. However, those estimates can increase once the additional business that Nvidia is likely to receive from China is factored in, paving the way for a bigger jump in this AI stock in 2026 compared to what it delivered this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "6 under-the-radar stocks to play the AI boom in 2026: BofA\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 7:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRDO\n\nALAB\n\nMTSI\n\nTER\n\nWhile players like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) are at the forefront of investors’ minds, smaller specialized players are grabbing a slice of the AI spending behind the scenes.\nIn a recent report, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya named a handful of small- to mid-cap companies as the unsung heroes of the semiconductor surge.\n\n\"We mentioned a few companies on the smid-cap side, Credo, MKS, Advanced Energy, MACOM, and Teradyne,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call.\nWhile these companies lack the massive margins of Nvidia, Arya suggests they are currently benefitting from being the primary providers of essential technologies.\nThe scale of the unsung opportunity is staggering. BofA predicts the total addressable market for AI data center systems will exceed $1.2 trillion by 2030, fueled by a 38% compound annual growth rate. Within that, AI accelerators will grab around $900 billion, but that leaves a massive $300 billion slice — one that depends on secondary technologies like networking, cables, and power systems.\nArya breaks down how the pie is divided. For every $100 spent on AI hardware, $15 to $20 goes into networking. A third flows directly into interconnects — the wires and optical components that let GPUs talk to each other. As AI clusters expand, these bits and bolts of the trillion-dollar build-out are seeing a direct benefit.\n\nArya highlights Credo ( CRDO ) for its leadership in active electrical cables. As data centers prioritize \"performance per watt,\" Credo's niche technology is critical. \"They want to make sure that all these GPUs talk to each other, very effectively,\" he said.\nHe also pointed to Astera Labs ( ALAB ) and its robust high-speed connectivity efforts via PCIe 6.0, the standard for moving data between a computer's motherboard and its hardware.\n\"They were the ones who invested in specific technologies ... nobody cared about these categories,\" he said. \"So now, they are benefitting from being the only people standing in those specific niche technologies.\"\nOther key players, such as MKS Instruments ( MKSI ) and Advanced Energy ( AEIS ), provide the precision power and vacuum systems needed to actually build chips. If Nvidia is the architect, these companies provide the machinery and high-voltage power to keep the site running.\nMeanwhile, MACOM ( MTSI ) provides high-speed analog and optical components that let these \"brains\" interact, while Teradyne ( TER ) serves as a final checkpoint. The company's automated testing equipment ensures these expensive components actually work before they are shipped.\n\nStory Continues\nStill, a healthy dose of skepticism is required. Unlike Nvidia, which can sell a single GPU for $30,000, the interconnect players like Credo and Astera face a brutal reality: pricing compression.\n\"Of course, they are not going to get these multiples forever,\" Arya said.\nArya warns that transceiver prices often fall from $1 per gigabit to $0.50 in just a few months.\n\n\"They can never hold pricing right, so you will never see them quite grow as fast as the accelerator or the logic companies,\" he explained. While their gross margins are currently 35%-40%, they are nowhere near Nvidia's \"different galaxy\" levels of 70% plus.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Nvidia Stock Is ‘Ripe’ for Gains in 2026, According to This Top Analyst\n\nSristi Suman Jayaswal\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThe semiconductor industry remains at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI)-led investment cycle, fueled by massive cloud spending, accelerating infrastructure buildouts, and a multi-year push toward advanced computing. While market sentiment has wavered at times, the long-term demand backdrop for chips tied to AI remains firmly in place.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has been the defining winner of this boom, transforming itself from a graphics pioneer into the backbone of modern AI data centers. After a historic run, however, 2025 brought a noticeable slowdown. Shares trailed several chip peers as investors grew cautious, weighed valuations, and questioned whether the AI trade had moved too far, too fast.\nMore News from Barchart Tesla + Robinhood + FedEx’s Unusually Active Put Options Could Deliver $Big Income Over the Next 30 Days\nCisco Systems Stock Is Treading Water - How to Use Puts and Calls to Play CSCO\nHere’s a Smart Way to Trade Robinhood (HOOD) Stock Without Going into Lottery Mode\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nThat pause has only heightened interest at Cantor Fitzgerald. With AI-linked stocks pressured by risk-off conditions and bubble fears, the brokerage firm argues the market is losing sight of the broader opportunity. Analyst C.J. Muse believes those concerns are overdone, pointing instead to a fresh AI demand inflection taking shape. With next-generation architectures approaching, demand visibility improving, and valuations resetting, Cantor foresees Nvidia’s current setup as increasingly attractive heading into 2026, making it “top pick.” Let’s look at it closely.\nAbout NVIDIA Stock Santa Clara-based Nvidia has spent decades building itself into one of the most influential technology companies on the planet. What began as a gaming graphics specialist evolved into a computing powerhouse spanning data centers, networking, automotive, and advanced software.\nIts CUDA platform entrenched Nvidia deeply within developer workflows, shifting the company from a component supplier to an industry standard. Today, under Jensen Huang, Nvidia stands as a dominant force with global reach and immense financial scale, currently boasting a market capitalization of nearly $4.6 trillion.\n\nNvidia's operational dominance has translated into a stock story marked by sharp runs, healthy pauses, and strong long-term structure. NVDA has rallied aggressively through 2025, only stopping periodically to consolidate gains. After peaking near $212.19 in late October, the stock is down by 11.67%. Even after that dip, shares of the chip giant remain firmly in an uptrend, up over 41.9% year-to-date (YTD), and 22.9% over the past six months.\n\nStory Continues\nPlus, NVDA has surged recently on a mix of analyst optimism and strategic developments. For instance, after Cantor named it a top 2026 pick, and BofA reiterated a “Buy” with a $275 target on NVDA after a new licensing deal with AI firm Groq, the stock price rose.\nMomentum also followed reports that NVDA plans to resume H200 AI chip shipments to China by mid-February, pending approvals, marking the first major U.S. export of advanced AI chips since prior restrictions, boosting investor confidence despite lingering regulatory risks.\n\nTechnically, the chart suggests stabilizing momentum. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which pushed into overbought territory above 70 in October, has eased back toward the mid-to-high 50s. That’s a constructive zone, indicating excess froth has been worked off. More importantly, the RSI is turning upward again, signaling improving momentum and renewed buyer interest rather than fading demand. Trading volume has returned to normal levels, suggesting the stock is taking a breather and moving sideways rather than seeing heavy selling or investors rushing for the exits.\nThe MACD oscillator reinforces that view. The MACD line remains above its signal line, indicating a bullish broader trend. Meanwhile, the histogram has flipped back into positive territory this month, signaling strengthening upside momentum. Taken together, NVDA’s technical setup signals the stock is catching its breath and not losing momentum, with the overall trend still looking solid as it prepares for the next move.\nNvidia’s valuation can seem rich at first pass. The stock is priced at 42.85 times forward earnings and roughly 21.5 times sales, levels that tower over most peers. But context matters.\nAt the same time, Blackwell-based deployments are only beginning to scale, with a broader rack-level upgrade cycle forming around Blackwell and the upcoming Vera Rubin GPUs. With earnings growth still accelerating, the premium reflects forward visibility rather than excess, suggesting valuation is being anchored by what lies ahead, not just what’s already priced in.\n\nNvidia Beats Q3 Revenue and EPS Estimates Nvidia’s third-quarter update had a familiar ring to it – strong numbers, confident outlook, and little sign of fatigue. On Nov. 19, the stock rose nearly 3% as the company delivered results that comfortably cleared Wall Street’s bar and were backed by confident guidance. Revenue grew 62.5% year-over-year (YOY) to $57.01 billion, while adjusted EPS rose 60.5% annually to $1.30, signaling that size has not dulled Nvidia’s execution.\n\nThe data center segment remained the backbone of the business, with sales jumping 66% to $51.2 billion. Networking emerged as a standout, posting a massive 162% revenue jump to $8.2 billion as products like NVLink, InfiniBand, and Spectrum-X Ethernet saw rising adoption. Gaming continued to show resilience with 30% growth, while the automotive unit quietly built momentum, advancing 32% from a year earlier.\nLeadership struck a confident note throughout. CFO Colette Kress pointed to Blackwell Ultra as the company’s top-selling product, and CEO Jensen Huang said cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. With fourth-quarter revenue projected at around $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, Nvidia’s operating rhythm looks steady and far from slowing down.\nMeanwhile, analysts tracking Nvidia forecast its Q4 fiscal 2026 revenue to be $65.6 billion, and EPS is anticipated to grow 69.4% YOY to $1.44. For the full fiscal 2026, the bottom line is expected to surge 50.9% annually to $4.42 per share and rise by another 55.7% to $6.88 in fiscal 2027.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock? Wall Street’s outlook on Nvidia has taken a noticeably constructive turn, led by Cantor Fitzgerald’s bullish stance. The firm recently reiterated NVDA as a “top pick,” arguing that the AI chip stock’s pullback has created an attractive entry point. With demand trends stabilizing, valuations resetting, and a new product cycle approaching, Cantor believes the market is underestimating Nvidia’s next leg of growth.\n\nThat optimism is echoed at Tigress Financial, which has grown even more confident in Nvidia’s long-term story. Last week, Tigress raised its price target to $350 from $280 and maintained a “Strong Buy” rating, calling NVDA stock the “premier AI investment” on the market.\nTigress points to Nvidia’s dominance in data center computing as the foundation, but sees additional upside from expanding use cases in areas like autonomous driving and healthcare. A steady stream of record quarters reinforces Nvidia’s role as the core engine behind global infrastructure buildouts. With strong cash generation, disciplined capital allocation, and underappreciated growth drivers emerging, Tigress views Nvidia as a long-duration winner still early in its journey.\n\nOverall, analysts are bullish about NVDA’s growth prospects, giving the stock a consensus rating of “Strong Buy.” Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, 44 advise a “Strong Buy,” while two suggest “Moderate Buy,” one advises a “Hold,” and only one suggests a “Strong Sell.”\nThe average analyst price target for NVDA is $256, indicating potential upside of 34.36%. Evercore ISI’s Street-high target price of $352 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 84.75% from here.\nFinal Thoughts on NVDA As 2026 approaches, the questions around Nvidia are less about demand and more about how much of it ultimately flows through the income statement. Data centers remain the anchor, but attention is steadily shifting toward what comes next – Rubin chips, expanding backlogs, and deeper penetration across infrastructure layers.\n\nManagement has already flagged a massive $500 billion order backlog tied to chips and networking, with a significant portion of it expected to land in 2026 alone. Big customers are not slowing either, with hyperscalers set to pour hundreds of billions into infrastructure. Meanwhile, deals like Anthropic’s long-term compute agreement add visibility. Beyond that, Nvidia is quietly expanding into CPUs, software, and inference through partnerships and strategic moves like the reported Groq acquisition.\nCompetition is clearly rising, and geopolitical risks cannot be ignored. Still, Nvidia enters this phase with a solid balance sheet, expanding markets, and a relentless focus on R&D and long-horizon bets across areas like robotics and quantum computing. Those strengths help reinforce its staying power, which is why Cantor's analyst projects NVDA poised for gains in 2026.\nFor long-term investors, the recent pullback looks less like a red flag and more like a chance to add exposure to a market leader as it gears up for its next chapter.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has a Third of His Portfolio in These 6 Incredible AI Stocks Poised to Dominate in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Laffont is a huge believer in the artificial intelligence (AI) investment trend.\nNvidia and TSMC are slated to thrive due to increased data center spending in 2026.\nThe AI hyperscalers all have strong core businesses to fund their AI buildouts.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nChecking up on what billionaire hedge fund managers have in their portfolios can be a smart idea for investors. This information is publicly released 45 days after a quarter ends through a Form 13F . While this doesn't give up-to-date information on what these hedge fund managers are doing, it at least informs investors on some potential solid stock picks.\n\nOne billionaire I follow is Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management. He has had some incredible success, and after examining some of his top portfolio holdings, it's clear he's bullish on artificial intelligence (AI). About a third of his portfolio is invested in six monster AI stocks, and I think each of these should be owned by individual investors in 2026.\nAll six stocks look primed to excel in 2026 The six AI-focused holdings Coatue Management has are:\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) (7.3% of portfolio)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) (5.9% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manucturing (NYSE: TSM) (5.5% of portfolio)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) (4.7% of portfolio)\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) (4.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (4.3% of portfolio)\n\nAltogether, that adds up to 32.2%, or about a third of total portfolio assets. However, he also has exposure to other AI investments in his portfolio; these are just some of the largest ones. It's clear that this billionaire believes that these six will do well in 2026, and I think he's right on track.\nThe AI buildout is far from over Infrastructure players like Nvidia are set to do well in 2026. The demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) is insatiable, as the AI hyperscalers are looking to get as much computing power online as fast as possible. Nvidia told investors during its Q3 earnings release that it is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs because demand is so high. This bodes well for anyone in this industry, including Taiwan Semiconductor, which is a major chip supplier to Nvidia.\n\nAI buildouts are expected to persist for many years. Nvidia expects global 2025 data center capital expenditures to reach $600 billion. However, that figure is expected to rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.\nIf that pans out, businesses like Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia make for incredible purchases right now. Combine that with the fact that each of these stocks is down a bit from its all-time high, and each seems like a smart purchase.\n\nStory Continues\nMoving to the AI hyperscalers, companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are all spending a ton of money on AI computing capacity. While investors may be getting a bit fed up with these expensive capital expenditures, all four believe that this investment is necessary to stay relevant in the future.\n\nOf these four, Meta may be the most intriguing. Meta's stock fell hard after Q3 earnings. While its growth and profitability were great, investors took issue with management's spending plans for 2026. As a result, the stock plummeted, and it's now the cheapest of these six when valued using next year's earnings.\nAt 21.8 times next year's earnings, Meta is priced about the same level as the S&P 500 index. With Meta expected to deliver market-beating growth, it seems like a no-brainer investment.\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft all operate leading cloud computing platforms. These will be long-term winners, as clients continue to need more and more computing capacity as generative AI workloads become more common. Furthermore, each of these companies also has its own generative AI model or has deep partnerships with one of the major players. This places them in a great position to succeed not only in 2026, but also in the years after.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont has positioned his portfolio wisely to take advantage of the massive AI buildout. I think investors should do the same, and these six are a great place to start.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could 5X by 2030\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points AMD's technology stack is improving.\nAMD's margins could expand to deliver outsized profit growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nFinding stocks that can increase in value 5 times within five years is a lofty goal. That requires serious stock performance, and few companies can deliver that. To achieve 5 times returns in five years, a company must grow at a 38% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) . A 38% CAGR isn't an easy return to achieve, and it requires a massive market opportunity.\n\nWhat's a bigger opportunity than artificial intelligence (AI) ? There are several names in this industry, including AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) . AMD has outperformed rival Nvidia in 2025, rising around 80% versus Nvidia's 35%. Furthermore, AMD gave an incredible growth projection set to come about over the next five years, so it's the perfect candidate to see if it could return 5 times in five years. Management's numbers line up with the 38% CAGR laid out above, giving AMD a real shot at delivering this incredible return.\nAMD's management is bullish on its five-year outlook Frankly, AMD has not done well in the AI revolution. Its hardware isn't as good as Nvidia's, and its software was well behind. However, AMD has made various acquisitions and partnerships to improve its controlling software, ROCm. It noted that downloads for ROCm were up 10 times year over year as of November 2025, so there is a possibility that AMD could start gaining some ground on Nvidia once AI clients realize that AMD's technology stack could compete with Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia has controlled the data center computing market with an iron fist, and this dominance shows up in each company's results. In Q3 2025, AMD's data center revenue rose 22% year over year to $4.3 billion. During Nvidia's Q3 FY 2026 (ending Oct. 26, 2025), its data center revenue totaled $51.2 billion, up 66% year over year. AMD is clearly getting smoked here, but the tides could be changing.\nIn Nvidia's release, they noted that they are \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. This could be a concern for Nvidia, as clients will now likely search for alternative computing providers to fulfill their massive computing power needs. AMD could emerge as a top option to provide this power, and once they realize how far AMD's technology has come, they could become greater clients of AMD's because of its lower price point. That could increase AMD's business in the future, and so could a return to selling in the Chinese market.\n\nStory Continues\nCurrently, neither AMD nor Nvidia is allowed to sell in China. However, they recently made a deal with the U.S. government to give up 15% of revenue for the right to export these GPUs to China. These GPUs aren't the cutting-edge ones used in the U.S. and are specifically downgraded to meet export restrictions. But if this sales channel returns, it could be a huge boost to AMD over the long run.\n\nWhile these are positive catalysts, are they enough to provide the 38% CAGR necessary to return 5 times in five years?\nAMD's guidance is slightly lower than a 38% CAGR Over the next five years, AMD believes it can deliver a 60% CAGR in its data center division. That clears the 38% threshold by a wide margin, but that's not the only part of AMD's business. AMD also has a consumer hardware and embedded processor division, and each of those is expected to grow at a 10% CAGR over the next five years. That brings AMD's total CAGR to 35%, slightly less than the 38% needed.\nHowever, revenue growth isn't the only thing the market looks at. If AMD can achieve outsized profit growth as well, it may be able to surpass the 38% CAGR in profit growth. After all, AMD's margins are far slimmer than Nvidia's.\nIf AMD can improve its profit margin to the 15% to 20% range, that will double the profits it generates from its revenue, providing another growth lever. If AMD can improve its margins and grow at the expected growth rate, I do not doubt that the stock could return 5 times in five years. If it does this, AMD will be a top stock to buy and hold.\n\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "These stocks saw gains in shortened Christmas week trading\n\nBenzinga\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:02 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nMU\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nThe S&P 500 notched new all-time highs during the shortened Christmas trading week, capping off another year of double-digit gains — its third consecutive and the sixth in the past seven years.\nTechnology stocks once again led Wall Street’s advance. Nvidia surged in its best week since late October, buoyed by a new wave of deals tied to next-generation artificial intelligence chips.\nOn Wednesday, AI chip startup Groq unveiled a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia, reportedly worth $20 billion, for its inference technology, a move analysts said would further reinforce Nvidia’s already dominant competitive moat.\nMore: Stocks rebound after rocky week on news of cooling inflation\nMicron Technology continued to rally, extending gains following a blockbuster quarterly earnings report. The stock posted its fifth consecutive weekly gain — and its 10th in the past 11 weeks. Micron currently ranked as the second-best performer in the S&P 500 this year, with shares up roughly 240% year to date, trailing only Western Digital among the index’s top gainers of 2025.\n\nNike also made headlines after Apple CEO Tim Cook disclosed a $3 million purchase of the company’s stock, acquiring 50,000 shares at $58.97 each following the sharp post-earnings sell-off. Nike shares reacted positively, rising about 5%.\nFor Michigan-based automakers, 2025 shaped up as a strong year in the equity markets. General Motors shares were up 55% year to date, while Ford gained 38%. For GM, this marked its best annual performance since its return to public markets in 2010. Stellantis, by contrast, lagged peers and was on track to close the year down roughly 13%.\nOn the commodities front, precious metals closed out a truly exceptional year. Silver’s rally showed little sign of slowing, with prices that broke above $75 an ounce amid acute supply constraints in Asian markets. The move pushed silver’s year-to-date gain above 150%, which marked its strongest annual performance since 1979.\nOther metals also posted extraordinary gains. Platinum surged roughly 170% this year, on track for its best annual performance on record.\nBenzinga is a financial news and data company headquartered in Detroit.\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: These stocks saw gains in shortened Christmas week trading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Got $5,000? 3 Incredible Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 3:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nMELI\n\nKey Points Nvidia expects more strong growth in 2026.\nThe Trade Desk was the S&P 500's worst-performing stock.\nMercadoLibre is dominating Latin American e-commerce.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n2026 is right around the corner, and there are some incredible stocks available to buy. I've got three that I believe will crush the market in 2026, and I think investors should have some healthy exposure to them.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) , and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) make great buys. These three all operate in different areas, and are poised to continue 2025's success or make a huge comeback.\n1. Nvidia Nvidia is the world's largest company by market cap . However, that isn't stopping it from growing at an unreal pace. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) and the technology to support them, which are the preferred computing units to train and run artificial intelligence (AI) models. Nvidia expects monster growth in 2026, as the AI hyperscalers have all informed their investors that they will be spending a record amount constructing data centers in 2026.\n\nThis bodes well for Nvidia, but it has one problem: It's sold out of cloud GPUs. With demand so high for its GPUs, it can start taking orders for computer graphics years in advance. This is what gives management confidence to provide a mind-blowing projection: It expects global data center capital expenditures to total $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's up from 2025's $600 billion, and if Nvidia's projection pans out, it will be one of the best stocks to own in 2026 and beyond.\nFurthermore, Nvidia's stock really isn't all that expensive. It trades for 24 times 2026's earnings, which isn't bad considering the multi-year growth it's expected to deliver.\n2. The Trade Desk The Trade Desk has had a bad year. It is currently the worst-performing company in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) for 2025, down around 70% this year. That's a horrendous 2025 for one of the leading advertising software providers, but it's not because the company is necessarily doing poorly.\n\nIn Q3, The Trade Desk's revenue rose 18% year over year. The only issue is that The Trade Desk's revenue growth rate is slowing, thanks to rising competition and a poorly executed rollout of its new AI-powered platform, Kokai. However, part of The Trade Desk's decline was an elimination of the premium the stock used to trade at. Now, it's actually undervalued.\nThe Trade Desk now trades at less than 18 times 2026's earnings, making it a solid value in today's expensive market. I think The Trade Desk will mount a solid comeback in 2026 and provide market-beating returns along the way.\n\nStory Continues\n3. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre hasn't had as bad a year as The Trade Desk, as it's still up around 17% for the year. However, that's about market-matching growth, which is disappointing considering MercadoLibre's long-term outperformance.\nMercadoLibre is the dominant e-commerce and fintech company in Latin America. It's essentially a combination of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) , and shareholders have reaped the rewards of owning MercadoLibre as it has rapidly expanded to dominate the e-commerce market in Latin America. It still has a long way to go, and its stock is valued at the lowest level it has seen in a long time.\nAt just 15 times free cash flow, MercadoLibre looks like a steal at these levels. Combine its low price tag with an incredible opportunity to dominate Latin American commerce, MercadoLibre looks like a no-brainer buy. It's down more than 20% from its all-time high established in July. I think MercadoLibre will return to its market-beating status in 2026, making it one of the top stocks to buy for the year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?
