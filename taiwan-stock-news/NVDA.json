The deal primarily targets AI21’s workforce of approximately 200 employees, most with advanced academic degrees and rare experience in artificial intelligence development. The acquisition price represents about $10-15 million per employee.\n\nAI21 Labs is one of the few Israeli companies developing a large-scale language model for artificial intelligence. The company’s last known valuation was $1.4 billion following a capital raise in 2023.\nReports from last summer suggested AI21 completed a $300 million fundraising round led by Nvidia and Google, though these publications were never confirmed by the company.\nFounded in 2017 by Amnon Shashua and two others, AI21 has benefited from the boom in artificial intelligence, attracting significant interest from venture capital firms and investors. Shashua is also the founder and CEO of Mobileye.\nRelated articles\nNvidia in talks to buy A21 Labs for $2B-$3B, Israeli media reports\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\nThese Under-$10 Stocks Are Up 100%+ This Quarter - And Some Still Have Room to Run\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The agreement appears like an acquisition in terms of its economic impact, but it's not one on paper.\nNvidia gives Groq workers a payday Axios says that Groq's stockholders and employees are getting compensated as if they were leaving the company, even though no equity is changing hands. And Nvidia gets what it needs most for 2026: inference IP, talented engineers, and speed.\nAxios’ reporting answers the question that immediately lit up social media: What happens to Groq employees if Nvidia “didn’t buy” the company?\n\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nAxios adds that Groq stockholders will get cash payments for each share they own based on the $20 billion value, even though \"no equity is changing hands.\" The payments are set up like this: 85% up front, 10% in the middle of 2026, and the rest at the end of 2026.\nRelated: Novo Nordisk just pulled off something nobody saw coming\nThe terms are very generous for employees:\nIt is likely that about 90% of Groq's workers will go to Nvidia. They will get cash for vested shares and Nvidia stock that vests over time for unvested equity.\nAxios said that about 50 people in that category get their share faster and with cash.\nPeople who stay at Groq still get paid for vested shares and earn a package that is related to the company's future.\nAxios claims that even new hires will profit because the usual one-year vesting cliff is being dropped, so employees who have been there for less than a year can still obtain liquidity .\n\nAxios’ bottom line is so blunt: “Everyone gets paid. A lot.”\nGroq’s inference edge is Nvidia’s prize Groq's own release frames the deal as a way to make \"high-performance, low-cost inference\" more widely available. It also says that Groq founder Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other team members are joining Nvidia. It also says that Groq will be independent, with Simon Edwards taking over as CEO, and that GroqCloud will keep running.\nRelated: Alphabet makes a subtle Gmail shift ahead of 2026\nThe move is part of a larger trend in which Big Tech is looking for licensing-plus-talent deals to speed things up and make it easier to cope with rules.\n\nStory Continues\nThis is Nvidia preparing for 2026, which will be all about \"AI factories\" and always-on inference (the term used to describe the continuous use of AI models, rather than their training).\nImpact on Nvidia's balance sheet, income statement The $20 billion Groq deal that Nvidia just made is big news, but it's not too much for a firm that makes money at Nvidia's present rate. Nvidia has $60.6 billion in cash , cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of the conclusion of its quarter on Oct. 26. The free cash flow for that same quarter was about $22.1 billion. This means that the Groq price tag is about \"one quarter of free cash flow\" at the current run rate.\n\nRelated: This $40 PC fix might be the quietest MSFT signal for 2026\nNvidia is also still in a strong position to return cash, which is important. NVDA is aggressively buying back stock and giving cash back to shareholders while it builds up its AI infrastructure. This is one reason why most investors see this move as adding value rather than taking it away.\nThe timing of the cash payments is another aspect that is easy to overlook. The money that Groq stakeholders will get isn't likely to come in one big check. The mechanism reported delivers around 85% of the money up front, 10% in the middle of 2026, and the rest at the end of 2026. That moves some of the cash effect into next year, which fits with the bigger notion that the payout is a strategic bet for 2026 and beyond, not merely a one-time headline.\n\nRelated: Warner faces a surprise new bid as investors do the real math\nFinally, investors should closely monitor the \"hidden\" implications that may appear on the income statement in 2026.\nThe Groq employee transition is set up so that vested equity is paid out in cash and unvested equity is turned into Nvidia stock that vests over time. That's a benefit for keeping employees, but it could also mean more stock-based pay and costs associated with integration. And depending on how Nvidia records the perpetual license, investors may see amortization or other non-cash expenses that are important for GAAP results even if cash flow is robust.\nNvidia’s deal is a blueprint for AI tie-ups Investors should view the Groq structure as an indication that AI-driven dealmaking is evolving. The plan is straightforward: Get the essential IP, employ the leaders, and make sure the target stays \"independent.\"\nIt's easy to see why this happens more often in 2026:\nIt takes too long to examine AI infrastructure.\nRegulators have been wary of big mergers.\nBig companies can pay acquisition-level fees for \"access\" instead of \"ownership.\"\n\nAnd the market conditions make it more likely. Coverage from Bank of America reveals patterns indicating significant chip growth in 2026, with Nvidia consistently being one of the largest companies to benefit from this trend.\nNvidia didn't simply make a $20 billion purchase; it may have shown how major AI companies plan to expand in 2026: faster than regulators can stop them and with enough money to make \"not an acquisition\" feel like one.\nRelated: What’s next for Nvidia stock in 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 30, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Can Intel's Investment-Driven Strategy Regain Its Competitive Edge?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 7:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nQCOM\n\nAMD\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nIntel Corporation ( INTC ) has completed a previously announced $5 billion investment from NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ), under which the latter purchased around 214.7 million shares of the former at $23.28 per share. Earlier in December, this transaction received U.S. antitrust approval from the Federal Trade Commission. This purchase gives NVIDIA roughly a 4% equity stake in Intel through a private placement of shares.\n\nThe partnership aims to tightly combine Intel’s custom-designed x86 CPUs with NVIDIA’s AI GPUs and NVLink interconnect technology to create faster, more efficient AI systems and next-generation PCs with stronger AI and graphics performance. This could help Intel remain competitive in the AI era.\nIntel had also secured $8.9 billion in funds from the U.S. government to support semiconductor manufacturing and packaging projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon in order to boost the domestic chip industry. SoftBank has also invested $2 billion, providing funds to support Intel’s restructuring and AI projects.\nIntel is constantly making efforts to bring huge investments to strengthen its balance sheet, supporting heavy spending on new factories and R&D, boosting market confidence and enabling deeper technology collaboration with firms like NVIDIA.\n\nHow Are Rivals Performing? Intel faces competition from Qualcomm Incorporated ( QCOM ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). Qualcomm recently completed its $2.4 billion acquisition of British semiconductor company Alphawave Semi to strengthen its AI, data center and high-speed connectivity technologies, boosting its competitiveness beyond smartphones. By strengthening its PC chip offerings through programs like Snapdragon X, Qualcomm can expand into new markets such as AI infrastructure, edge computing and personal computers. Qualcomm entered the AI infrastructure space by developing AI accelerators like AI200 & AI250.\n\nAMD is set to launch high-performance AI GPUs, EPYC server CPUs and full AI systems like Helios to compete with NVIDIA and provide faster, more efficient solutions for data centers and enterprises. AMD is partnering with companies like OpenAI and Oracle to expand across gaming, PCs and servers to increase revenues and stay competitive. The company continues to improve its ROCm open software stack and open hardware standards.\nINTC’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of Intel have surged 85% over the past year compared with the industry ’s growth of 34.1%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/book ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 1.5 book value, lower than 32.5 of the industry average.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nINTC’s earnings estimates for 2025 have increased 6.3% to 34 cents per share, while those for 2026 have declined 6.5% to 58 cents over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIntel stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Ranking the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy for 2026. Here's My No. 2\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's GPUs are the gold standard for training and running AI programs.\nThe company says it has $500 billion in orders through the end of 2026.\nNvidia's top customers are among those working on alternative chip designs.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) buildout would look much different without Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the gold standard for training and running AI products, and major companies have been spending billions to buy and package the chips to try to get an advantage in the AI race.\n\nData centers bundle Nvidia chips by the thousands so they can work together to perform high-level AI tasks, which has been a huge windfall for Nvidia and its investors. CEO Jensen Huang has said the company's Blackwell chips cost $30,000 or more each -- so any company investing in AI chips is making substantial purchases.\nThat's helped Nvidia leapfrog other major companies to become the largest publicly traded company in the world by market capitalization. Nvidia even topped the $5 trillion mark earlier this year before pulling back -- it now has a market capitalization of more than $4.5 trillion.\nNvidia took its place as a member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a grouping identified by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett as the most influential stocks in the S&P 500 .\nThis is the sixth article in a series ranking the best Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026. In previous articles, I identified Apple in the No. 7 spot , Amazon as No. 6, Tesla as No. 5, Microsoft in the No. 4 spot, and Meta Platforms as No. 3. Here's why Nvidia deserves the No. 2 spot for 2026.\n\nAbout Nvidia stock We've already covered what Nvidia does. What we haven't talked about is how much money the company's making and how Nvidia's GPU sales have changed its trajectory.\nIn just five years, Nvidia saw incredible revenue growth of 682%. Profits have been even better, as Nvidia's net income rose by 1,580% in the last five years, and its free cash flow is up by 1,550%.\nEven faced with more challenging comparable numbers, Nvidia continues to shine. Revenue in its fiscal 2026's third quarter (ended Oct. 26, 2025) was $57 billion, up 62% from a year ago. Most of those sales came from the company's data center segment, which saw $51.2 billion in revenue, up 66% from the previous year.\nThe company's gross margin is an impressive 73.4%, with net income of $31.91 billion, a 65% increase year over year. Earnings per share came in at $1.30, up 67% year over year.\n\nStory Continues\nHuang, who has predicted that the global AI infrastructure market could grow from $600 billion to $4 trillion by 2030, says Nvidia is profiting from three simultaneous shifts in computing: an evolution from CPU general-purpose computing to GPU-accelerated computing, the rise of generative AI, and growth in agentic AI systems.\n\n\"Nvidia is chosen because our singular architecture enables all three transitions and thus so [sic], for any form and modality of AI across all industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in the cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots, one architecture,\" he said.\nNvidia says that it has had $500 billion in cumulative orders for its Blackwell and upcoming Rubin AI chips, with $150 billion worth already shipped.\nWhy Nvidia is No. 2 This company is doing things the right way. There's a huge opportunity in AI infrastructure, and Nvidia has massive competitive advantages. But I also think that the waters are going to get a little choppier in 2026. Companies are spending billions of dollars a year on Nvidia processors. Some of them are looking for alternatives or at least trying to create competition.\n\nAmazon, a major Nvidia customer, is now marketing its Trainium3 custom AI chip, which it claims can halve the cost of training and operating AI models compared to systems that use GPUs. Meta Platforms is also reportedly in talks with Alphabet 's Google about purchasing billions of dollars' worth of Google's tensor processing units, or TPUs, to operate in its data centers.\nOpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has signed new deals with Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom to provide additional computing power for its popular AI models.\nNvidia currently holds an estimated 90% of data center AI market share, but that won't last forever. Its biggest customers -- many of them members of the Magnificent Seven as well -- would rather make their own chip infrastructure than continue to feed Nvidia's bottom line.\n\nMy prediction is that Nvidia will have a very good calendar 2026 year. But the stock price will lag behind its 2025 gains (around 40% year to date) as the competitive landscape begins to shift. That's why it gets the No. 2 ranking in the list of top Magnificent Seven stocks to buy for 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "AI Arms Race Drives Capex Boom: 3 AI Stocks to Watch in 2026\n\nSubham Roy\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:04 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMRVL\n\nMU\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence arms race is going to enter a decisive phase after years of heavy investment in chips, data centers and foundational models. The focus is now shifting toward scale, monetization and competitive advantage. The year 2026 will separate long-term winners from those who have not successfully integrated AI-native business models.\n\nAI is no longer an experimental add-on; it has become a core growth driver and customer retention pillar for many companies in 2025. Big Tech, cloud hyperscalers and enterprise software providers are racing to embed AI deeper into products, workflows and infrastructure to get an edge over their competitors.\nAmong the various players within the AI ecosystem, the companies that stand out as the direct beneficiaries of the AI arms race are NVIDIA NVDA, Marvell Technology MRVL and Micron Technology MU, as the rapid expansion of AI inference workloads is structurally dependent on their technologies.\nGrowing Capex Spent to Drive AI Infrastructure Growth According to Gartner, global AI spending is expected to exceed $2 trillion in 2026 compared with an estimated $1.5 trillion in 2025. A major portion of this spending will be on AI infrastructure, which will drive the demand for semiconductor chips providing high bandwidth memory, compute, control, connectivity and deployment.\n\nPer a report by International Data Corp. (IDC), the global AI infrastructure market is expected to hit a massive $758 billion by 2029, driven by strong demand for compute and storage hardware. IDC expects momentum in AI investment to continue in 2026, driven by strong spending from hyperscalers and cloud service providers.\nThree Stocks Expected to Benefit From Rising AI Capex NVIDIA – This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is at the forefront of the AI revolution due to its strong portfolio. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\nNVIDIA is gaining from the demand for its Hopper 200 and Blackwell GPU, used for training and inference of large language models, and have been a key catalyst as cloud providers and enterprises scale their AI infrastructure.\n\nNVIDIA’s strength lies not just in hardware but in its full-stack approach. GPUs, networking products, software platforms and developer tools work together to create a powerful ecosystem. This integration makes it difficult for competitors to displace NVIDIA in large-scale AI deployments.\nNVIDIA’s financials remain rock solid.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nTuttle Capital Management Launches the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\n\nNewsfile\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:02 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: CBOE\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nGreenwich, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - December 30, 2025) - Tuttle Capital Management, a leading provider of thematic and alternatives ETFs, today announced the launch of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (CBOE: MAGO) , now trading on the CBOE.\nMAGO is an actively managed exchange-traded fund that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the equity performance of the \"Magnificent 7\" - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - using an options 1 -based strategy designed to harvest option premium while maintaining equity-like exposure to these market-defining companies.\n\nThe fund combines direct exposure to the Magnificent 7 with a systematic put-spread 2 program implemented with listed options and FLEX Options® 3 to potentially generate income. The goal is to give investors a way to seek an options-enhanced, rules-driven income stream tied to some of the most influential stocks in global markets.\nTurning the Magnificent 7 Into an Income Strategy\nThe Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla - have become core drivers of index performance, innovation, and investor attention. They also tend to exhibit significant volatility , which creates opportunities in the options market.\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF is built on a straightforward idea: use a disciplined options structure to seek to convert that volatility into a stream of option premium, while maintaining targeted economic exposure to the underlying stocks.\n\nRather than simply owning the Magnificent 7 outright, MAGO seeks to:\nProvide economic exposure approximating the price return (before fees and expenses) of the Magnificent 7 basket,\nSystematically write put spreads on those names to generate additional income.\n\"In today's market, everyone talks about the Magnificent 7, but most investors only have two choices: own them outright or ignore them,\" said Matthew Tuttle , CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. \"With MAGO, we're trying to give income-focused investors another option - a rules-based strategy that seeks to turn the volatility of these names into a potential income stream, while still keeping full exposure to their price moves.\"\nA Unique Approach to Magnificent 7 Income\n\nMAGO's strategy uses several key building blocks:\nMagnificent 7 Core Exposure\nThe fund seeks economic exposure approximating 100% of the price return of the Magnificent 7 (before fees and expenses), primarily through direct investments in their stocks and/or through listed options and FLEX Options on those names, as outlined in the prospectus.\nSystematic Put-Spread Strategy\nMAGO implements a systematic put-spread program on the Magnificent 7, typically selling put options 4 and buying further out-of-the-money puts on the same names. This structure is intended to generate option premium, define downside exposure to the option positions, and support the fund's income objectives.\nRegular Rebalancing and Roll Discipline\nThe fund intends to implement and roll its put spreads on a regular schedule , re-establishing positions as prior spreads expire or are closed. This rules-based process is designed to keep the strategy aligned with current market conditions and the fund's income targets, subject to the risks described in the prospectus.\nFocused but Non-Diversified Exposure\nMAGO is non-diversified , meaning it can invest a greater percentage of its assets in the Magnificent 7 than a diversified fund. This concentration can increase volatility and risk, but is central to the fund's objective of tying income generation to these specific, high-impact stocks.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO)\nThe Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF (MAGO) is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide current income and exposure to the price returns of the common stock of the companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent 7,\" MAGO may invest directly in the Magnificent 7 stocks and/or obtain exposure through listed options and FLEX Options on those names. It then implements a systematic put-spread strategy intended to generate option premium and support income generation.\n\nMAGO is advised by Tuttle Capital Management, LLC . Investors should carefully review the fund's prospectus for full details on the investment objective, strategy, fees, and risks, including risks related to equity securities, options, concentration in the Magnificent 7, derivatives, liquidity, and market volatility.\n\nGlossary\n1) Options are financial derivatives that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. They are commonly utilized by investors to hedge against market risk or to speculate on the future price direction of a security.\n2) A Put Spread is an options strategy that involves simultaneously buying and selling put options on the same underlying asset with different strike prices but the same expiration date. This structure is used to limit both the upfront cost (or generate a credit) and the maximum risk, capping potential gains and losses within a specific price range.\n\n3) FLEX® Options are customizable options contracts that allow investors to specify key terms-such as strike price, expiration date, and exercise style-while retaining the benefits of an exchange-traded product. By combining the bespoke nature of the over-the-counter (OTC) market with the transparency and centralized clearing of Cboe, these options reduce counterparty risk and provide greater capital efficiency.\n4) Put Options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of an underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. Investors typically use puts to profit from a decline in the asset's price or to protect an existing long position against potential losses.\n\nAbout Tuttle Capital Management\nTuttle Capital Management is known for building unconventional, research-driven ETFs that seek to give investors access to themes, strategies, and trade structures often overlooked by traditional asset managers. The firm focuses on transparent, rules-based approaches that aim to respond to how markets actually behave, rather than how textbooks say they should.\nFor more information on MAGO, including the prospectus and risk disclosures, please visit incomeblastetfs.com .\nImportant Risk Information\nInvesting involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments in equity securities are subject to the risk that the value of the underlying stocks may decline. Because MAGO is non-diversified and focuses on a small number of large-cap technology and growth-oriented companies, it may be more volatile than a diversified fund and more sensitive to sector- and issuer-specific developments.\n\nThe Fund's use of options, including put spreads and FLEX Options, involves additional risks, such as the possibility that options may expire worthless, the impact of changes in implied volatility, and the potential for increased losses due to leverage embedded in options positions. The Fund's strategy also limits potential gains relative to direct ownership of the Magnificent 7 stocks. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that its options strategy will be successful.\nShares of the Fund are bought and sold on an exchange at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.\nInvestors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Tuttle Capital Magnificent 7 Income Blast ETF before investing. For a prospectus with this and other information about the fund, please call (833) 759-6110 or visit the Fund's website.\n\nDistributor: Foreside Fund Services, LLC\nMedia Contact:\nMatthew Tuttle\nTuttle Capital Management\nmtuttle@tuttlecap.com\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/279159\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

( NVDA , Financials ) investing $20 billion in AI inference business Groq shows its desire to dominate the AI ecosystem. Groq may continue operating independently while Nvidia uses its inference tools thanks to its founder Jonathan Ross and several engineers.Nvidia's planned diversification beyond AI training hardware is shown by the deal. Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPUs fuel most large-scale model training, but the company is now targeting inference, which has a far larger and recurring revenue potential.Over 90% of the AI GPU market is Nvidia. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq protects market dominance and adds software and service income streams while Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft construct their own inference processors to save costs.AI applications increase inference workloads considerably. AI token usage at major tech businesses increases every few months, fueling inference hardware and platform demand, say analysts. Beyond inference, Nvidia is entering networking, robotics, and government. Last quarter, networking sales surged 162% to $8.2 billion, while automotive and professional visualization grew double digits.Nvidia's Strong Buy consensus has 39 Buys and one Hold rating with an average price target of $263.58, implying 40% upside over a year. To balance chip sales with long-term software, cloud, and inference revenue growth, Nvidia's Groq acquisition boosts its full-stack AI platform transition.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Buy These 5 Low-Leverage Stocks Amid a Reversal of Santa Claus Rally\n\nAparajita Dutta\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:20 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nHL\n\nENGQF\n\nRMD\n\nRSMDF\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indices slipped at the bourses on Dec. 29, 2025, led by a drop in big technology shares, including Oracle, Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. The move might have disappointed some investors who had been anticipating a &ldquo;Santa Claus rally,&rdquo; a seasonal pattern in which the S&P 500 typically gains during the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the new year.\n\nAt this juncture, investors may want to favor safe-haven assets over high-growth technology stocks, given that declines in AI-driven tech names were a key reason behind the broader market sell-off. So, we recommend companies, such as Engie SA ENGIY, Hamilton Insurance Group HG, Hecla Mining HL, Resmed RMD and Siemens Energy SMNEY. These stocks carry low leverage and, therefore, may offer a safer option for investors seeking stability during periods of market turmoil.\nNow, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let&rsquo;s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock can help investors.\nWhat&rsquo;s the Significance of Low-Leverage Stocks? In finance, leverage refers to the practice of borrowing capital to help companies run their operations smoothly and expand their business. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt financing over equity financing.\n\nHowever, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. To avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, it is advisable to avoid companies that rely excessively on debt financing.\nThe crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.\nThe equity market can be volatile at times. As an investor, if you want to avoid significant losses, we suggest focusing on stocks with low leverage, which are generally less risky.\nTo identify such stocks, several leverage ratios have historically been developed to measure the amount of debt a company carries. The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common of these ratios.\n\nAnalyzing Debt/Equity Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders&rsquo; Equity\nThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.\nWith the fourth-quarter 2025 earnings season ahead of us, investors should be eyeing stocks that have demonstrated solid earnings growth in recent periods.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, if a stock carries a high debt-to-equity ratio during an economic downturn, its seemingly strong earnings could quickly turn into a nightmare.\nThe Winning Strategy Considering the factors above, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.\nYet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To select stocks with the potential to provide steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include additional factors.\n\nHere are the other parameters :\nDebt/Equity less than X-Industry Median : Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.\nCurrent Price greater than or equal to 10 : The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.\nAverage 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000 : A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.\nPercentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median : Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock&rsquo;s price appreciation.\nVGM Score of A or B : Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.\nEstimated One-Year EPS Growth F (1)/F(0) greater than 5 : This shows earnings growth expectations.\n\nZacks Rank #1 or 2 : Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.\nExcluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 18 stocks that made it through the screen.\nEngie : It engages in the power, natural gas, and energy services businesses. On Dec. 18, 2025, Engie announced that its largest onshore wind project globally and one of the largest in Latin America, Serra do Assuru&aacute;, has reached full commercial operations. This should bolster ENGIY&rsquo;s position in the globally expanding wind energy market.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ENGIY&rsquo;s 2025 earnings indicates an improvement of 28.5% from the prior-year reported actuals. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nHamilton Insurance Group : It underwrites specialty insurance and reinsurance risks, principally in Bermuda and internationally. On Nov. 4, 2025, the company released its third-quarter 2025 results.

It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\nHecla Mining : The company is a leading low-cost U.S. silver producer with mines in Alaska and Idaho, and an expanding gold producer with operations in Quebec, Canada.

It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nResmed : It is a well-known designer, manufacturer, and distributor in the worldwide market for generators, masks, and related accessories for the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and other respiratory disorders.\nOn Dec. 8, 2025, ResMed announced that it received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for Personalized Therapy Comfort Settings (PTCS), which will be marketed as Smart Comfort. Smart Comfort is the first FDA-cleared AI-enabled medical device that recommends personalized comfort settings to help people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) initiate and adhere to CPAP therapy.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for RMD&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 sales suggests a year-over-year improvement of 8.4%.

You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\nSiemens Energy : The company focuses on the design, development, manufacture and supply of products, installation and technologically advanced services, principally in the renewable energy sector with a focus on wind power plants. On Nov. 20, 2025, Siemens Energy announced its plans to repurchase its own shares worth up to approximately $6.9 billion (&euro;6 billion) by the end of fiscal 2028.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SMNEY&rsquo;s fiscal 2026 revenues indicates an improvement of 16.9% from the prior-year reported actuals.

The year 2025 remains on track to be a positive one for equity investors, but the success of the Santa Claus Rally is by no means assured as some caution and volatility seems to be in play. Along those lines, reading the tea leaves contained in insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research is a challenging task this week. For starters, transaction volume historically is low in the final trading days of any year, diminishing the quality of the data. But this year, the days are 'even quieter' because of two 'added' federal holidays that left the SEC closed for three of the five business days last week (the SEC being the source of the Form 4 documents filed by insiders when they transact). To add some detail, 466 filings meet the criteria for inclusion in Vickers' Weekly Insider Report this week, compared to 1641 last week. Turning to longer-term (eight-week) data to mitigate the short-term (one-week) weakness, we note that the data is solidly neutral, suggesting corporate insiders are not eager to buy stock -- but nor are they selling aggressively. On a scale where the neutral range runs from 2.00 to 6.00, Vickers' eight-week sell/buy ratio for the NYSE is 3.44, the Nasdaq ratio is 3.90, and the Total (all exchanges) ratio is 3.67.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Could Be Among the First to Reach a $5 Trillion Valuation\n\nThomas Niel, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points In October, Nvidia's market cap briefly topped $5 trillion.\nWhile that particular \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has since pulled back, another member could join the $5 trillion club this year.\nGoogle parent Alphabet currently has a market capitalization of $3.8 trillion.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nBack in October, Nvidia became the first company with a market cap exceeding $5 trillion.\nNvidia's stock has since pulled back from that lofty level, but one big rally might be all it takes to lift the AI chip giant back above that value in 2026. Not only that, a few other companies could join that exclusive club, too.\nFor instance, as my fellow Motley Fool contributor Harsh Chauhan noted in an article on Dec. 20, Microsoft could conceivably hit that market cap milestone in the coming year .\nIn my view, another \" Magnificent Seven \" member also looks to be on the verge of joining the $5 trillion club: Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) .\nWhy Alphabet is so close to hitting this milestone Alphabet shares have surged by 65% year to date. The primary reason for this has been the company's success in catching up to early adopters of generative artificial intelligence (AI) like Microsoft and OpenAI. Alphabet's Gemini 3 has given ChatGPT a run for its money.\nMore importantly, the AI Overviews and AI Mode features on the Google search engine have helped to increase user engagement with the platform. This has alleviated investors' initial concerns that the growing use of AI chatbots to answer people's questions would cut into Alphabet's primary profit center, search advertising.\n\nThanks to this year's significant share price run-up, Alphabet now has a market cap of $3.8 trillion. That means all it'll take for the company to reach a $5 trillion market cap is for it to appreciate in value by another 31.6%. Not only is that well within the realm of possibility in the next few years, there's a chance it could happen between now and next December. It all has to do with near-term earnings growth, coupled with the potential for the stock to experience further valuation expansion.\nCould it happen next year? According to sell-side analysts' estimates, Alphabet's earnings per share (EPS) could rise by over 41% between now and the end of 2028. This strongly suggests that it's a matter of when, not if, Alphabet will join the $5 trillion club.\nHowever, a move to that market cap could arrive as soon as 2026. Yes, the average sell-side analyst's earnings forecast may only call for 6% EPS growth next year, but those predictions may be too conservative. Even as Alphabet plans to ramp up spending on AI and cloud infrastructure, the payoff from these investments could take shape sooner than expected.\n\nStory continues\nIn fact, we may already be witnessing this: Google's overall queries and revenue are growing by double-digit percentages thanks to AI integration. The sell-side forecasts at the high end of the range call for earnings growth of as much as 24% in 2026. Even if growth lands somewhere between the average and high end of the forecast range, that may lift the stock price by enough to get the company over the $5 trillion mark.\n\nShares currently trade for around 28 times expected forward earnings. If high growth persists into the coming year and bullishness about AI returns, names like Microsoft could again trade at forward P/Es in the mid-30s, and Alphabet could experience a similar rerating. Considering its plausible path to a $5 trillion market cap, Alphabet may be one of the first stocks investors should buy for the new year.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Nvidia, AMD, and Micron Technology Could Help This Unstoppable ETF Turn $250,000 Into $1 Million in 10 Years\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:33 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMU\n\nAMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution would be at a standstill without advanced chips and components.\nNvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Micron supply some of that critical hardware, and their shares are up by an average of 119% in 2025.\nThe iShares Semiconductor ETF exclusively invests in semiconductor companies that stand to benefit from megatrends like AI.\n10 stocks we like better than iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF ›\n\nTop artificial intelligence (AI) developers like OpenAI and Anthropic continue to launch new models, with each one being \"smarter\" and more capable than the last. However, every new model also soaks up more computing power than its predecessors, so it requires significantly more data center capacity.\nSome of the biggest suppliers of AI infrastructure, chips, and components include Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) , and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) . Shares in those three companies have surged by an average of 119% in 2025 alone, crushing the S&P 500 index, which is up just 18%.\nIn other words, investors who had little or no exposure to the AI semiconductor space this year probably underperformed the broader market.\nFortunately, there's a simple way to buy a slice of this hypergrowth industry without having to pick winners and losers. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that exclusively invests in companies like Nvidia, AMD, Micron, and many of their peers. Here's how it could turn an investment of $250,000 into $1 million over the next 10 years.\nThe best AI hardware stocks packed into one ETF The iShares Semiconductor ETF solely invests in American companies that design, distribute, and manufacture chips and components, but primarily those benefiting from opportunities like AI . Its narrow focus is the reason its portfolio only includes 30 stocks. The fund is also quite top heavy, with its three largest holdings sporting a combined weighting of 22.7%:\nStock\niShares ETF Portfolio Weighting\n1. Nvidia\n8.22%\n2. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\n7.62%\n3. Micron Technology\n6.88%\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Dec. 24, 2025, and are subject to change.\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the best chips on the market for developing AI models. Its current Blackwell Ultra lineup was designed to deliver sufficient computing power for the industry's latest reasoning models, like OpenAI's GPT 5.2, Anthropic's Claude 4.5, and Alphabet 's Gemini 3. I think Nvidia stock is still cheap despite its 41% gain in 2025, which leaves plenty of room for more upside from here.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD is chasing Nvidia in the market for data center chips. The company's latest MI350 Series GPUs have captured some of its key rival's top customers, but they still fall modestly short in terms of performance. Next year, AMD plans to launch its new MI400 GPUs as part of a fully integrated data center rack called Helios, which could deliver 10 times more performance than its MI350 GPUs. This company might be a real threat to Nvidia at that point.\n\nThen there is Micron Technology, which is one of the world's leading suppliers of memory and storage chips. Both Nvidia and AMD have integrated Micron's HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) solutions into their data center GPUs to unlock their maximum processing speeds. Micron is already sold out of its entire 2026 supply of data center memory, including its upcoming HBM4E solution, which is poised to deliver improvements in both capacity and energy efficiency.\nOutside of its top three positions, the iShares ETF holds several other top AI semiconductor stocks like Broadcom , Texas Instruments , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing .\nTurning $250,000 into $1 million over the next decade The iShares Semiconductor ETF is on track to end 2025 with an eye-popping 43% return. That isn't sustainable over the long run, but the ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 27.2% over the past decade, so it's no stranger to high growth. Even its more modest average annual gain of 11.8% since its inception in 2001 is still better than the performance of the S&P 500 over the same period.\nHere's how long it might take for the iShares ETF to turn an investment of $250,000 into $1 million, based on three different average annual returns:\nInitial Investment\nCompound Annual Return\nTime to Reach $1 Million\n$250,000\n11.8%\n13 Years\n$250,000\n19.5% (midpoint)\n8 Years\n$250,000\n27.2%\n6 Years\n\nCalculations by author.\nAccording to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, annual spending on AI data center infrastructure and chips could reach $4 trillion by 2030. If that happens, the iShares ETF is likely to deliver compound annual returns in excess of 20% for the foreseeable future. But to be perfectly clear, that wouldn't be sustainable under normal circumstances because of the law of large numbers.\n\nFor example, Nvidia is already a $4.6 trillion company. If its market cap grew by 27.2% annually for the next decade, it would be worth almost $50 trillion. The output of the entire U.S. economy was less than $30 trillion in 2024, so although AI is a revolutionary technology, it's important for investors to temper their expectations.\nFortunately, the iShares ETF can still turn $250,000 into $1 million over the next 10 years even if its annual returns moderate to slightly below 20%. Per the above table, if investors are a little more patient, the ETF could also help them join the million-dollar club in 13 years even if its returns suffer a significant reversion back to their long-term average of 11.8%.\nBut I think its returns are likely to remain elevated for now, considering practically every chipmaker is experiencing more demand than it can possibly supply.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF right now? Before you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Trust - iShares Semiconductor ETF wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Silver Is Obliterating the Stock Market in 2025 With a 168% Return. Here's a Simple Way to Buy It for 2026\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 1:45 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: SI=F\n\nGC=F\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Silver is a precious metal just like gold, except it's far more abundant.\nSilver is very useful in industrial settings, with electronics manufacturers soaking up almost half of all available supply each year.\nThe shiny metal has more than doubled in value during 2025 on rising political and economic uncertainty paired with a supply shortage.\n10 stocks we like better than iShares Silver Trust ›\n\nGold has increased in value by 72% in 2025, crushing major stock market indexes like the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and the Nasdaq-100 . It has even outperformed shares of artificial intelligence (AI) powerhouse Nvidia . Elevated inflation, soaring government debt, and heightened economic uncertainty are just a few factors pushing the yellow metal higher.\nGold's close sibling, silver, is doing even better, with a whopping 168% gain this year. It's benefiting from the same tailwinds, but a supply shortage is acting like rocket fuel for this rally. Could 2026 bring further gains? I'll explore that possibility below, and give investors a simple way to buy the precious metal with minimal fuss.\nWhy silver is soaring right now Gold has been a widely recognized store of value for thousands of years, mainly because it's extremely scarce, with just 216,265 tons pulled out of the ground throughout all of human history. Silver is also a precious metal but it's far more abundant, with miners extracting roughly eight times more of it each year compared to gold.\n\nBut on the flipside, silver is also far more useful in industrial settings thanks to its high electrical conductivity and its much lower cost per ounce. In fact, demand from electronics manufacturers alone soaks up almost half of all available supply each year. That's why a shortage of this precious metal can drive a sharp increase in price in a very short period of time, which is part of the reason for its fierce rally in 2025.\nChina, which is the world's second largest exporter of silver behind Hong Kong, recently announced new restrictions on shipping silver out of the country starting from Jan. 1, 2026. As the biggest manufacturer of electronics on the planet, China is trying to protect its domestic supply chain, but the restrictions also create leverage in global trade negotiations with other economic powerhouses like the U.S.\n\nBut silver was already trending higher this year before China announced the export curbs. It was benefiting from the same political and economic uncertainty fueling gold's powerful rally .\nFor example, the U.S. national debt recently hit a record high of $38.5 trillion, following a $1.8 trillion government budget deficit in fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30). Investors are worried the government can only escape this fiscal mess by aggressively increasing money supply to devalue the U.S. dollar, so they are flocking to precious metals as a hedge.\n\nStory Continues\nCan silver's incredible rally continue? The U.S. government is on track for another trillion-dollar deficit in fiscal 2026, so if China's export restrictions remain active, all of the ingredients will be in place for further upside in the price of silver next year.\nHowever, investors who expect silver to more than double in value again in 2026 might want to temper their expectations. The precious metal has delivered a compound annual return of just 5.9% over the last 50 years, which is probably a more realistic target. Anything above that baseline would be a bonus.\n\nPlus, while silver has generally trended higher over the long term, it's far more volatile than gold. It reached a high of $35 per ounce in 1980 before losing 90% of its peak value, and it then took a whole 31 years before it set a new record price of $48 in 2011. But a 70% decline also followed that bull run, so silver's latest journey to a new all-time high in 2025 was 14 years in the making.\nSimply put, investors who plan to add silver to their portfolios in 2026 need to maintain a very long-term time horizon if they want to maximize their odds of earning a positive return.\nA simple way to buy silver for 2026 Buying physical silver is the surest way to profit from the precious metal's potential upside over the long term, but it also comes with storage and insurance costs. Plus, it isn't easy to sell silver bars or coins in a hurry. Silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs), on the other hand, can be bought and sold instantly with the click of a mouse, and they don't take up any space.\n\nThe iShares Silver Trust (NYSEMKT: SLV) is the biggest ETF in the industry with $38 billion in assets under management, which is fully backed by 528 million ounces of physical reserves. Investors aren't entitled to take delivery of any actual metal, but owning this ETF gives them direct exposure to silver's potential upside all the same.\nThe ETF has an expense ratio of 0.5%, which is the proportion of the fund deducted each year to cover management costs. That means an investment of $10,000 would incur an annual fee of $50, but that's probably still cheaper than paying to store and insure physical metal.\nIn summary, buying the iShares Silver Trust is the simplest way for the average investor to add silver to their portfolio.\nShould you invest $1,000 in iShares Silver Trust right now? Before you buy stock in iShares Silver Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Silver Trust wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "China’s Rich Are Repricing Property Against Bitcoin — and Housing Is Losing\n\nLockridge Okoth\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 10:08 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nNVDA\n\nBNB-USD\n\nAffluent Chinese investors are increasingly questioning whether luxury real estate still deserves its long-held status as a safe store of value.\nViral discussions on Chinese social media now show ¥60–66 million ($414,000–$455,000) homes in Shenzhen Bay being weighed directly against Bitcoin, Nvidia stock, and BNB. Not as symbols of status, but as competing assets in a global portfolio.\n\nCrypto vs Concrete: Why China’s Wealthy Are Questioning the Value of Owning Homes The shift is striking, with Shenzhen Bay having long been considered one of mainland China’s most prestigious and resilient property markets. Yet recent posts suggest that even this enclave is no longer immune.\nOne widely shared account described touring a ¥66 million property while warning a friend that its value could fall to ¥30 million within three years. According to the post, prices in the area have already dropped by nearly 50%. Further downside is expected if a broader financial crisis hits.\nOther investors echoed the anxiety. One user admitted to taking on a ¥60 million mortgage in Shenzhen, saying they were unsure “whether to be happy or uneasy.”\nAnother joked about becoming a “house slave.” They noted that only paying in full spared them the full psychological burden of debt. Still others urged caution, pointing to high mortgage rates, rising housing supply, and the risks of concentrating capital in a single illiquid asset.\nBeyond price declines, the debate reflects deeper concerns about liquidity and political exposure. Investors argue that high-end properties have become increasingly difficult to exit quickly and are increasingly visible to regulators.\n\nBuying a home worth ¥100 million or more can invite tax scrutiny and investigations. This adds layers of risk during periods of policy tightening. In contrast, crypto and global equities are viewed as easier to hedge, trade, and move across borders.\nHong Kong’s Property Premium Is About Freedom, Not Returns This comparison also reframes why Hong Kong property continues to command a premium. According to one post, the appeal lies less in expected returns and more in “trading money for freedom.”\n\nStory Continues\nEuropean real estate, which can offer residency or passport pathways for far less capital, was cited as another example of property serving mobility rather than prestige. Mainland luxury housing, by contrast, was portrayed as offering neither strong returns nor optionality.\nSome investors likened the current housing market to China’s A-share equities. Domestic assets, they argued, tend to fall during geopolitical stress but fail to rally when global markets rise meaningfully.\n\nReal estate, particularly in Shenzhen Bay, appears to exhibit this asymmetry. It is vulnerable during downturns, yet stagnant during risk-on periods.\nThe implications extend beyond property. Crypto is no longer being framed primarily as a speculative bet, but as a strategic tool for capital preservation and flexibility.\nYounger investors, largely priced out of luxury housing, are opting out altogether. They favor digital assets and international equities, which offer clearer risk profiles and easier access.\nRepricing luxury real estate against Bitcoin and global equities signals a structural shift in Chinese wealth management. As capital mobility becomes paramount and political scrutiny intensifies, liquid global assets are increasingly displacing property as the preferred vehicle for preserving value.\nHow regulators respond, and whether property prices stabilize, may shape China’s domestic markets. It could also influence the next phase of global crypto adoption in the country.\nRead original story China’s Rich Are Repricing Property Against Bitcoin — and Housing Is Losing by Lockridge Okoth at beincrypto.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

On December 23, Reuters reported that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) aims to start shipping its second most powerful AI chips to China before mid-February 2026.\nThe update comes after several Chinese companies, including Alibaba, had shown interest in importing the company’s latest H200 chips to speed up their model training and development processes. To cater to this rising demand from Chinese companies, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) earlier on December 15 had announced ramping up its H200 production.\nAs per the latest update, the US chip maker plans to ship around 5,000 to 10,000 chip modules, which is equivalent to 40,000 to 80,000 H200 AI chips. According to people familiar with the matter, as per Reuters, Nvidia has told Chinese companies that the new production capacity for chips will open in the second half of 2026. However, it should be noted that the Chinese government has yet to approve the import of these chips; as a result, the timeline of the shipment can vary.\n\nThat said, Wall Street is bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Recently, on December 26, Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $265 price target. On the same day, C J Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $300 price target.\n​NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and sells specialized processors, initially for gaming but now also crucial for AI, data centers, professional visualization, and the automotive industry. It developed the graphics processing unit (GPU) and the CUDA parallel computing platform, which allows its GPUs to perform tasks beyond graphics.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Nvidia, in the Last Days of 2025, Just Made a Game-Changing Move\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia, with earnings reaching record levels, is one of the first winners of the AI boom.\nThe tech giant says AI inferencing will be a major growth driver in the years to come, so it’s placed a big bet on that area.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has dominated the early stages of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and this is thanks to the company's top-performing chips. These graphics processing units (GPUs) power the training of models, so that they have what it takes to then go on and do the job of solving complex problems.\n\nThough rivals exist, Nvidia has remained in the lead -- the company has kept its promise of innovating on an annual basis to ensure this position. Still, this isn't the only way Nvidia plans on staying ahead, and right now, in the last days of 2025, the tech giant made a game-changing move -- one that could help secure its leadership in the next phase of AI growth. Let's find out more.\nFrom gaming to AI First, though, let's take a quick look at Nvidia's path so far. The AI giant actually started out about 30 years ago with a focus on serving the video game industry. Nvidia still does this, but a decade ago, the company recognized the AI opportunity and put its focus there. As a result, Nvidia developed the world's most sought-after AI chips as well as a full menu of related products -- from enterprise software to networking tools.\n\nBut the star of the show continues to be the GPU , and the biggest tech names, from Microsoft to Amazon , flock to Nvidia for each new release. This momentum has fueled explosive earnings growth for the chip designer, with revenue and net income climbing in the double and triple digits to record levels. In the most recent fiscal year, Nvidia's revenue reached more than $130 billion.\nNow, let's move along to Nvidia's game-changing move. It's key because it not only addresses the risk of competition, but it also strengthens Nvidia's position in what may next drive AI growth: AI inferencing. We'll start with competition. Nvidia faces it from market heavyweights like Advanced Micro Devices and even some of its own customers that are developing their own AI chips, such as Amazon. But Nvidia's biggest threat may not come from these giants. Instead, it may come from small start-ups specializing in technology that could either compete with or replace Nvidia chips -- particularly if these start-ups specialize in the area of AI inferencing.\n\nThe importance of inferencing Before I go any further, I'll explain the importance of inferencing. It's the powering of the \"thinking\" AI models go through to do their job. So even after they're trained, they will need GPUs (or another similar tool) to fuel that process. The AI inferencing market, worth about $103 billion today, may reach $255 billion by 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights.\n\nStory continues\nNvidia has said repeatedly that inferencing is the next major area of growth in this AI boom and has specifically designed its latest architecture, Blackwell, for inferencing strength.\nBut Nvidia isn't stopping there, and instead made this exciting move: The company is acquiring inferencing technology from start-up Groq for $20 billion in cash, according to CNBC. This represents Nvidia's largest deal ever. CNBC reported that in an email to employees, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang said: \"We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the Nvidia AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads.\"\n\nNvidia's financial strength Nvidia, with $60 billion in cash as of the end of the latest quarter, has the financial strength for this deal and potentially others. And, importantly, it shows that Nvidia is ready to invest in the developments of smaller rivals to reinforce its own platform -- this, along with the company's own commitment to innovation, is a surefire way to stay ahead of the crowd.\n\nThe Groq deal is particularly attractive because it involves inferencing, an area that could supercharge Nvidia's growth in the years to come. And the addition of Groq executives to the Nvidia team should facilitate the integration of this new technology with Nvidia's. Groq's chief executive officer, the company president, and other executives will join Nvidia as part of the deal to \"help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" according to a Groq blog post.\nAll of this is great news for Nvidia investors as we head toward a new year -- and a new phase of AI growth driven by inferencing.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Silver and gold swung after a sharp pullback from fresh all-time highs, as traders booked profits and liquidity thinned after the holidays.\nCrypto traders kept describing the same theme, a market that keeps moving, then does it with less depth.\nMarket snapshot Bitcoin : $87,164, down 1.9%\nEther : $2,929, down 2.3%\nXRP: $1.85, down 2.2%\nTotal crypto market cap: $3.03 trillion, down 2.1%\nBitcoin And Ether Drift Sideways As Year-End Volumes Fade Jake Kennis, senior research analyst at Nansen, said year-end trading has slowed and volumes have faded across major assets. “Bitcoin and Ethereum have both traded largely sideways over the past week, reflecting seasonal inactivity rather than a meaningful shift in market structure,” he said.\n“Activity has cooled across most chains, with a broad consolidation in active addresses, transactions, and fees generated over the past 30 days. Chains like Base saw notable pullbacks in DEX volumes following a very strong run earlier in the year. Solana remains the dominant venue for onchain trading by volume, even as user activity softened slightly over the week, with BNB Chain a distant second.”\n\n“Overall, trading activity hasn’t disappeared; it has simply slowed and become more selective as the year comes to a close.”\nProfit-Taking Hits Metals After New Highs Macro investors, meanwhile, stayed focused on the policy path. Investors looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes due later Tuesday, a release that often resets rate expectations when positioning runs crowded.\nThe bigger picture still shows a strong year for risk assets, despite the late-year wobbles. The MSCI All Country World Index has climbed about 21% in 2025, and a broad measure of Asian stocks has rallied almost 26%, according to market-wrap data.\n\nIn metals, the latest move showed how quickly crowded trades can unwind. Spot silver fell 4.8% on Monday after earlier hitting a record, and gold eased after setting its own peak on Friday, with profit-taking doing the heavy lifting.\nFor crypto, Bitcoin’s steadiness looked more like a positioning pause than a conviction push, with traders watching liquidity, flows and volatility pricing for the next move into the first week of 2026.\nRead original story Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Holds $87k As Asia Rally Stalls, Wall Street Tech Slips by Shalini Nagarajan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "1 Incredible Reason to Buy Nvidia Stock Before Feb. 25\n\nLyle Daly, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia will release its next earnings report on Feb. 25, 2026.\nThe chipmaker's revenue has increased for 11 consecutive quarters, and it has an order backlog of $500 billion through the end of 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and the increased demand for GPUs has driven massive growth in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock. The chipmaker is currently up an astounding 23,020% over the last 10 years (as of Dec. 26).\nIf you've been thinking about starting or adding to a position in Nvidia, there's one great reason to do so before Feb. 25, 2026.\nNvidia's next earnings report is coming up Feb. 25 is when Nvidia will announce the financial results for the fourth quarter and its full 2026 fiscal year. The company's 2026 fiscal year ends on Jan. 31.\nNvidia's earnings reports have become more like victory laps. It has delivered 11 consecutive quarters of revenue growth, often in double- or triple-digit percentages. Most recently, its third-quarter revenue reached a record $57 billion, a 62% year-over-year increase. Fourth-quarter revenue expectations are $65 billion, which would mean sales of $213 billion on the year.\n\nTaking a long-term perspective, Nvidia is also set up for future earnings growth. It has a $500 billion order backlog through the end of 2026, and earlier this month, the Trump administration authorized Nvidia to begin selling its H200 chips in China.\nNvidia is on the expensive side, trading at 47 times trailing earnings and 41 times forward earnings expectations. However, its sales have consistently grown, and the company's GPUs remain in high demand with other AI companies. Considering its next earnings report will most likely bring positive news, if you're going to invest in Nvidia, you might not want to wait too long.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Uh we're wrapping up 2025. You're looking at the Mag 7, Corey. And the divergences here are, they're interesting, Corey, they're noteworthy. and over the past year, Google, it's a rocket ship, we know this. Nvidia, strong. Amazon, not so much. And I'm curious what you make of that, Corey. What what you think investors are looking for? Is is it monetization, Corey, or investors looking for, okay, who controls the whole stack? Explain it for us. What do you think's going on?\n00:46 Corey\nI think the construct of the Mag 7 is a market phenomenon, not a business phenomenon. Which is to say you have very different businesses uh under the the the auspices of the Mag 7 that were gathered together because of kind of the size of the businesses in general, the size of the market caps of the companies, I should say. And and the direction of their stocks. And as those start to fall apart as they naturally those those correlations naturally will because they are in different businesses, the whole notion of a Mag 7 is going to look sillier and sillier over time.\n01:21 Speaker A\nLet me ask you about a name. I'm excited to get your take here. Nvidia. This deal with Grock, Corey. I've not I I I want to get the Cory take here to remind viewers. So licenses the AI technology for reportedly here 20 billion in cash. Key execs join Nvidia. What do you make of that deal, Corey? Was it a smart deal by Jensen Wong? And why did Jensen Wong decide, you know what, I'm going to structure this as licensing, not an acquisition?\n01:54 Corey\nRight, those are two important different questions. So let's talk about what they're doing first and why it's different and we can talk about this for days, except that we can't. But but let's let's see what we can do here. So uh the way that Grock chips are so different than Nvidia chips is the way they profit uh the way they process information. Specifically, uh there's a it's a phrase that's really hot in Silicon Valley right now, deterministic programming. So deterministic or processing, I should say. Deterministic sort of takes a big chunk of data and analyzes it all at once. So, if you were to ask the example that Grock likes to use, if you were to ask a large language model using, you know, if you were to ask chat GPT using Nvidia chips, what uh sentence uses all 26 words in the alphabet, and the answer might be the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Well, as you type that question in letter by letter, Nvidia's uh chips and and the chat GPT model is trying to figure it out letter by letter. W H A T S E N every what sentence? It's it's trying to determine what the next thing you're going to is and it can be kind of slow. Whereas a deterministic model, using a a Grock chip looks at the whole question, figures out the answer and dishes it out to you quickly. It's a different kind of processing that uses less high bandwidth memory, uses less processing power. The chip must be more powerful to do so, but program to do that. It's a very different approach. and as the as the the artificial intelligence world goes from building the models, training, to using the models, inference, the Grock chip is a different approach that might work better. Nvidia had reasons to be concerned that they were going to lose share on the marketplace over time because of this deterministic approach being more simple and more elegant and and cheaper to use over time. They're smart to get in there to try to uh make sure nobody else can take their lunch.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

And for more on Intel's deals, let's welcome in Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Laura.\n00:09 Laura Bratton\nHow's it going?\n00:10 Speaker A\nVery good. Walk us through it.\n00:12 Laura Bratton\nYeah, so, um, Intel said in a regulatory filing today that over um last week, it had completed the sale of 5 billion worth of shares to Nvidia. Um it was a deal that was initially announced in September and really boosted confidence in Intel. Um, the two companies are co-developing CPUs for data center servers, um and also chips for personal computers. So, um really big deal for Intel to have kind of Nvidia behind it. Um, but notably it doesn't include Intel manufacturing and that's really what investors have been waiting to see um whether Intel's manufacturing business can turn around.\n00:46 Speaker A\nNow Nvidia, that wasn't the only deal Intel struck, right, this year? What else has changed for that chipmaker?\n00:54 Laura Bratton\nYeah, a lot has changed. They have a new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, um that really bolstered kind of investor confidence in Intel because of his wide-ranging industry connections. Um Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO had undergone like a really aggressive turnaround effort and it just cost a lot of money and the manufacturing business, which opened up to outside um customers has been losing a lot of money. Um, other things that happened, the US government really big, they invested in Intel, so did Softbank. Um, and the US government investment was was a really big deal because the thought is that, you know, now Intel might have sway over trade policy. The US government could potentially pressure some of the bigger companies to use Intel's manufacturing business.\n01:40 Speaker A\nSo, and by the way, this stock, I mean, as we we should mention, it's up about 80% this year. Uh it has been just a rocket ship. Uh most analysts, by the way, on on uh maybe not surprising after a move like that. I mean, look at that stock chart. Most analysts at this point are on the sidelines. But what's ahead for Intel? Like if I'm an investor in this name, Laura, what should I be looking for in 2026? What's on the radar?\n02:05 Laura Bratton\nYeah, so, um Intel's latest manufacturing process 18A was a really big milestone for the company. Um but they didn't really get the big external customers that investors are really looking for Intel to get in order to be like, hey, this business has really, you know, turned around. Um, so that instead is being kind of used for Intel's own chips, but now they need outside customers for their upcoming manufacturing processes, 18AP and 14A.\n02:37 Speaker A\nMhm.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) also fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) dipped around 0.3%.\n\nMeanwhile, volatility gripped the precious metals trade after a furious rally to all-time highs . Silver ( SI=F ) retreated, plummeting as much as 7% after rising above $80, while gold ( GC=F ) futures fell over 3%.\nStocks fell after ending a shortened Christmas trading week near all-time highs, with the S&P 500 and Dow setting records on Wednesday to start the \"Santa Claus rally\" period — the last five trading days of December and first two sessions in January.\n\nAll three major indexes look set to end a topsy-turvy 2025 with strong gains. The benchmark S&P is up over 17%, and the blue-chip Dow has climbed over 14%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has led gains, adding over 21% so far — even after briefly entering a bear market in April after the rollout of President Trump's most sweeping tariffs .\nIn another otherwise relatively sleepy week for economic releases, one bright spot came on Monday as data showed pending home sales in November jumped the most since early 2023 — a sign that homebuyer momentum is building. But the highlight of the week will likely come Tuesday with the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's meeting earlier this month .\nThe minutes could add fresh insight for investors looking for clues on the Fed's next move in January, with the divisions that have gripped the central bank in 2025 likely to continue into the new year .

A number of stocks fell in the afternoon session after the technology sector retreated in the intraday session as investors began to lock in profits following a historic rally that recently pushed the market to all-time highs.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq were under pressure as the dominant artificial intelligence trade cooled off. Notable names like Nvidia were down as traders locked in profits following a banner year where the Nasdaq surged over 20%. With the S&P 500 recently hitting intraday highs near 6,945, this dip reflected a shift in internal momentum rather than a response to major economic news.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\nData Storage company MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) fell 2.9%.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 10 days ago when the stock gained 3.7% on the news that investor optimism around artificial intelligence fueled broad market gains. Technology stocks with a focus on artificial intelligence once again led the market higher, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Companies at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, saw significant jumps in their share prices. The rally reflected a renewed belief among investors in the transformative potential of AI technology to drive future growth and productivity. The rally was further supported by a surprise cooling in the November consumer price index (CPI) report, which triggered market pricing for additional rate cuts in the coming year. This created a more favorable environment for growth-oriented software companies as borrowing costs decrease.\n\nAppLovin is up 104% since the beginning of the year, and at $697.54 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $733.60 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AppLovin’s shares at the IPO in April 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $10,698.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 2.8% on the news that a Delaware Supreme Court ruling restored CEO Elon Musk's 2018 compensation plan, ending a long-running legal battle.\n\nThe court reversed a lower court's decision to cancel the $56 billion pay package. This news removed a significant legal uncertainty that had loomed over the company. Adding to the positive sentiment, the company reportedly began testing fully driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, without safety drivers, marking a major step toward commercial autonomous driving. Investor focus also turned to Tesla's 2026 product plans, which included a sub-$25,000 model and the first commercial use of its Cybercab. Further bolstering confidence, Deutsche Bank and RBC both raised their price targets on the stock.\nTesla is up 22.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $463.89 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $489.88 from December 2025.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 11 days ago when the stock gained 2.6% on the news that the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation cooling more than anticipated, fueling optimism for potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\nThe November report indicated that annual inflation fell to 2.7%, significantly below economists' expectations of 3.1% and its lowest level since July. The Consumer Price Index, or CPI, is a key measure of inflation. This encouraging data was welcomed by investors, as sustained lower inflation could give the U.S. Federal Reserve more justification to lower interest rates in the coming year. Wall Street favors lower interest rates because they reduce borrowing costs for companies and can stimulate economic activity, making stocks more attractive. The positive news helped major indexes, including the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq, snap a four-day losing streak.\nSkillz is down 15.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $4.51 per share, it is trading 50.4% below its 52-week high of $9.09 from August 2025.

The cut was attributed to several supply-side issues, including government crackdowns on driver qualifications and electronic logging devices. Reinforcing the negative sentiment, S&P Global Ratings also revised RXO's outlook to negative from stable, pointing to weaker-than-expected credit metrics within a soft freight market. This followed the company's disappointing third-quarter 2025 earnings.\nRXO is down 47.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $12.37 per share, it is trading 53.9% below its 52-week high of $26.81 from January 2025.

In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 5 months ago when the stock gained 4.5% on the news that a new trade agreement between the United States and Japan spurred a broad market rally.\n\nThe positive sentiment swept across markets after it was announced the U.S. and Japan had reached a new trade deal. The agreement included a 15% tariff on Japanese goods imported into the U.S. and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to American cars and agricultural products.

      "Content": "Why anchoring 2026 portfolios in Big Tech and cybersecurity is the way to go\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWD\n\nGOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nANET\n\nThe next phase of the AI trade is more about growth and survival than simply chasing the most coveted names.\n\"I definitely wouldn't just bet on Nvidia,\" Adam Coons, chief investment officer at Winthrop Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. \"We kind of like to barbell this with something like the big hyperscaler, like an Alphabet Google, because that's really the type of name that you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because the AI story is just benefitting an already existing business model that was doing well.\"\nThe \"barbell\" strategy is born out of a growing skepticism toward \"one-trick ponies.\" In this case, Coons says it applies to companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), and Palantir ( PLTR ), which rely almost exclusively on the current AI hardware rush.\n\nWhile these names have led the market higher, their valuations have reached a point where \"margin of safety\" is effectively zero. In Coons's view, when a stock is priced to perfection, even a minor earnings miss can trigger a catastrophe.\n\"You need to position size,\" he said.\nBy anchoring a portfolio in \"behemoth hyperscalers\" like Alphabet ( GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ), investors get exposure to AI through companies with diversified cash flows. Such companies aren't just AI plays, but are advertising and software giants that use AI to optimize businesses that were already succeeding.\n\nIf the \"safe\" end of the barbell is Big Tech, the other side is \"growth,\" and it can be found in the infrastructure required to keep those systems running and secure.\n\"Down the chain, we like the things that overall the AI story will help prop up,\" Coons said. \"For us, it's cybersecurity [as it] becomes more and more important.\"\nHe added that Fortinet ( FTNT ) and CrowdStrike ( CRWD ) are among \"two of our top picks on the security side.\"\nAs AI advances, so does the risk for hacking, Coons noted. Cybersecurity isn't a discretionary expense, but a tax on the digital age that must be paid. Unlike the volatile demand for graphics processing units, the need for protection is more predictable.\nThe sector isn't without its risks, however. CrowdStrike faced a global IT outage in July 2024, caused by a faulty software update. It prompted the \"blue screens of death\" across 8.5 million machines, including airlines, hospitals, and banks.\n\nCoons says the final piece of the 2026 investor blueprint is disciplined position sizing. He suggests building a \"basket\" of smaller, high-conviction names — like Reddit ( RDDT ), which he views as a unique data play for AI training — but with the caveat of keeping those positions small.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to Coons, the average investor should steer clear of trying to find the next Nvidia. The low-hanging fruit has been picked, and winning 2026 is more about leaning into the giants that own the platforms and the specialists who protect the data.\nAdditionally, Chris Versace, chief investment officer at Tematica Research, sees Marvell Technology ( MRVL ) and Arista Networks ( ANET ) as the next logical steps in the AI revolution.\n\nVersace argues that the massive spending on data centers is creating a \"network congestion\" problem. As AI usage explodes, the connection between chips becomes the new bottleneck.\n\"It's the network connection that will be the big bottleneck that I think folks are missing,\" Versace notes, pointing to Marvel because of its dominance in optical and networking hardware.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "AI chipmakers that could steal some of Nvidia's spotlight in 2026\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Jared Blikre\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:30 AM PST\n\nIn this video: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nARM\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) announced a deal to acquire AI hardware and software designer Groq ( GROQ.PVT ) for $20 billion last week. While the semiconductor manufacturer remained a major AI player in 2025, who could be some of Nvida's biggest competition in the fast-approaching 2026?\nTECHnalysis Research, LLC President Bob O'Donnell sits down with Yahoo Finance markets and data editor Jared Blikre on Market Catalysts to discuss which chipmaker could gain more prominence next year.\nAlso catch Bob O'Donnell's predictions for agentic AI in 2026 as it relates to cybersecurity usage.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Jared\nAnd another thing people have been uh some of the critics have been pouuncing on is all the spending, the capital expenditures, so-called CAPEX. Uh we saw that it's been exploding over the last few years. It's set to continue next year. But uh we've seen in the Mag 5, for instance, we used to kind of talk about them or the Mag 7 uh as a whole. It's really only Alphabet and Nvidia, maybe Tesla as a come behind story that have really surged this year. So is it a game of have and have nots or how do you see this playing out?\n00:32 Bob\nNo, it's a great question. I mean, look, I think Nvidia obviously continues to do well, but I also am certain that Nvidia is going to heck get a heck of a lot more competition in 2026. AMD is, you know, an obvious one, but there's a lot of other little players. I mean, you know, Nvidia's uh deal with Grock recently to bring more of their technology in is a reflection of the fact that we're seeing more specialized types of models being developed. We're we're going from the days of big general purpose LLMs that you can use for everything to much more specialized areas. And each of those are going to require different types of hardware and I think in turn that's going to create additional opportunities, but it's going to create more diversity, which is going to be a little harder to figure out. But obviously I think, you know, you're going to continue to see folks like Nvidia and AMD do well. I do, as I said, I think you're going to start to see uh some of the smaller the cloud guys who are doing custom chips often through Broadcom will also start to benefit. We've seen already, you know, Google's been doing more with TPUs, uh Amazon has their Graviton chips. Um, we've got a a bunch of other companies. Microsoft is doing custom chips. A lot of these are arm-based. So arm is another company, you know, we haven't been talking about them a lot lately, but arm's helping drive some of this innovation. Intel, as you've talked about, you know, is doing well. They continue to plug away. Obviously, they had their challenges last year, but things are looking better in 2026. So, I think we're going to see a lot of different players uh from different areas uh all start to come together. And we'll see some smaller companies. Uh there's a little company called SiTime that does uh timing chips and all these networks have to be completely aligned from a timing perspective. They're doing some interesting stuff. So, I think there's a lot of different opportunities in different areas. Um but we're going to have a lot of the bears on the side just again, waiting to pounce on these oper these concerns that get raised, I think around a gentic AI.\n02:29 Jared\nAnd we'll have to see if those are dips worth buying or not. And Bob, what I'm realizing is we got to do another podcast real soon. So thank you for showing up.\n02:39 Bob\nYeah, man, I'd love to.\n02:40 Jared\nIt was great seeing you here.\n02:41 Bob\nThanks, Jared.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The company has a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion as I write this, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a 21% return over the next year if it does cross the $3 trillion milestone.\nRead on, and let's consider Amazon's growth prospects in the year ahead.\nAll eyes on Amazon Web Services Amazon's potential pathway to the $3 trillion club next year starts with its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It used to be a place where businesses would simply store data and host their critical digital applications, but it has evolved to become the center of Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAWS operates state-of-the-art data centers and it rents the computing capacity to AI developers who don't have the financial resources to build their own infrastructure. These data centers are filled with advanced AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia , but Amazon also designed its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium. Top developers like Anthropic are using hundreds of thousands of the latest Trainium2 chips, which offer up to 40% better price performance than competing hardware when training AI models.\nThen there is the AWS Bedrock platform, where businesses can access hundreds of completed AI models from third-parties including Anthropic and Meta Platforms . Developing models from scratch is time consuming and expensive, so using a ready-made solution can help businesses achieve their AI goals much faster.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), which was up 20% year over year. That was the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, which highlights the platform's incredible AI-driven momentum. But it gets better, because AWS has a whopping $200 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online, so the strong top-line results are likely to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's earnings continue to crush Wall Street's estimates The $33 billion in third-quarter revenue that AWS brought in accounted for just 18% of Amazon's total revenue of $180 billion. However, the cloud business is the company's most profitable by far, contributing 65% of its total operating income. E-commerce is actually Amazon's largest source of revenue, but its profit margins are very thin because its Amazon.com site focuses on selling a high volume of products at low prices.\n\nHowever, Amazon is pushing to improve profitability in its e-commerce business by boosting efficiency and implementing new technologies. In 2023, it broke its U.S. logistics network into eight distinct regions, so now the products in each fulfillment center are specific to their geographic region. As a result, orders travel shorter distances to reach customers, which brings down packing and shipping costs.\nAmazon also uses AI-powered software like Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers, which uses computer vision to identify defective products before they ship. This reduces returns and refunds, creating further cost savings.\nThe accelerating growth at AWS combined with improved efficiency in the e-commerce business is driving a huge increase in Amazon's overall profit. The company generated earnings of $5.22 per share during the first three quarters of 2025, which was a whopping 42% jump from the same period in 2024. Plus, Amazon's earnings have beaten Wall Street's consensus estimates in every single quarter of 2025, by an average of 22%.\n\nHow Amazon can cross the $3 trillion milestone in 2026 Amazon stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.8 as I write this. That's roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so Amazon stock is basically sitting at fair value relative to its peers in the tech sector.\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate earnings of $7.86 per share in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6.\nAssuming Wall Street is right, Amazon stock would have to climb by 11% next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 32.8, lifting its market cap to $2.75 trillion. But remember, the company has a habit of beating Wall Street's expectations.\nIf its 2026 earnings beat the consensus estimate by 22% like they have so far in 2025, then its stock could be poised for a 35% gain next year instead. That would catapult its market value to a whopping $3.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, even an earnings beat of just 9% next year would be enough to see Amazon join the $3 trillion club. Given the incredible momentum across its e-commerce business and AWS, I think that's an achievable target.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "AMD stock faces its next big test in 2026\n\nMoz Farooque\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 9:03 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nFor the better part of the last decade, Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) lived in Nvidia ’s shadow. In 2025, that changed.\nAMD stock took off handsomely ( up 78% year-to-date ), as Mr. Market stopped calling it “the alternative.”\nThe tech giant landed major AI deals in proving its mettle as more than just a CPU turnaround story.\n\nDespite Nvidia’s dominance in the AI chip space, the narrative has shifted to how much market share AMD can realistically capture.\nThat matters a great deal because breakthrough years, such as 2025, raise expectations much more quickly than earnings can keep pace.\nNevertheless, AMD enters 2026 with solid momentum, real long-term customers, and a fast-growing AI revenue base, but also with a stock price that reflects plenty of that optimism.\nHence, 2026 might not just be a victory lap but a proving ground.\nAMD proved it can compete in AI 2025 was clearly the year when AMD began to land real wins in the AI space.\nThe turning point came in October, when AMD announced marquee AI partnerships with the likes of OpenAI and Oracle, sending its stock up 34% in a single day , according to Reuters .\nRelated: CoreWeave CEO delivers blunt 5-word take on AI debate\n\nOpenAI selected AMD as its go-to GPU supplier , looking to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct accelerators for its next-generation AI infrastructure plans.\nOracle followed suit by showing off its first public AI supercluster built around AMD’s new Helios rack design , covering 50,000 MI450 GPUs slated for release in Q3 2026.\nHere are some of AMD's biggest deals in 2025: OpenAI : Multiyear deal to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs; the first 1 gigawatt of MI450 is expected for deployment in the second half of 2026.\nOracle : Expanded partnership; Oracle plans a publicly available AI supercluster with 50,000 MI450 GPUs starting Q3 2026.\nDOE/ORNL : $1 billion partnership with ORNL, HPE , and Oracle Cloud to build Lux and Discovery supercomputers.\nSanmina : Agreement up to $3 billion to buy ZT Systems manufacturing .\nCisco + G42 : UAE secure AI cluster built and secured by Cisco for G42, featuring Instinct MI350X GPUs.\n\nMoreover, CEO Lisa Su outlined a solid path to double-digit AI share , spearheaded by MI300 chips, which are forecasted to generate over $2 billion in sales and memory advantages favoring large AI models.\nThe financial proof behind AMD’s AI push The bull case for AMD is now clearly showing up in the numbers.\nEarnings snapshot over the past four quarters:\nFQ3 2025 (Sept. 2025): EPS 1.20 , beat by 0.03 ; revenue 9.25 billion , up 35.59% year over year , beat by 487.48 million.\nFQ2 2025 (June 2025): EPS 0.48 , in line; revenue 7.69 billion , up 31.71% year over year , beat by 255.65 million.\nFQ1 2025 (March 2025): EPS 0.96 , beat by 0.03 ; revenue 7.44 billion , up 35.90% year over year , beat by 318.31 million.\nFQ4 2024 (Dec. 2024): EPS 1.09 , in line; revenue 7.66 billion , up 24.16% year over year , beat by 132.12 million.\n\nStory Continues\nAMD’s stellar results were capped off by a standout Q3 2025 .\nRevenue hit a record $9.25 billion , up 36% year over year , Investing.com reported , as GAAP net income surged 61% to $1.24 billion .\nAt the same time, margins moved higher, as AMD’s gross margins skyrocketed 52% , up from 50% a year earlier, while its operating income climbed another 75% year over year .\n\nOn top of that, AMD generated record free cash flow , underscoring how growth is translating into cash.\nGrowth was broad-based:\nData Center: Revenue reached $4.3 billion , up 22% year over year , led by stellar demand for EPYC server CPUs and Instinct MI250 and MI300 accelerators (despite the $1.5 billion revenue headwind linked to China).\nClient and Gaming: Combined sales skyrocketed to $4 billion , up 73% year over year . PC sales reached a record $2.8 billion (up 46%), while gaming revenue was up a whopping 181% to $1.3 billion.\nEmbedded: Revenue dropped 8% year over year to $857 million , a modest drag linked to tougher comparisons following the Xilinx acquisition.\nFor perspective, AI-related products accounted for roughly 21% of AMD’s total sales, pushing expected full-year 2025 sales around $33 billion mark .\n\nGuidance shows momentum isn’t slowing In addition to that, AMD guided Q4 2025 sales to be at $9.6 billion (±$300 million), with the midpoint implying a sizeable 25% increase year over year.\nAdditionally, AMD’s management guided for non-GAAP gross margin to be at around 54.5% and operational expenses near $2.8 billion.\nOn the call, CEO Lisa Su said demand looks remarkably durable heading into next year.\n\nWhere AMD stock could trade in 2026 Wall Street is optimistic about AMD heading into 2026.\nThe bulls see substantial upside if execution holds up. On the other hand, skeptics view a stock that’s already pricing in a lot of good news.\nHere’s how the big firms are lining up:\nGoldman Sachs — $210 (Neutral): Goldman is still cautious, warning that AMD’s outlook is linked to flawless execution of its big AI deals and margin expansion, leaving virtually little room for error.\nBank of America — $300 (Buy): BofA expects AMD to effectively capture a double-digit share of a trillion-dollar AI market by 2030.\nHSBC — $310 (Buy): HSBC points to AMD’s incredible OpenAI win and expects a significant ramp-up in earnings growth as those deals scale.\nWells Fargo — $345 (Overweight): Perhaps the Street’s most bullish calls, spearheaded by healthy data-center momentum and AI product traction.\nMelius Research — $380 (Buy): The most aggressive target, which assumes AMD securing 10%+ AI chip share while sustaining its top- and bottom-line growth numbers.\nAcross roughly 51 analysts in the past three months, AMD stock’s consensus 12-month target sits near $282.82 (32% upside from current levels), underscoring superb confidence.\n\nAMD’s 2026 test: big AI upside, bigger expectations Heading into 2026, AMD’s not exactly easing into the hotly competitive AI race.\nAt its late-2025 Analyst Day , the management laid out some remarkably aggressive goals:\nRevenue growth: Targets 35%+ compound annual revenue growth over the next several years.\nData center engine: Expects 60%+ annual growth in data-center sales as the key driver.\nAI kicker: Projects 80%+ annual growth in AI revenue , implying a growing mix shift toward AI.\n\nMoreover, AMD will be rolling out its MI450 AI accelerators and Helios rack-scale systems in the back half of 2026, with early deployments linked to OpenAI and Oracle .\nWhether it can result in repeatable share gains remains a significant question mark.\nThat’s exactly why Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon framed it as follows, according to Reuters .\nThe risks are real.\nNvidia still commands 80-90% of AI accelerators ; this, along with a misstep in AMD’s ROCm ecosystem, may slow adoption.\nExecution matters too, with delays in MI450 production, customer concentration around OpenAI, or tighter export controls impacting results. Throw in a rich valuation at over 54 times 2026 earnings , and the upcoming year becomes a not-so-simple test.\nRelated: Cathie Wood drops $1.3 million on healthcare stock\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 29, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Why the electrical grid needs more software\n\nTim De Chant\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 9:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nOne of the nicest comments people have made about the electrical grid was … nothing. The grid works best when it fades into the background.\nThat low-profile status has changed in recent years as fires in California and freezes in Texas raised awareness of the electrical grid. But it was in 2025, when the electrical grid — and concerns about demand, supply, pricing, and the strain on natural resources — moved into the spotlight. And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch.\n\nElectricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including repurposing supersonic jet engines for data center duty and working on beaming solar power down from space .\nAnd that pace of growth isn’t expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is projected to nearly triple in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled consumer frustration around pricing and drawn the ire of environmental groups that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load — the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.\n\nThis confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.\nFor example, startups like Gridcare and Yottar argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.\nGridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amidst the data center boom.\nSeveral other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it’s needed most.\n\nBase Power, for example, is building one in Texas by leasing batteries to homeowners at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn’t sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.\n\nStory Continues\nOther startups including Texture, Uplight, and Camus are developing software layers to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.\nThere’s also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid.\n\nNvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to develop industry-specific models in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is working with the grid operator PJM to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.\nThese changes won’t happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold.\nUtilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they’re also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it’s costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability.\nSoftware, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction.\nAnd that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power. It would be foolish to ignore the power of software in these instances. It’s cheap, flexible, and speedy to deploy.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Nvidia didn't even put out an SEC filing on this one. I go figure. It also hasn't said anything publicly about this deal. The only one who has had something to say is the likely much wealthier Grock founder Jonathan Ross. Ross pointed out his LinkedIn over the weekend. Clearly he's jazzed about this. He will be joining Nvidia as chief software architect. Big role for Jonathan there, for sure.\n00:46 Speaker A\nWhile this deal gets digested by Nvidia investors are also wondering how any slip ups by the company in 2026 will be received and what is the outlook more broadly for large cap tech stocks after another strong year in 2025. Chris Versachi is Tomoco Research's chief investment officer. Chris, uh got to get your thoughts on Nvidia. I I find it funny. You and I are I think fundamental analysis uh at heart. and I am just I'm surprised there was no filing on this deal. You spent $20 billion and you don't even get a filing.\n01:26 Speaker B\nBiggest acquisition they've ever done, Brian, no filing and they sneak it through on Christmas Eve. Uh, you know, I I agree with you. It's a bit of a head scratcher especially when you take a look at the multiple that they're that they're, you know, seem to be paying. but we've seen other big multiples of late. Service now picking up Armus, you know, 7.75 billion on 340 billion in revenue.\n01:59 Speaker B\nAnd you know, I I think this is a a larger trend that we've seen really over the last year, Brian, where these large cap companies are flexing their balance sheets, filling in technical gaps or holes, um kind of as a competitive move so they can compete on a greater scale in 2026.\n02:16 Speaker A\nChris, I remember being in the streets offices when I worked there and you may have been there too as well. I think 2017 and and the street founder Jim Cramer always would come in very bullish on the video. It's one of the first people that I know championing a bull case on Nvidia and his case was Nvidia essentially dominates the chip market. At the time they were doing gaming, but now they're also of course the main leader in AI. Do you think this acquisition signals that they are concerned that Grock was working on something\n02:50 Speaker A\nthat they didn't have in their pipeline.\n02:54 Speaker B\nSo, I I think it's more of an effort of them to shore up their their inference, uh strength, Brian. You know, again, taking a very strong competitive position, extending it further as we move deeper into AI, moving past, you know, simple training in into figuring out what is next, making their models that much sharper. And I think we're going to see more of this. You you know as well as I that there there's never, you know, one company making a sole move.\n03:32 Speaker B\nThere's always the what what we like to call the competitive response. So, what is AMD going to do? What is, you know, Avago or sorry, Broadcom going to do? What is Marvel going to do and others. And I I think, you know, if you step back too on this, it's another signal that we're likely to see the M&A strength we saw in, you know, the current quarter continue into the new year. and if you're a shareholder of, you know, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, you're going to feel pretty good about that.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia finalizes its roughly 4%, $5 billion stake in Intel\n\nShannon Carroll\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nIntel just cashed Nvidia’s $5 billion check . Intel says it completed the share sale to Nvidia on Dec. 26 after regulatory clearance earlier this month, turning a September announcement into settled cash and issued shares — and making Nvidia’s roughly 4% stake in Intel official.\nNvidia bought 214,776,632 shares at $23.28 apiece in a private placement, a round-number infusion that landed on Intel’s balance sheet like a vote of confidence and on its reputation like a defibrillator. For months, the deal lived in that corporate purgatory where everyone speaks in the future tense and the market politely pretends it can’t hear the lawyers. Now, the cash is in — and the shares exist.\n\nNvidia was off about 1.7% in early morning trading, and Intel was relatively flat (up just over 1%). That’s what happens when a headline becomes a filing. Intel got the money. Now: It has to make the partnership feel like hardware, not hope.\nIt’s a private placement, not a public-market nibble, and Intel’s earlier filing emphasized Nvidia wasn’t getting special governance or information rights beyond what shareholders already get. The deal was conditioned on the regulatory process, and the FTC’s early-termination notice for the transaction is dated Dec. 18.\n“AI is driving a reinvention of every layer of the computing stack,” Huang said back in September at a press conference to discuss the news, which he called a “historic partnership” and a “great business opportunity” for both companies. Huang said the three architecture teams — working across the CPU architecture, as well as product lines for servers and PCs — have been developing this “fairly extensive” architecture for over a year. He added, “Today, we’re taking the next great step.”\n\nYou could feel how unthinkable this pairing once was by the way the Street talked about it. “This is truly like the Yankees and the Red Sox coming together to end their rivalry — the companies did not like each other whatsoever,” David Wagner, head of equity and a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote at the time. “[Using Intel’s fabs to make chips is] a massive step in the right direction for U.S. chip designers and breathes new life into a poorly run company for decades.”\nThis partnership didn’t happen in a vacuum. Earlier this fall, the federal government took the rare step of engineering a roughly 10% equity stake in Intel , converting lectures about industrial policy into a live experiment with an actual balance sheet. The politics were loud, the stakes louder, and the message unmistakable: In President Donald Trump’s America’s AI playbook — a CEO-style , results-first posture toward national champions — Intel is the corporate vessel for “made here” ambition. But Intel didn’t just need capital. It also needed a partner.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Intel-Nvidia partnership pitch stays the same, and the omissions stay just as loud. Intel and Nvidia have said they’ll co-develop multiple generations of products for data centers and PCs, including Nvidia-custom x86 CPUs meant to slot into Nvidia’s AI infrastructure and PC system-on-chips that combine Intel CPU cores with Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets, stitched together with NVLink. Missing, deliberately, is any promise that Nvidia’s crown-jewel GPUs will move off TSMC or that Intel will suddenly become the default factory for Nvidia’s most important silicon. The deal reads like influence and distribution, not a manufacturing surrender. A big check, not a merger.\n\nFor Intel, that’s still a win. It gets cash plus the kind of association that turns a long-suffering turnaround narrative into something procurement teams can cite without blushing. For Nvidia, this is a smoother path into the x86 universe without asking enterprises to torch their software estates — and a convenient way to look less like a solitary superpower while regulators and politicians keep peering at the AI stack like it’s critical infrastructure.\nNvidia’s check has cleared — now, Intel’s story has to.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why BellRing Brands (BRBR) Shares Are Falling Today\n\nAnthony Lee\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:55 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BRBR\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nWhat Happened? Shares of nutrition products company Bellring Brands (NYSE:BRBR) fell 10.5% in the morning session after analysts highlighted a murky near-term outlook and rising volatility expected for the company.\nThe shifting views prompted a wave of revised forecasts, adding to the uncertainty around BellRing's performance. This cautious stance from Wall Street helped drive the sharp selloff.\n\nContributing to the weakness, major indices pulled back from record highs reached the previous week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were under pressure in the morning as the dominant artificial intelligence trade cools off. Market leaders like Nvidia and AMD saw significant losses as traders locked in profits following a banner year where the Nasdaq surged over 21%. With the S&P 500 recently hitting intraday highs near 6,945, this dip reflected a shift in internal momentum rather than a response to major economic news.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunties to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy BellRing Brands? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us BellRing Brands’s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for BellRing Brands and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 14 days ago when the stock gained 2.5% on the news that investors flocked to defensive sectors, including consumer staples, amidst the broader tech sell-off.\n\nAs capital fled high-beta AI and tech names (like Broadcom and Oracle) due to margin concerns, investors reallocated into cash-generative, defensive growth stocks. Adding to the momentum, the company's recently authorized $600 million share repurchase program raised market optimism, signaling management's confidence in the stock's value.\nBellRing Brands is down 63.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $26.96 per share, it is trading 66% below its 52-week high of $79.39 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of BellRing Brands’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,143.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend. We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking.

Do they waste a whole day trying to find the next big play in AI or do they just say, you know what? Nvidia's going to win this whole damn thing? I'm just going to bet on them again next year.\n00:15 Adam\nYeah, I definitely wouldn't uh just bet on Nvidia. I I think you do need to do your homework if you want to buy specific names. I think probably the general investor is probably better finding some sort of basket to kind of play the overall space. Uh but we're very early innings in this and\n00:41 Adam\nobviously Nvidia is the winner right now, but uh to say, you know, in five years that we look back that they're going to be the dominant player still, very, very unlikely. Like I said, this is really an evolving space. So I I would be careful with something that's so specific as Nvidia. Uh we kind of like to barbell this with, you know, something like the the big hyperscaler like a like an Alphabet Google, uh because that's really the type of name that uh you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because they just\n01:14 Adam\noverall, the AI story is just benefiting an already existing business model that was doing well. So, I think you would just want to be careful with what we're calling kind of the one trick ponies, like a Nvidia, uh a Core Weve or a Patier right now.\n01:31 Speaker A\nUh, Brooke, let me get over to you because I think what you're seeing in industrial metals and some of the things that Adam's talking about fits nicely with what we heard from Ed Yardini this morning that he might see it is likely to see we are likely to see a broadening out in this rally. Investors doing their homework, trying to get outside of the tried and true Mag 7.\n01:53 Brooke\nYeah, Brian, what we did hear from Ed Danny over the weekend was really ongoing momentum in this market in 2026. He maintained that year end target for the S&P 500 of 7,700 and he said largely it won't be really led by uh the Mag 7, but also what he called the impressive 493 of the S&P 500 as really this broadening out, this boost in productivity growth really leads to overall returns for the\n02:26 Brooke\nS&P 500 in 2026. Specifically, you know, he went on to say that that is really where exactly investors should be thinking about this mindset. You know, not really overweight technology, but more so thinking about the other users of AI as opposed to just the producers of AI. And so certainly he's not alone in this uh momentum that he thinks will exist within 2026 ongoing from what we've seen so far in the returns in 2025.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Market participants returning from the holiday break were greeted by a landscape of high volatility, as record-setting gains in gold and silver were pared back amid profit-taking and shifting geopolitical signals.\n\nThe S&P/TSX 60 Futures edged lower on Monday morning, trading down 0.14% at 1,875.7 CAD. The subtle decline follows a holiday-shortened session last week where the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite settled at 31,999.76, down 0.2%.\nThin liquidity characterized the Toronto market as institutions finalized year-end portfolios. While the TSX is on track for its best annual performance in years, up nearly 30%, the retreat in mining heavyweights could limit the index’s ability to punch through new highs before the 2026 turnover.\nU.S. Stock Futures Slip Across the border, Wall Street futures signaled a cautious open after the S&P 500 touched fresh record intraday highs on Friday.\nNasdaq 100 Futures: Fell 0.6% as AI leaders like Nvidia and Oracle saw premarket pressure.\nS&P 500 Futures: Slid 0.4%, hovering near 6,952 points.\nDow Jones Futures: Remained slightly down, set for a loss of 0.2% at open.\n\nGold and Metals Reversal The most dramatic action occurred in the commodities pits. Precious metals, which have been the stars of 2025, saw a sharp \"flush out\" as traders locked in gains following the Christmas break.\nThe broader metals complex faced a coordinated sell-off in early Monday trading. Gold Futures for February delivery dropped 2.93% to trade at $4,419.50, while Silver Futures for March plunged a significant 6.77% to $71.97 after failing to hold its overnight record of $83.99. Copper Futures followed the downward trend, slipping 2.10% to $5.71 per pound as the recent rally in industrial metals took a breather.\n\nOil Gains on Geopolitical Friction In contrast to the selling in metals, energy markets found a floor. Crude Oil WTI Futures climbed 2.28% to $58.04, while Brent Crude rose 2.1% to $61.47.\nThe \"tug of war\" in oil remains between:\nDe-escalation Hopes: Progress in Ukraine peace talks between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, with 90% of a peace plan reportedly agreed upon.\nSupply Risks: Intensified U.S. naval activity near Venezuela and ongoing tensions in the Middle East.\n\nLooking Ahead Investors will pivot their attention to release of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes, seeking clarity on whether the central bank will accelerate rate cuts in early 2026. For the TSX, the focus remains on whether energy resilience can offset the sudden cooling in the mining sector.\n\nStory Continues\nRelated articles\nTSX futures drift as commodities retreat from record territory\n10 Beaten-Down Large-Cap Tech Stocks Offering Solid Upside Potential\nGold: $4K Breakout Faces First Real Test as Stocks and Sentiment Rise Together\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The acquisition is part of SoftBank’s push to invest in the digital infrastructure fueling the artificial intelligence boom.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nSoftBank’s billionaire founder, Masayoshi Son, aims to capitalize on soaring demand for digital infrastructure, driven by the AI boom. The past year has seen a wave of multibillion-dollar deals in the space, largely focused on data centers and the computing power necessary to build and power the technology.\n\nThe need for capacity has fueled massive transactions, including BlackRock Inc.’s $40 billion purchase of Aligned Data Centers and Oracle Corp.’s agreement to supply OpenAI with about 4.5 gigawatts of computing power worth as much as $300 billion.\nDigitalBridge is one of the biggest investment firms focused on digital infrastructure, with about $108 billion of assets under management at the end of September, according to its website.\nDigitalBridge shares jumped 9.7% to $15.28 at 9:33 a.m. in New York, trading slightly below the sale price. The deal represents a 15% premium to DigitalBridge’s closing share price on Dec. 26, the companies said.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2026, pending regulatory approvals.\nShares of DigitalBridge rose 45% on Dec. 5, when Bloomberg first reported the talks to take the company private. It had a market value of about $2.5 billion and an enterprise value of $3.8 billion including debt as of Friday’s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe deal will bring to SoftBank relationships with more investors keen to deploy money in the data center industry. DigitalBridge is led by Chief Executive Officer Marc Ganzi and its portfolio includes digital infrastructure operators such as AIMS, AtlasEdge, DataBank, Switch Inc., Vantage Data Centers and Yondr Group.\nSoftBank has separately been discussing a potential acquisition of Switch, a data center operator backed by investors including DigitalBridge, Bloomberg News reported earlier in December. Switch’s owners have sought a valuation of around $50 billion including debt in a deal, people with knowledge of the matter have said.\nWhile SoftBank’s most famous bets include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Arm Holdings Plc and WeWork, it has previously done deals in the asset management space. In 2017, it acquired Fortress Investment Group for more than $3 billion. It later sold its stake to a group including Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co. and Fortress management in a deal completed in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\nIn January, SoftBank announced the $500 billion Stargate project, alongside OpenAI, Oracle and Abu Dhabi’s MGX, to build data centers in the US. While Son pledged to deploy $100 billion “immediately,” the rollout of Stargate has been slower than planned, in part because of disagreements over where the data centers should be located.\n\nSoftBank initially sought project financing from outside investors including insurance companies, pension funds and investment funds. Some of the conversations dragged due to market volatility, uncertainty around US trade policy and questions about the financial valuations of AI hardware, Bloomberg News reported in May.\nSoftBank’s newest investment push has meant moving some funds around to free up capital. Son this month said he “was crying” over his need to sell a $5.8 billion Nvidia Corp. stake to reallocate the money to other AI spending.\n(Updates with Monday trading in the sixth paragraph.

Kyiv and Moscow also have yet to make progress on the issue of concessions over land captured by Russia during the conflict.\nSanctions from the US Treasury Department seeking to curtail Russia's ability to sell its oil internationally are likely to remain in place until a peace agreement is reached. The sanctions are likely keeping several hundred thousand barrels of oil off the market, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, even as Russia continues to find buyers in China and India willing to take Russian barrels at a steep discount.\nAt the same time, a monthly decline in output reported by Kazakhstan and escalating rhetoric from Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have put upward pressure on prices from the Middle East.\nKazakhstan's massive Tengiz oilfield, where Chevron ( CVX ) serves as the lead operator, led a decline of 6% in monthly output in December after attacks by Ukrainian drones damaged a Russian export terminal on the Black Sea, according to Reuters.\nProduction also fell in the Tengiz field in December, according to Reuters, even as Chevron has spent the year working on a nearly $50 billion effort to increase production in the field by roughly 1 million barrels per day.\nOil is headed for its fifth straight monthly decline as December comes to a close.\n\n34 mins ago Laura Bratton\n\nStocks slip at the open US stocks pulled back at the market open on Monday, dampening hopes for a so-called \"Santa Claus\" rally — the historic upturn in stocks during the last five trading days of December and first two sessions in January.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) led declines at the open of Monday's session, falling 0.7%, as Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Tesla ( TSLA ) dropped more than 2%.

Political shifts, leverage and crowded positioning powered sharp rallies across assets, only to reverse when sentiment cracked or liquidity thinned. Crypto trades tied to Donald Trumps return to the White House briefly surged before fading, with Trump-linked tokens and American Bitcoin sliding sharply from their peaks, while Bitcoin itself fell from its October high and is on track for an annual loss. In equities, skepticism crept into the AI boom after Michael Burry ( Trades , Portfolio )s Scion Asset Management disclosed deep out-of-the-money put options on Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Palantir Technologies ( NASDAQ:PLTR ), a filing that jolted markets even as questions lingered over the trades structure and duration.\n\nIs PLTR fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nElsewhere, geopolitics and macro stress rewired capital flows. European defense shares rallied as governments boosted military spending, pushing a Bloomberg basket of the sector up more than 70% for the year through Dec. 23 and reshaping ESG playbooks. Gold climbed to repeated records amid talk of a debasement trade, even as Treasuries moved toward their best year since 2020 and the dollar steadied, underscoring how fiscal fears and demand for safety can coexist. Japans bond market flipped a long-standing script, with yields surging past multi-decade levels and turning the once-notorious widowmaker trade into a profitable short, while South Koreas equity market jumped more than 70% as foreign investors piled in, even as local retail money flowed out and pressured the won.\n\nCredit and balance-sheet trades delivered some of the years most pointed lessons. Jim Chanos ( Trades , Portfolio )s short of Strategy Inc. ( NASDAQ:MSTR ) against a long Bitcoin position paid off as the companys premium to its crypto holdings shrank, while aggressive creditor-on-creditor tactics around Envision Healthcare generated sizable gains for select funds after Amsurg sold to Ascension Health for $4 billion. At the same time, speculative fervor lifted Fannie Mae ( FNMA ) and Freddie Mac ( FMCC ) shares on privatization hopes following Trumps re-election, before skepticism resurfaced over timing and feasibility. From Turkeys carry trade collapse after sudden political unrest to a string of smaller corporate credit failures that prompted JPMorgans Jamie Dimon to warn of more cockroaches, 2025 left investors heading into 2026 mindful that powerful narratives can carry prices far but not indefinitely.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nThe AI Data Center Boom Goes Public: From “Neoclouds” to Power, Cooling, and the Grid\n\nMicrocaps\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nWestlake Village, Dec. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Microcaps.com curates and contextualizes news, analysis, and market data across the public micro- and small-cap ecosystem, with a focus on emerging growth themes shaping investor sentiment. As AI infrastructure spending accelerates and capital flows increasingly target data centers, GPU clouds, and adjacent platforms, Microcaps is examining how these developments are being reflected in public-market valuations, from established leaders like Nvidia (NVDA) to newer, infrastructure-adjacent entrants gaining investor attention.\n\nThe artificial intelligence data center industry has quickly evolved from a niche buildout into one of the most capital-intensive sectors in technology. What began as a race to secure GPUs has turned into a broader competition for energy capacity, cooling systems, high-speed interconnection, real estate, and long-term power contracts. Increasingly, this transformation is moving into public markets, where investors are looking to the physical infrastructure enabling AI as the next frontier of opportunity.\n\nWhy AI data centers are different\nAI-focused data centers are fundamentally different from traditional enterprise facilities. These environments are devised to handle macro model training and inference, requiring accelerators, high rack power density, liquid or advanced cooling, and low-latency networking. According to McKinsey & Co., global investment in AI-ready data centers could reach $5.2 trillion by 2030, reflecting the scale and intensity of demand ( McKinsey ).\n\nThese technical requirements are driving new partnerships, facility types, and capital strategies as AI shifts from experimental to operational at scale.\n\nThe role of GPU supply\nAI infrastructure is often defined by access to high-performance compute, especially graphics processing units. Nvidia, one of the most prominent suppliers of GPUs, plays a central role in powering many of the world’s largest AI compute clusters ( Wikipedia ). Though hardware companies are key players, the larger story involves how power, physical capacity and integration models affect the scale and resilience of AI deployments—particularly as some operators explore hybrid approaches that blend owned infrastructure with third-party and network-based GPU capacity.\n\nValuation multiples and public market signals\n\nInvestor expectations are increasingly reflected in valuation multiples. In both public and private markets, companies exposed to AI infrastructure have seen enterprise value-to-revenue ratios in the 20-to-30-times range, particularly where growth visibility is high ( Aventis Advisors ). By contrast, the average price-to-sales ratio for S&P 500 companies remains around 2.8 times revenue ( Eqvista ).\n\nStory Continues\nThese valuation differences underscore the market’s confidence in the long-term value of infrastructure that enables AI, even when it’s capital-intensive or early in monetization.\n\nAI infrastructure and data centers\nGPU-focused cloud providers have emerged to serve training and inference workloads at scale. Some of these companies have attracted significant attention for their capital efficiency and growth rates. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, such platforms have traded at revenue multiples as high as 13 times, reflecting investor appetite for scalable infrastructure models ( Wall Street Journal ).\n\nData center operators with experience in large-scale buildouts have also benefited. Oliver Wyman notes that infrastructure specialists often trade at 20-to-30-times EBITDA, given the strength of long-term leases and strategic real estate positioning ( Oliver Wyman ).\n\nInfrastructure-adjacent valuations\nSupporting infrastructure providers—including power delivery, thermal systems and high-performance fiber—are increasingly recognized as critical to AI expansion. These companies, while not compute providers themselves, have traded at revenue multiples of 20 or more during periods of elevated interest ( Skeptically Optimistic ).\nTheir role in enabling denser, more efficient compute environments makes them essential to the broader AI infrastructure stack.\n\nThe rise of ‘neoclouds’\nA new class of cloud platforms, sometimes called “neoclouds,” has emerged to address AI-native workloads. These providers specialize in GPU infrastructure and orchestration tools tailored for AI applications. Their ability to secure scarce GPU supply and scale quickly has made them influential examples of how infrastructure strategy meets AI compute demand ( Wikipedia – CoreWeave ).\nHowever, the capital intensity of these models—combined with execution risk—remains a topic of investor debate.\n\nInfrastructure-adjacent public entrants\nSome newer publicly traded firms are entering the AI market from adjacent angles—building data center infrastructure, facilitating energy deployments or offering highly specialized GPU-hosting services. In several cases, companies that originated in AI software or applied research have repositioned toward compute enablement as enterprise demand for flexible GPU access accelerates. Axe Compute (NASDAQ: AGPU), which recently rebranded from its earlier life sciences focus, is one example of this shift, reflecting how public-market entrants are adapting their strategies to align with the infrastructure layer of the AI economy. These companies often see their valuations driven more by future AI-aligned revenue potential than by current earnings. Their presence reflects the growing complexity and diversity of infrastructure models supporting the AI boom ( Global Equity Briefing ).\n\nThe enabling layer: landlords, interconnection and cooling\nData center landlords and interconnection platforms play a key role in the ecosystem, even when they do not directly offer AI compute. These providers benefit from long-term contracts, scarce land and high interconnection demand from cloud platforms and hyperscalers. As AI growth continues, these firms are seeing renewed attention from both investors and partners seeking strategic locations.\nCooling and energy delivery vendors, such as those specializing in liquid cooling or immersion systems, are increasingly vital as AI density grows. Their ability to adapt to next-generation hardware is becoming a competitive advantage.\n\nThe access layer: asset-light models\nAsset-light platforms that aggregate compute capacity—rather than owning it—are emerging to meet short-term demand. These companies act as intermediaries between data center partners and end users, offering flexible pricing and availability; some public operators, including newer entrants like Axe Compute, are pursuing this model to monetize enterprise GPU access without assuming full hyperscale buildout risk. Their value is often measured through recurring revenue and partner depth, rather than hardware ownership.\n\nThis model appeals to developers and smaller enterprises that need scalable compute without long-term infrastructure commitments.\n\nCapital intensity and execution risk define the space\nAcross all categories, AI data infrastructure is shaped by two opposing forces: massive demand growth and extremely high buildout costs. Capital requirements for land, power, cooling and chips can exceed billions per deployment. At the same time, operators must navigate execution challenges such as grid access, supply chain constraints, permitting and sustainability.\nAs McKinsey notes, while AI workloads will continue to scale, so too will the need for long-term infrastructure strategy and financing innovation ( McKinsey ).\n\nLooking ahead\nIf 2023 and 2024 were the years of the GPU race, 2025 is increasingly defined by infrastructure readiness. Power, cooling, interconnection and capital planning are now as important as the chips themselves. In public markets, firms that combine technical leadership with scalable infrastructure and capital discipline are likely to lead the next wave of growth.\n\nAs AI infrastructure continues to expand, the companies positioned across compute, enablement, and access layers will play a central role in how the AI economy is built.\n\nReferences\nMcKinsey & Co.

What about your holiday stock shopping list? Today is Thursday, December 18. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm your host today, Jason Hall, and I'm joined by Motley Fool analysts Dan Caplinger and Jon Quast to discuss some of our favorite hidden gem stocks that look like great buys as 2025 comes to a close. Get ready for a fun, Foolish round table discussion. If I say hidden gems, you probably think I'm talking about small esoteric companies that nobody's ever heard of, right?. That's true. But it's not the only place that you can find hidden gems. On today's show, we have three giants and their respective industries. Airbnb is one of those dominant companies, and Jon, you brought it to the table. It's a name that people think of when describing the entire short-term stays industry now. It's become the verb, too. Since the first day of trading post IPO, the stock's up almost double, but it peaked like a month later, and it's way down since then in early 2021. Jon, why is this on your list as a hidden gem stock worth buying?\n\nJon Quast: Well, let me give you my elevator pitch here for Airbnb to start it off. People aren't giving up this short-term rental model. Airbnb is the dominant player in this space, and I think it has a brand mote, and it's printing cash, like few companies do. Eventually, these factors should make Airbnb stock a winner. I know it hasn't performed great in recent years, but I think that it will eventually catch up. Let's talk about one of the traits I like of a hidden gem, and that's reasonable growth in an expanding market. Airbnb is growing its revenue at a double-digit pace, 10% in the most recent quarter, expecting high single-digit in the upcoming quarter. But it's not red hot, but that is reasonable growth. There's market research pointing to ongoing growth in this space as a whole. Airbnb is one of the third parties that puts out reports on this. What's so interesting to me is that Airbnb has showed that there are rental property owners who are willing to put their listing on multiple platforms, and that's the majority. But if you're only listing exclusively, you're not listing with Airbnb's competitors. You're listing on Airbnb exclusively. It's either Airbnb alone or Airbnb plus, but never without Airbnb. That to me, shows the mot here, and one of the reasons I like it in this expanding market.\n\nStory Continues\nJason Hall: There's more you like, too.\nJon Quast: For sure. I also like companies that exhibit this trait of having this relentless drive and curiosity to finding new business opportunities. Airbnb is definitely one of those. It's invested $200 million this year in experiences and services. When you look at its bookings in the third quarter, half weren't attached to a place to stay. I'm talking about its experiences and services. People stay in a new place, and maybe they'll book an experience on top of that, but half of the experiences now don't have a place attached to it, so they're doing it exclusively for the experience. That's an interesting trend. The company investing in that seems to be paying off. Management's also talked about, hey, we're going to launch a couple new business ideas every single year. This is throwing spaghetti at the wall, for sure, but it has extra cash on hand, so it can't afford to invest in these new ideas you look at the whole thing. It trades at 18 times its free cash flow. That's a valuation I can get behind. It's buying back shares, and the share count is coming down, and it's investing in new opportunities. Here's the thing. Its competitive position does afford investors the luxury of patience. If it was being outcompeted, if it was burning cash, you wouldn't have the ability to be very patient here. But because it is so strong, you can be patient while it waits for some of these new ideas to work out.\n\nJason Hall: Jon, I'm a little less convinced that optionality is going to lead to that next leg of growth. But the core business is a wonderful business. You mentioned the valuation, and that says that other investors don't necessarily think it's a wonderful business. Maybe some margin of safety there. Plus, or maybe interest rates falling a catalyst for the business moving forward, too? We'll find out about that, but, Dan, you say there's something else that stands out to you.\nDan Caplinger: There's a couple of things. One is that co-founder CEO Brian Chesky has done a great strategy where he is actually living in a different Airbnb property. It's like on a weekly basis or every couple of weeks, something like that. As I get older, as I start to travel more, I'm finding that is more appealing an idea for me, as well. I think that that may actually resonate with some older travelers as they get to a point where they're thinking about retirement, have more time to spend on the road. Just suddenly, that hotel mindset, it's just different from what you get from an Airbnb. I think there's a lot of potential there. The other thing that I have run into in my own travels in the past year is that Airbnbs actually starting to get some cross-listings from traditional hotels. What I was shocked at is the pricing on the hotel rooms on Airbnb is sometimes cheaper than what you get from aggregator sites. I even ran into one situation where it happened to be a Marriott property. I'm a Marriott Bonvoy loyalty member. There was a better price on Airbnb than I could get as a loyalty member. It ticked me off as a loyalty member, but it does speak to the appeal that hotel owners have when they're trying to get as much money as they possibly can. Maxing it out, putting it on all platforms is the smart thing to do. I just never expected a traditional hotel to be so interested in Airbnb. I think that's a potential growth driver, as well.\n\nJason Hall: See, that's the optionality that I think could be compelling, and it's a little bit of maybe Amazon's ad business on its own platform for inventory. Where there's a lot of competition for consumer goods, and it's the same way for Airbnb. It also says to me that Airbnb, you know what? We're not afraid of the hotel industry. Come, give us some money. Put your properties on our platform. We'll take a little money from you. We're still going to win. Up next, Dan makes the case for Lululemon in the midst of growing competition and a change in the C suite. Stay with us.\nSpeaker 1: Head home for the holidays with Abercrombie and Fitch . Between family dinners and making time to catch up with friends, my calendar gets booked up. When I need to look put together, Abercrombie makes it easy to find outfits for all of my fans. With their classic jumpers, essential hoodies, and Abercrombie denim, I've got my holiday fits covered for the whole season. Shop Abercrombie in the app, online, and in stores.\n\nJason Hall: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Over the long term, Lululemon has been a huge winner. It's up more than 15X since going public. But in recent years, it has not been a great investment. Investors have lost money from the peak back in 2023. We can go all the way back to 2020. Beginning of 2020, the stock is still down. The business has lost some of its luster. Dan, what's going on with Lululemon today that makes it compelling to you as a buy?\nDan Caplinger: I've been following Lululemon for a long time, and it's interesting to me how stocks that arguably start out more looking like rule breakers can end up emulating hidden gem style stocks later on. We all know Lululemon yoga apparel business, it changed the retail industry. It opened up an entire new category of these so-called Athlesure products. It brought a new meaning to casual Fridays at the office. It's been instrumental. It's spawned a whole bunch of other specialty retail concepts as well. Business is done really well. But after briefly topping $500 a share, late in 2023, early in 2024, we've seen the stock plunge 70%. Well, what happened? Growth trends slowed. They even reversed in the core North American market. Even now, the company is guarded about its immediate outlook. Seems like it's trying to bottom, but even most recent quarter, we saw same store sales in the North American segment drop. There's a lot of questions about Lululemon right now, but the thing I focus on is we have seen Lululemon be resilient before. Turn back the clock, what, 10, 11 years or so. From around 2012-2014, the stock was down about 50%. What happened? Yoga pants were suddenly see through. We had all these quality control issues. That was exacerbated by some comments from the then CEO, now former CEO and founder, which I won't bother to repeat here, but it took a while for the company to write the ship after that big boondoggle. But the payoff was the stock was a 10 bagger by 2021. Come back to today. Now we're facing a similarly interesting moment. Lululemon just announced its quarterly results earlier this month, but it also said CEO Calvin McDonald is stepping down. Shareholders were happy with that move. More recently, we've seen activist investors come in. Elliott Management has apparently taken $1 billion stake in Lululemon stock has suggested a former Ralph Loren executive named Jane Nelson for the job. Very much the stock in play right now a lot of investors trying to see, is this the thing that breaks Lululemon out of its slump.\n\nJon Quast: It's so interesting, Dan, that we're going to experience a change here at CEO, and I'm a little bit worried about a new management team coming in here and overcorrecting because I really don't think things are as bad as it appears. I think you have good apparel businesses and bad ones, and bad ones have piling up inventory, and that leads to markdowns, and it leads to a complete disintegration of its profit margins. You look at Lululemon. That's not what's happening. It's a good business. Inventory is fine. Margins are fine. It's just having a slowdown. I'm worried that a new manager could come in here and overcorrect when in reality, it stay the course and do what you need to do to keep appealing to your customers.\n\nDan Caplinger: I agree with a lot of what you said, Jon, and I will admit, I'm less than convinced that this recent trend of trying to pick up superstar CEOs for consumer goods companies that are going through some temporary problems. I just don't think that's as important as just going back to basics. Let's make some good products. Let's build up a core base of loyal customers, make them feel valued. But here's the thing. Investors have bid down Lululemon stock so far that they're essentially assuming no real chance of successfully reigniting the growth fires here. I'm not that pessimistic. I think somebody new in the corner office might be able to reverse that negative sentiment and get the stock moving in the right direction.\n\nJason Hall: I think competition is a real threat, but it's also an important reminder that it's a really compelling business. Competitors are not jumping in this to lose money. We've seen other retail or other apparel businesses that have struggled because they lost control of distribution. Lululemon is different because it still has so much control over its distribution footprint. I do think that I agree with both of you that this is less a turnaround and more of a recalibration, but the stock is still priced maybe for more trouble ahead. Up next. We've got one more. I've got a Mag 7 seven stock that I think is more hidden Jim than you might think. Stick with us.\nJason Hall: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money to wrap up today's show. I want to talk about Alphabet , guys.\n\nDan Caplinger: But what are we talking about here? I thought you said this was a hidden gem. Alphabet, more like hiding in plain sight. This was April, maybe. But now?\nJason Hall: I think that's fair. From the beginning of the year, the stocks up 55%, but that big sell-off during the lows in April, the stock's basically doubled since then, and it's clearly gone from being perceived as a feared loser from AI eroding that ad-driven search business to now one of the expected winners from artificial intelligence. Now, I think it's true. We're seeing it's getting really serious traction with Gemini, its Cloud services business is booming. We've also figured out that the ad business it's actually holding up pretty well, even as we do see search be affected by AI. But I think the reason it makes a cut for me, and of the stocks that we've discussed today, it's the one that I have actually most recently bought. It's because of those things and all of the other things that Alphabet is positioned to win from. Yes, that includes search. That includes AI and the Cloud. But it's basically got a Netflix bolted onto it with YouTube. It's a cool little thing with YouTube is it's a much lower risk content development engine because it shares in the profits with content creators. By the way, it's emerged as one of the largest cable TV companies in the US, too, with YouTube TV. Also, we continue to creep closer to autonomous vehicles becoming a real thing. Waymo is approaching half a million rides a week, and they're aiming to hit one million rides a week really soon. Eventually, that's going to be a big business. It's going to feel like an overnight success, but it will have actually taken 15-20 years to build out.\n\nJon Quast: Well, I think that's exactly why Alphabet is a hidden gem. It's not because it's undiscovered, but rather because investors tend to think about it one dimensionally, when in reality, as you point out, Jason, this business can win every way from Thursday in so many different ways. As an analyst, I can barely keep up with everything that it is doing and succeeding in. Optionality is a business trait that we can't measure by any valuation metric. There isn't a stock screener that's going to pull this out, but it's so important from an investing perspective. Just looking at the plethora of past stock market winners, they had that trait, and Alphabet certainly has it, and there are underappreciated optionality aspects of the business.\n\nDan Caplinger: Jason, kudos to you for making this purchase recently. I think it's always hard when you've seen a stock really take off before you've had a chance to really add to your position. I was fortunate enough. I saw Alphabet as sort of this mispriced under appreciated stock years ago, and I've been adding even as many commentators dismissed the company for missing out on AI, missing out on cloud computing. Well, Alphabet proved that wrong, and now the stock is much more favorably valued than it used to be. There's still potential, though for future gains good on you, Jason.\nJason Hall: Guys, I got one last question to wrap this up. We've talked about three stocks today. Which do you think is the biggest winner in five years? Jon, you go first.\n\nJon Quast: I hate to say it. Y'all know how much I love Airbnb, but I believe that LuluLemon has the clearest path to doubling in value over the next five years. I think all three of these stocks are really safe. I really do. But LuluLemon, to me, it has a really good balance between its growth rate and its valuation, maybe the most favorable balance between those two factors. For me, it has the nod of the best stock today.\nDan Caplinger: Jason, I've got to say, I agree with Jon 100% and not just because it was my pick. But I have to say this, too, I wish that it would be Alphabet. I wish that Alphabet would be able to outperform LuluLemon over the next five years because I own a lot more Alphabet stock. I think Alphabet is going to do just fine, and I'm really optimistic and hopeful Airbnb might finally catch a break here, start executing well enough, get some appreciation from shareholders, get the stock moving back in the right direction.\n\nJason Hall: Airbnb just keeps landing on my too-hard pile. The valuation is really compelling. I'm waiting to see more evidence that these other things are going to really help it deliver, and we're going to be rewarded with a higher multiple. Alphabet, this is just about the most expensive multiple on a sales basis it's ever traded for. It's not cheap. There's still all the other things I laid out we're counting on. The market is expecting big things from the company. I agree. I come back to thinking of this group, the highest probability. I agree. I think the best margin of safety, the business that's proven, the business that's a lot stronger than the stock is treating it like. I think that's Lululemon, too. I agree. How about that? All three of us?\n\nDan Caplinger: It's a first, Jason. I'm not sure that's ever happened before.\nJason Hall: It's either a really good thing or really bad thing Jon?\nJon Quast: This is a shocking development, for sure.\nJason Hall: Guys, this has been a lot of fun.

      "Content": "Could Vertiv Become the Next Essential AI Infrastructure Stock?\n\nJames Brumley, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 5:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nVRT\n\nKey Points AI data centers are consuming more increasingly-expensive electricity than the industry anticipated.\nKeeping data centers cool enough to remain operational has also surfaced as a challenge.\nMost investors have yet to realize Vertiv’s book of future business continues to outgrow revenue.\n10 stocks we like better than Vertiv ›\n\nTo date, Nvidia has been the centerpiece stock of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. And rightfully so. The world's been waiting on computer processors powerful enough to turn lofty AI ambitions into reality. Nvidia delivered, with its silicon now serving as the heart and soul of most artificial intelligence platforms.\nAs the AI movement evolves though, unexpected challenges are coming to light. For instance, the planet's power infrastructure isn't quite as ready as hoped to supply data centers with all the electricity they need. These challenges are, of course, presenting new growth opportunities for investors -- opportunities better than Nvidia is at this time.\nAnd one name in particular is rising to the surface as one of the next great stock picks of the artificial intelligence revolution. That's AI infrastructure specialist Vertiv (NYSE: VRT) . Although it's never going to be as big as Nvidia nor likely to dish out the sort of sustained gains that Nvidia did, from here, it does offer tremendous long-term promise.\n\nBuilt for the growth opportunity at-hand It's not the only outfit offering solutions that meet artificial intelligence data centers' complicated needs. Newcomers like Nebius , Applied Digital , and Iren (and others) are in this business as well, each with their own unique offering. Vertiv brings something very special to the table though. That's cost-effective flexible power and cost-efficient cooling solutions.\n\nOne of these cooling solutions is chilled water systems. While not unheard of, it's still relatively rare within the world of data centers. But it shouldn't be. While they can be complicated and somewhat expensive to set up, McKinsey reports that water-cooled platforms ultimately consume about 30% less power than more conventional alternatives.\nIt's not just chilled water cooling that Vertiv offers though, or for that matter, just cooling. Power generation and electricity management are also in its repertoire.\nBattery-based energy storage and highly efficient power transfer switches are also on its menu, for example, with the company reporting that its PowerDirect 7100 Energy hybrid DC power systems are 98% energy-efficient. In an industry where operating costs are soaring because some of this equipment is on the order of 30% less efficient, that's a pretty big deal.\n\nStory Continues\nThe opportunity at-hand isn't ho-hum either. S&P Global Market Intelligence predicts worldwide data center power consumption will nearly double between now and 2030, and still won't be done growing by then. Meanwhile, Precedence Research believes the global data center cooling market itself is set to grow at an average annualized pace of nearly 12% through 2035.\n\nVertiv is well-positioned to plug into both of these growth trends.\nKeep your eyes on the long-term prize These tailwinds don't necessarily mean Vertiv shares will be easy to own anytime soon. They likely won't be, in fact. Although the already-profitable company's top line is expected to grow another 20% in 2026 and pump up per-share profits at a similar rate, this ticker is understandably being lumped in with most other AI stocks, which some believe are in a bubble .\n\nIf that bubble pops, VRT will almost certainly tumble with those other names. In the meantime, it's just plain volatile, sliding from late-October's peak near $200 to this month's low near $150 back to where it was priced as of mid-October.\nJust don't lose your long-term perspective. This stock is currently valued at just a little over 30 times the coming year's projected per-share profits of $5.28, which is cheap by most artificial intelligence stock standards.\nAnd thanks to its recent AI-related volatility, the stock's also trading well below analysts' consensus price target of $200.62. Data center owners and operators desperately need the technology it offers, even if most investors don't see it yet. That's the crux of the opportunity here.\n\nThis might seal the deal, so to speak: Not only was Vertiv's third-quarter revenue of just under $2.7 billion up 29% year over year, the company's backlog of business grew from $8.5 billion as June to $9.5 billion now. The tailwinds blowing here are clearly picking up speed.\nShould you buy stock in Vertiv right now? Before you buy stock in Vertiv, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertiv wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Will Intel Shock the World in 2026?\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:38 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBF\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Intel had an 80% gain in 2025.\nBut the company's market cap is still far below its big tech peers.\nSome unexpected technology and financial successes could be in store for 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nOne of the best performers in the technology sector this year was Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , with its stock up roughly 80% in 2025. Extreme pessimism at the start of the year gave way to hope when new CEO Lip-Bu Tan was appointed to the role in March. Then hope turned to enthusiasm when the U.S. government, Softbank , and Nvidia all invested in the company in the third quarter.\n\nSkeptics may say Intel is due for a pullback in 2026, but investors should consider that Intel's market capitalization is still far below that of other AI leaders, at just $173 billion today.\nThat still leaves room for further upside if Intel can execute and regain its technology leadership. And while many analysts are skeptical this will happen, Intel may very well change the narrative in a big way next year.\nProfits are nearly certain to inflect higher Many don't really understand Intel's current financials, which is understandable. Current profits appear nonexistent; last quarter's adjusted ( non-GAAP ) EPS was a meager $0.23, likely not enough to justify the current stock price of $36.50.\nYet it seems nearly inevitable that Intel's profits will increase throughout 2026. The most direct way this will happen is by relocating more production from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) to Intel's own manufacturing fabs.\n\nThroughout former CEO Pat Gelsinger's turnaround plan, Intel had to reinvest to build its Intel 3 fab in Ireland and its 18A fab in Chandler, Arizona. During that period, Intel still produced older nodes in-house, but outsourced basically all of its leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC as its new fabs were built. As a virtual monopoly, TSMC achieved a very high gross margin of 59.5% last quarter. Meanwhile, Intel's foundry is yielding large operating losses, to the tune of $2.3 billion last quarter alone.\nBut Intel foundry's losses are entirely due to Intel having invested heavily in expensive leading-edge fabs, while having very little product running through those fabs as of yet. However, as Intel moves production back to both Intel 3, which began high-volume manufacturing in late 2024, and especially 18A, which just began high-volume manufacturing this quarter, those underutilization losses will not only reverse but should eventually turn into profits by 2027.\nSo there will be a double-positive effect of Intel beginning to utilize the fabs it has already built, while also not having to pay TSMC's huge margins.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile yields on the 18A process are currently lower than normal, according to Intel management, it's early in that node's ramp. Management remains confident yields will improve throughout next year, which should lead to steady margin increases throughout 2026.\nTechnology leadership could add even more profitability Speaking of 18A, it is still the node by which Intel believes it will meet or exceed TSMC's technology in the industry. Now, there is some debate about this, with some industry participants arguing that TSMC's 2nm remains superior.\nYet while both Intel and TSMC will be using gate-all-around transistors for the first time with their 18A and 2nm nodes, Intel will be bringing at least one technology to market ahead of TSMC: backside power.\n\nBackside power moves the power delivery wires of a semiconductor from the front of the chip to the back part of the chip. This leaves more room on the front for more transistors, which leads to better performance and efficiency.\nIn addition, while Intel has been close-lipped about the tooling for its 18A node, there is also the possibility that Intel may utilize high-NA extreme ultraviolet lithography (HNA) tools for 18A.\nHNA can \"write\" chip patterns in a thickness of just 8nm, more precisely than the 13nm light beams of low-NA EUV. If Intel implements high-NA for the 18A node, it can eliminate several processing steps that would be required by double or triple-patterning designs with LNA tools, thereby saving on other equipment lines and fab space. At a technology conference back in February, Intel noted that a high-NA machine can do the same work with a single-digit number of process steps that it took three low-NA machines and 40 steps to accomplish.\n\nNow, for the record, Intel has only stated that it will integrate HNA production into its upcoming 14A node. However, management has never explicitly ruled out the possibility of inserting the technology into 18A. Meanwhile, Intel has publicly disclosed it has already purchased at least three high-NA machines, and potentially more. Moreover, Intel just revealed two weeks ago it had completed \"acceptance testing\" for the production-grade HNA system, meaning it is manufacturing-ready. With Intel having first received HNA tools in late 2023 and the tool seemingly ready for production, it would be odd if the company doesn't use these next-gen tools until 2028's 14A.\nExternal customer announcements? Finally, in addition to improving its technology and margins for its own chips, Intel is also attempting to become a rival foundry to TSMC and break its monopoly. In fact, Intel has stated it may not even develop its next 14A node if it doesn't secure a large external customer -- although executives remain confident that this will happen.\n\nIf Intel does land an external customer for 14A, which is scheduled to enter risk production in 2027 and high-volume production in 2028, that customer win may very well be announced in 2026.\nAlready over the past month, rumors have circulated that Apple may utilize the 18AP node variant, a more refined version of 18A, for its lower-end M-series processors. Meanwhile, Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead recently wrote, \"Intel customers I've talked with who have seen this one say that 14A is the real deal.\" And GF Securities in Hong Kong recently reported Nvidia and even Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices are considering the 14A node.\nIf these rumors are already circulating in 2025, there will likely be a lot more activity surrounding external customer announcements in 2026.\n\n2026 could see the rally continue 2025 was the first stage of Intel's turnaround. The company returned to meager profitability, implemented its new 18A process, and reduced the company's bloated expense base. It attracted investment from the U.S. government and others, and new CEO Lip-Bu Tan is beginning to make his presence felt.\n\nYet 2026 could see even more tangible more breakthroughs across profitability, technology, and landing external customers. In other words, it will be another fascinating year for the most consequential U.S. chipmaker -- with potentially much more upside for the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

The round was led by Banyan Tree , Silver Capital , ZhaoTai Group , and NYX Ventures , with participation from Starting Gate Fund , Jade Capital , and renowned tech investors including VPs from NVIDIA , Julian Qian (Member of technical staff at Anthropic) , Weihe Zheng (Founding Partner, Cowin Capital) , Jia He (Founding Partner, Nanshan Capital) , Peter Xu (CEO, Plug and Play China) , and Zach Zhang (Founding Partner, Edgewater Investments) . Existing investors Tao Foundation and Xiaomi Co-founder Feng Hong also participated. The proceeds will be used primarily for technology R&D, product iteration, and market expansion.\n\nPrior to this, Traini also received investments from senior management at Google, Meta, and Palo Alto Networks and institutional investment from FutureX Capital , BlueSea Partners , Tao Foundation , Mint Capital , and Valkyrie Fund .\nFollowing this round of financing, Traini will launch its first smart hardware product—the world’s first cognitive pet wearable , the Cognitive Smart Collar . This device is also the world’s first human–dog \"language\" translation device built on generative AI. It is now available for pre-order through the Traini App and the website, traini.app .\nTraini founder Arvin Sun stated, \"Our mission is to develop an intelligence that reignites the natural instincts of our furry companions and builds a true spiritual bond between pets and their humans.\" Traini’s founding team brings extensive experience from companies like OpenAI , Chewy , and ByteDance .\n\nTraini is the world’s first—and so far the only—technology company to translate pet behavior using multimodal generative AI. Its breakthrough technology has pioneered a new way for humans to communicate with their pets.\nThe defining feature of Traini’s product lies in its ability to enable real-time voice conversations through its proprietary multimodal models. Traini’s core product, PEBI (Pet Empathic Behavior Interface) , supports multimodal interaction across text, images, video, and audio. By analyzing pets’ vocalizations, facial expressions, and behaviors, PEBI delivers a precise understanding of pets’ psychological and emotional states and expresses them in a human-like conversational form—achieving true, two-way communication between humans and pets.\n\nStory continues\nTraini’s models cover nearly 120 dog breeds, with emotion translation accuracy reaching up to 94% . PEBI can be applied to behavior translation, emotion recognition, personalized service matching, and pet-assisted healthcare diagnostics. In addition, Traini provides APIs to veterinary clinics and hardware companies, empowering medical services and intelligent device interactions. Traini has established deep partnerships with leading smartphone and electric vehicle brands, and soon users will be able to communicate with their pets in real time directly through mobile operating systems and in-car infotainment systems.\n\nIn product quality validation, beyond collaborating with pet behavior experts for extensive data annotation, Traini has innovatively adopted a \"human–pet vocal spectrogram comparison\" methodology. By using the spectrogram of human speech—captured when expressing corresponding emotions and intentions—as a baseline, Traini compares it against pet vocal patterns to enhance emotional mapping accuracy.\nTraini‘s smart dog collar integrates advanced AI with real-time emotion tracking. It is powered by Traini’s proprietary Valence–Arousal model, 3D Pet Emotion Model and Instant Emotion Vector . Developed in close collaboration with pet behaviorists, the model is built upon insights from more than 900 peer-reviewed studies in animal behavior and trained on behavioral data from over 2 million dogs . Designed to deepen emotional bonds between pets and their owners, the Cognitive Smart Collar helps pet parents gain a richer understanding of their dogs’ emotional well-being and overall mental health.\n\nThe collar's most remarkable feature lies in its ability to autonomously identify and track kinds of emotional states in dogs, including joy, anxiety, excitement, and distress. Translating them into human-understandable language enables real-time, meaningful two-way communication — including vocalizations, emotions, behaviors, and even what the dog \"wants to say.\" Using a combination of sound analysis from the dog’s barks and vital signals like heart rate, temperature, and body movement, Traini’s AI-powered collar interprets these data points to provide a comprehensive emotional profile of the pet. Traini's collar offers actionable feedback that can enhance the bond between owner and pet.\nBeyond everyday care, the collar also has significant potential in the realm of pet healthcare. By continuously monitoring a dog’s emotional and physiological signals, it can help detect early signs of health issues.\n\nOn the user side, Traini has already served over 2 million dogs and received widespread coverage from major media and influencers. Its videos on YouTube have surpassed 70 million views . In 2023, Traini launched PetGPT , a natural-language and behavior-analysis model with 99% coverage across users, improving service engagement by 70% . Earlier this year, it unveiled T-Agent , an AI-powered product recommendation and purchasing system that autonomously identifies dogs’ real needs—allowing pets to make decisions, with their owners acting as co-pilots . Traini now collaborates with nearly 40,000 local pet stores across the U.S.\nTo realize this vision, Traini had to overcome two major challenges: data scarcity and environmental complexity . Traini addressed these through multimodal fusion , integrating image, video, and audio data to train its PPI (Pet Perception and Interaction) model. Powered by transformers, PPI combines real-time perception, adaptive reasoning, and feedback generation.\n\nTraini also introduced a \"train-as-you-use\" mechanism , where every anonymized user-pet interaction feeds back into model training, enhancing personalization and continuously expanding the behavioral dataset. This approach strengthens the model’s precision while building a sustainable data moat. Traini has achieved breakthroughs at both data and model levels , developing a rich, high-quality pet audio-video dataset across multiple breeds, scenes, and emotions. As a result, users can detect early signs of pet stress, loneliness, or health risks, transforming Traini from a passive tool into an emotional interface for daily companionship.\nInvestors describe Traini as a breakthrough example of AI in vertical applications—where technology, empathy, and consumer experience converge.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251229406590/en/\nContacts\ntrainipet@gmail.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Will AMD Be a Must-Own AI Stock in 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points AMD is starting to make a comeback in the AI revolution.\nAMD's management believes it can deliver 60% data center growth through 2030.\nThe stock has a premium price tag over its chief rival.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nAMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has spent most of the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout in second place to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . This has caused AMD's stock to dramatically underperform Nvidia since 2023, with AMD rising aboiut 230% while Nvidia is up around 1,160%. However, AMD flipped the script in 2025, as it outperformed Nvidia stock significantly. AMD is up nearly 80% while Nvidia rose around 35%.\nThat's strong performance from both stocks, but AMD's 2025 comeback made it a must-own stock this year. The question is, will AMD be a must-own stock in 2026? Let's find out.\nAMD's comeback is real Nvidia was, and still is, the preferred graphics processing unit (GPU) vendor for the AI hyperscalers. Its GPUs and technology stack truly lead the industry, with AMD serving as a viable alternative. However, AMD has started to close the gap, particularly with controlling software.\nNvidia's CUDA software was one of the major differentiators between the two offerings, as AMD's wasn't nearly as good. However, thanks to various acquisitions and partnerships, AMD's ROCm software has dramatically improved. In fact, AMD reported that downloads for ROCm software increased 10 times year over year as of November 2025. This shows AMD is gaining ground, and there's another important consideration as well.\n\nDuring Nvidia's Q3 FY 2026 results, its CEO, Jensen Huang, noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. This is a huge deal, as its cloud clients aren't going to sit around idle while Nvidia fulfills demand. Instead, they're going to go looking for alternative computing providers, and AMD is near the top of the list. This could allow AMD to build a strong position in the computing hardware industry. If AI clients find out that AMD's hardware offers similar performance at a much lower price point, you could see more clients begin to use AMD's hardware stack instead of Nvidia's. This would be a huge shift for AMD, making it one of the best AI stocks to own in 2026 and beyond.\nAMD's internal projections reflect this, as management believes the data center division can achieve a 60% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030. In Q3, its data center growth rate was a mere 22%. This is a lofty goal AMD set for itself, but if it can achieve it, AMD will become a top artificial intelligence stock to own for the next few years.\n\nStory Continues\nCompanywide, AMD expects its CAGR to come in around 35%, because its consumer hardware and embedded processor divisions are only expected to grow at around a 10% CAGR over the next five years. Still, a 35% growth rate is nothing to be disappointed with, and if AMD's growth starts to accelerate in 2026, the stock could go on an incredible run. But there's one factor holding it back.\n\nSome of AMD's comeback is already priced in The market is well aware of the situation laid out above, which is why AMD's stock has done so well in 2025. Part of that success is already priced into its stock, as it trades for a significant premium over rival Nvidia when next year's earnings are used as the forward earnings valuation metric.\nInvestors must pay nearly 50% more to own AMD's stock versus Nvidia's. That's a hefty premium to place on a company that hasn't started its comeback yet; it's only talked about it. That's concerning to me, as I want to see some progress before I'm willing to say that AMD is the better stock to own for 2026. However, I still think that AMD will be successful, but just maybe not as successful as Nvidia will be in 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

What should they be doing right now with these gains?\n00:14 George\nGood morning, Brian. Can you imagine being a short seller in this market and trying to bet against the the Mag 7 or the AI trade or anything. I mean, you get carried out. Short selling's been like the worst uh possible thesis on the market you could have the last 15 years other than maybe going long oil and gas stocks. So I I I would not bet against any of any of these complexes, any of these movements. You want to talk about earnings growth, this market's got it. A lot of the other developed countries really don't. So betting against the US has been a fool's game and I'm certainly not going to be doing it in 2026. I'm going not I'm be going to not try to time the market. I'm going to try to stay in there, stay positions as is and just trim and reallocate as as wisdom would would dictate.\n01:05 Brian\nGeorge, I just had a a guest on uh I'm doing double duty here.

What excites you more and why?\n01:22 George\nYeah, I don't really like any of those the best. I think healthcare's seen a significant rally in the closing parts of 2025. If you look at Johnson and Johnson, which basically just lagged in the 140s to 170s, uh kind of era era for a long time and now it's well over 200. You've already seen somewhat of a healthcare rally. If I was going to move chips around the table, I would stay focused on small caps and international. And believe it or not, even though I just ridiculed them, I'd I'd look at oil and gas stocks. They're incredibly cheap, they're incredibly out of favor and the risk reward of that is is pretty compelling from a one to two-year perspective in my view.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Nvidia Is Hands-Down a Better Stock to Buy Than Palantir for 2026\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:04 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia and Palantir have similar growth stories.\nNvidia's valuation is much more attractive than Palantir's.\nOverall, Nvidia appears to offer a better risk-reward proposition than Palantir.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is on track to deliver another sizzling performance in 2025. The chipmaker's gain, though, won't come anywhere close to matching that of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) . Unless Palantir's stock implodes in the final trading days of the year, it should finish 2025 up more than 150%.\nDoes Palantir's momentum make it the more attractive choice going into the new year? I don't think so. Instead, I believe that Nvidia is the hands-down better stock to buy than Palantir for 2026.\nTwo similar growth stories Don't get me wrong: Palantir has an impressive growth story. In the third quarter of 2025, the software company reported that its total revenue increased 63% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter to $1.18 billion.\nAs it has in the past, Palantir continues to generate the majority of its revenue in the U.S. Over half of its U.S. revenue stems from contracts with the federal government. However, that might not be the case for much longer. The company's U.S. commercial revenue is growing at a much faster pace than its government revenue.\n\nNvidia's growth is remarkably similar to that of Palantir. The GPU maker reported Q3 revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter.\nWhich company has the stronger momentum as 2025 draws to a close? I'd give the nod to Nvidia, based on the revenue guidance from both companies. While Palantir forecasts quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 12.5% in Q4, Nvidia projects quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 14%.\nBoth artificial intelligence (AI) leaders also have CEOs who hype their growth stories. Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in his company's Q3 update, \"Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.\" That seemed downright modest, though, compared to Palantir founder and CEO Alex Karp's proclamation that his company delivered an \"unworldly growth rate\" in the third quarter.\n\nTwo dissimilar valuations I don't think that Nvidia's relatively small momentum advantage as 2025 draws to a close makes it a hands-down better stock to buy than Palantir in the new year. However, I believe that Nvidia's valuation does.\nGranted, Nvidia doesn't seem to be cheap at first glance. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio is roughly 24.8. It's essential to factor in the company's growth prospects over the next few years, though. Nvidia's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, based on analysts' five-year growth projections, is only 0.72, according to Yahoo! Finance. Any PEG multiple below 1.0 is typically considered an attractive valuation.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other hand, Palantir's valuation looks downright scary. The AI and data analytics software stock trades at 192.3 times forward earnings. Yes, Palantir's outstanding growth helps make its valuation somewhat more palatable. However, the stock's PEG ratio remains over 3.0, indicating that it appears to be significantly more expensive than Nvidia, even with growth projections taken into account.\n\nKarp tried to shrug off his company's sky-high valuation in his Q3 letter to Palantir shareholders, stating, \"It has indeed been difficult for outsiders to appraise our business, either its significance in shaping our current geopolitics or its value in the vulgar, financial sense.\" The problem, as I see it, with his perspective, though, is that valuing stocks must always be done using financials, whether one views doing so as vulgar or not.\nRisk vs. reward Ultimately, investing comes down to trading risk in exchange for potential rewards. Which of these two stocks provides the better risk-reward proposition? I think the answer is clearly Nvidia.\nAlthough Palantir's revenue growth is impressive (and perhaps even \"unworldly,\" as Karp argues), it's essentially on par with that of Nvidia. However, Nvidia's stock trades at a much lower valuation. That's true whether we incorporate growth projections for one year or five years from now.\n\nTo be sure, Nvidia faces some risks. The AI infrastructure boom could slow down. Customers could increasingly turn to chips from rivals. But these are \"maybe\" kind of risks. Palantir's valuation risk isn't so speculative.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Nvidia got there first. Who will hit a $5 trillion market cap next?\n\nCatherine Baab\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIt was a landmark year for corporate valuations, especially among the world’s most famous tech companies.\nMarket cap milestones once considered mythical — $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $3 trillion, etc. — are now routine financial news. On one side, they’ve been driven by explosive growth in consumer tech, cloud computing, and AI; on the other, by simply massive inflows of capital from ETFs, money managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and the global investor class.\n\nOf course, the sheer most eye-catching headline has already been written. In October 2025, Nvidia became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation , propelled by its central role in powering AI workloads and tremendous demand for its chips. The achievement cements Nvidia’s role as a heavyweight of the current mega-cap era — a status that just a few years ago seemed out of reach for any hardware business.\nBefore we look at which company is likely to be the next in the race to the $5 trillion mark, let’s review who reached the $4 trillion threshold in 2025.\nThe $4 trillion club Microsoft passed the $4 trillion threshold in the middle of the year, powered by accelerating cloud and AI services growth and strong enterprise demand for its AI-integrated software platforms . Apple also rose above $4 trillion late in the year — the third company in history to do so — on the back of device sales and services revenue. Late in the year, Google parent Alphabet briefly brushed the $4 trillion market cap mark, too.\n\nConsidered together with Nvidia, these four companies represent the frontier of size in the global stock market, occupying a tremendous chunk of market-cap-weighted indices.\nWhat about the rest of the Magnificent Seven ? Amazon, smaller than the very largest four, derives much of its $2.4 trillion valuation from Amazon Web Services and long-term bets in logistics and AI-driven commerce. But the stock lagged behind its Big Tech peers in 2025, moving sideways so that it’s set to finish the year with low single-digit gains.\nMeanwhile, even sitting below the $2 trillion mark, Tesla, Meta, and the semiconductor and hardware maker Broadcom remain firmly in the upper tier of global market caps.\nWho will be the next to $5 trillion? It may seem tautological, but the tech companies that have recently crossed into or flirted with a $4 trillion market cap are the most obvious candidates to hit the $5 trillion mark.\nThus, Microsoft — with its vast cloud business, deep enterprise software penetration, and increasing AI integration — may be the most obvious of any contender. Continued multiple expansion alongside consistent earnings growth are likely to steadily push the stock higher. Ditto Apple. Its ecosystem generates enormous recurring revenue from services and hardware, and its ventures into AI-enhanced products could, at least in theory, prove to be future growth catalysts. If innovation accelerates in ways that reenergize — or simply meet? — investor expectations , hitting $5 trillion is within the realm of possibility.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's a similar story with Alphabet’s strength in AI, plus its core business in search, YouTube, Android, and everything cloud. Few companies on earth boast such broad and defensible franchises. And as the investor story catches up , the company could break out to emerge as an even bigger winner.\nWhy scale begets scale In the past, investor logic — invoking “ trees don’t grow to the sky ” and a loose reading of the law of large numbers — cast mega-caps as destined for slower growth. But the 2010s and 2020s turned that longstanding wisdom on its head, and a fresh reversal doesn’t look likely.\nIt’s simple. As companies reach multi-trillion-dollar valuations, index weight, passive ownership, and benchmark dominance don’t just reflect success — they arguably help to perpetuate it, making further gains more likely. Earnings still matter, yet they’re also amplified by the structure of contemporary capital markets.\nThe logic may feel circular, but new $5 trillion behemoths rarely emerge out of nowhere. The next entrant is far more likely to come from the ranks of the giants than from anywhere else.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Since late October, they have lost 45% amidst chatter in the market about sluggishness in data center buildout and an AI bubble. CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)’s shares have seen analyst action as well in December. For instance, Citi resumed coverage with a Buy rating but cut the share price target to $135 from $192 on December 19th. Citi’s coverage followed Mizuho’s, which cut CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)’s share price target to $92 from $120 on December 16th and kept a Neutral rating.

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Will Outperform Nvidia in 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 4:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points This AI company is making popular AI chips and developing a leading large language model.\nIt should see strong sales growth across its hardware business while more developers license its model.\nThe stock trades for a value relative to Nvidia, and strong growth across multiple businesses could send shares higher in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nNvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks in the current bull market. The stock has increased by more than 1,000% since the release of ChatGPT , which kicked off the artificial intelligence (AI) spending spree among big tech stocks. Nvidia has been a huge beneficiary of the growing spend on artificial intelligence infrastructure, as its GPUs are best in class for training large language models .\nDespite its status as the largest company in the world with a market cap of around $4.5 trillion, analysts think Nvidia could keep climbing higher in 2026. The median price target on the stock is $250, about 30% higher than the stock price as of this writing. That would make it a $6 trillion company.\nBut another AI leader looks poised to outperform the chipmaker in 2026 thanks to its momentum across hardware, software, and real-world applications of AI. Here's why I expect Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to outperform Nvidia next year.\nChallenging the AI leaders Alphabet has made tremendous progress in artificial intelligence in 2025, and that should show up in continued financial strength in 2026.\nIts Google Cloud division saw revenue growth accelerate to 34% last quarter while its operating margin continued to expand, reaching 24%. Those trends should continue in 2026, as management reported a backlog of $155 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 46% year over year.\n\nAlphabet is seeing notably strong demand for its custom-built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). The AI accelerator chips are a more cost-efficient alternative to Nvidia GPUs for AI training and inference. Anthropic plans to use TPUs for some of its workload starting in 2026, and Alphabet is reportedly in discussions with Meta Platforms to use the chips and port popular AI framework PyTorch to the hardware. The relative performance of TPUs to Nvidia's GPUs and other custom AI accelerators should continue to fuel growth for Google Cloud in 2026 with significant margin improvements.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet also saw strong relative performance for its large language models. Gemini 3.0, released in November, scored highly on most benchmark tests, outperforming top models from both Anthropic and OpenAI at the time. The release spurred OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to declare \"code red,\" as the model performed better than GPT 5.1 and pushed more consumers to download Google's Gemini app, which had 650 million monthly active users as of November.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet could have a big customer for its LLM next year as well, as Apple is reportedly going to use Gemini for some of its new AI-powered Siri features starting next spring. The iPhone maker will pay $1 billion per year to license the model. Apple will run the model on its own servers, so it would be practically all profit for Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet benefits from using its own AI innovations Alphabet isn't just out-innovating the biggest competitors in the field; it's also able to use those innovations in its own business.\nAs a large language model developer, it's able to take advantage of its massive cloud computing business and TPU development. But Alphabet's also using that large language model to improve its core search engine, which remains a cash cow for the business. It's also continuing to refine various machine learning algorithms, improving its advertisement placement and YouTube engagement.\n\nIn search, features such as AI Overviews and AI Mode have increased the types and number of search queries users make. And with Google monetizing those searches at roughly the same rate as those without AI-powered results, it's been a net positive for revenue. Over the last two years, the company has drastically cut the cost of generating AI Overviews, improving profitability. Overall, Google Search revenue accelerated through the first three quarters of 2025, up 15% in the third quarter.\nYouTube, likewise, saw revenue growth accelerate, climbing 15% in the most recent quarter. AI features, such as tools that help edit videos and create thumbnails, as well as identify shoppable products in videos, have helped improve engagement and monetization.\n\nAlphabet's also seeing progress with Waymo, its self-driving car business, which is part of its Other Bets segment. The robotaxi service completed 14 million trips in 2025, more than triple the number of trips completed in the previous year. Management says it's on track to complete 1 million rides per week by the end of 2026 as it expands to 20 new cities. The business could be a key source of revenue growth as it scales next year.\nThe value is there With growth across hardware, software, and its core businesses, Alphabet presents a diversified growth stock that trades at a good value. Investors can currently pick up shares for less than 30 times forward earnings expectations. By comparison, you'll pay over 40 times earnings for Nvidia shares.\n\nAlphabet should experience strong earnings growth as the cloud computing business scales and operating margin expands. It already generates tens of billions in cash every year, providing room to increase its share repurchase program, further boosting earnings per share. As a result, paying less than 30 times earnings could prove a bargain.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia may struggle to build on its gains in 2026, especially as Google's TPUs, competing GPUs, and other companies' custom AI accelerators make progress in eating into its market share. At its current price, it'll have to outperform already high expectations to produce returns like the last few years.

      "Content": "4 Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 2:43 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nIREN\n\nCRDO\n\nNVDA\n\nBTC-USD\n\nKey Points Palantir and Nvidia are large companies at the forefront of the AI revolution.\nIren Limited is a Bitcoin miner, but it just inked a huge deal with Microsoft to supply cloud computing capacity.\nCredo Technology's wiring solutions may not be sexy, but they help data centers function better.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nOne of the greatest appeals of cryptocurrencies is their massive potential. That market can be very challenging, and investors are often swept away by some of the sudden, huge gains they read about each year. There are dozens of cryptocurrencies with more than a 100% gain in the last seven days.\nHowever, chasing these kinds of gains can be frustrating, as for every success story, there are digital coins that fade away just as quickly, leaving investors with a proverbial pile of dust. It's impossible to predict which cryptocurrencies will be the next big winners and which will vanish into obscurity.\nHowever, you don't need to chase crypto to build wealth. You can find some great companies in the stock market that will give you outsize gains and make crypto investors green with envy. Tech stocks have been some of the best investments you can make in the last year, and I'm expecting that to continue in 2026.\nIf you want explosive growth potential, I'd wager that these four tech stocks are great possibilities -- and all of them have a compelling growth story that makes them superior to cryptocurrencies.\n1. Palantir Technologies It's true that Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) isn't a perfect company. Its valuation is a major concern, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 267 and a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 104 at the time of this writing. Those numbers indicate that for a typical company, these shares are extraordinarily expensive and the stock could be ripe for a correction.\n\nBut Palantir isn't a typical company. The data analytics company is growing fast thanks to its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which allows users to access Palantir's powerful network with minimal training. Palantir saw 63% revenue growth in the third quarter as it closed 204 deals valued at more than $1 million each. It's in high demand among both military and commercial clients.\nPalantir stock is up 155% so far this year -- the third-best performance in the Nasdaq-100 -- and that follows gains of 167% in 2023 and 340% in 2024.\nI would be shocked if Palantir stock doesn't grow another 100% or more in 2026.\n2. Nvidia Semiconductor maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been slowing down as of late -- but who can really expect the stock price to maintain its torrid pace? Nvidia shares rose 819% from 2023 to 2024, and followed that up with a 37% gain in 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are bundled by the thousands in data centers to train and run high-level artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning programs. Nvidia holds a substantial lead in the data center chip market, with estimates ranging from 86% to 92% of its market share. Its huge advantage stems from chip superiority as well as its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel computing architecture that allows developers to write and develop code on Nvidia GPUs.\n\nNvidia reported in its last quarter that it sold out of data center GPUs, and its Blackwell line is flying off the proverbial shelves. When Nvidia rolls out its next-generation architecture Rubin line in 2026, I'm expecting equally strong demand.\n3. Iren Limited We're seeing incredible growth in data centers, and that's going to continue through 2026 and beyond. As more companies develop AI products to help manage their businesses or draw in new customers, there's an increasing demand for data centers to cluster GPUs and run AI programs. Researchers at BloombergNEF estimate that at least 150 data center projects have been announced in the U.S. over the last year, and data center power demand in the U.S. is expected to grow from 25 gigawatts to 106 gigawatts by 2035.\n\nIren Limited (NASDAQ: IREN) has six data centers in Texas and Canada with 2.9 GW of capacity. And it has a new $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft to provide cloud computing capacity using Nvidia GPUs.\nBuilding data centers is really expensive, but Iren has an advantage because it makes most of its money from Bitcoin mining, which allows it to operate at a profit while other data center companies are operating in the red. It made $232.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 from Bitcoin mining, accounting for nearly all of its $240.3 million of total revenue.\nIren gives you the advantage of Bitcoin -- the most stable cryptocurrency -- without holding the coins yourself. And you also get to invest in a tech stock that has its fingers in data center expansion.\n\n4. Credo Technology This one may sound a little out of left field, as Credo Technology (NASDAQ: CRDO) is down 21% since Dec. 22. But I'm confident that this is just temporary weakness, as Credo is an indispensable company for the data center expansion already discussed.\nCredo makes the wiring that links GPUs together in data centers. Instead of traditional wiring, Credo's active electrical cables (AECs) include signal processors that help the data move faster and more efficiently. Management says they are 1,000 times more reliable and consume half the power as optical wiring.\n\nCredo's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending Nov. 1, 2025) was $268 million, up 272% from a year ago. Income of $82.6 million resulted in earnings of $0.44 per share.\nDespite the recent pullback, Credo stock is up 121% this year and has a strong runway ahead of it.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?

      "Content": "11 big trades of 2025: Bubbles, cockroaches, and a 367% jump\n\nBloomberg News\nUpdated Sun, December 28, 2025 at 2:08 PM PST 16 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nGC=F\n\n^IXIC\n\n(Bloomberg) — It was another year of high-conviction bets — and fast reversals.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nFrom bond desks in Tokyo and credit committees in New York to currency traders in Istanbul, markets delivered both windfalls and whiplash. Gold hit records. Staid mortgage behemoths gyrated like meme stocks. A textbook carry trade blew up in a flash.\n\nInvestors bet big on shifting politics, bloated balance sheets and fragile narratives, fueling outsized stock rallies, crowded yield trades, and crypto strategies built on leverage, hope, and not much else. Donald Trump’s White House return quickly sank — and then revived — financial markets across the world, lit a fire under European defense stocks, and emboldened speculators fanning mania after mania. Some positions paid off spectacularly. Others misfired when momentum reversed, financing dried up or leverage cut the wrong way.\nAs the year draws to a close, Bloomberg highlights some of the most eye-catching wagers of 2025 — the wins, the wipeouts and the positions that defined the era. Many of those bets leave investors fretting over all-too-familiar fault lines as they prepare for 2026: shaky companies, stretched valuations, and trend-chasing trades that work, until they don’t.\n\nCrypto: Trumped It looked like one of crypto’s more compelling momentum bets: load up on anything and everything tied to the Trump brand. During his presidential campaign and after he took office, Trump went all-in on digital assets — pushing sweeping reforms and installing industry allies across powerful agencies. His family leaned in, championing coins and crypto firms that traders treated as political rocket fuel.\n\nThe franchise came together fast. Hours before the inauguration, Trump launched a memecoin and promoted it on social media. First Lady Melania Trump soon followed with her own token. Later in the year, Trump family–affiliated World Liberty Financial made its WLFI token tradable and available to retail investors. A set of Trump-adjacent trades followed. Eric Trump co-founded American Bitcoin, a publicly traded miner that went public via a merger in September.\nEach debut sparked a rally. Each proved ephemeral. As of Dec. 23, Trump’s memecoin was floundering, off more than 80% from its January high. Melania’s was down nearly 99%, according to CoinGecko. American Bitcoin had sunk about 80% from its September peak.\nPolitics gave the trades a push. The laws of speculation pulled them back down. Even with a friend in the White House, these trades couldn’t escape crypto’s core pattern: prices rise, leverage floods in, and liquidity dries up. Bitcoin, still the bellwether, is on track for an annual loss after slumping from its October peak. For Trump-linked assets, politics offered momentum, but no protection.\n\nStory Continues\nAI Trade: The Next Big Short? The trade was revealed in a routine filing, yet its impact was anything but routine. Scion Asset Management disclosed on Nov. 3 that it held protective put options in Nvidia Corp. ( NVDA ) and Palantir Technologies Inc. ( PLTR ) — stocks at the center of the artificial intelligence trade that’s powered the market’s rally for three years. While not a whale-sized hedge fund, Scion commands attention due to the person who runs it: Michael Burry, who earned fame as a market prophet in book and movie about the mortgage bubble that led to the 2008 crisis.\n\nThe strike prices were startling: Nvidia’s was 47% below where the stock had just closed, while Palantir’s was 76% below. But some mystery lingered: Due to limited reporting requirements, it was unclear if the puts — contracts that give an investor the right to sell a stock at a certain price by a certain date — were part of a more complicated trade. And the filing offered just a snapshot of Scion’s books on Sept. 30, Yet skepticism about the lofty valuations and massive spending plans of major AI players had been building like a pile of dry kindling. Burry’s disclosure landed like a freshly struck match.\nNvidia, the largest stock in the world, tumbled in reaction, as did Palantir, though they later regained ground. The Nasdaq also dipped.\nIt’s impossible to know exactly how much Burry made. One bread crumb he left was a post on X saying he paid $1.84 for the Palantir puts; those options went on to gain as much as 101% in less than three weeks. The filing crystallized doubts simmering beneath a market dominated by a narrow group of AI-linked stocks, heavy passive inflows and subdued volatility. Whether the trade proves prescient or premature, it underscored how quickly even the most dominant market narratives can turn once belief begins to crack.\n\nDefense Stocks: New World Order A geopolitical shift has led to huge gains in a sector once deemed toxic by asset managers: European defense. Trump’s plans to take a step back from funding Ukraine’s military sent European governments into a spending spree, giving a huge lift to shares of regional defense firms — from the roughly 150% year-to-date rally in Germany’s Rheinmetall AG as of Dec. 23, to Italy’s Leonardo SpA more than 90% ascent during the period.\nMoney managers who once saw the sector as too controversial to touch amid environmental, social and governance concerns changed their tune and a number of funds even redefined their mandates.\n“We had taken defense out of our ESG funds until the beginning of this year,” said Pierre Alexis Dumont, chief investment officer at Sycomore Asset Management. “There was a change of paradigm, and when there is a change of paradigm, one has to be responsible and also defend one’s values. So we’re focusing on defensive weapons.”\n\nFrom goggle makers to chemicals producers, and even a printing company, stocks were snapped up in a mad rush. A Bloomberg basket of European defense stocks was up more than 70% for the year as of Dec. 23. The boom spilled into credit markets as well, with firms only tangentially linked to defense attracting hordes of prospective lenders. Banks even started selling “European Defence Bonds,” modeled on green bonds except in this case ringfenced for borrowers like weapons manufacturers. It marked a repricing of defense as a public good rather than a reputational liability — and a reminder that when geopolitics shifts, capital tends to follow faster than ideology.\nDebasement Trade: Fact or Fiction? Heavy debt loads in major economies such as the US, France and Japan — and a lack of political appetite to confront them — pushed some investors in 2025 to tout gold and alternative assets like crypto, while cooling enthusiasm for government bonds and the US dollar. The idea gained traction under a bearish label: the “debasement trade,” a nod to historic episodes when rulers such as Nero diluted the value of money to cope with fiscal strain.\nThe narrative reached a crescendo in October, when concerns over the US fiscal outlook collided with the longest government shutdown on record. Investors searched for shelter beyond the dollar. That month, gold and Bitcoin both rose to records — a rare moment for assets often cast as rivals.\nAs a story, debasement offered a clean explanation for a messy macro backdrop. As a trade, it proved more complicated. Bitcoin has since slumped amid a broader retreat in cryptocurrencies. The dollar stabilized somewhat. Treasuries, far from collapsing, are on track for their best year since 2020 — a reminder that fears of fiscal erosion can coexist with powerful demand for safe assets, particularly when growth slows and policy rates peak.\n\nElsewhere, price action told a different story. Swings in metals from copper to aluminum, and even silver, were driven at least as much by Donald Trump’s tariff policies and macro forces as by concerns about currency debasement, blurring the line between inflation hedging and old-fashioned supply shocks. Gold, meanwhile, has kept powering ahead, reaching new all-time highs. In that corner of the market, the debasement trade endured — less as a sweeping judgment on fiat, more as a focused bet on rates, policy and protection.\nKorean Stocks: K-Pop Move over, K-drama. When it comes to plot twists and thrills, it’s hard to beat this year’s action in South Korea’s stock market. Fueled by President Lee Jae Myung’s efforts to boost the country’s capital markets, the benchmark equity index rocketed more than 70% in 2025 through Dec. 22, headed toward his aspirational goal of 5000 and handily topping the charts among major stock gauges worldwide.\n\nIt’s rare to see a political leader publicly set an index level as a goal, and Lee’s “Kospi 5000” campaign drew little attention when it was first announced. Now, more and more Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) and Citigroup Inc. ( C ) think it’s achievable in 2026, helped in part by the global AI boom, which has increased demand for South Korean stocks as Asia’s go-to artificial intelligence trade.\nThere is one notable absence from the Kospi’s world-beating rally: local retail investors. While Lee often reminds voters that he was once a retail investor himself before entering public office, his reform agenda has yet to persuade domestic investors that the market is a durable buy-and-hold proposition. Even as foreign money has poured into Korean equities, local mom-and-pop investors have been net sellers, channeling a record $33 billion into US stocks and chasing higher-risk bets ranging from crypto to leveraged exchange-traded funds overseas.\n\nOne side effect has been pressure on the currency. As capital flowed outward, the won weakened, a reminder that even blockbuster equity rallies can mask lingering skepticism at home.\nBitcoin Showdown: Chanos v Saylor There are two sides to every story. In the case of short-seller Jim Chanos’s arbitrage play involving Bitcoin hoarder Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc., there were also two big personalities, and a trade that was fast becoming a referendum on crypto-era capitalism.\nIn early 2025, as Bitcoin soared and Strategy’s shares went through the roof, Chanos saw an opportunity. The rally in Strategy had stretched the premium the company’s shares enjoyed relative to its Bitcoin holdings, something the legendary investor saw as unsustainable. So he decided to short Strategy and go long Bitcoin, announcing the move in May when the premium was still wide.\n\nChanos and Saylor started publicly trading barbs. “I don’t think he understands what our business model is,” Saylor told Bloomberg TV in June about Chanos, who in turn, called Saylor’s explanations “complete financial gibberish” in an X post.\nStrategy’s shares hit a record in July, marking a 57% year-to-date gain, but as the number of so-called digital asset treasury firms exploded and crypto token prices fell from their highs, Strategy shares — and those of its copycats — began to suffer and the company’s premium to Bitcoin shrank. Chanos’s wager was paying off.\nFrom the time Chanos made his short call on Strategy public through Nov. 7, the date he said he exited from the position, Strategy shares dropped 42%. Beyond the P&L, it illustrated a recurring crypto boom-and-bust pattern: balance sheets inflated by confidence, and confidence sustained by rising prices and financial engineering. It works until belief falters — at which point the premium stops being a feature and starts being the problem.\n\nJapanese Bonds: Widowmaker to Rainmaker If there was one bet that repeatedly burned macro investors in the past few decades, it’s the infamous “widowmaker” wager against Japanese bonds. The reasoning behind the trade always seemed simple. Japan carried a vast public debt, and so the thinking was that interest rates just had to rise sooner or later to lure in enough buyers. Investors, therefore, borrowed bonds and sold them, expecting prices to fall once reality asserted itself. For years, however, that logic proved premature and expensive, as the central bank’s loose policies kept borrowing costs low and punished anyone who tried to rush the outcome. No longer.\n\nIn 2025, the widowmaker turned rainmaker as yields on benchmark government bonds surged across the board, making the $7.4 trillion Japan debt market a short-seller’s dream. The triggers spanned everything from interest rate hikes to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi unleashing the country’s biggest burst of spending since pandemic restrictions eased. Yields on benchmark 10-year JGBs soared past 2% to reach levels not seen in decades, while those on 30-year paper advanced more than a full percentage point to an all-time high. A Bloomberg gauge of Japanese government bond returns fell more than 6% this year through Dec. 23, the worst-performing major market in the world.\nFund managers from Schroders to Jupiter Asset Management to RBC BlueBay Asset Management discussed selling JGBs in some form during the year and investors and strategists are betting the trade has room to run, as benchmark policy rates edge higher. On top of that, the Bank of Japan is trimming its bond purchases, pressuring yields. And with the nation boasting the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio in the developed world by a wide margin, bearishness to JGBs is likely to persist.\n\nCredit Scraps: Playing Hardball Pays Some of 2025’s richest credit payoffs didn’t come from turnaround bets, but from turning on fellow investors. The dynamic, known as “creditor-on-creditor violence,” paid off big for funds like Pacific Investment Management Co. and King Street Capital Management, who waged a calculated campaign around KKR-backed Envision Healthcare.\n\nWhen Envision, a hospital staffing company, ran aground after the Covid-19 pandemic, it needed a loan from new investors. But raising new debt meant pledging assets already spoken for. While many debt holders formed a group to oppose the new financing, Pimco, King Street and Partners Group broke ranks. Their support enabled a vote to allow the collateral — a stake in Envision’s valuable ambulatory-surgery business Amsurg — to be released by the old lenders and used to back the new debt.\nThe funds became holders of Amsurg-backed debt that eventually converted into Amsurg equity. Then Amsurg sold to Ascension Health this year for $4 billion. The funds who spurned their peers generated returns of around 90%, by one measure, demonstrating the payoff from waging such internecine battles. The lesson: in today’s credit markets, governed by loose documentation and fragmented creditor groups, cooperation is optional. Being right is not always enough. The bigger risk is being outflanked.\n\nFannie-Freddie: Revenge of the 'Toxic Twins' Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance giants that have been under Washington’s control since the financial crisis, have long been the subject of speculation over when and how they would be released from the government’s grip. Boosters such as hedge fund manager Bill Ackman loaded up on the two in the hopes of scoring a windfall on any privatization plan, but the shares languished for years in over-the-counter trading as the status quo prevailed.\n\nThen came Donald Trump’s re-election, which catapulted the stocks into a meme-like zeal on optimism the new administration would take steps to free up the companies. In 2025, the excitement ratcheted up even more: The shares soared 367% from the start of the year to their high in September and remain big winners for 2025.\nDriving the momentum to its peak this year was word in August that the administration was contemplating an IPO that could value the enterprises at around $500 billion or more, involving selling 5% to 15% of their stock to raise about $30 billion. While the shares have wavered from their September high amid skepticism about when, and whether, an IPO will actually materialize, many remain confident in the story.\n\nAckman in November unveiled a proposal he pitched to the White House, which calls for relisting Fannie and Freddie on the New York Stock Exchange, writing down the Treasury’s senior-preferred stake and exercising the government’s option to acquire nearly 80% of the common stock. Even Michael Burry joined the party, announcing a bullish position in early December and musing in a 6,000-word blog post that the companies which once needed the government to save them from insolvency may be “toxic twins no more.”\nTurkey Carry Trade: Cooked The Turkish carry trade was a consensus favorite for emerging-market investors after a stellar 2024. With local bond yields above 40% and a central bank backing a stable dollar peg, traders piled in — borrowing cheaply abroad to buy high-yield Turkish assets. That drew billions from firms like Deutsche Bank, Millennium Partners and Gramercy — some of them on the ground in Turkey on March 19, the day the trade blew up in minutes.\n\nIt was on that morning that Turkish police raided the home of Istanbul’s popular opposition mayor and took him into custody, sparking protests — and a frenzied selloff in the lira that the central bank was unable to contain. “People got caught very much by surprise and won’t go back in a hurry,” Kit Juckes, head of FX strategy at Societe Generale SA in Paris, said at the time.\nBy the end of the day, outflows from Turkish lira-denominated assets were estimated at around $10 billion, and the market never really recovered. As of Dec. 23, the lira was some 17% weaker against the dollar for the year, one of the world’s worst performers. The episode served as a reminder that high interest rates can reward risk-takers, but they offer no protection against sudden political shocks.\n\nDebt Markets: Cockroach Alert Credit markets in 2025 were unsettled not by a single spectacular collapse, but by a series of smaller ones that exposed uncomfortable habits. Companies once considered routine borrowers ran into trouble, leaving lenders nursing steep losses.\nSaks Global restructured $2.2 billion in bonds after making only a single interest payment, and the restructured debt is itself now trading at less than 60 cents on the dollar. New Fortress Energy’s newly-exchanged bonds lost more than half their value in the span of a year. The bankruptcies of Tricolor and then First Brands wiped out billions in debt holdings in a matter of weeks. In some cases, sophisticated fraud was at the root of the collapse. In others, rosy projections failed to materialize. In every case, investors were left to answer for how they justified taking large credit gambles on companies with little to no proof they’d be able to repay the debt.\nYears of low defaults and loose money eroded standards, from lender protections to basic underwriting. Lenders to both First Brands and Tricolor had failed to discover the borrowers were allegedly double-pledging assets and co-mingling collateral that backed various loans.\nThose lenders included JPMorgan, whose chief executive Jamie Dimon put the market on alert in October when he colorfully warned of more trouble to come, saying, “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” A theme for 2026.\n—With assistance from Benjamin Harvey, Kerim Karakaya, Youkyung Lee, Cormac Mullen, Michael P.

      "Content": "Nvidia's \"Aqui-Hire\" of Groq Eliminates a Potential Competitor and Marks Its Entrance Into the Non-GPU, AI Inference Chip Space\n\nBeth McKenna, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 12:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia is entering into a non-exclusive licensing agreement for Groq’s AI inference technology.\nNvidia's reportedly paying $20 billion for this deal, about three times Groq's most recent valuation.\nGroq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross -- who will join Nvidia along with other Groq personnel -- is widely considered the creator of Google’s TPU.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOn Friday, artificial intelligence (AI) chip start-up Groq announced via a very brief press release that it \"has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) for Groq's inference technology.\"\nThe deal also includes Jonathan Ross, Groq's founder and CEO, Sunny Madra, Groq's president, and other members of the Groq team joining Nvidia to \"help advance and scale the licensed technology.\"\nThis was a smart move by Nvidia, in my view. Nvidia has tons of cash, and it makes sense to use it to accomplish two goals at once: eliminate a potential competitor and obtain a new chip technology to offer its customers.\nHere's what investors should know.\nAs close to an acquisition as it gets That Nvidia is not only entering into a non-exclusive license with Groq, but also hiring its founder-CEO, president, and reportedly key engineering talent, makes this deal an \"acqui-hire\" and as close to a full-fledged acquisition as possible.\nGranted, Groq will reportedly continue to operate, with its CFO taking over the CEO position, and operate its GroqCloud. However, with the founder -- who is the mastermind behind the company's tech -- leaving, it appears that all advancements in Groq's tech will now be made under Nvidia.\n\nNo doubt, Nvidia structured the deal to avoid potential regulatory scrutiny. The company already dominates the AI chip space, so any acquisition that could potentially increase its current or future market share further would likely garner a very close look from regulators.\nNvidia-Groq deal size The deal's size wasn't disclosed by the companies involved, but one major financial outlet has reported it at $20 billion, which would be Nvidia's largest deal to date, by far. Its prior largest deal was its $6.9 billion acquisition of high-performance networking specialist Mellanox Technologies in 2020. That acquisition proved to be extremely successful, as Nvidia's networking business is booming.\nIf the $20 billion is accurate, it represents a huge premium over Groq's most recent valuation. After a $750 million financing round in September, Groq's valuation was $6.9 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia tried to buy leading central processing unit (CPU) chip designer Arm Holdings in 2020, but that massive deal was called off due to significant antitrust concerns from regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nGroq's chip technology Groq's chips are language processing units (LPUs) designed for AI inferencing. Inferencing is the second step in the two-step AI process, following training. Training involves using vast amounts of data to teach an AI model, while inference is the deployment of that model to generate answers to a user's questions, images, and other outputs.\n\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have long dominated the AI training stage. They're also leaders in AI inference, but they face growing competition in this area. Competitors include Advanced Micro Devices ' (AMD) data center GPUs, as well as custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that Broadcom and Marvell Technology are making for big tech company customers. Until now, the big tech companies have just used their custom AI chips internally and, where applicable, also in their cloud computing services.\nHowever, it was recently revealed that social media giant Meta Platforms is considering buying Alphabet 's Google custom AI chip, called a tensor processing unit (TPU), for inferencing purposes in its data centers.\n\nThe big tech companies are exploring alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs for two reasons: to reduce costs and to diversify their supply chains. Relying on just a single supplier for anything can be risky.\nGroq's goal was for its LPUs to be a big player in the AI inference market. The company claims its technology is faster than alternatives for specific inference applications. Its plans included selling its chips for less money than Nvidia GPUs and perhaps other offerings.\nIt makes good sense that Nvidia views Groq's tech as potentially very valuable and evidently viewed the company as a potential, significant future rival. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross is widely considered the creator of Google's TPU. Granted, he didn't create this chip alone, but he was the force behind the effort to develop it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "What’s next for Nvidia stock in 2026\n\nVuk Zdinjak\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 11:50 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nTo understand what is in the cards for Nvidia in 2026, we need to go back and take a look at the most important moves the company made in 2025 and estimate how they will develop in 2026.\nNvidia ( NVDA ) ended the year with a deal that has left many investors and analysts surprised, and even a little bit confused. Contributing to the confusion was the fact that when CNBC broke the news, it reported that Nvidia would acquire Groq for approximately $20 billion, but once the official announcement from Groq came out, it turned out that the deal was a non-exclusive licensing deal and talent grab rather than a company acquisition.\n\nHere are key questions Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya raised about the deal, in a research note shared with TheStreet:\nWhat does the “non-exclusive licensing agreement” referred to by Groq imply?\nCould Nvidia have developed this technology on its own?\nCan Groq cloud, still an independent company, undercut Nvidia’s LPU-based\nservice with lower pricing?\nDespite having these questions and calling the deal surprising, Arya also said the deal is strategic and complementary. He reiterated a buy rating and the price target for Nvidia stock of $275.\nTo understand the Groq deal, we need to delve into what Groq technology is about and what the dominant strategies in the tech industry have morphed into.\nWhat is Groq? Groq’s main business is GroqCloud, an artificial intelligence inference platform. AI inference is the process of generating a response from the AI model that has already been trained.\nGroq offers developers a way to run AI models on the company’s hardware and obtain responses very quickly for a competitive price. The reason a relatively small startup can compete with big players and offer competitive pricing for AI inference is its hardware.\n\nThe company’s inference platform uses application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips, which it calls the Language Processing Unit (LPU), developed and optimized specifically for LLM inference.\nGPUs can be used for many different calculations including gaming, 3D rendering, crypto mining, AI training, and AI inference, but Groq’s LPU chips have only one purpose — AI inference.\nThis means they have razor-sharp focus, and that makes them many times as efficient at that particular task.\nWhat is Nvidia getting from the deal with Groq? When Gemini 3 launched, Google touted that it had been trained 100% on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and of course, it is doing inference on TPUs, too. You may have guessed correctly that TPUs are also ASIC chips.\nFollowing the news about Gemini Nvidia’s post on X ( formerly Twitter ):\n\"We’re delighted by Google’s success — they’ve made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google. NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it’s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions.\"\n\nRelated: Bank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\nThe fact that Nvidia felt it needed to address Gemini in its post showed that the company is worried about the competitive power of well-designed ASIC chips, and now we have proof.\nGroq’s announcement about the deal with Nvidia says: “As part of this agreement, Jonathan Ross, Groq’s founder, Sunny Madra, Groq’s president, and other members of the Groq team will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology.”\nCan you guess what Jonathan Ross’s job was at Google? He was one of the designers of Google’s first generation of TPUs, of course. Nvidia’s decision to license Groq’s LPU tech stack and to “acqui-hire” its talent team is a quiet admission that ASIC chips represent the future of AI.\n\nWhat does the non-exclusive licensing part of the deal with Groq mean for Nvidia? A non-exclusive licensing deal was the only way to avoid government scrutiny. The approach here is a combination of Apple and Meta strategies. Apple manufactures custom ARM chips and has a non-exclusive licensing agreement with ARM.\nBut what makes Apple chips great is the talent that only Apple can attract; so far, competitor ARM chips have been unable to catch up.\n\nNvidia has secured top talent in this transaction by mimicking Meta’s move, which was an investment in Scale AI. The whole deal with Scale AI turned out to be a lot more about getting Alexandr Wang to lead Meta’s Superintelligence unit than about investing in Scale AI.\nThis is the new dominant strategy in the tech space where talent is more valuable than whole companies.\nAssuming that Nvidia's contract with Groq doesn’t have some special quirks, non-exclusive licensing should mean that other companies can license the LPU designs and build similar LPUs. Nvidia is content, as it isn’t getting the talent, and it's betting they won’t be building anything impressive with just the license.\nThe second of Arya’s questions, whether Nvidia could have built LPUs on its own, seems like a superfluous one. Even if the company could have developed such chips (assuming no patent issues), it could not have done that in a desirable timeframe.\n\nThis underscores my thesis that Nvidia started to worry about TPUs a little late.\nWider implications of the Groq-Nvidia licensing deal To answer the third of Arya’s questions, we need to first determine Nvidia’s game plan for LPUs. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wrote the following.\n“We plan to integrate Groq’s low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads.”\n\nHuang has promoted the idea of AI factories for some time, and he appears increasingly focused on it. This new LPU plan has finally made the whole thing click for me, and the sudden shift to inference is extremely interesting and revealing.\nAfter all the hype of chasing AGI or Superintelligence, the market is shifting toward inference. You’d think that as long as we haven’t reached that amazing life-changing technology, the training capabilities would be of paramount importance.\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nThe problem is that LLMs have peaked, and although the shift to inference and “AI factories” is Huang’s stealthy pivot, LPUs are just one part of the puzzle. Nvidia recently announced the Nvidia Nemotron 3 family of open models, data, and libraries. These models are the key component of the latest pivot, which is AI factories and sovereign AI.\n\nData ownership, privacy, and model fine-tuning are some of the reasons any company or organization that can afford to have a sovereign AI would want it. This is why open-source, and at least open-weight, models are the future, just like ASIC chips.\nWe can see a slow, ongoing shift toward this, as hundreds of academic papers presented at NeurIPS, the premier AI conference, used Qwen, as reported by Wired .\n“A lot of scientists are using Qwen because it’s the best open-weight model,” Andy Konwinski, cofounder of the Laude Institute, a nonprofit established to advocate for open U.S. models, told Wired.\nHuang’s plan seems to be a complete sovereign AI solution that offers the fastest inference for the lowest power consumption offered by LPUs, combined with GPUs for training, and Nemotron as a starter software platform.\n\nArya also wrote this in his note: “We envision future NVDA platforms where GPU and LPU co-exist in a rack, connected seamlessly with NVDA’s NVLInk networking fabric.”\nI will adamantly say that this idea is incorrect.\nRelated: Bank of America resets Micron stock price target, rating\nLPUs have a completely different memory model, based on so-called SRAM memory, which is very expensive and very fast. According to Groq, its LPUs connect directly via a plesiosynchronous protocol, aligning hundreds of chips to act as a single core.\nGroq calls its chip-to-chip interconnect technology RealScale. LPUs have one other key difference compared to GPUs: they are deterministic. These architectural differences mean that LPU and GPU chips can’t work together to run the same software (perform inference), and placing them in the same racks would only cause problems and complicate matters.\n\nEvery LPU has very little memory; a vast number of LPUs are needed to run big LLM models. This will be the deciding factor on how many racks of LPUs will be needed to run the model.\nIt is certainly possible for Nvidia to develop its LPUs to be a lot different compared to Groq’s, to allow for the mixing with GPUs in the same racks, but in that case, they would take a lot more time to develop. I believe that for Huang’s plan for AI factories, speed of development takes priority.\nIn any case, a launch of Nvidia’s LPUs in 2026 is highly unlikely, considering that chip design takes at least a year. The Groq deal and inference pivot tell us we need to watch what happens to OpenAI very closely.\nNvidia deal with OpenAI remains in question On December 19, Reuters reported that SoftBank Group is racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI. Considering that SoftBank’s pledge was to invest that money by the end of the year, they are cutting it pretty close.\nWaiting until the last moment to follow through makes the company look unsure if it is a good investment.\n\nNvidia’s agreement with OpenAI to invest up to $100 billion in the startup is still not finalized, according to a Reuters report from December 2. OpenAI doesn’t expect to be cash flow positive until 2030, according to Forbes .\nIt's easy to see why Nvidia isn’t rushing to finalize the deal with OpenAI. The best-case scenario for OpenAI is that Nvidia is waiting for it to have an IPO first, while the worst-case scenario, of course, is that there is no deal.\nOpenAI failing to secure more investments will have a domino effect that will hurt Oracle, Nvidia, and Microsoft the most. Nvidia’s AI factories strategy is a good way for the company to protect itself from dependence on OpenAI as a customer.\nWhat can we expect from Nvidia's partnership with Intel? According to the leaks, Intel Serpent Lake is the first chip that will feature an integrated Nvidia GPU, which won’t launch before 2027. Even that is optimistic, and 2028 is more likely, as reported by PC GAMER .\nNvidia’s revenue mix and estimates for 2026 The latest Bank of America research note that includes estimates for Nvidia is from November. Arya and his team estimate that Nvidia's revenue for fiscal year 2026 will be $212.83 billion, and non-GAAP EPS will be $4.66. Nvidia missed consensus estimates in Q3 for its revenue from gaming by 4%. There have been rumors that Nvidia is looking to cut gaming GPU production by up to 40% in 2026 due to VRAM supply issues, as reported by PC GAMER .\n\nWe can expect that due to the memory industry going all-in on AI, skyrocketing RAM prices will have a side effect of fewer gaming PCs being sold and built, so the gaming revenue could easily miss the consensus again.\nIn the automotive segment, a similar situation is evident, as Nvidia missed consensus estimates for Q3 by 6%. The company's guidance for Q4 is significantly lower than consensus estimates of $700 million, at $592 million.\nThe company’s guidance for the pro visualization segment for Q4 is optimistic at $760 million and higher than the consensus $643 million. OEM, including the crypto segment outlook for Q4, is close to consensus at $174 million compared to $172 million.\nNon data-center revenue segments look tiny compared to Nvidia's outlook of $51.2 billion and consensus estimates of $57 billion for Q4. As the company focuses more on its highest-margin products, revenue from non-data center segments will continue to shrink.\n\nThe Vera Rubin line launch will be the defining moment of 2026, because if the chips bring the promised performance and efficiency uplift, it will destroy any doubts regarding Nvidia’s supremacy.\nThe next year will be the year of Nvidia, especially if the rumor that Google failed to secure HBM shipments for its TPUs, as reported by Android Headlines , proves true.\nI wouldn’t be surprised if this rumor is true, as Huang is always several steps ahead of the competition, except for the moment when he underestimated Google TPUs.\nRelated: Veteran analyst has blunt message on Intel stock\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 28, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

At this share price, Meta now trades in the same range where companies such as Apple , Nvidia , and Tesla previously announced forward stock splits .\nWhile Meta has never executed a forward stock split since going public, the company's rising share price and growing earnings power have meaningfully increased the probability of a split in 2026.\nStock splits don't change the value of any investor's holdings, but here's why a Meta stock split could prove beneficial for investors, if it were to enact one.\n\nUpside drivers Although stock splits do not change a company's fundamentals, they tend to improve liquidity and broaden the investor base as they lower the per-share price (while increasing the number of shares), which can support higher trading activity and market valuation over time. While the availability of fractional shares has reduced some barriers to entry in stocks with high nominal share prices, research suggests that many retail investors still prefer owning full shares.\n\nAccording to data from Bank of America 's Research Investment Committee, companies that split their stock reported an average total return of 25.4% in the 12 months following the split announcement, more than double the 11.9% average return of the benchmark S&P 500 index in the same time frame. Hence, Meta's stock could see an incremental upside from improved liquidity and broader participation following a stock split.\nMeta reaches almost 3.5 billion people daily across its family of apps, giving it unmatched global scale and pricing power in digital advertising. Management has also guided for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures to be in the range of $66 billion to $72 billion, mainly for expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.\nThese investments are already showing results. Meta's AI-driven ad tools are improving ad targeting efficiency and advertiser returns on ad spend. The company is also expanding its addressable market with newer ad surfaces, including on WhatsApp, Reels, and Threads.\n\nStory Continues\nHence, for long-term investors, a potential stock split could serve as an accelerator on top of the company's robust fundamentals, which can drive up its share prices in the coming months. I think Meta could be a stock-split stock that could make investors rich.\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

Wall Street remains bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) despite the ongoing challenges stemming from increased competition in the AI chip sector and uncertainty regarding exporting to China amidst the geopolitical challenges.\n​Amidst this situation, Wall Street’s 12 month average price target on the stock represents more than 38% upside from the current level. A recent December 21 report by CNBC highlighted recent analysts’ ratings explaining the Street’s optimism.\n​The report noted Bernstein’s analyst Stacy Rasgon’s December 19 rating. The analyst maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $275 price target. Rasgon maintained his bullish sentiment after a virtual meeting with Stewart Stecker, senior director of investor relations at Nvidia. The analyst noted that the company’s $500 billion outlook released in October is expected to see further upside, driven by new recent deals with Anthropic, OpenAI, and the collaboration with the Middle East.\n\n​Moreover, the talk with Stewart Stecker highlighted that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) acknowledges that Google is at least two years ahead of the company due to its TPU program. However, the senior director of investor relations at Nvidia noted that Google will find it difficult to deploy these chips as they are designed for specific model structures. Therefore, Nvidia’s programmable platform solutions remain the best for cloud infrastructure.\n​In addition, on December 14, Blayne Curtis from Jefferies also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $250 price target.\n​NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) highlighted that Nemotron 3 Nano is capable of delivering 4x higher throughput than Nemotron 2 Nano.

      "Content": "What’s next for IonQ stock in 2026\n\nMoz Farooque\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:31 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nNVDA\n\nNot too long ago, AI felt like something you’d argue about after watching a sci-fi movie on the weekend.\nThen ChatGPT hit the screens in late 2022, and all of a sudden, the conversation stopped being theoretical.\nInvestors who paid attention benefited immensely by investing in pure-play AI and AI-adjacent stocks.\n\nFor perspective, since late 2022, Nvidia alone has surged from nearly $422.5 billion to about $4.63 trillion in market cap (adding nearly $4.2 trillion in value)\nQuantum computing stocks feel like they are at that same juncture at this point.\nAt its core, quantum computing is about doing math differently.\nPut simply, traditional computers handle problems one step at a time, sort of like checking doors at a hotel one by one.\nOn the flipside, quantum computers can check several doors at once. It might not seem like much until it starts solving impossible problems and changing how drugs are developed, products are moved, and data is secured.\nIn fact, according to McKinsey, quantum technologies could potentially create more than $1.3 trillion in value by 2035.\n\n2025 in particular was a huge year for quantum. Companies started showing real-world progress, governments began paying attention, and investors took notice.\nPerhaps the clearest beneficiary of this shift has been IonQ ( IONQ ), a rare pure-play in a space still dominated by tech giants.\nThat said, the question heading into 2026 is likely to be a ‘show me’ year for quantum players like IonQ, which, if they could turn scientific progress into something Wall Street easily understands in terms of revenues, customers, and long-term expansion.\n2025 was the year quantum got real 2025 will probably go down as the year quantum broke the perception around it perpetually being in ‘almost there’ mode.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nProgress became visible, measurable, and a lot more commercial at the same time.\nHere are some of the biggest milestones making the shift impossible to ignore.\nGoogle’s Willow chip: Google showed off its powerful 105-qubit processor in late 2024, crossing a critical threshold in error correction. In 2025, it moved from theory to action, solving a Quantum Echo physics problem with a 13,000× speedup that would have taken a classical supercomputer far longer to complete.\nIBM ’s long-term roadmap: IBM laid out a powerful fault-tolerant plan as it looked to target a massive 200 logical qubits by 2029 and scale toward a mind-boggling 1,000 logical qubits in the early 2030s.\nMicrosoft’s topological bet: Microsoft introduced its “Majorana 1” prototype while demonstrating 28 logical qubits encoded within 112 physical qubits, underscoring a future where error correction is significantly less resource-intensive.\nFunding and adoption accelerated: North of $2 billion was poured into quantum startups in 2024 , followed by another $1.25 billion in 2025, as governments and enterprises expanded cloud-based pilots, signaling a critical shift.\n\nStory Continues\nIonQ is a different kind of quantum bet IonQ is one of the few pure-play stocks you can invest in, which is taking a much more patient approach compared to its rivals.\nRelated: Cathie Wood drops $1.3 million on healthcare stock\nAlthough larger businesses, such as IBM and Google, continue to focus on building machines with as many qubits as possible, IonQ is focusing more on how these qubits actually function. Hence, it’s essentially chasing accuracy over raw horsepower.\n\nThat level of focus has paid off.\nIn 2025, IonQ reached a massive performance milestone, showing its machines are able to handle significantly more complex problems than their size would suggest.\nCompetitors like Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum take different approaches, and have also found success, but IonQ has done the best job so far in effectively turning complex science into an investment vehicle.\nHere are major U.S.-listed quantum stocks with 2025 year-to-date gains as of 12/26/2025:\nIonQ : +10.13%\nRigetti Computing : +46.66%\nD-Wave Quantum : +201.07%\nQuantum Computing Inc. : −35.59%\nDefiance Quantum ETF : +38%\nSource: ytdreturn.com\nIonQ’s major milestones in 2025 IonQ ’s 2025 was essentially a combination of technical breakthroughs, early commercial wins, and growing investor attention.\nRelated: Moody’s offers sobering view on Fed rate cuts\nHere are the main highlights of the year:\nReached #AQ 64 performance: IonQ’s powerful new Tempo system struck #AQ 64 three months ahead of schedule, doubling its previous computing power while opening the door to powerful real-world applications such as drug discovery and energy optimization.\nSet a fidelity record: IonQ achieved 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity , the first business to go past that threshold, reducing errors and laying groundwork for much larger systems, including a planned 256-qubit system in 2026 .\nLanded a landmark system sale: IonQ inked an agreement to deliver a massive 100-qubit system to South Korea’s national research institute, KISTI .\nProved real-world advantage: In partnering with Ansys , IonQ beat classical supercomputers by 12% on a practical engineering simulation.\nExpanded aggressively: IonQ’s fundamentals are in good shape, backed by timely acquisitions and partnerships, along with cloud availability through AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, boosting sales to $39.9 million in Q3 2025 , up 221% year-over-year .\n\n\"I am pleased to report that we once again beat the high end of our revenue guidance, this time by 37%. We are also raising our revenue expectations for the full year to $110 million at the high end of guidance,” said Niccolo de Masi, Chairman and CEO of IonQ.\nIonQ in 2026: What to watch next After a breakout 2025, IonQ heads into 2026 with a ton of expectations.\nRelated: Veteran analyst has blunt message on Intel stock\nHere’s what investors should be watching:\nA push to 256 qubits: As mentioned earlier, IonQ is planning to show off its 256-qubit system in 2026 , and if successful, that could move its computing power into triple digits.\nDelivering the KISTI system: The development and deployment of its 100-qubit Tempo system for South Korea’s KISTI will be a critical real-world test, unlocking more government and enterprise orders.\nExpanding partnerships and use cases: IonQ has existing relationships with businesses such as Amazon, NVIDIA, Hyundai, and Airbus, and new deals would help validate commercial demand.\nTurning progress into revenue: With 2025 sales still under $100 million annually, even doubling or tripling sales in 2026 is possible.\n\nKey risks to keep in mind:\nScaling risk is real: Moving from dozens of qubits to hundreds is a tremendous engineering leap, to say the least, and any delays or other issues can quickly reset expectations.\nCompetition is closing in: Tech giants, including the likes of IBM and Google, have significantly deeper pockets and parallel roadmaps.\nIonQ's latest price targets IonQ stock is currently trading at nearly $46 ; that said, here are three major analyst price targets heading into next year:\nJefferies: $100 (Street-high)\nMizuho : $90 (Buy)\nWedbush: $60 (Outperform, initiated December 2025)\nRelated: Longtime analyst resets Nvidia stock price target ahead of 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 28, 2025, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

      "Content": "What Is the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 8:36 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Chip designers such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom serve as the backbone of generative AI development.\nWhile chip designers steal the spotlight, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is playing a hugely important supporting role in the background.\nAs demand for AI chips and data centers accelerates, Taiwan Semi is poised for explosive long-term growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nFor the last three years, investing in semiconductor stocks has proven to be a profitable decision given the critical role chips play in the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Companies such as Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices , Broadcom , and Micron Technology have been some of the biggest contributors to the semiconductor industry throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nFlying under the radar is another chip company whose storyline seems muted compared to its peers. That's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , the pick-and-shovel specialist of the chip realm.\nLet's dive into Taiwan Semi's increasingly important role for the future of AI and assess why the stock looks like a no-brainer buying opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon.\nHow does Taiwan Semiconductor benefit from AI? Throughout the AI revolution, hyperscalers such as Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and OpenAI have collectively poured hundreds of billions of dollars into AI-related capital expenditures (capex) -- namely, chips and networking gear for data centers.\nOn the surface, this is great news for the likes of Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. But underneath the surface, it's even better news for Taiwan Semi. Why is that?\n\nTSMC is the largest chip manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue. While Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom design the most-in demand GPUs and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) on the planet, each of these giants relies heavily on Taiwan Semi's cutting-edge fabrication processes.\nIn other words, if Nvidia and its competitors represent the body of the car moving the AI narrative forward, TSMC holds the keys to the ignition.\nTSMC's growth is off the charts Over the last year, Taiwan Semi's revenue has been growing strongly thanks to ongoing demand for AI accelerators. What's interesting to point out is that the company's revenue trajectory is actually steepening. This is largely driven by rising demand for Nvidia's and AMD's next-generation Rubin and MI400 Series chips, as well as increasing investment in custom hardware from cloud infrastructure providers.\n\nStory Continues\nThe more subtle aspect from the financial picture above is Taiwan Semi's expanding profitability profile. Given its near-70% market share, TSMC is able to command enormous pricing power relative to competitors like Intel or Samsung .\nAgainst this backdrop, Taiwan Semi's gross margin is widening -- with excess cash flowing straight to the bottom line. The company is making the most of this new wave of capital by expanding its geographic footprint -- building additional foundries in Arizona, Germany, and Japan.\n\nIs Taiwan Semi stock a good buy right now? At the moment, TSMC boasts a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28.4 -- hovering near its highest level during the AI revolution. If you were to base your investment decision purely off of this metric, you may think Taiwan Semi is overvalued.\nSmart investors understand that TSMC's premium valuation could be warranted, though. McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion market through 2030 -- with the majority of spend allocated toward refining AI workloads.\nIn essence, building out AI-equipped data centers is expected to accelerate throughout the rest of the decade as training and inferencing models becomes more sophisticated and demanding. This is great news for TSMC as it paves the way for long-run visibility across the business.\n\nThe AI infrastructure chapter is still in its early innings. Over the course of the next several years, Taiwan Semi is positioned to benefit from the secular tailwind of rising investment in infrastructure both domestically and abroad.\nTaking this one step further, physical applications such as autonomous systems and robotics are yet to be deployed in a commercial sense. Looking beyond into the 2030s, these use cases are expected to drive additional trillions in economic value.\nShould they achieve some form of adoption and set the stage for the next wave of AI, Taiwan Semi has the potential to benefit immensely beyond where AI stands today -- building large language models (LLMs) and other software-based applications.\nWhen you consider the bigger picture and begin to think longer-term, TSMC's growth potential relative to its valuation looks compelling. So while the stock may not appear dirt cheap at first glance, I think there is ample room for meaningful valuation expansion over the course of the next decade -- making the stock a no-brainer buy right now in my eyes.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the First New $2 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 7:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nTSLA\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Broadcom each have market caps around $1.6 trillion.\nAI is the driving force behind all three stock prices.\nOne of these tech leaders is seeing immediate results from AI spending, and its stock valuation is more attractive right now.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is responsible for adding trillions of dollars in value to a handful of companies over the last few years. Nvidia , for example, briefly touched a $5 trillion market cap this year, thanks to its dominant position in the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). Four other companies sit firmly above the $2 trillion threshold as we approach the new year.\nBut three AI stocks currently have similar market caps around $1.6 trillion as of this writing, and are vying to become the first new $2 trillion company of 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Here's my prediction for the next company to top the milestone, and it could come as soon as next year.\nArtificial intelligence is fueling all three Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom have all seen their stock prices heavily influenced by advances in AI this year.\nMeta stock climbed higher early in the year as its efforts to improve its recommendation algorithms bore fruit. Ad revenue climbed higher as time spent on its apps increased, and ads became more effective. However, the stock took a step back recently as management shared plans to increase its AI-related spending.\n\nTesla's value is heavily tied to its robotaxi service and AI innovations. The stock received a boost over the summer when it launched its robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas. Investors added to those gains on promising progress on the company's next-generation AI chip for its vehicles.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator business has gained momentum in 2025, as the company signed big contracts with OpenAI and Anthropic, the latter of which is buying Alphabet 's Broadcom-designed tensor processing units (TPUs). To that end, Alphabet and Broadcom are seeing excellent progress in shifting more developer workloads to TPUs, which offer greater energy efficiency and cost savings versus Nvidia's GPUs.\nBroadcom stock took a step back after its last earnings report, as many analysts were disappointed with management's expectation that greater AI chip sales would come at a lower gross margin.\nWhile all three of these stocks have a path to a $2 trillion valuation in 2026, I expect Meta Platforms to reach the milestone first. Here's why.\n\nStory continues\nAI-powered earnings growth at an attractive valuation Even with its run rate of $200 billion in annual revenue, Meta is still growing its bottom line quickly. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 20% in the third quarter, and improvements in AI are the reason.\nMeta has seen an increase in both ad impressions and price per ad for eight straight quarters. That indicates that it's increasing user engagement and opening new places within its apps for advertising while making ads more effective.\n\nManagement attributes a shift in its recommendation algorithm to make it more general across formats as the primary reason users are spending more time on its apps. Meta has seen similar improvements by applying the same methodology to its advertising algorithm. In other words, bigger models have directly translated into more revenue.\nThat trend should continue in 2026, as Meta opens up more opportunities for advertising, including on Threads and WhatsApp. It could also begin monetizing Meta AI, its generative AI chatbot. The improvements in its algorithms over the last couple of years should enable it to ramp up advertising quickly without as much negative impact on its pricing as we've seen in the past.\nThe bigger opportunity for Meta in 2026, though, may be the expansion of its generative AI features. It's reportedly working on an AI agent that can manage advertising campaigns for small businesses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly talks about the opportunity to handle everything involved with creating, testing, and optimizing ad campaigns on its platform through an AI agent.\n\nAnd chatbots specializing in sales and customer service for a company could open the door for more businesses to push Facebook and Instagram users to start messaging them through Meta's chat apps.\nWith small- and medium-sized businesses accounting for the bulk of advertisers on Meta's platform, these innovations have the potential to dramatically increase the amount they're willing to spend on ads. If the overhead for these clients is much lower, they can increase their ad spending and scale up their businesses faster.\nThose efforts should fuel another year of strong revenue growth. And while depreciation expense from the increase in AI-related capital expenditures could eat into earnings growth, Meta should be able to manage continued improvements in earnings per share with the help of share repurchases.\n\nThe stock trades for just 26 times forward earnings expectations, which is much lower than Broadcom's multiple and less than one-tenth the multiple Tesla stock trades for. I expect Meta to fetch a higher earnings multiple as it proves its AI spending to be well worth it once again in 2026, pushing its valuation to $2 trillion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "3 Stock-Split Stocks to Buy and Hold for at Least a Decade\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:35 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNFLX\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Amazon's AI solutions are getting a lot of attention, but its advertising business is another key tailwind in addition to e-commerce.\nNetflix is getting a lot of coverage for a potential acquisition, but its flagship businesses are sticky on their own.\nNvidia is arguably one of the most popular AI stocks, and for good reason.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCompanies usually perform a stock split when their stock price has risen due to strong performance and management is optimistic about continued growth. The announcement of a split can be interpreted as a bullish signal by company insiders, which may attract more investor interest. Plenty of stocks have initiated splits over the last few years, but not all of these companies are created equal.\nOn that note, here are three stock-split stocks to buy and hold for at least a decade if you have investment capital to put to work right now.\n1. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has split its stock four times, with the most recent being a 20-for-1 split in June 2022 following earlier splits in June 1998, January 1999, and September 1999. The 2022 split was a significant event, as it was the first in over two decades. Since that recent split, shares have soared by around 170%.\n\nAmazon Web Services ( AWS ) is the world's leading global cloud infrastructure provider and the key catalyst behind Amazon's exceptional operating profits. The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) presents a significant tailwind for AWS, as companies require massive computing power and infrastructure to support AI applications. Amazon's heavy investment in custom AI chips (like Trainium and Inferentia) positions it to offer cost-effective solutions and maintain its market leadership in the AI era.\nAmazon's advertising business has emerged as a major profit driver, growing faster than its e-commerce business and operating at high margins. By owning the point of sale and leveraging vast amounts of first-party customer data, Amazon provides highly effective, intent-driven advertising opportunities that are a major draw for sellers and brands.\n\nWhile the e-commerce segment's growth rate is maturing, it still has an unrivaled scale and a strong competitive moat built on its vast logistics network, wide selection, and low prices. The company's investments in automation and robotics are expected to further boost efficiency and expand profit margins in the coming years.\nThe Prime membership program, with over 240 million members worldwide, creates strong customer loyalty and a powerful network effect. Its integrated benefits, including fast shipping, streaming business (Prime), and healthcare (Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical), encourage members to spend more within Amazon's ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nIn Q3, net sales grew 13% year over year to $180.2 billion. Amazon reported operating income of $17.4 billion, and AWS delivered accelerated growth to 20% (totaling $33 billion), thanks to its dominance in supporting AI workloads. The advertising segment's revenue rose 22% to $17.7 billion. Amazon still looks like a compelling buy to hold on to for many years to come.\n\n2. Netflix Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has split its stock multiple times, with three significant stock splits in its history: a 2-for-1 split in 2004, a 7-for-1 split in 2015, and most recently, a 10-for-1 split in November 2025. That most recent split took effect Nov. 17.\nWhile subscriptions remain core to its revenue and profitability model, Netflix is successfully expanding into new, high-growth areas. The ad-supported tier is growing rapidly and is on track to double its revenue in 2025. The company is also venturing into gaming, live sports events, and merchandising, all of which could create multiple avenues for future growth.\n\nNetflix has shifted its focus from pure subscriber growth to profitable expansion, which has effectively to expanded its operating margins and achieved significant free cash flow generation. In Q3 2025, Netflix's revenue was $11.5 billion (up 17% year over year), but its operating margin was 28%, while its free cash flow surged to $2.7 billion. Netflix also expects to report free cash flow of approximately $9 billion in 2025 on the whole.\nNetflix has established itself as the preeminent global streaming service. While the U.S. and Canadian markets are nearing saturation, there remains significant room for subscriber growth in international markets, such as Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The company's strategy of producing high-quality, localized original content that resonates globally (e.g., Squid Game , Stranger Things ) helps drive retention and attract new subscribers.\n\nNetflix has also demonstrated robust pricing power, increasing subscription costs without experiencing significant subscriber losses. The brand name is synonymous with streaming, and its vast library of content, combined with data on viewer habits, creates a strong competitive advantage that is difficult for rivals to match.\nProposed acquisitions, such as the potential purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery studios (though it certainly faces regulatory hurdles), could further solidify its content library and market dominance. Now looks like a great time to scoop up some shares of Netflix.\n3. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has split its stock six times, with the most recent split being a 10-for-1 split enacted on June 10, 2024. Before that, Nvidia executed a 4-for-1 split in 2021. Since the 2024 split, Nvidia shares have increased by about 55%.\nNvidia's strong position as the foundational technology provider for the AI revolution, combined with its robust financial performance and competitive moat, has driven the company to new heights of financial growth. Its most recent results for its 2026 third quarter (ending October 2025), included record revenue of $57 billion (up 62% from a year ago) and EPS of $1.30, thanks to booming data center and Blackwell GPU sales. Its data center division delivered $51.2 billion in revenue, up 66% from one year ago.\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 80% to 90% market share in the data center AI chip market, and its GPUs are considered the gold standard for AI training and inference. The company's key competitive advantage lies in its proprietary CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software platform, which has become the de facto standard for GPU-accelerated computing.\nMajor AI frameworks are optimized for CUDA, and the platform boasts an ecosystem of millions of developers globally who rely on CUDA to build and accelerate their applications. This large community creates a powerful network effect, offering extensive support, shared code, and third-party tools that competitors struggle to match.\nThe deep integration of CUDA into existing workflows and institutional knowledge creates prohibitively high switching costs for developers and organizations. Nvidia continuously optimizes the CUDA software stack for its latest GPU architectures, which ensures top-tier performance that often outpaces hardware-only competitors.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's next-generation chips (Blackwell and Rubin architectures) remains exceptionally high, with an order backlog of $500 billion through the end of 2026. Beyond data centers, Nvidia is expanding into robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial digital twins, which positions the business to tap into new, multitrillion-dollar market opportunities. That's a value proposition many long-term investors won't want to miss out on.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "'I don't see a bubble': Why Wall Street thinks the stock market can keep climbing even as AI anxiety grows\n\nInes Ferré · Senior Business Reporter\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nAs stocks sit near all-time highs, strategists are brushing off concerns of an AI bubble.\nAt least for now.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is on pace to close out the year with a gain of over 17%, powered by a 26% jump in technology stocks ( XLK ).\n“I don't see a bubble at all. However, I do believe we're going to be going into a bubble,” Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist Mary Ann Bartels told Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nBatels compared the current market to prior bubbles, including the late 1920s and the dot-com bubble.\n“We're tracking pretty similarly. In fact, it's kind of eerie how we're actually tracking that pattern,” she said. “I see a bubble occurring but not out until maybe ’29 into ’30.”\nBut for the time being, Sanctuary strategists forecast that tech will continue leading the market higher out into the end of the decade. They place the S&P 500 anywhere between 10,000 and 13,000 by 2030.\n“That's why we're calling 2026, you know, to be fearless, that there's still significant upside in this market, particularly for technology,” she said.\nPart of the upside comes from semiconductor stocks. Once treated as commodity plays, they become growth stocks, with Nvidia ( NVDA ) “basically rewriting the path for semiconductor chips.”\n\nThe AI chip powerhouse has surged over 40% so far this year, pushing its market cap to $4.6 trillion and making it the most valuable publicly traded company. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose after the company announced a $20 billion licensing deal with specialized chipmaker Groq ( GROQ.PVT ).\nThe deal was announced as the chip space has heated up, with Alphabet's Google ( GOOG ) making headlines with its specialized customer chips called TPUs.\nAlphabet stock has soared some 65% year to date.\n\nUBS strategists also expect the AI boom and robust profit growth to underpin market gains in 2026.\n“We note that forward price-to-earnings multiples are only marginally higher than at the start of the year, reinforcing the fact that earnings growth and not valuation bubbles have driven market gains,” wrote the strategists last week.\n\nUBS forecasts S&P 500 earnings per share to grow about 10% year over year, pushing the index to 7,700 by the end of next year.\nVeteran strategist Ed Yardeni also sees the index reaching 7,700 next year, with the probability of his \"Roaring 2020s\" scenario at 60%. He cited, among other reasons, tax benefits from the \" One Big Beautiful Bill \" that passed this year and the AI boom.\nIn October, Goldman Sachs analysts argued the stock market isn’t in a bubble because tech stocks have risen mostly due to actual growth, not speculative bets. The firm noted that top-performing companies have strong balance sheets and the AI sector is still mostly led by a few big players, while most bubbles occur when many new entrants rush into a hot sector.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile most of the earnings growth this year has been led by the largest seven stocks in the S&P 500, Goldman Sachs analysts also see participation broadening.\n\"We expect macro tailwinds from accelerating economic growth and a fading tariff drag on margins will support an acceleration in the earnings growth rate for the remaining 493 stocks,\" wrote Goldman's Ben Snider earlier this month.\nMeanwhile, AI productivity is expected to lift earnings for companies outside the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks, said Joseph Shaposhnik, founder of Rainwater Equity.\n\"I think some of them will take a break — some of them will perform well,\" he told Yahoo Finance.\n\"But really, the opportunity for outsized returns next year are going to be outside those seven businesses,\" he added.\nInes Ferre is a Senior Business Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "These 4 Billionaires All Have 1 Genius AI Stock in Common, and It's Set to Skyrocket in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor is a broader way to play the AI buildout trend.\nData center capital expenditures are expected to rise through at least 2030.\nChip designers have one thing in common: they all turn to Taiwan Semiconductor.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nLooking at what stocks billionaire hedge fund managers own can be a smart investment strategy. While blindly following their trades isn't a smart move because of information delay, seeing what stocks they all have in common may reveal some great insights to investors.\n\nThe reason for the information delay is due to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements. Any money manager with more than $100 million in assets must report end-of-quarter holdings to the SEC. Then, that information is made available to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . So, if you see that your favorite fund manager bought a position in a hot AI stock, they may have done it months ago.\nThe key is to find fund managers who don't make massive trades every quarter on a single position. Instead, they add or trim as necessary to manage their risk. One stock that popped up in multiple funds I follow is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , also known as TSMC. It's a huge holding in many portfolios, and I think it's set to skyrocket in 2026 as artificial intelligence demand ramps up.\nTaiwan Semiconductor plays a key role in the AI realm The four billionaires who all own shares of Taiwan Semiconductor are:\nChase Coleman at Tiger Global Management (4% of portfolio)\nSteve Mandel at Lone Pine Capital (6.2% of portfolio)\nDavid Tepper at Appaloosa Management (4% of portfolio)\nDaniel Loeb at Third Point (3.7% of portfolio)\nClearly, these four billionaires are very bullish on Taiwan Semiconductor's prospects, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out why.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine whose computing units are the best at any given time. For most of the AI arms race, Nvidia and its leading graphics processing units (GPUs) have dominated this conversation. However, rising competition from Advanced Micro Devices and custom AI accelerators from Broadcom has made this analysis more difficult.\nBut all three of these companies have one thing in common: They get most of their chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. This places TSMC in the ultimate neutral position, as it is supplying chips to competitors. So, as long as there are massive data center buildouts ongoing to develop generative AI technologies, Taiwan Semiconductor will be in an excellent position.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia informed investors that it expects global data center capital expenditures to total $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030 -- a huge expansion from 2025's $600 billion. That's total capital expenditures, which is far broader than just computing. AMD offered a similar projection, estimating that computing will be a $1 trillion market opportunity by 2030.\n\nThis bodes well for one of the key providers of chips in the world, making it no surprise that these four billionaires own shares.\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a buy now? As mentioned above, the information we have on the ownership of Taiwan Semiconductor among the four billionaires is old information. All we know is that they owned shares on Sept. 30. Since then, TSMC's stock has basically been flat, up around 3%. This likely means they still own the shares, as there haven't been any huge drops.\nFurthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is reasonably valued heading into 2026.\nAt 23 times 2026 earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor isn't all that expensive compared to its peers. Factor in its critical position and monster growth that's expected to persist for several years after 2026, and Taiwan Semiconductor looks like one of the best buys in the market.\nI think investors should follow these four billionaires' lead and take a hefty position in Taiwan Semiconductor. It's a critical company, and with massive spending expected to occur over the next five years, it's well-positioned to be a huge winner and could skyrocket in 2026 as a result.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Stocks sit near record highs as 'Santa Claus rally' builds, 2026 approaches: What to watch this week\n\nJake Conley · Breaking Business News Reporter\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nADP\n\n^IXIC\n\n^DJI\n\nGC=F\n\nStocks finished trading on Friday — the second session of the so-called \"Santa Claus rally\" — down just slightly on the day after a run of five straight positive sessions, with the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) hovering right near record levels set on Christmas Eve.\nFor the holiday-shortened week, the benchmark S&P 500 gained roughly 2.3%, while the blue-chip Dow and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) picked up about 1.6% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nWall Street enters another relatively sleepy holiday week. Employment figures from labor market data provider ADP and minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting, both released on Wednesday, will take center stage as Wall Street looks to enter 2026 on a high note.\n'Santa Claus rally' looks to continue 2025 has been a year of fresh highs throughout the market.\nAfter a sharp downturn in the wake of President Trump's springtime tariff policy rollout , all three major stock indexes have rallied back to notch multiple records. Gold ( GC=F ) and silver ( SI=F ) have headlined a monster rally for precious metals, both cresting their historical highs as investors turned to safety investments, while copper ( HG=F ) hit its own high-water mark on the back of supply chain disruptions and tariff policy uncertainty.\n2025 also saw Nvidia ( NVDA ) become the first company to cross a market capitalization of $5 trillion as the biggest players in technology ballooned their spending to keep up in what has become an AI arms race.\n\nNow, with stocks hitting fresh records near the tail end of last week, the market is looking primed for a positive \"Santa Claus rally\" — typically the last five trading sessions of December and first two of January.\n\"Momentum heading into year-end suggests a favorable setup for a positive Santa Claus Rally — a historically bullish signal for January and the year ahead,\" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said in emailed commentary.\n\nWall Street strategists are predicting that the indexes will keep the party going in 2026.\nThe S&P 500 closed Friday's trading session at 6,929.94. Strategists at JPMorgan Chase and HSBC see the index reaching 7,500 by year-end in 2026. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank are even more bullish, setting their 2026 targets at 7,800 and 8,000, respectively. The latter number would represent a more than 15% increase from current levels.\n\"Despite AI bubble and valuation concerns, we see current elevated multiples correctly anticipating above-trend earnings growth, an AI capex boom, rising shareholder payouts, and easier fiscal policy,\" said JPMorgan lead equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas.\n\nStory Continues\n'Cautious optimism' But investors are also stepping into 2026 with an economy on somewhat shaky footing.\nEven as GDP growth has jumped and inflation has cooled, the US economy is growing increasingly fragmented, or \"K-shaped.\" Higher-income households have been drivers of spending and wealth growth, while lower-income households have struggled.\n\nWorries about overspending by Big Tech companies and potentially unsustainably lofty valuations in the sector have remained persistent.

      "Content": "Making fortunes and letting it ride: 13 New Year investing resolutions\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nYou can always be better.\nA better family member. A better friend. A better human toward others. A healthier person. And, of course, a better investor.\nAnyone that tells you they have the investing game all figured is, well, a dope. You can tell them that cold hard reality came from Brian Sozzi at Yahoo Finance — and feel free to send me their replies on X @BrianSozzi .\n\nWhile it feels as if making money in the market is easy right now — if not for all of 2025 — the market could turn on a dime and run you over.\nThink what would happen if Nvidia ( NVDA ) came out in a few months and had a key growth rate that slowed sequentially. What if that was backed up with a surprise dose of cautiousness from CEO Jensen Huang? Or, what if the new Fed chair in 2026 isn't as dovish as the market is currently pricing in? That would severely damage the bull thesis on stocks.\nWhatever the case, markets do not go up in a straight line, and that should mean you try each and every day to improve at the craft of making money. One way to do that is to make some investing resolutions and tape them to one of the eight screens you have at your investing command post.\nThese are my 10 investing-related resolutions for 2026:\n\nTake less management BS on earnings calls as gospel.\nBetter understand the intricacies and motives behind executive compensation packages.\nHold more weight toward GAAP financial results compared to non-GAAP financial results.\nAssign better investing scores for companies clearly seeing profit gains from new AI actions.\nFind five companies that seem ripe for an activist investor attack.\nGo and see an AI data center being built.\nTrack capital expenditures at the 15 largest tech companies.\nScreen for the 10 \"cheapest\" members of the S&P 493 (the ex-\"Magnificent Seven\" names).\nBecome better at spotting the top five stock formations.\nFind one small-cap company doing something amazing.\nAnd here are three additional resolutions investing pros told me this week on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid .\n\nSam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist \"I'm a big rules follower. Even though history is a good guide, it's never gospel. But one of the rules that I follow is if last year was an up year, you want to let your winners ride. If last year was a down year, you want to own the three worst-performing sectors. Using this alternate kind of investment strategy, you would have added about 300 basis points to the market's return and beat the market 70% of the time. Obviously not a guarantee, but it's an encouragement that the market says it has further to run.\"\n\nStory continues\nGeorge Seay, Annandale Capital founder \"Don't time the market. Stay on the ride, enjoy it while it lasts.\"\nThomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital chairman \"I think we're going to keep doing what we did in 2025 because it worked. I think the thing that is going to surprise people is that equal weight indices could outperform cap weighted indices. I think people who are just stuck in regular cap weighted indices, like the S&P 500, are going to be underwhelmed with their returns in 2026, and the people that venture out a little bit, such as the stock pickers, I think there's going to be fortunes made under the surface.\n\"But the easy way to get exposure to that is with an equal weight index, in which case would be the first time in some time where the broadening and that participation overwhelms what people expect in the indices. And that's a sign of health. That's a good thing, not a bad thing.\"\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Ahead of 2026, According to Wall Street Analysts (Hint: Not Palantir)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Morningstar analysts recently ranked Nvidia and Microsoft as the two best artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now.\nBrian Colello at Morningstar says Nvidia has an economic moat due to its leadership in GPUs, networking, and software tools needed for artificial intelligence.\nDan Romanoff at Morningstar says Microsoft’s cloud computing unit has emerged as a leader in artificial intelligence due to investments in OpenAI.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nPalantir Technologies has been one of the best-performing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in recent years. Shares have advanced 1,000% since January 2024, but many analysts worry about its valuation. That may explain why Palantir did not appear on Morningstar 's recent list detailing the best AI stocks to buy now.\nInstead, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) took the top two spots, followed by Amazon , Broadcom , and Meta Platforms . But optimism concerning Nvidia and Microsoft is not limited to Morningstar. Most Wall Street analysts believe the stocks are undervalued.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $190.\nAmong 63 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 29% upside from its current share price of $488.\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft.\n1. Nvidia Morningstar analyst Brian Colello writes:\nTo summarize, Nvidia has an important competitive advantage in its full-stack strategy. The company is best known for its GPUs, chips that accelerate demanding data center workloads like AI training and AI inference. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it pairs best-in-class GPUs with CPUs, high-speed interconnects, and networking platforms, such that the company essentially builds entire data centers.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has spent the better part of two decades creating its CUDA software platform, which comprises an unparalleled number of code libraries, pretrained models, and application frameworks that assist developers. While custom AI chips developed by Broadcom may be cheaper, the total cost of ownership is often higher because they lack pre-built software tools.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia has over 90% market share in data center GPUs, a market where sales are projected to grow at 36% annually through 2033, and the company is likely to maintain its dominant position due to its full-stack strategy. Wall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 48% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2028. That makes the current valuation of 47 times earnings look cheap.\n\n2. Microsoft Microsoft is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for Microsoft 365 (a suite that includes office applications like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word), the company also has a strong position in other software verticals, including business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning.\n\nMicrosoft has added generative AI copilots to several software products and monthly active users surpassed 150 million in the September quarter, up from 100 million in the June quarter. And CEO Satya Nadella told analysts, \"Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot faster than any other Microsoft 365 suite. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.\"\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services sales. \"Azure has several distinct advantages, including that it offers customers a painless way to experiment and move select workloads to the cloud,\" according to Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff. \"Based on its investment in OpenAI, the company has also emerged as a leader in AI.\"\n\nMicrosoft owns a 27% equity stake in OpenAI and it has exclusive rights to the AI start-up's most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 and GPT-5). Also, The Information reports that OpenAI shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft under the agreement. Those payments will top $1 billion this year, up from about $500 million last year, according to TechCrunch.\nWall Street estimates Microsoft's adjusted earnings will increase at 16% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look somewhat expensive. But Microsoft topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 8% during the last four quarters, which makes the current valuation look more reasonable. Nvidia is still the more attractive option, but I think patient investors should consider buying a small position in both stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "This AI Stock Is Quietly Outperforming Nvidia in 2025\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 10:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia has climbed 40% so far this year, but this other AI player has advanced 65%.\nThis company’s stock has picked up momentum in recent months.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the artificial intelligence (AI) stock everyone has been watching over the past few years. The company has established itself as the leading AI chip designer and launched an entire ecosystem of products that make it the one to turn to for anything AI. All of this has resulted in revenue exploding higher -- and the stock price has followed. Nvidia shares have soared a mind-blowing 1,300% over the past five years.\n\nThe tech giant has continued with this momentum in 2025, reporting record levels of revenue and high demand for its products. The stock also has climbed, advancing in the double digits -- but it's far from being this year's biggest stock market winner. In fact, the following unassuming AI stock is quietly outperforming Nvidia in 2025. Let's find out more.\nEarnings strength over time Nvidia is on track for a 40% increase this year, but fellow tech player Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is heading for a gain of more than 65%. Alphabet picked up significant momentum in recent months, buoyed by its overall earnings strength, its position in AI , and the outcome of an antitrust suit.\n\nWe'll start out by talking about Alphabet in general. You may know this company very well, as it's the owner of something most of us use pretty regularly: Google Search. The world's No. 1 search engine, with more than 90% market share, has been Alphabet's ticket to billion-dollar revenue and steady growth year after year. This is as advertisers rush to the Google platform to catch us where they know they can find us -- and these ads generate the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue.\nBut Alphabet also has another significant, and growing, revenue source, and that's Google Cloud. This business sells a variety of cloud services to customers -- and here's where AI comes in. Google Cloud offers AI tools and platforms to those aiming to develop and use AI, and this has supercharged revenue in recent quarters. In the most recent period, for example, Google Cloud's revenue advanced 34% amid demand for AI infrastructure and generative AI services. Alphabet also has built its own large language model, Gemini, which it offers to customers -- and the company uses Gemini to improve its own business, for instance, making the advertising experience better and more productive for advertisers.\n\nStory Continues\nA first $100 billion quarter The strength of Alphabet's ad business, as well as growth in Google Cloud, helped the company reach its first-ever $100 billion quarter in the latest period. This shows that Alphabet not only offers you a solid track record but also potential for growth as this AI story develops. It's important to keep in mind that analysts predict the AI market may reach into the trillions of dollars in just a few years. A company like Alphabet is well-positioned to benefit as customers turn to Google Cloud for various AI needs.\n\nFinally, Alphabet recently received excellent news from the judge in a U.S. antitrust case against the company. The federal judge ruled out the worst-case scenario: the possible breakup of Google. He said Alphabet would not be required to sell Chrome or the Android operating system. Instead, the company faces other penalties that should be much less detrimental to the business. This news, in early September, clearly offered the stock a lift as it removed the biggest risk for Alphabet and its investors.\nA look at valuation Now, as we look ahead to the new year, you may be wondering: Does Alphabet have what it takes to continue outperforming AI market star, Nvidia? I think it's possible. Alphabet, trading for 29x forward earnings estimates, is considerably cheaper than Nvidia.\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\nThis could attract buyers looking for a reasonably priced AI stock and one that may be heading for a new phase of growth. Alphabet not only offers access to Nvidia systems, but it also offers its customers access to a wide variety of alternatives too -- so, as I mentioned earlier, it's likely to benefit as the AI market grows.\n\nI also like the fact that the company's main profit engine -- advertising -- is likely to keep on delivering revenue increases regardless of the AI spending climate. This offers investors who are worried about the pace of AI growth an element of security.\nAll of this means that there's reason to be optimistic about Alphabet's performance next year -- and it may even continue to outperform Nvidia.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Leave Behind in 2026\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 5:00 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nAI\n\nRGTI\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Palantir's stock appears priced for perfection.\nA CEO change and dramatically lower revenue guidance bode poorly for C3.ai.\nFalling revenue and a high valuation could lead to further declines for Rigetti Computing.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\nSince the end of the 2022 bear market, several artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have delivered massive returns for investors as they transform the technology landscape. Not surprisingly, one of the top stocks in this category is Nvidia , which delivered returns of over 1,640% since its low in mid-October 2022.\nUnfortunately, such success has not made every AI stock an automatic buy. In fact, given the state of the stock or the company, it may be time to part ways with some of the stocks, and these three names probably belong at the top of such a list.\nPalantir Technologies Admittedly, Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) may seem like a strange choice for a \"stocks to sell\" list. It is up nearly 33-fold from its 2022 low, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has brought eye-popping productivity gains to several of its clients.\nHowever, its success has arguably taken its stock into bubble territory. The problem with bubbles is that they can take stocks to such high levels that it may take years or possibly decades to recover.\n\nEven though bubbles are typically identified after the fact, the valuation metrics look like a bubble in the making. Palantir's trailing P/E ratio is just above 450. While investors could dismiss that, its forward P/E of around 270 and the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio above 125 prove the trailing earnings multiple is not a fluke. Also, considering that investors often balk at sales multiples that are one-fourth of Palantir's P/S ratio, it is likely a sign that investors should turn cautious.\nIndeed, revenue for the first nine months of 2025 rose by 51% year over year. Amid that performance, Palantir stock certainly deserves to trade at a premium. Nonetheless, with the market pricing the stock beyond perfection, one has to question whether the stock has any near-term upside left.\n\nC3.ai C3.ai (NYSE: AI) stock has often drawn investor interest in recent years. The company has developed over 130 software applications to help organizations adopt AI quickly, and companies from a variety of industries use its tools.\nUnfortunately, the company has faced considerable struggles, the latest of which is the news this summer that the company's founder and CEO, Thomas Siebel, would step down. He departed in September due to health issues, and the current CEO, Stephen Ehikian, faces a daunting turnaround task.\n\nStory Continues\nOne issue to tackle is C3.ai's falling revenue. After issuing fiscal 2026 guidance between $448 million and $485 million six months earlier, it reduced that guidance to between $290 million and $310 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Oct. 31).\nAmid that adjustment, revenue is down 20% year over year in the first half of fiscal 2026. Also, operating expenses continue to far outpace revenue, and its $221 million loss in the first two quarters of 2026 was higher than its $129 million loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nConsequently, the stock trades down over 60% from one year ago. That decline took its P/S ratio to 5, a two-year low and a level that could attract some investors. Still, with deteriorating financials and an uncertain direction for the company under new management, one has to wonder whether C3.ai stock is worth the risk of owning.\nRigetti Computing Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) competes in the burgeoning quantum computing field, which is on track to become a player in next-generation AI.\nRigetti has a competitive advantage in developing faster technology. Unfortunately, this does not necessarily lead to the highest accuracy, a factor that could lead to Rigetti losing out to competitors.\n\nMoreover, it is not only smaller companies like IonQ that compete in this field. Alphabet and IBM are among the mega-techs investing in quantum computing, and they generate sufficient free cash flows to invest in the necessary research and development.\nThis is not the case with Rigetti, which has to issue shares periodically simply to fund its continued existence. Additionally, it may be losing out to competitors, as its revenue in the first nine months of 2025 was just $5.2 million, a 39% decline from the same period in 2024.\nThat drop and a $149 million change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities led to a net loss in the first three quarters of the year of $198 million. In comparison, the company lost $48 million over the same timeframe in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Rigetti had benefited from a rising stock price, but the stock now trades down nearly 60% from its October 2025 high. Considering the falling sales and the price-to-book ratio of 22, this stock seems to offer more risk than reward to its investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?

(NYSE: BLK ), Neuberger Berman , Samsung Electronics Co. (OTC: SSNLF ), Disruptive and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ).\nDespite dilution from later funding rounds and uncertainty around its current ownership, Social Capital's early bet on Groq has almost certainly delivered a substantial windfall for Palihapitiya, who has backed the company since its early stages, all the way through its billion-dollar exit.\n\nSince Social Capital now operates primarily as Palihapitiya's family office and is closed to outside investors, he stands to capture the bulk of the windfall, a gain that would significantly expand his estimated $1.2 billion net worth , according to Forbes.\nSocial Capital did not immediately respond to Benzinga’s request for a comment.

      "Content": "Prediction: AMD Stock Will Jump 60% in 2026, Thanks to President Donald Trump\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 3:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points AMD was getting a nice chunk of its revenue from the Chinese market before the U.S. government's export controls took effect in April 2025.\nAMD will soon be allowed to sell advanced AI chips to Chinese customers, which should benefit AMD's business in 2026.\nThis could help AMD exceed Wall Street's growth expectations next year, which could send the stock soaring.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock clocked stellar gains in 2025, rising 78% this year as of this writing. However, recent trading suggests that some investors are booking profits. AMD stock is down 19% since hitting a 52-week high on Oct. 29.\nThis pullback could be a buying opportunity for investors looking to add a fast-growing company that's benefiting from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) . Additionally, a recent announcement by President Donald Trump, which will allow companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD, and Intel to sell their advanced AI chips to Chinese customers, is going to give AMD an additional boost in 2026.\nLet's take a closer look at AMD's catalysts for the new year and see why this stock has the potential to soar once again.\nThe Trump administration's announcement could give AMD a big shot in the arm AMD's business grew at a nice clip in 2025. It is on track to deliver $34 billion in revenue for the year, up 31% over 2024 revenue. It might have been even better, but AMD hasn't been able to sell its chips into the Chinese market since April, when the Trump administration imposed export controls on sales of advanced AI data center chips to that country.\n\nAs a result, AMD incurred an $800 million inventory charge in the second quarter. Moreover, the company lost a significant chunk of its revenue stream thanks to the Trump administration's move. That's because China accounted for nearly a quarter of AMD's 2024 revenue of $25.8 billion, or almost $6.2 billion.\nDespite the headwind, analysts expect a 20% increase in the company's earnings for 2025 to $3.97 per share. Consensus estimates suggest that AMD's earnings could jump 62% next year to $6.46 per share. I think it could end up doing much better than that.\nTake Nvidia, for example. The Trump administration now allows Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to Chinese customers. Nvidia was previously only selling its downsized H20 chips in China to comply with export regulations. Those chips were significantly cheaper and less powerful than Nvidia's flagship Hopper processor, the H200.\n\nStory Continues\nWith the change, Nvidia will likely see a significant bump in its revenue next year, even after paying the 25% tax that the administration plans to charge on sales to China. President Trump pointed out in his Truth Social post that the \"same approach will apply to AMD,\" suggesting that the company may be able to sell its high-end chips to Chinese customers.\n\nIt was earlier selling the downgraded MI308 processor to Chinese customers. It may now be able to ship its more powerful chips into that market, just like Nvidia has been allowed to. So, there is a possibility of AMD regaining the lost Chinese revenue in 2026, even with the 25% export fee.\nThat's because a full-fledged AMD data center graphics processing unit (GPU) will carry a significant premium over the nerfed MI308. This is why AMD's sales next year could turn out to be much higher than expected.\nThe stock could skyrocket in 2026 Analysts anticipate AMD's revenue to jump by 31% in 2026 to $44.6 billion. Assuming its revenue from China next year lands at 2024 levels of $6.2 billion, its top line could be somewhere around $51 billion. What's worth noting is that analysts haven't adjusted their 2026 revenue expectations for AMD following the Trump administration's rule change, suggesting that the company's potential gains from China aren't baked in just yet.\nAssuming AMD does achieve $51 billion in revenue next year and maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 11 at that time, its market cap could jump to $561 billion. That points toward a potential jump of 60% from its current market cap. So, now it would be a good time to buy this semiconductor stock following its recent pullback, as it has the potential to soar impressively in the new year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

Here's What's Next.\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia was the first $5 trillion stock, but it's declined over the past few weeks.\nThe chipmaker has an edge in its vertically integrated ecosystem of products.\nHowever, it's facing new competition from the likes of Amazon and Alphabet.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) made stock market history, again, when it reached a $5 trillion market value at the end of October. However, it has since fallen almost 10% from those highs and currently sports a $4.4 trillion value. What's next for the artificial intelligence (AI) giant?\nCompetition and new products One way Nvidia has stayed on top of the AI mountain is by constantly upping its game and releasing new, groundbreaking products. It's best known for its expensive and powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), but it's increasingly focused on vertically integrated products that draw high-paying clients into its ecosystem.\n\nThese companies are spending vast amounts of money on their AI development using Nvidia products, creating high barriers to entry for other vendors. That gives Nvidia an edge on top of the one it already has from having the most powerful program.\nHowever, there are other top companies, including Amazon and Alphabet , that are creating their own AI chips and finding the white space to drive AI.\nWhat seems likely is that Nvidia will keep launching new and improved technology and keep its lead, but as competition heats up, the landscape continues to change, and the company gets bigger, growth will decelerate. The price is already coming down to a more realistic valuation , and it could still beat the market next year, but it isn't likely to deliver the life-changing gains it has in the past.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "From Power Grids to Data Centers: The Overlooked Winners in the AI Gold Rush\n\nMatt DiLallo, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 12:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Companies need to invest $5.2 trillion in AI infrastructure by 2030.\nData centers are the physical homes of AI hardware.\nPower is vital to AI.\n10 stocks we like better than NextEra Energy ›\nThe AI revolution is driving nearly insatiable demand for hardware like high-performance GPUs, CPUs, networking equipment, and storage. Demand for this hardware is so strong that AI companies are buying Nvidia 's GPUs and memory chips from Micron hand over fist. As a result, the share prices of AI hardware companies have skyrocketed in recent years.\n\nHowever, hardware is only part of the estimated $5.2 trillion in capital spending McKinsey sees on AI infrastructure through 2030. Companies will also need to invest heavily in developing the physical data center shells, power grids, and electricity-generating capacity to support the AI boom. Here's a look at some of the overlooked pick-and-shovel plays that are crucial to the AI gold rush.\nThe cloud is a physical space AI technology requires specialized computing infrastructure. The centerpiece is an AI factory, a purpose-built data center that houses critical hardware. In addition to the hardware, this physical building shell requires advanced cooling systems and access to a substantial amount of reliable power.\nSeveral companies specialize in developing data centers (shells and operating facilities). For example, data center REITs such as Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX) and Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR) play a crucial role in helping develop physical real estate to support AI. Equinix is building out several xScale data centers (large-scale, AI-ready facilities). In 2024, it formed a $15 billion joint venture to purchase land and build several new state-of-the-art xScale facilities. Meanwhile, Digital Realty launched its first U.S. Hyperscale Data Center Fund in 2025 to support up to $10 billion of data center investments. It also partnered with Blackstone in late 2023 on a $7 billion joint venture to build large-scale data centers.\n\nBrookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC) (NYSE: BIP) is another notable data center developer. The company has acquired several global data center platforms over the years to build up its capabilities. It currently operates over 140 data centers worldwide, with a total capacity of 1.6 gigawatts (GW). It sees potential to develop an additional 3.4 GW of capacity across its platform in the future. Additionally, Brookfield is investing in other data infrastructure to support AI, including plans to deploy advanced fuel cell technology from Bloom Energy to power data centers.\n\nStory Continues\nPowering the AI revolution The advanced GPUs, cooling systems, and other hardware required to support AI demand a massive amount of electricity. Many AI data center campuses need over 1 GW of electricity, enough to power about 750,000 homes. According to an estimate by leading AI company Anthropic , the U.S. will need at least 50 GW of power for AI by 2028 alone .\n\nSeveral energy companies are investing in expanding the energy infrastructure necessary to support AI. They're constructing new energy transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and clean power generation assets.\nOne of the leaders in energy infrastructure development is NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) . The company is exploring the potential to invest over $25 billion in the coming years in developing additional electricity transmission projects to support the grid. Additionally, it has an extensive gas pipeline network that it expects to expand in the future to support growing demand for gas power. On top of that , NextEra is a leader in developing renewable energy. The company also formed strategic partnerships with Google to advance the deployment of nuclear energy and co-develop multiple large-scale data center campuses.\n\nWilliams (NYSE: WMB) is another leader in helping support the AI power boom. The natural gas pipeline company has several projects underway to increase the supply of gas across the country that should enter commercial service through 2030. The company is evaluating another 30 projects totaling over $14 billion of investment that it could build in the 2027 to 2033 time frame. Additionally, Williams has $5.1 billion of projects under construction to develop and operate gas-power generating capacity for data center customers. It has several additional power innovation projects in the backlog.\nBuilding the physical infrastructure to support AI AI has the potential to be one of the most impactful technologies in history. It can't achieve its immense potential without the physical infrastructure needed to turn chips into AI supercomputers. As a result, companies from Brookfield Infrastructure to NextEra Energy will play a vital role in supporting the AI era, enabling their investors to cash in on the gold rush.\n\nShould you buy stock in NextEra Energy right now?

I mean, was it because okay, Uncle Sam's going to get a taste, Brennan? Is it because Trump thinks, hey, for now at least Xi has leverage when it comes to where Earth? What's the reasoning there, do you think?\n00:18 Brennan\nI think President Trump, you know, his his, he's not a career politician. He's he's been a business person and I I think he looks to corporate leaders as almost like a a shadow cabinet where I think he he wants to meet and and hear the views of if it's Tim Cook or Jensen Wong or, you know, you know, other corporate leaders, you know, as we've seen earlier this year that, you know, after the CEOs of Walmart and Target and Home Depot met with him, you know, the tariffs were kind of de-escalated. So I think President Trump is unique in that he does listen to corporate leaders and I think Jensen Wong, you know, arguably said, you know, this is really, really critical for for Nvidia, but at the same time, I also think, you know, Chinese companies want Nvidia chips. So why why would you, why why would you turn your back on that, that revenue opportunity?\n00:54 Speaker A\nWell, and here Brennan, on this great AI race, you know, AI hardware, AI software, who in your opinion, Brennan, still is in pole position, still is in the lead? Is it is it the US and if so, how long do you think?\n01:03 Brennan\nI mean, certainly, uh, uh, you know, using Nvidia as, you know, they're, Nvidia is very, very far ahead of of its Chinese equivalents. Uh, so I don't I don't think there's any catch up on a Blackwell like chip, uh, coming from a Chinese competitor anytime in the near future. I think I think the two the two countries and really the ultimately the underlying companies are looking at AI very differently. You know, in the US, it's really about an enterprise sale from Anthropic or Open AI really. Uh, at same, in China, the large language models, those are open source. They're literally basically free. You know, there's no mode to, um, a lot of these large language models in China where where the revenue is coming in is going to be on the cloud computing and that's where an Alibaba, 10 cent and Baidu, uh, really are going to be the main beneficiaries of AI via cloud computing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "2 Genius Stocks Nvidia Owns That You Should Buy for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 11:25 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNBIS\n\nAPLD\n\nKey Points Nvidia is a part owner of Nebius and Applied Digital.\nBoth companies benefit from the huge construction projects in data centers.\n10 stocks we like better than Applied Digital ›\nThe reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) say that companies that own more than $100 million in other companies' stocks must report those holdings to the SEC at the end of the quarter. Then, 45 days after the quarter ends, that information is released to the public in a Form 13F . These disclosures tend to capture the attention of investors curious about what stocks are being bought and sold by specific companies they follow.\n\nSome of these investors use this information to influence their own investing choices. While it isn't wise to blindly follow what others are doing, this information can provide some sense of what top-level investors and industry leaders think are the top stocks to own.\nOne industry leader that investors might want to pay attention to is Nvidia , currently the world's largest company. It makes the most popular graphics processing units (GPUs) on the market, giving it significant insight into the industry overall, including what's going on in the artificial intelligence (AI) world.\nNvidia is making so much money from its products that it can't spend it all on growing its own company, so it has started investing in other companies it sees having growth potential. Given its deep knowledge base, investors stand to benefit by paying attention to the companies Nvidia is interested in.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, Nvidia owned shares in six publicly traded companies. There are two that are particularly intriguing, and investors should take a look at them for potential 2026 purchases.\nNvidia owns shares of Applied Digital and Nebius Nvidia reported owning shares of Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) and Nebius Group (NASDAQ: NBIS) . Both of these companies are involved in the data center building boom in different ways. Applied Digital designs, builds, and operates data centers for various clients. These data centers require computing hardware from Nvidia to function, and it's possible that Applied Digital used its stock as a way to finance some transactions with Nvidia.\n\nAnother possibility is that Nvidia believes in Applied Digital, so it took a position in the company as a result. It owns about 7.7 million shares of Applied Digital, or about 2.8% of the overall company.\nThis investment did well for Nvidia in 2025, since Applied Digital's stock price is up 238% this year. Its price spiked on news of 15-year leases with various AI companies, including another major Nvidia investment, CoreWeave . Applied Digital is not profitable right now, but once it has built up its computing footprint, it could turn into a long-term cash-generating machine for investors like Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nNebius is similar: It operates full-stack data centers for its clients. Its growth has been incredible, and it expects that to persist into 2026, with annual recurring revenue (ARR) reaching $900 million to $1.1 billion by the end of 2025. By 2026, this metric is forecast to be between $7 billion and $9 billion. That's huge growth in a short time, and it reflects the insatiable demand for AI computing power.\n\nNvidia also recognizes this and knows that Nebius is a great company to invest in. It owns 1.2 million shares of Nebius, or about 0.5% of the company. Although that's a small chunk of Nebius, if it can continue growing at a rapid pace for multiple years, this small investment could turn into a huge win.\nIs Nvidia a better investment pick? Should you follow Nvidia's lead and buy these two? Both Applied Digital and Nebius have been great picks in 2025. But could Nvidia be an even better pick? Nebius and Applied Digital are both deeply unprofitable and will likely be that way for a few years as they build out to meet the demand created by generative AI workloads.\n\nBut one company that isn't unprofitable and is thriving at the moment is Nvidia. So investors need to ask themselves: Do I want increased risk with potential of higher returns with Applied Digital or Nebius, or do I want great returns with far less risk? The latter would indicate that an Nvidia investment is a better option.\nIt's up to each investor to decide which is the better answer, as the ultimate 2026 winner is impossible to predict.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Applied Digital right now? Before you buy stock in Applied Digital, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Applied Digital wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Billionaire David Tepper Loaded Up on Nvidia Shares in 2025. Should You Follow Him?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points David Tepper increased his Nvidia position by over 6x in 2025.\nNvidia's GPUs are still the most popular computing option available.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTracking the moves of billionaire hedge fund managers is a smart move for investors. While simply following their trades isn't a good idea, seeing what they're doing to confirm your moves is a good gut check. Fortunately, any fund with over $100 million in assets is required to disclose its holdings 45 days after the end of a quarter through a Form 13F.\n\nOne billionaire I keep tabs on is David Tepper, and he spent most of 2025 loading up on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock. At the end of the first quarter, his fund, Appaloosa Management, owned 300,000 shares of Nvidia. As of the end of the third quarter, it now owns 1.9 million. That's a huge number of shares to load up on throughout the year, and it is now the company's fourth-largest holding.\nClearly, there's something here, and I think loading up on Nvidia is a smart move for all investors heading into 2026.\nThe AI buildout still has a long way to go Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , which have been the go-to computing unit since the AI buildout began in 2023. Nvidia's technology stack is second to none, and even as more competition emerges, its chips have remained a top option.\nDemand for Nvidia's GPUs has been incredible, and its CEO Jensen Huang noted during its Q3 fiscal year 2026 (ending Oct. 26) that it's \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. So, while some investors are concerned that an AI bubble will burst, that doesn't reflect reality.\n\nAI hyperscalers are spending all their available cash flows (and sometimes more) to build as much artificial intelligence computing capacity as possible. While headlines suggest that companies are starting to choose computing devices other than Nvidia's GPUs, the reality is that Nvidia cannot meet the computing demands of its clients. Instead of decreasing demand, they are turning to alternative computing suppliers.\nNvidia is still working to ramp up production, which will allow it to deliver monster growth next year and many years beyond, as the demand for AI computing power is expected to last for multiple years. Nvidia's official projection is that global data center capital expenditures will continue to rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. That's incredible growth, especially since the total for 2025 is expected to be about $600 billion.\nTepper can see this, which is why he chose to load up the fund on Nvidia stock in 2025. I think that's a brilliant move, and the recent stock price decline has opened up a massive buying opportunity.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's stock is on sale Nvidia's stock is around 10% off from its all-time high. While that's not a fire sale price, it is a decent chunk off one of the world's largest and fastest-growing businesses. Thanks to the decline, Nvidia now trades for 24 times next year's earnings.\nThat's a reasonable price to pay for any big tech company, let alone Nvidia. With the monster growth expected in 2026 and beyond, today's stock price is a no-brainer. After all, it's cheaper than others like Apple (30 times next year's earnings) and Alphabet (28 times next year's earnings).\n\nNvidia is in a fantastic position to capitalize on the massive data center buildout. The recent sale price is a gift for investors, and I think everyone should be taking advantage of it by scooping up shares. While investors may be growing fatigued by the AI focus, we still have several years to go before we've built enough computing capacity to meet what's necessary. As a result, Nvidia will continue to be an excellent buy.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia Investors Just Got Incredible News for 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 8:24 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nKey Points A Reuters report claims that Nvidia could start shipping H200 chips to China from mid-February.\nThe company is expected to increase its capacity to fulfill more orders from Chinese customers.\nAnalysts expect Nvidia to deliver respectable gains in 2026, but the company could potentially do even better based on the latest developments.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nNvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) gains on the stock market this year may not have been as great as in 2023 and 2024. However, the semiconductor bellwether still managed to clock respectable gains of 37% despite being under pressure at certain times owing to various factors.\nNvidia stock outperformed the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite 's 21% jump by a nice margin. And now, the chip designer is entering the new year with a potentially solid tailwind on its side. President Donald Trump announced earlier in December that Nvidia will be allowed to sell its advanced H200 data center graphics processing units (GPUs) to approved Chinese customers. It looks like the wheels are already in motion, and Nvidia will soon be able to tap the Chinese market once again, according to an exclusive Reuters report.\nLet's take a closer look at this news, and check why it is going to be a big boost for this semiconductor stock in the new year.\nNvidia's Chinese revenue inflow could begin from February 2026 Reuters spoke to three people familiar with Nvidia's Chinese plans. The news agency learned that Nvidia informed its Chinese customers that it plans to start shipping the H200 processors before the mid-February Lunar New Year holiday.\nThe Reuters report claims Nvidia will initially ship between 40,000 and 80,000 H200 chips. Nvidia will fulfill these shipments from its existing H200 stock. Given that each H200 processor is priced at around $32,000, Nvidia could sell $1.28 billion to $2.56 billion worth of these chips into the Chinese market in the first quarter of fiscal 2027, which begins at the end of January 2026.\n\nOf course, Nvidia's agreement with the Trump administration is that it will hand over a quarter of its Chinese revenue to the U.S. government. However, it is still a start, nonetheless, for a company that was frozen out of this market in April 2025 following export controls restricting sales of its advanced AI chips to Chinese customers. More importantly, the third source cited by Reuters in its report stated that Nvidia will bring additional production capacity online for its Chinese customers.\nThe company will start taking orders for the newly added capacity in the second quarter of 2026. This suggests Nvidia is confident regarding the demand for the H200 processors in China. That isn't surprising, as the H200 is around six times more powerful compared to the China-specific H20 processor it was selling there earlier. So, it is easy to see why Chinese tech giants Alibaba , ByteDance, and Tencent are looking to get their hands on these chips.\n\nStory Continues\nAnother point of note is that Chinese government officials may mandate companies to purchase homegrown chips, along with the H200, to support the growth of local technology. This could further reduce the friction for Nvidia to sell its advanced chips in China, a market where it was on track to sell $30 billion worth of AI chips in the current fiscal year before the restrictions kicked in.\n\nThe stock's returns next year could be better than in 2025 Nvidia already has a significant backlog of data center chip orders to fulfill in 2026, standing at around $275 billion. That number is now likely to head higher following the reopening of its access to the Chinese market, which could pave the way for a stronger jump in its revenue and earnings.\nNvidia has a 12-month median price target of $250, per 69 analysts covering the stock. That suggests a potential jump of 36% from current levels, almost in line with the stock's appreciation this year. However, the recent developments have led analysts to boost their earnings expectations from Nvidia in 2026.\nThe current $7.52 earnings per share estimate for next year points toward a potential 60% increase from the ongoing fiscal year's estimated earnings of $4.69 per share. However, those estimates can increase once the additional business that Nvidia is likely to receive from China is factored in, paving the way for a bigger jump in this AI stock in 2026 compared to what it delivered this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "6 under-the-radar stocks to play the AI boom in 2026: BofA\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 7:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRDO\n\nALAB\n\nMTSI\n\nTER\n\nWhile players like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ) are at the forefront of investors’ minds, smaller specialized players are grabbing a slice of the AI spending behind the scenes.\nIn a recent report, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya named a handful of small- to mid-cap companies as the unsung heroes of the semiconductor surge.\n\n\"We mentioned a few companies on the smid-cap side, Credo, MKS, Advanced Energy, MACOM, and Teradyne,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call.\nWhile these companies lack the massive margins of Nvidia, Arya suggests they are currently benefitting from being the primary providers of essential technologies.\nThe scale of the unsung opportunity is staggering. BofA predicts the total addressable market for AI data center systems will exceed $1.2 trillion by 2030, fueled by a 38% compound annual growth rate. Within that, AI accelerators will grab around $900 billion, but that leaves a massive $300 billion slice — one that depends on secondary technologies like networking, cables, and power systems.\nArya breaks down how the pie is divided. For every $100 spent on AI hardware, $15 to $20 goes into networking. A third flows directly into interconnects — the wires and optical components that let GPUs talk to each other. As AI clusters expand, these bits and bolts of the trillion-dollar build-out are seeing a direct benefit.\n\nArya highlights Credo ( CRDO ) for its leadership in active electrical cables. As data centers prioritize \"performance per watt,\" Credo's niche technology is critical. \"They want to make sure that all these GPUs talk to each other, very effectively,\" he said.\nHe also pointed to Astera Labs ( ALAB ) and its robust high-speed connectivity efforts via PCIe 6.0, the standard for moving data between a computer's motherboard and its hardware.\n\"They were the ones who invested in specific technologies ... nobody cared about these categories,\" he said. \"So now, they are benefitting from being the only people standing in those specific niche technologies.\"\nOther key players, such as MKS Instruments ( MKSI ) and Advanced Energy ( AEIS ), provide the precision power and vacuum systems needed to actually build chips. If Nvidia is the architect, these companies provide the machinery and high-voltage power to keep the site running.\nMeanwhile, MACOM ( MTSI ) provides high-speed analog and optical components that let these \"brains\" interact, while Teradyne ( TER ) serves as a final checkpoint. The company's automated testing equipment ensures these expensive components actually work before they are shipped.\n\nStory Continues\nStill, a healthy dose of skepticism is required. Unlike Nvidia, which can sell a single GPU for $30,000, the interconnect players like Credo and Astera face a brutal reality: pricing compression.\n\"Of course, they are not going to get these multiples forever,\" Arya said.\nArya warns that transceiver prices often fall from $1 per gigabit to $0.50 in just a few months.\n\n\"They can never hold pricing right, so you will never see them quite grow as fast as the accelerator or the logic companies,\" he explained. While their gross margins are currently 35%-40%, they are nowhere near Nvidia's \"different galaxy\" levels of 70% plus.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Nvidia Stock Is ‘Ripe’ for Gains in 2026, According to This Top Analyst\n\nSristi Suman Jayaswal\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThe semiconductor industry remains at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI)-led investment cycle, fueled by massive cloud spending, accelerating infrastructure buildouts, and a multi-year push toward advanced computing. While market sentiment has wavered at times, the long-term demand backdrop for chips tied to AI remains firmly in place.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has been the defining winner of this boom, transforming itself from a graphics pioneer into the backbone of modern AI data centers. After a historic run, however, 2025 brought a noticeable slowdown. Shares trailed several chip peers as investors grew cautious, weighed valuations, and questioned whether the AI trade had moved too far, too fast.\nMore News from Barchart Tesla + Robinhood + FedEx’s Unusually Active Put Options Could Deliver $Big Income Over the Next 30 Days\nCisco Systems Stock Is Treading Water - How to Use Puts and Calls to Play CSCO\nHere’s a Smart Way to Trade Robinhood (HOOD) Stock Without Going into Lottery Mode\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today!\n\nThat pause has only heightened interest at Cantor Fitzgerald. With AI-linked stocks pressured by risk-off conditions and bubble fears, the brokerage firm argues the market is losing sight of the broader opportunity. Analyst C.J. Muse believes those concerns are overdone, pointing instead to a fresh AI demand inflection taking shape. With next-generation architectures approaching, demand visibility improving, and valuations resetting, Cantor foresees Nvidia’s current setup as increasingly attractive heading into 2026, making it “top pick.” Let’s look at it closely.\nAbout NVIDIA Stock Santa Clara-based Nvidia has spent decades building itself into one of the most influential technology companies on the planet. What began as a gaming graphics specialist evolved into a computing powerhouse spanning data centers, networking, automotive, and advanced software.\nIts CUDA platform entrenched Nvidia deeply within developer workflows, shifting the company from a component supplier to an industry standard. Today, under Jensen Huang, Nvidia stands as a dominant force with global reach and immense financial scale, currently boasting a market capitalization of nearly $4.6 trillion.\n\nNvidia's operational dominance has translated into a stock story marked by sharp runs, healthy pauses, and strong long-term structure. NVDA has rallied aggressively through 2025, only stopping periodically to consolidate gains. After peaking near $212.19 in late October, the stock is down by 11.67%. Even after that dip, shares of the chip giant remain firmly in an uptrend, up over 41.9% year-to-date (YTD), and 22.9% over the past six months.\n\nStory Continues\nPlus, NVDA has surged recently on a mix of analyst optimism and strategic developments. For instance, after Cantor named it a top 2026 pick, and BofA reiterated a “Buy” with a $275 target on NVDA after a new licensing deal with AI firm Groq, the stock price rose.\nMomentum also followed reports that NVDA plans to resume H200 AI chip shipments to China by mid-February, pending approvals, marking the first major U.S. export of advanced AI chips since prior restrictions, boosting investor confidence despite lingering regulatory risks.\n\nTechnically, the chart suggests stabilizing momentum. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which pushed into overbought territory above 70 in October, has eased back toward the mid-to-high 50s. That’s a constructive zone, indicating excess froth has been worked off. More importantly, the RSI is turning upward again, signaling improving momentum and renewed buyer interest rather than fading demand. Trading volume has returned to normal levels, suggesting the stock is taking a breather and moving sideways rather than seeing heavy selling or investors rushing for the exits.\nThe MACD oscillator reinforces that view. The MACD line remains above its signal line, indicating a bullish broader trend. Meanwhile, the histogram has flipped back into positive territory this month, signaling strengthening upside momentum. Taken together, NVDA’s technical setup signals the stock is catching its breath and not losing momentum, with the overall trend still looking solid as it prepares for the next move.\nNvidia’s valuation can seem rich at first pass. The stock is priced at 42.85 times forward earnings and roughly 21.5 times sales, levels that tower over most peers. But context matters.\nAt the same time, Blackwell-based deployments are only beginning to scale, with a broader rack-level upgrade cycle forming around Blackwell and the upcoming Vera Rubin GPUs. With earnings growth still accelerating, the premium reflects forward visibility rather than excess, suggesting valuation is being anchored by what lies ahead, not just what’s already priced in.\n\nNvidia Beats Q3 Revenue and EPS Estimates Nvidia’s third-quarter update had a familiar ring to it – strong numbers, confident outlook, and little sign of fatigue. On Nov. 19, the stock rose nearly 3% as the company delivered results that comfortably cleared Wall Street’s bar and were backed by confident guidance. Revenue grew 62.5% year-over-year (YOY) to $57.01 billion, while adjusted EPS rose 60.5% annually to $1.30, signaling that size has not dulled Nvidia’s execution.\n\nThe data center segment remained the backbone of the business, with sales jumping 66% to $51.2 billion. Networking emerged as a standout, posting a massive 162% revenue jump to $8.2 billion as products like NVLink, InfiniBand, and Spectrum-X Ethernet saw rising adoption. Gaming continued to show resilience with 30% growth, while the automotive unit quietly built momentum, advancing 32% from a year earlier.\nLeadership struck a confident note throughout. CFO Colette Kress pointed to Blackwell Ultra as the company’s top-selling product, and CEO Jensen Huang said cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. With fourth-quarter revenue projected at around $65 billion, plus or minus 2%, Nvidia’s operating rhythm looks steady and far from slowing down.\nMeanwhile, analysts tracking Nvidia forecast its Q4 fiscal 2026 revenue to be $65.6 billion, and EPS is anticipated to grow 69.4% YOY to $1.44. For the full fiscal 2026, the bottom line is expected to surge 50.9% annually to $4.42 per share and rise by another 55.7% to $6.88 in fiscal 2027.\n\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock? Wall Street’s outlook on Nvidia has taken a noticeably constructive turn, led by Cantor Fitzgerald’s bullish stance. The firm recently reiterated NVDA as a “top pick,” arguing that the AI chip stock’s pullback has created an attractive entry point. With demand trends stabilizing, valuations resetting, and a new product cycle approaching, Cantor believes the market is underestimating Nvidia’s next leg of growth.\n\nThat optimism is echoed at Tigress Financial, which has grown even more confident in Nvidia’s long-term story. Last week, Tigress raised its price target to $350 from $280 and maintained a “Strong Buy” rating, calling NVDA stock the “premier AI investment” on the market.\nTigress points to Nvidia’s dominance in data center computing as the foundation, but sees additional upside from expanding use cases in areas like autonomous driving and healthcare. A steady stream of record quarters reinforces Nvidia’s role as the core engine behind global infrastructure buildouts. With strong cash generation, disciplined capital allocation, and underappreciated growth drivers emerging, Tigress views Nvidia as a long-duration winner still early in its journey.\n\nOverall, analysts are bullish about NVDA’s growth prospects, giving the stock a consensus rating of “Strong Buy.” Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, 44 advise a “Strong Buy,” while two suggest “Moderate Buy,” one advises a “Hold,” and only one suggests a “Strong Sell.”\nThe average analyst price target for NVDA is $256, indicating potential upside of 34.36%. Evercore ISI’s Street-high target price of $352 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 84.75% from here.\nFinal Thoughts on NVDA As 2026 approaches, the questions around Nvidia are less about demand and more about how much of it ultimately flows through the income statement. Data centers remain the anchor, but attention is steadily shifting toward what comes next – Rubin chips, expanding backlogs, and deeper penetration across infrastructure layers.\n\nManagement has already flagged a massive $500 billion order backlog tied to chips and networking, with a significant portion of it expected to land in 2026 alone. Big customers are not slowing either, with hyperscalers set to pour hundreds of billions into infrastructure. Meanwhile, deals like Anthropic’s long-term compute agreement add visibility. Beyond that, Nvidia is quietly expanding into CPUs, software, and inference through partnerships and strategic moves like the reported Groq acquisition.\nCompetition is clearly rising, and geopolitical risks cannot be ignored. Still, Nvidia enters this phase with a solid balance sheet, expanding markets, and a relentless focus on R&D and long-horizon bets across areas like robotics and quantum computing. Those strengths help reinforce its staying power, which is why Cantor's analyst projects NVDA poised for gains in 2026.\nFor long-term investors, the recent pullback looks less like a red flag and more like a chance to add exposure to a market leader as it gears up for its next chapter.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has a Third of His Portfolio in These 6 Incredible AI Stocks Poised to Dominate in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Laffont is a huge believer in the artificial intelligence (AI) investment trend.\nNvidia and TSMC are slated to thrive due to increased data center spending in 2026.\nThe AI hyperscalers all have strong core businesses to fund their AI buildouts.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nChecking up on what billionaire hedge fund managers have in their portfolios can be a smart idea for investors. This information is publicly released 45 days after a quarter ends through a Form 13F . While this doesn't give up-to-date information on what these hedge fund managers are doing, it at least informs investors on some potential solid stock picks.\n\nOne billionaire I follow is Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management. He has had some incredible success, and after examining some of his top portfolio holdings, it's clear he's bullish on artificial intelligence (AI). About a third of his portfolio is invested in six monster AI stocks, and I think each of these should be owned by individual investors in 2026.\nAll six stocks look primed to excel in 2026 The six AI-focused holdings Coatue Management has are:\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) (7.3% of portfolio)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) (5.9% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manucturing (NYSE: TSM) (5.5% of portfolio)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) (4.7% of portfolio)\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) (4.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (4.3% of portfolio)\n\nAltogether, that adds up to 32.2%, or about a third of total portfolio assets. However, he also has exposure to other AI investments in his portfolio; these are just some of the largest ones. It's clear that this billionaire believes that these six will do well in 2026, and I think he's right on track.\nThe AI buildout is far from over Infrastructure players like Nvidia are set to do well in 2026. The demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) is insatiable, as the AI hyperscalers are looking to get as much computing power online as fast as possible. Nvidia told investors during its Q3 earnings release that it is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs because demand is so high. This bodes well for anyone in this industry, including Taiwan Semiconductor, which is a major chip supplier to Nvidia.\n\nAI buildouts are expected to persist for many years. Nvidia expects global 2025 data center capital expenditures to reach $600 billion. However, that figure is expected to rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.\nIf that pans out, businesses like Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia make for incredible purchases right now. Combine that with the fact that each of these stocks is down a bit from its all-time high, and each seems like a smart purchase.\n\nStory Continues\nMoving to the AI hyperscalers, companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are all spending a ton of money on AI computing capacity. While investors may be getting a bit fed up with these expensive capital expenditures, all four believe that this investment is necessary to stay relevant in the future.\n\nOf these four, Meta may be the most intriguing. Meta's stock fell hard after Q3 earnings. While its growth and profitability were great, investors took issue with management's spending plans for 2026. As a result, the stock plummeted, and it's now the cheapest of these six when valued using next year's earnings.\nAt 21.8 times next year's earnings, Meta is priced about the same level as the S&P 500 index. With Meta expected to deliver market-beating growth, it seems like a no-brainer investment.\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft all operate leading cloud computing platforms. These will be long-term winners, as clients continue to need more and more computing capacity as generative AI workloads become more common. Furthermore, each of these companies also has its own generative AI model or has deep partnerships with one of the major players. This places them in a great position to succeed not only in 2026, but also in the years after.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont has positioned his portfolio wisely to take advantage of the massive AI buildout. I think investors should do the same, and these six are a great place to start.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could 5X by 2030\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points AMD's technology stack is improving.\nAMD's margins could expand to deliver outsized profit growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nFinding stocks that can increase in value 5 times within five years is a lofty goal. That requires serious stock performance, and few companies can deliver that. To achieve 5 times returns in five years, a company must grow at a 38% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) . A 38% CAGR isn't an easy return to achieve, and it requires a massive market opportunity.\n\nWhat's a bigger opportunity than artificial intelligence (AI) ? There are several names in this industry, including AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) . AMD has outperformed rival Nvidia in 2025, rising around 80% versus Nvidia's 35%. Furthermore, AMD gave an incredible growth projection set to come about over the next five years, so it's the perfect candidate to see if it could return 5 times in five years. Management's numbers line up with the 38% CAGR laid out above, giving AMD a real shot at delivering this incredible return.\nAMD's management is bullish on its five-year outlook Frankly, AMD has not done well in the AI revolution. Its hardware isn't as good as Nvidia's, and its software was well behind. However, AMD has made various acquisitions and partnerships to improve its controlling software, ROCm. It noted that downloads for ROCm were up 10 times year over year as of November 2025, so there is a possibility that AMD could start gaining some ground on Nvidia once AI clients realize that AMD's technology stack could compete with Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia has controlled the data center computing market with an iron fist, and this dominance shows up in each company's results. In Q3 2025, AMD's data center revenue rose 22% year over year to $4.3 billion. During Nvidia's Q3 FY 2026 (ending Oct. 26, 2025), its data center revenue totaled $51.2 billion, up 66% year over year. AMD is clearly getting smoked here, but the tides could be changing.\nIn Nvidia's release, they noted that they are \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. This could be a concern for Nvidia, as clients will now likely search for alternative computing providers to fulfill their massive computing power needs. AMD could emerge as a top option to provide this power, and once they realize how far AMD's technology has come, they could become greater clients of AMD's because of its lower price point. That could increase AMD's business in the future, and so could a return to selling in the Chinese market.\n\nStory Continues\nCurrently, neither AMD nor Nvidia is allowed to sell in China. However, they recently made a deal with the U.S. government to give up 15% of revenue for the right to export these GPUs to China. These GPUs aren't the cutting-edge ones used in the U.S. and are specifically downgraded to meet export restrictions. But if this sales channel returns, it could be a huge boost to AMD over the long run.\n\nWhile these are positive catalysts, are they enough to provide the 38% CAGR necessary to return 5 times in five years?\nAMD's guidance is slightly lower than a 38% CAGR Over the next five years, AMD believes it can deliver a 60% CAGR in its data center division. That clears the 38% threshold by a wide margin, but that's not the only part of AMD's business. AMD also has a consumer hardware and embedded processor division, and each of those is expected to grow at a 10% CAGR over the next five years. That brings AMD's total CAGR to 35%, slightly less than the 38% needed.\nHowever, revenue growth isn't the only thing the market looks at. If AMD can achieve outsized profit growth as well, it may be able to surpass the 38% CAGR in profit growth. After all, AMD's margins are far slimmer than Nvidia's.\nIf AMD can improve its profit margin to the 15% to 20% range, that will double the profits it generates from its revenue, providing another growth lever. If AMD can improve its margins and grow at the expected growth rate, I do not doubt that the stock could return 5 times in five years. If it does this, AMD will be a top stock to buy and hold.\n\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

I've got three that I believe will crush the market in 2026, and I think investors should have some healthy exposure to them.\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) , and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) make great buys. These three all operate in different areas, and are poised to continue 2025's success or make a huge comeback.\n1. Nvidia Nvidia is the world's largest company by market cap . However, that isn't stopping it from growing at an unreal pace. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) and the technology to support them, which are the preferred computing units to train and run artificial intelligence (AI) models. Nvidia expects monster growth in 2026, as the AI hyperscalers have all informed their investors that they will be spending a record amount constructing data centers in 2026.\n\nThis bodes well for Nvidia, but it has one problem: It's sold out of cloud GPUs. With demand so high for its GPUs, it can start taking orders for computer graphics years in advance. This is what gives management confidence to provide a mind-blowing projection: It expects global data center capital expenditures to total $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's up from 2025's $600 billion, and if Nvidia's projection pans out, it will be one of the best stocks to own in 2026 and beyond.\nFurthermore, Nvidia's stock really isn't all that expensive. It trades for 24 times 2026's earnings, which isn't bad considering the multi-year growth it's expected to deliver.\n2. The Trade Desk The Trade Desk has had a bad year. It is currently the worst-performing company in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) for 2025, down around 70% this year. That's a horrendous 2025 for one of the leading advertising software providers, but it's not because the company is necessarily doing poorly.\n\nIn Q3, The Trade Desk's revenue rose 18% year over year. The only issue is that The Trade Desk's revenue growth rate is slowing, thanks to rising competition and a poorly executed rollout of its new AI-powered platform, Kokai. However, part of The Trade Desk's decline was an elimination of the premium the stock used to trade at. Now, it's actually undervalued.\nThe Trade Desk now trades at less than 18 times 2026's earnings, making it a solid value in today's expensive market. I think The Trade Desk will mount a solid comeback in 2026 and provide market-beating returns along the way.\n\nStory Continues\n3. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre hasn't had as bad a year as The Trade Desk, as it's still up around 17% for the year. However, that's about market-matching growth, which is disappointing considering MercadoLibre's long-term outperformance.\nMercadoLibre is the dominant e-commerce and fintech company in Latin America. It's essentially a combination of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) , and shareholders have reaped the rewards of owning MercadoLibre as it has rapidly expanded to dominate the e-commerce market in Latin America. It still has a long way to go, and its stock is valued at the lowest level it has seen in a long time.\nAt just 15 times free cash flow, MercadoLibre looks like a steal at these levels. Combine its low price tag with an incredible opportunity to dominate Latin American commerce, MercadoLibre looks like a no-brainer buy. It's down more than 20% from its all-time high established in July. I think MercadoLibre will return to its market-beating status in 2026, making it one of the top stocks to buy for the year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "3 Genius Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 11:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nIONQ\n\nKey Points Alphabet is getting closer to useful quantum technology.\nNvidia recently released a product that will enable hybrid quantum computing.\nIonQ's quantum computer is leading the pack for accuracy.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nQuantum computing isn't as popular a theme among investors now as it was just a couple of months ago, which means that this could be a good time to start considering some top-tier stocks in this segment. Stock prices in the industry are driven by hype at this stage, and when the hype cycle is low, it can offer opportunities to buy in.\n\nWith experts not expecting quantum computing systems to deliver broad real-world advantages over classical computers any earlier than 2030, we have a long way to go before we find out which companies will be the winners in this emerging industry. As a result, I think it's better for investors interested in getting exposure to the technology to spread their investments out across multiple companies -- some that have established businesses in other areas and are also involved in quantum computing, as well as some of the riskier quantum computing pure plays.\nI think a diversified trio of stocks like this one would be a great place for investors to start.\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has become one of the biggest companies in the world thanks to the dominance of Google Search. The profits from ad sales connected to that product have allowed Alphabet to fund other endeavors, such as its popular generative AI model and its dominant cloud computing business. Another area that it's diving into is quantum computing, and it seems to be having some success with that technology.\n\nEarlier this year, the company announced that its Willow chip had run an algorithm that for the first time demonstrated a verifiable quantum computing advantage. This is a huge deal because it shows that viable quantum computing isn't as far away as some may think. While the forecast arrival of generally useful quantum computing is still no sooner than 2030, in some niche cases, it could prove viable sooner than that.\nAlphabet, of course, isn't an all-or-nothing investment in this new technology. The company is a massive and diversified business that uses excess cash flow from its core operations to fund new research. If it can develop effective quantum computing technologies in-house, those will boost its artificial intelligence efforts and increase its cloud computing client base.\nAlphabet's base businesses are set to thrive in 2026, and with plenty of cash to fund its quantum research, its stock is a top pick in the space.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't making a quantum processing unit to compete with all of the various companies involved in this realm. Instead, it's focusing on maximizing its traditional graphics processing units (GPUs). But it's not ignoring the quantum realm.\nNvidia understands that this new technology will likely be deployed in hybrid systems that use both traditional and quantum computers. This will require an interface between the two, and Nvidia released NVQLink to serve just that purpose.\n\nThis ensures that many cutting-edge quantum computing players will be using its hardware and software to interface with classical hardware, making it a perfect investment to bridge the gap between the old and the new technologies.\nWith demand for its AI accelerators not expected to slow down, Nvidia should be a great stock to own while we wait for quantum technology to arrive.\nIonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is one of the risky upstarts that's betting it all on bringing a practical version of this technology to market. There are several other small quantum computing pure plays, but in my opinion, IonQ is the best bet to provide a useful application.\nAll quantum computers are built around qubits (quantum bits), but there are numerous ways to create them. IonQ is taking a relatively unusual approach -- trapped ion qubits. That technology trades some speed for greater accuracy. Right now, IonQ holds the world record for the quantum computing system with the best two-qubit gate fidelity, which is a measure of how unlikely it is for the system to have a result with an error in it after a computation passes through two quantum operations.\n\nThe company has achieved 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity, indicating about one error in every 10,000 operations. That's a huge lead over its rivals, which have yet to breach the 99.9% threshold (one error in every 1,000 operations).\nTime will tell if this head start will be enough for it to establish itself as the top quantum computing provider, but it's a good beginning. IonQ is the leading start-up quantum computing business, so it's my top pick for the high-risk side of this group of investments.\nIf IonQ's approach pans out, it could provide monster returns. If it doesn't, the stock will likely go to $0. However, even if that happens, your investments in Alphabet and Nvidia should be able to pick up the slack, which is why it's smart to balance out risky investments with more conservative ones.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $504,994 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,156,218 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 986 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Trading volume only reached 136.8 million shares, coming in about 27% below versus its three-month average of 188.5 million shares.\n\nFriday's action centered on Nvidia's $20 billion Groq licensing deal and analyst commentary framing it as a strategic AI and data center win that investors are watching for implications on future chip demand.\n\nHow the markets moved today The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.02% to 6,931, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) eased 0.09% to 23,593. In Semiconductors, industry peers Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 0.02% and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) edged up 0.11%, as traders weighed Nvidia-driven AI server momentum.\n\nWhat this means for investors Nvidia acquired assets from chip start-up Groq for about $20 billion. Groq was founded in 2016 by the developers of Alphabet 's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tensor processing unit (TPU), which competes with Nvidia in the field of artificial intelligence workloads.\nThe deal also brought Groq executives, including its CEO, under Nvidia's umbrella. Investors see the move as a way to integrate Groq's AI inference technology, expanding Nvidia's leadership in the sector.\n\nToday's move higher extended Nvidia's recent winning streak with the stock up over 11% in just the past six days.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Still, all three indexes logged gains for the holiday-shortened week. Just three trading days remain in a turbulent year in which tariff jitters, simmering geopolitical tensions, and the rapid growth of AI-related momentum stocks took investors on a bumpy ride. But it was a year that put the three major indexes, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq, on track to register double-digit percentage gains. Stocks on the move on Friday included Nvidia, which gained 1% after the AI chipmaker agreed to license chip technology from startup Groq and hire its CEO. Shares of Target rose more than 3% after the Financial Times reported the retailer is facing activism from hedge fund Toms Capital Investment Management, which has made a significant investment in the company. And U.S.-listed shares of precious metal miners such as First Majestic, Coeur Mining and Endeavour Silver advanced as silver and gold prices touched fresh record highs.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: ASML vs. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points ASML's equipment is essential to producing the world's most advanced semiconductors.\nTSMC has effectively leveraged ASML's equipment to produce the world's most advanced chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) are arguably the two most essential artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the hardware space. TSMC is well known for being the foundry of choice for Nvidia , Apple , and other top semiconductor companies.\n\nHowever, TSMC's success is not possible without ASML. It uses the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines built by ASML to manufacture the world's most advanced chips.\nThis creates a harder job for investors trying to discern which stock is more likely to make the highest long-term gains. Although both companies are critical to this process, investors need to take a closer look to see which is the more suitable stock for them to own.\nThe case for ASML Investors should remember one thing about ASML. Despite ASML's importance, only a tiny client base is interested in its EUV machines, which can cost as much as $400 million each. Worse, political concerns bar what equipment it can sell to countries like China, further adding to that limitation.\nNonetheless, companies such as Samsung and Intel are among the companies buying EUV machines. Additionally, ASML operates in the deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) market. Although the market has more competitors, it also allows it to earn business from foundry companies that produce other types of chips.\n\nFurthermore, such costly equipment needs periodic maintenance. With that, the Netherlands-based company runs a thriving maintenance business that accounts for more than one-third of ASML's revenue.\nAmid the growth in AI, its machines are more in demand, so much so that ASML earned almost 23 billion euros ($27 billion) in revenue in the first nine months of 2025, a yearly increase of 21%.\nAlso, ASML limited expense growth, leading to a net income of 6.8 billion euros ($7.9 billion), a 39% rise from year-ago levels. With the rising profits, the stock is up by almost 50% over the last year.\nInvestors should also note the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. While that is above the S&P 500\naverage of 31, it closely approximates the company's average over the last five years. Considering the demand in AI, such a valuation is unlikely to deter investors from bidding the stock price higher over time.\n\nWhy investors might consider TSMC However, with a larger client base, investors might find TSMC stock more appealing. They might also like its dominance.\n\nStory Continues\nAs mentioned, TSMC makes the world's most advanced chips. While companies like Samsung and Intel have attempted to compete, TSMC's dominant market share continues to grow. As of the second quarter of 2025, that market share reached 70%, giving the company a tremendous competitive advantage.\nThis arguably makes TSMC's biggest threat operating in Taiwan, an island that has dealt with periodic threats of an invasion by China. Since Chinese companies also depend on its chips, the threat could be overblown. Still, it was concerning enough that Warren Buffett reversed a decision by his lieutenants to invest Berkshire Hathaway 's capital in the company.\n\nThat threat has not stopped TSMC's growth. The $87 billion in revenue TSMC earned in the first nine months of 2025 rose 36% compared to the same period last year.\nAlso, like with ASML, expenses grew more slowly than revenue. Still, with other comprehensive losses weighing on the bottom line, its comprehensive income of $35 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 increased by 30% year over year. If not including those losses, net income would have grown by 52%.\nAmid the rising demand and income, TSMC stock is up by almost 50% over the last year. Also, with a 30 P/E ratio, it is cheaper than ASML and trades at a valuation that closely matches the S&P 500 average.\nStill, TSMC has tended to trade at a discount, and for that reason, it is above its average earnings multiple of 25 over the last five years. That makes it unclear whether TSMC is a better bargain, or whether investors feel the geopolitical concerns justify the discounted multiples of the past.\n\nASML or TSMC? Considering these similarities, investors will likely win by choosing either or both stocks. However, choosing between the two probably comes down to risk tolerances.\nTSMC offers similar revenue and stock price growth at a lower valuation. Hence, if one is comfortable with the geopolitical risk, it might make sense to lean more toward TSMC.\n\nConversely, if one feels as Buffett does about the geopolitical concerns, ASML is probably the more suitable choice, as most of its manufacturing takes place far away from geopolitical hotbeds.\nUltimately, investors have the choice between two critical AI hardware stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market. Thus, this is one case where they should assess their risk tolerances and act accordingly.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

The move deepens Nvidia's push into AI inferencing as it looks to extend its dominance beyond chips. Groq, founded by former Google TPU engineers, was valued at just under $7 billion in a recent funding round. Nvidia says it's licensing Groq's technology and bringing key talent on board, not acquiring the company outright, as competition in AI hardware continues to intensify.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: NVDA ) for its inference technology on Wednesday, aiming to boost high-performance AI inference worldwide. The reportedly 20.6 billion cash deal highlights collaboration between the AI chip innovators amid surging demand for efficient inference solutions.\n\nGroq To Remain An Independent Company Groq has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia covering its inference technology. Groq reports the pact focuses on expanding access to high-performance, low-cost inference capabilities. As part of the arrangement, Jonathan Ross , Groq's Founder, Sunny Madra , Groq's President, and other team members will join Nvidia to advance the licensed technology.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nRoss confirmed on X that he would be joining Nvidia and would help to integrate the “licensed technology.” The Groq CEO said, “GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.”\nGroq will remain an independent company, with Simon Edwards stepping up as Chief Executive Officer. GroqCloud services will continue operating seamlessly without disruption.\nNvidia agreed to buy assets from AI chip startup Groq for $20 billion in cash, according to Disruptive CEO Alex Davis, who is associated with Groq’s last financing round in September, as reported by CNBC. Davis said the deal came together quickly, noting his firm has invested more than $500 million in Groq since its founding in 2016.\n\nSee Also: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nDeal Comes After Funding Rounds This agreement bridges two leaders in AI hardware, combining Groq’s specialized inference speed with Nvidia’s vast ecosystem. It comes after Groq’s recent funding rounds, including a $750 million raise earlier this year that valued the firm highly amid AI boom.\nPrior reports noted Groq’s ambitions to rival Nvidia in inference chips, with backing from investors like Cisco and Samsung . The executive transition underscores the technology’s potential, positioning Nvidia to integrate Groq innovations for broader AI scaling.\n\nStory Continues\n“The agreement reflects a shared focus on expanding access to high-performance, low cost inference,” the announcement stated.\nPhoto Courtesy: T.

      "Content": "3 Leading AI Stocks Investors Can Buy for 2026 (NVDA, AVGO, VRT)\n\nEthan Feller\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 10:58 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: VRT\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nThe market, and many leading AI stocks, are at an inflection point. In the near term, further volatility or even a pullback is possible. However, the longer-term opportunity remains compelling, with upside potential that extends well into 2026 and beyond.\nAI capital spending is projected to reach an estimated $571 billion in 2026, and Nvidia ( NVDA ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Vertiv ( VRT ) sit at the center of this historic infrastructure buildout. These companies are among the most critical enablers of the AI expansion.\n\nAfter running multiple screens focused on growth, valuation, and margin strength, these three names consistently rose to the top. Collectively, they represent exceptional businesses with durable competitive advantages and strong earnings power.\nDespite their leadership positions, these stocks are not stretched on valuation and in recent weeks have experienced earnings upgrades, giving two of them top Zacks Ranks.\nRecent months have been choppy in these stocks, with prices moving sideways to lower, leaving shares near technically important levels. Whether those levels hold or break in the short term is uncertain, but the risk-reward profile remains attractive at current prices regardless.\nEven if further downside materializes and bearish narratives resurface, any weakness is unlikely to persist given the scale and durability of AI-driven demand. If support holds, these stocks may already be positioning for their next leg higher.\nBelow, I will break down the recent developments, fundamental strength of these businesses and highlight a tactical trading plan using the technical charts.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia Stocks Breaks Out on Bullish Developments Nvidia continues to anchor the AI boom as the critical infrastructure provider through its leadership in GPU technology. While 2025 was comparatively subdued for the now roughly $4.5 trillion semiconductor giant, with shares delivering a tidy 42% return, the company has remained firmly on offense.\nOver the past week, Nvidia advanced its largest acquisition to date, agreeing to acquire assets from AI chip startup Groq in a deal valued at approximately $20 billion. Groq, founded by former Google TPU architects, develops high-performance inference-focused silicon that competes in certain AI workloads. While Groq described the transaction as a “non-exclusive licensing agreement,” the deal includes the integration of Groq’s CEO and senior leadership into Nvidia, signaling deeper strategic alignment.\nFrom a competitive standpoint, the acquisition strengthens Nvidia’s already formidable moat at the leading edge of AI semiconductors.\n\nStory Continues\nFundamentals also continue to move in the right direction. Analysts have resumed raising earnings estimates, earning Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) . Consensus forecasts for next year’s earnings have climbed nearly 16% over the past two months, and longer-term projections call for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years. At roughly 40.6x forward earnings, the valuation remains reasonable given Nvidia’s growth profile and its central role in the most powerful technology cycle in more than a decade.\n\nThe technical picture has also improved meaningfully. After months of choppy, volatile trading marked by sharp rallies and pullbacks, NVDA has made a decisive bullish turn. During the low-volume holiday period, the stock broke out from a clear descending bullish wedge, marking its most constructive advance in several months. As long as shares hold above the breakout level, the setup points to further upside as 2026 begins.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nBroadcom Shares Consolidate at Key Price Level Broadcom has been a core beneficiary of the AI boom since the trend began, but its importance has become even more apparent in recent months. After being viewed as a relative laggard for several years, Alphabet ( GOOGL ) has reasserted itself as a leader in AI and large language models. A major driver of that shift has been renewed appreciation for Alphabet’s proprietary hardware stack, most notably its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which Google has deployed internally for nearly a decade.\n\nBroadcom plays a critical role in that ecosystem. While TPUs are branded as Google-designed chips, Broadcom provides the underlying expertise in ASIC design, networking, and high-speed I/O, effectively enabling Google to scale these systems reliably at hyperscale. As Alphabet rapidly expands AI infrastructure across Search, cloud services, and generative AI models, custom silicon becomes economically unavoidable. Broadcom sits squarely at the center of that transition, helping design chips optimized for inference, training, and internal workloads, areas where generic GPUs are often less cost-efficient. As Alphabet’s AI leadership has become clearer, Broadcom’s strategic importance has risen alongside it.\nFrom a fundamentals perspective, Broadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) , reflecting a pause in earnings revisions rather than any deterioration in outlook. Consensus estimates still call for 35.7% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, and the stock trades at roughly 36x one-year forward earnings. Given that growth profile and Broadcom’s deep entrenchment in the AI infrastructure stack, valuation remains reasonable relative to peers.\n\nTechnically, Broadcom had been outperforming much of the AI complex in recent months as investors increasingly recognized its role within the Alphabet AI ecosystem. The sharp selloff following its most recent earnings report was less about weakening fundamentals and more about positioning and nuanced guidance, a classic “sell-the-news” event after a strong run. Importantly, shares found support at a level that has held up the stock since late summer. As long as that support holds, the consolidation looks constructive, and the near-term technical outlook remains encouraging.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nVertiv Stock Sits Within Trading Range Vertiv remains one of the purest plays on the physical backbone of the AI buildout, supplying critical power, cooling, and thermal-management solutions to hyperscale and enterprise data centers. Recent developments continue to reinforce that positioning. Over the past several months, Vertiv has announced expanded partnerships with large data center operators and hyperscalers, while management has highlighted strong backlog growth and improving visibility tied directly to AI-driven capacity expansion. Demand for high-density cooling solutions continues to exceed expectations as next-generation AI workloads push power and thermal limits higher.\n\nFundamentally, the story remains compelling. Vertiv currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as earnings estimates continue to trend higher. Consensus forecasts call for 30.2% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, reflecting operating leverage, improving margins, and sustained AI-related demand. While the stock trades at a 40.6x forward earnings multiple, that valuation appears justified given Vertiv’s growth rate, expanding addressable market, and increasingly important role in AI infrastructure.\nThe technical setup adds another layer of appeal. After a sharp advance earlier in the cycle, VRT has spent recent months consolidating within a well-defined trading range. Importantly, the stock recently bounced cleanly off support within its rising channel. The key level to watch on the upside is the ~$180 area, which marks the top of the current range. A decisive breakout above that level would likely signal the next leg higher, while continued support near the lower end of the channel keeps the risk-reward profile attractive.\n\nTaken together, Vertiv offers a differentiated way to participate in the AI boom—not through chips or software, but through the indispensable infrastructure that makes large-scale AI deployment possible. With fundamentals strengthening and the technical picture improving, VRT remains well positioned as investors look ahead to 2026.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy Shares in VRT, NVDA and AVGO? Taken together, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Vertiv offer complementary exposure to the core layers of the AI buildout—compute, custom silicon and networking, and physical infrastructure. While near-term volatility is always possible, fundamentals, earnings momentum, and long-term demand visibility remain firmly intact. With each stock positioned at a critical point in the AI value chain and trading near technically important levels, the current setup favors accumulation opportunistically as the AI investment cycle extends into 2026 and beyond.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Nvidia's Groq deal underscores how the AI chip giant uses its massive balance sheet to 'maintain dominance'\n\nLaura Bratton\nUpdated Fri, December 26, 2025 at 10:33 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nMU\n\nXAAI.PVT\n\nNvidia’s ( NVDA ) licensing deal with chip startup Groq ( GROQ.PVT ) shows how the tech giant is leveraging its massive cash pile to sustain its preeminence in the AI market.\nNvidia this week said it struck a non-exclusive deal with Groq to license its technology and hired the startup’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, its president, and other employees. CNBC reported the agreement to be worth $20 billion , marking Nvidia’s largest-ever deal. (The company declined a request for comment on the figure.)\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note to clients Thursday that the Nvidia-Groq deal “appears strategic in nature for NVDA as they leverage their increasingly powerful balance sheet to maintain dominance in key areas.” Nvidia’s cash inflow climbed more than 30% from the previous year to $22 billion in its most recent quarter.\n\"This transaction is ... essentially an acquisition of Groq without being labeled one (to avoid the regulators' scrutiny),\" added Hedgeye Risk Management analysts in a note Friday.\n\nThe move is just the latest in a string of AI deals by Nvidia, the world’s first $5 trillion company . The chipmaker’s investments in AI firms span the entire market, ranging from large language model developers such as OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) and xAI ( XAAI.PVT ) to “neoclouds” like Lambda ( LAMD.PVT ) and CoreWeave ( CRWV ), which specialize in AI services and compete with its Big Tech customers.\n\nNvidia has also invested in chipmakers Intel ( INTC ) and Enfabrica. The company made a failed attempt around 2020 to acquire British chip architecture designer Arm ( ARM ).\nNvidia’s wide-ranging investments — many of them in its own customers — have led to accusations that it’s involved in circular financing schemes reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. The company has vehemently denied those claims.\nGroq, meanwhile, was looking to become one of Nvidia’s rivals.\nFounded in 2016, Groq makes LPUs (language processing units) geared toward AI inferencing and marketed as alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units).\nTraining AI models involves teaching a model to learn patterns from large amounts of data, while \"inferencing\" refers to using that trained model to generate outputs. Both processes demand massive computing power from AI chips.\n\nWhile Nvidia easily dominates the chip market for AI training, some analysts argue that Nvidia could soon see greater competition in the inference space. That’s because custom chips like Google's ( GOOG ) TPUs (tensor processing units) — and arguably Groq’s chips called LPUs (language processing units) — may be better suited for certain tasks. LPUs, for instance, are faster and more energy efficient when used for certain models, utilizing a type of memory technology called SRAM within the chips. On the other hand, Nvidia GPUs rely on off-chip HBM made by companies like Micron ( MU ) and Samsung ( 005930.KS ).\n\nStory Continues\nRoss, the Groq CEO, said in a recent interview that the upstart aimed to provide chips for half the world’s AI inference computing needs — and cheaply.\n“What we want to do is we want to drive the cost of compute as close to zero as we can get it. Every year we want to make it cheaper,” he told Indian business outlet YourStory . Notably, Ross already helped create Nvidia’s greatest source of competition: The executive led the development of Google’s first-generation TPUs.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst CJ Muse said Nvidia’s \"acqui-hire\" of Groq talent and licensing of its intellectual property showed the chipmaker “is playing both offense and defense” in the AI space. Muse said the deal would allow Nvidia to take “even greater share of the inference market.”\nNvidia shares rose more than 1% Friday.\nOthers on Wall Street were more confused by Nvidia’s move and its potential $20 billion price tag. Hedgeye Risk Management analysts argued that Groq's chips are \"still unproven\" when it comes to large AI models, due to their low memory capacity.\n\"Groq's current technology is greatly limited to only a small subset of inference workloads,\" added DA Davidson analyst Alex Platt.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nVance Cariaga\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 9:39 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 in Tesla’s (TSLA) stock four years ago, it would be worth about $13,700 today, thanks to a 37% price gain since late December 2021.\nThat’s a solid profit, but it falls well short of the massive returns you’d have gotten with other high-profile stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) or Alphabet (GOOG). The next four years could be a lot more lucrative for Tesla investors — or a lot worse.\n\nWhat could a $10,000 Tesla investment today look like by 2030? Here’s what a couple of experts had to say.\nAlso see the Tesla investing mistake that could cost you thousands .\nThe Bull Case A $10,000 investment in Tesla today could be worth twice that much by 2030 if the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle (EV) maker reaches certain benchmarks, according to Chad Cummings, an attorney and certified public accountant (CPA) at Cummings & Cummings Law who previously worked in finance and tax.\n\nBut for that to happen, a lot of things would have to go the right way.\n“If Tesla scales its energy storage segment and increases paid software penetration above current rates, [its] position could exceed $20,000,” Cummings told GOBankingRates. “The S&P 500 at an 8% compound rate places the same $10,000 near $15,900, which is the realistic hurdle Tesla must beat. Even so, there are some major headwinds.”\nThose headwinds include “litigation and regulatory exposure” that could drive Tesla’s downside more than macro trends, according to Cummings.\n“A single autonomous-related fatality that triggers a regulatory halt can cut Tesla’s valuation by tens of billions within days,” he said. “The insurance and legal systems still have yet to fully price in autonomous driving and the results, which creates something of a hot potato.”\n\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nLooking Beyond the EV Market Another thing to keep an eye on is how Tesla’s non-EV businesses perform over the next few years — mainly its energy generation/storage and other services. These businesses are considered by many to be the stock’s main growth drivers.\n“A $10,000 investment in Tesla right now depends less on the EV side than people think,” said Edward Corona, founder of The Options Oracle AI Trade Manager . “I honestly don’t believe Tesla’s main focus is cars anymore — but they still need the car business to keep the money flowing while they build everything else. And Elon has about one trillion reasons now to make sure the long-term plan pays off.”\nThe “one trillion reasons” comment refers to Musk’s new compensation package , which could be worth about $1 trillion if certain milestones are met.\n\nStory Continues\nBy 2030, a $10,000 investment will “come down to whether Tesla can use the EV side to fund the bigger vision without letting margins fall apart,” Corona told GOBankingRates. “If they balance that right, the stock could look a lot different in a few years. If they don’t, investors will feel it. Tesla’s future isn’t about selling cars — it’s about whether the rest of the plan actually gets executed.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia’s AI Cash Machine: The 1 Metric Proving Its Dominance Isn’t Going Anywhere\n\nRich Duprey\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:39 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nQuick Read Nvidia ( NVDA ) reached a $4.6T market capitalization driven by dominance in AI chips.\nConcerns have grown that Nvidia will lose its top dog position as competition grows.\nBut there is one number that shows the fears may be overblown.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) has become the face of the AI revolution. Its graphics processing units have powered the breakthrough advances in generative AI, enabling applications from chatbots to image generation and beyond. As a result, the company has experienced enormous growth, reaching a market capitalization of $4.6 trillion.\nAnalysts and investors remain focused on growing competition in the AI chip market, where Nvidia faces pressure to continue advancing new, more powerful chips to stay ahead. The belief is that it must innovate rapidly with architectures like Blackwell and Rubin to maintain its lead, or risk ceding the field to the competition.\nYet one key number has emerged that underscores why Nvidia remains the undisputed king of AI -- and is likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future.\n\nGrowing Competition in AI Accelerators Despite Nvidia's dominance, concerns persist about potential market share losses. Competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ), and Marvell Technology ( NASDAQ:MRVL ) are gaining traction in AI chips. Major cloud providers and tech giants, including Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) with its Trainium chips and Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) with Tensor Processing Units, are developing custom accelerators to reduce or replace their reliance on Nvidia's products.\n\nThese in-house efforts aim to lower costs and optimize specific workloads, particularly inference. Analysts project that custom silicon from hyperscalers could account for a larger portion of the AI accelerator market in coming years. Big Tech companies continue heavy investments in their own chips, partnering with designers like Broadcom to challenge Nvidia's position.\nThe Power of Nvidia's Installed Base It is true that Nvidia can't rest on its laurels amid this intense competition. It must sustain rapid innovation cycles and expand its software ecosystem, including CUDA, to keep developers tied to its platform as the data center buildout continues. However, the company's existing strengths provide a real and durable substantial moat.\n\nUsing data from company reports and UBS estimates, analysts at Creative Strategies compared Nvidia's data center compute revenue from all of its GPU generations -- Ampere, Hopper, Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and beyond -- and compared them to peers including AMD, Broadcom, and Marvell. The results are staggering: Hopper revenue alone exceeds the combined compute revenue of all its rivals combined .\n\nStory Continues\nFrom the beginning in early 2023 when the AI revolution really sprung into the public consciousness until today, Hopper GPUs remain a dominant force for growth. Even as Blackwell and Rubin ramp up, Hopper's ongoing sales -- driven by the massive installed base for training, inference, and other workloads -- outpace competitors' collective offerings.\n\nWhile the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs now surpass Hopper and will accelerate their growth in the quarters to come, Hopper's sustained cash flows provide a revenue foundation for Nvidia's aggressive R&D for future architectures. This has funded the development and production of Blackwell and Rubin, allowing an annual release cadence that competitors struggle to match. The prior-generation chips reinforce Nvidia's dominance while enabling advances that widen the performance gap.\nKey Takeaway This single metric of Hopper revenue surpassing all peers combined illustrates Nvidia's structural lead in AI. The installed base generates enormous ongoing revenue, supporting innovation and locking in customers to its ecosystem, which deters share erosion.\nWhile competition intensifies, Nvidia's position remains as strong as ever. Investors can confidently view any significant price weakness as a buying opportunity for Nvidia stock. Given the chipmaker's history of leadership in powering the AI revolution, and no clear threat to its dominance, investors can be assured Nvidia's leadership atop AI will remain well into the future.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Nvidia makes boldest move yet, and the fallout begins\n\nFaizan Farooque\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nNvidia recently struck a $20 billion deal to acquire the brains of a fierce rival, marking its biggest move to date in the AI arms race. However, the massive chip manufacturer may soon have to respond to more difficult inquiries about the future of its chips.\nCEO Jensen Huang offered further detail in an internal email obtained by CNBC .\n\nThe move comes as Nvidia is getting more attention in Asia. Megaspeed International, a fast-growing Singapore-based importer of Nvidia chips, is being looked into for possibly smuggling banned H100 and H200 chips into China, according to a recent Bloomberg report .\nThe world's most valuable chipmaker is now stuck between two extremes: It has to deal with rising geopolitical threats and regulatory difficulties in one of its hottest regions while still dominating AI infrastructure around the world.\nNvidia buys brainpower, not branding, in record-breaking Groq deal Groq, a nine-year-old firm started by former Google TPU engineers, was never for sale — at least not in public. But Nvidia came in with a $20 billion deal that includes licensing Groq's cutting-edge AI inference technology and bringing on its top leaders, such as CEO Jonathan Ross.\nSources informed CNBC that Nvidia is really buying all of Groq's assets, except for a small GroqCloud firm, even though Groq called the purchase a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"\n\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nThis is Nvidia's biggest deal ever in terms of money. The price of $20 billion is over three times what Groq was worth in its most recent investment round, which was $6.9 billion.\nIt also beats Nvidia's previous record, the $7 billion purchase of Mellanox in 2019, by a wide margin.\nKey takeaways on Nvidia-Groq deal: Nvidia now controls Groq’s high-speed inference chip designs, allowing tighter integration into its broader AI platform.\nGroq’s leadership, including Ross and president Sunny Madra, will join Nvidia’s leadership team.\nThe remaining GroqCloud unit will continue operating independently, led by its CFO.\nThis aggressive move is like Nvidia's smaller but similar AI acquisition in September, when it spent $900 million for chip IP and key staff from Enfabrica.\n\nU.S. authorities zero in on Nvidia's Southeast Asian partner As Nvidia continues to lead in AI, it is being caught up in the sticky politics of the semiconductor supply chain .\nMegaspeed International, which used to be a small part of a Chinese gaming company, is now Nvidia's biggest customer in Southeast Asia. But U.S. investigators are now looking into the company because it may have smuggled prohibited AI chips into China.\n\nStory Continues\nRelated: Oracle just made a power move Wall Street can’t ignore\nThe dispute is over the difference between the number of chips Nvidia claimed to have for Megaspeed and what was found during inspections. This might put Nvidia in the sights of regulators who are already making it harder to export goods.\n\nThe H100 and H200 chips at the center of this drama are subject to U.S. trade restrictions aimed at curbing China’s AI ambitions.\nSingapore is becoming a popular place for AI startups, but U.S. officials are still worried that they might be diverted to other countries through regional partners.\nNvidia has repeatedly insisted it complies with all export laws, but the Megaspeed case could test that stance.\nThere is no proof of wrongdoing, but the optics are bad. Nvidia now has to convince both investors and authorities that its record-breaking expansion isn't causing problems with AI compliance.\nThe financial stakes are rising Some analysts, such as Loop Capital, say that Nvidia's value might reach $6 trillion in a year, after it just exceeded the $4 trillion mark, Bloomberg reports . Its AI chips power everything from Google's data centers to OpenAI's models. But as Nvidia's profile grows, so does the scrutiny from regulators.\n\nNvidia is solidifying its dominance over real-time workloads in the AI chip market with its Groq integration.\nThe corporation has full control over AI infrastructure, since it has a growing collection of chip IP, developer tools, and cloud services.\nBut probes like Megaspeed's could lead to stricter laws around the world or make it harder for companies to export.\nInvestors can clearly see that although Nvidia is outpacing its competitors in technology, its vulnerability to geopolitical events now poses a significant risk.\nAs 2026 nears, the world's top AI company may face more than just speed and size; it may also face scrutiny.\nRelated: Microsoft sends harsh message to millions of Microsoft 365 customers\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 26, 2025, where it first appeared in the Economy section.

Today, it’s up another $5 in premarket.\nNike is still showing big signs of life after plummeting on weak Chinese sales and guidance.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAfter finding strong support at $170, Nvidia ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) continues to ramp higher.\nLast trading at $190 in premarket, NVDA is up on news that it agreed to pay $20 billion to acquire assets from Groq, an AI startup. From here, given the strength of the AI boom, we’d like to see NVDA closer to $200 before the year is over.\nHelping, just days ago, Barclays upgraded NVDA to a buy on stronger AI spending.\n“We are OW as the company has long-term sustainable growth led by a large lead in GPUs for AI in DC, with further Edge opportunities (autos, robots, etc.) and a competitive moat around a large portion of the market,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC.\nEven better, Wedbush’s Dan Ives says NVDA could see $250 by the end of 2026. In fact, he argues that the market is still underestimating how critical NVDA is to AI.\n\n“The reality is there's one chip in the world, fueling the AI revolution, and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out, numbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15% to 20% at a minimum going into 2026. You put that together, I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a base case to end 2026,” said Ives, as quoted by Yahoo Finance.\nMicron Just the other day, Micron ( NASDAQ: MU ) knocked it out of the park with earnings and guidance. Today, it’s up another $5 in premarket.\nAs noted by CNBC, the stock is up after DigiTimes reported that, “citing industry sources, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are raising prices for their fifth-generation high-bandwidth memory 3E chips by nearly 20% for 2026 deliveries.”\n\nThis comes just days after Micron crushed earnings and guidance.\nAs we reported just days ago, Micron’s EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share. It also expects revenue to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter.\nNike Nike ( NYSE: NKE ) is still showing big signs of life after plummeting on weak Chinese sales and guidance.\n\nStory Continues\n“However, Apple’s Tim Cook sees value, having just bought $3 million worth of Nike stock at the bottom of trend. Cook, who has been on the NKE board since 2005, bought 50,000 shares at an average price of $58.97 a share. Robert Swan, another Nike director, bought about $500,000 of stock on Dec. 22 at an average price of $57.54,” we noted just last week.\n\nTechnically, after catching support at $56.99, Nike is just starting to pivot higher again. Last trading at $60, we’d like to see it refill its bearish gap at around $66 initially. Nike is also just starting to pivot from oversold reads on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

I'm Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sazi. Let's fire up three things you need to know on this day after Christmas trading session. First up, I remain on Santa Claus rally watch as the Grinch may not rip this from the mouths of the bulls. Stocks flirting with fresh records as the Santa rally period is now underway. A little news you can use here.The Sox have enjoyed a Santa Claus rally in nearly 80% of the last 50 years. The largest Santa Claus rally of the 21st century occurred from late 2008 to early 2009. During this period, the S&P 500 advanced 7.4% in a much needed rebound following the steep sell-off in October 2008. Plus, the year's red hot run up in precious metals has broken new ground today, no pun intended, actually it was.I wrote this. Gold is at another record. Silver is at a new record and up 40% in the past month. Quick fun fact here. Shares of top gold and silver miner Freeport McEbra are up a sizzling 28% in the last month. The stock has shot up 8% in the last five sessions alone. Hope that earnings report is good from them in a few weeks. And Nvidia has made its largest acquisition ever buying assets from 9-year-old AI chip startup Gronk.For roughly $20 billion Grok was just valued at $6.9 billion in the $750 million capital raise three months ago. Grok founder and CEO Jonathan Ross will join Nvidia as an employee, while Google Ross, while at Google Ross designed custom chips that the tech giant would go on to train its AI models on. Ross is no joke. Let's get a check on the markets here on the day after Christmas.And uh you can see it right there. Things are looking pretty meager out there, thin trading volumes, not much going on, but the markets are open for business.Alright, investing in AI has been a moneymaker in 2025, with big tech stocks like Nvidia and Alphabet helping to drive up the NASDAQ more than 20% this year. But there are growing concerns that AI stocks could be overvalued and headed for doom in 2026. I spoke to Wedbush tech analyst and tech bull Dan Ives about all this.Dan, good to see you. Don't know where to start, so I'm gonna start on Nvidia. Uh, I mentioned at the top, we're seeing, uh, the Bulls return to Nvidia, uh, not in a big way, but I would say in a nice way. What's the play there?\n2:17 spk_1\nLook, I think the reality is China's going to reopen, you know, for Nvidia, and I think that's something that wasn't necessarily factored in fully. I think investors are realizing it's a big change in the Beltway. And look, Saz, the reality is there's one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution, and, and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out, numbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15 to 20% at a minimum going in 2026.Put that together, I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a base case to end 2026.\n2:51 spk_0\nAnother case for Nvidia, Dan, is, is it this, and you can tell me if I'm wrong, you know, you and I have, have known each other for, for many, many years. It's OK. We have a debate here, um, that Nvidia has less exposure to OpenAI than its rival AMD because AMD might be partially owned by OpenAI in 10 years.\n3:10 spk_1\nLook, right now, the reality is, is that, you know, associated with open AI is a bad thing. Now I disagree with that. Just, I mean, you've talked about it, but no doubt from a trade perspective, Nvidia, you know, they're obviously like they're not wed to an open AI, and I think to some extent.You know, I think you've talked about it. When you look at the divergence of those related to OpenAI, you know, whether it's Oracle or Microsoft or whatever it may be, you know, those stocks are obviously under more pressure. But look, my view is, as we go into 2026, investors are underestimating the scale and scope of the.AI revolution for Nvidia, for OpenAI, for Oracle, which I think is table pounded here despite, you know, obviously a lot of the negative sentiment for Palantir and others, because look, only 3% of companies in the US have gone down the AI path, and for the first time in 30 years, the US is ahead of China when it comes to tech.\n4:06 spk_0\nDan, later on in the show, I'm gonna have uh Marianne Bartels on, uh, really excited to talk to her. She's making the case that tech might see, her words, not mine, a reset year next year, but then go off on a very strong bull run looking out over the next decade. If there is a reset in tech, let's just say the first quarter next year, what, what triggers that?\n4:25 spk_1\nYeah, look, and she, and she obviously always has great thoughts.I think my view is, look at the white knuckle moments, whether they're resets or whatever you may call it, like they create the opportunities. I mean, go back to, you know, we'll be at CES again, go back to a year ago, right? I mean, Jensen comes out, the black leather jacket, I think even maybe potentially diamond studs in the back or whatever.You know, talk about Quantum.\n4:48 spk_0\nI think that's your jacket, Dan. I think\n4:49 spk_1\nthat's your, I, I think that could be your jacket dollars, but, but, but we, we're getting off topic. But the point is, look, the reality is negative on Quantum. Remember the sentiment going to the deep seek moment in January. You're gonna have these moments, but my view is like you're in year 3 of an 8 to 10 year buildout of the AIrevolution.\n5:09 spk_0\nOutside of, uh, Nvidia. I love what some of the thoughts you've been putting on your X account, Dan, on, uh, Tesla.Now, I, I'm sure you saw the photos of Waymos getting stuck in San Francisco with the power outage, and my first thought was, uh, this is everything that could go wrong with the Tesla robotaxi.\n5:27 spk_1\nLook, my view is 2026 is going to be probably the most important year, I'd say maybe in its history for Musk and Tesla, because look, the autonomous chapter now comes to Tesla, 30 cities where we see robotaxis, you know, ultimately in the United States. Are there going to be issues? Are there going to be speed bumps? Could there be?Delays here and there, yeah, I mean, obviously you saw the blackout in terms of Waymo in San Francisco, but look, I think next 3 to 4 years, 20% of vehicles are going to be autonomous, and I think that ultimately is where it's heading. And that's why I think when it comes to physical AI plays, the best physical AI plays in the world are Nvidia and Tesla.\n6:10 spk_0\nHow much value, Dan, are you assigning to Tesla's robotics initiatives?\n6:16 spk_1\nA trillion is what conservatively we view. I mean, look, if you, if you own Tesla here, you're not owning it for what deliveries look like on Jan 2nd, right? I mean, you're owning it for autonomous robotaxis, and we talk about bulk case 3 trillion, base case 2 trillion. Now look, if I showed you a year ago where numbers were going to go for Tesla this year, you'd be like, oh, the stock's 200, 250 bucks.The reality is that investors are looking through deliveries and near term numbers to understand what the autonomous chapter is going to ultimately bring, because I could argue.Numbers could be up 4, 5x when you look out over the next 456 years. I think that's the way to, to view a name like Tesla.\n7:06 spk_0\nDan, uh, before, I want to get to pound here, but why I love you and many reasons why, uh, as you know, but one is you covered damn, you, you covered damn near everything. So if Tesla's going to dominate in robotaxis, what does that mean to a General Motors and a Ford who are not really playing in this industry at all?\n7:22 spk_1\nWell, first of all, to lump GM and Ford together, I disagree. I mean, I think, I think what Mary's done and Paul at GM has been Hall of Fame moment for them, right? And the stock, I think, speaks for that. They've been able to navigate supply chain issues, pull back on EVs, but I believe like GM is in a much better situation.And again, they're gonna kind of pick their spots. Ford obviously much more back against the wall, and we see that in terms of what far we're trying to navigate. Look, I think what it means for the GM and Ford's, they gotta pick their spots. They gotta figure out how they're gonna go down the autonomous chapter. Do they eventually partner at one point with Tesla? I don't think that that's out of the realm, given where we see the autonomous world heading.\n8:08 spk_0\nAnd Dan, making some good points here. General Motors shares up about 56% year to date. Ford about 35% year to date. They're just coming off a big, almost $20 billion charge uh to their EV business. Dan, so on Palantir, I know you're watching this name. Is this, is Palantir double next year? And if so, why?\n8:24 spk_1\nI think it's a $1 trillion mark cap next 2 to 3 years. I, I think investors are underestimating how disruptive Palantir is on the enterprise. We've justWe, they, they've, they've just started to tap into that market on the commercial business. So, now, is it's super expensive, of course. But if you look at the next 345 years, like I view it as like, it's gonna be the next Salesforce, the next Oracle, however you want to think about it in terms of, on the software side, and I think Carp's playing a different game. He's playing chess.You know, as a mastered wizard, and I think a lot of others are playing, uh, you know, checkers at the kids' table.\n9:02 spk_0\nI'm, I'm loving this comparison or this duel that erupted in the fall, Dan, between Mark Benioff and Alex Carp, kind of taking shots at, you know, the other out there in media and, and X, I believe. If, if Palantir is a winner, then is Salesforce a loser?\n9:17 spk_1\nLook, I don't think Salesforce is a loser because I believe Benioff's going to be able to turn this around. Agent 4 needs to be successful. They're probably going to have to do more acquisitions, but no doubt, like, look, Benioff, top of the mountain, the Hall of Fame, Mount Rushmore CEO. But for the first time in many, many years, like there's, I won't call it a code red, but like there's a threat to the business model, and I think they have to adjust. And that's why when you look at Palantir with no direct salespeople doing what they're doing.I think that it's a shot across the bow, not just at Salesforce, at ServiceNow with the traditionalsoftware.\n9:53 spk_0\nDan, hit me with a tech stock you hate.\n9:56 spk_1\nLook, Adobe is the one, I wouldn't say hate, but Adobe is the one that's probably under the most pressure, given you think about AI, what it's doing to their business model, what they need to prove, massive success story obviously over the decades. But I think when you think about AI as a threat to a business model, I think Adobe, like, look, they're going through like a turbulent little white knuckle period here.\n10:22 spk_0\nYeah, why do we need, we're not gonna be printing out PDFs anymore, right, Dan?\n10:26 spk_1\nLook, they gotta change, they, they're gonna have to adjust and change part of their business model. But I mean, look, it's no different than Salesforce, no different than Workday. I mean, these are companies like you either pivot.Or stay on the treadmill at 2.0 speed.\n10:42 spk_0\nLastly, Dan, lastly, uh, this may be the last time I see you this year, and if it is, you've been traveling around the world all year, meeting with investors, covering this tech AI revolution. What has surprised you? Is there one thing that has absolutely blown you away this year?\n10:58 spk_1\nLook, I think the thing that's maybe surprised me is just what I ultimately view as the enterprise adoption and how accelerated it's been. Go back to capbacks a year ago, right? Concerns about AI, big tech capbacks.And, and it's ultimately 50% higher than ultimately it was at the beginning of the year. I think that's ultimately the thing that it's that acceleration that surprised me the most. And maybe the other surprise, you know, obviously is, uh, you know, I was hoping for more from the Giants and Penn State, but what are you gonna do? I mean, we, we got another year nextyear.\n11:33 spk_0\nThere's not much you can do, Dan. You know, sometimes we're just at the whims of bad decisions by our sports teams. Uh, Dan Ives, happy holidays to you, my friend. You too. Thanks for making time, man. Appreciate you.Coming up on Morning Brief, I have a few hot trending tickers to shout out. I'll be right back.Welcome back to Morning Brief presented by Robinhood. Let's fire up some trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform. We're watching Nvidia Micron. First up, Nvidia, the chip giant is making its largest deal ever, acquiring the assets of AI chip startup Grok. Nvidia has reportedly paid $20 billion in cash.The companies are calling it a non-exclusive licensing agreement, plus Grok's founder and CEO Jonathan Ross and other executives will officially join Nvidia, where remains of Grok will operate as an independent company likely focused on the cloud business. Nvidia shares are rising ahead of the open.Next, Micron. The company is set to report at a new record as the memory chip maker extends its post earnings rally. In mid-December, Micron posted earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations. One analyst even called the report the best in chip history, outside of Nvidia's May 2023 results, which kicked off the AI stock rally.Finally, I'm watching airlines. Major winter weather bearing down on both sides of the country, set to disrupt holiday travel. Nearly 1000 flights have already been canceled Friday and hundreds just around New York City due to the threat of a major snowstorm. Between 5 to 9 inches of snow are expected, starting late Friday afternoon and into Saturday. Want to stay up to date on the weather? Of course you do. Download the awesome Yahoo Weather app. I use it around the clock. Love this app.All right, from lingering tariff questions and AI's impact on jobs to changing Fed leadership and another election cycle, the list of things that could rip the face off the bulls next year is longer than they think. The investing backdrop may feel perfect today, but that site, that great feeling isn't guaranteed for tomorrow. Jason Bonfield is a global advisory partner and managing director at Stewart Partners. Jason, good to see you here. Biggest concern you have on these markets going into next year?\n13:44 spk_2\nYeah, thanks for having me, Brian. The, the biggest concern I really have is just that, you know, there's going to be a lot of uncertainty. I mean, we have, you know, tariff questions and noise that's just going to be out there that's common in these markets, and, and we also have midterm elections. So I think there's, there's going to be a lot of aspects that come at investors as they go through 2026. And you know those are, that's the biggest thing that I'm thinking about is the noise, because we're going to have volatility because of these coming through, and it's really going to come down toYou know, are we doing the research before they happen, or are they just going to react to it when it happens? Of\n14:16 spk_0\ncourse, Jason, there's so much focus on what is happening with AI in this country, the infrastructure buildout, investors hanging on every single world, a word, a seal like Jensen Wong says in Nvidia. But do you think investors are forgetting that we will have a new Fed chair next year? And if that is in fact the case, can that, whoever that person may be, can they be as, I guess, dovish as the marketexpects?\n14:39 spk_2\nYeah, well, we're definitely going to get a new Fed chair in May, I think. I think that's pretty much locked in. And you know as far as you know the markets and AI, I see a lot of impacts there with what's going to go on withThe interpretation of, is it unemployment going up because of AI and what's happening in that space. And we also have, you know, the baby boomers retiring at a greater scale. So, are we actually going through a weaker economy and does that make the Fed make different decisions?You know, we're going to have to see, but I think AI is going to continue to play in. It's not fully adopted by everyone and not all companies at this point. I mean, Nvidias, as you talk about, are, are definitely at the forefront, but as far as companies translating down and do we see that unemployment, I think that's going to be the big pivoting point that we're all going to look at is, is how are they going to interpret that unemployment number.\n15:33 spk_0\nJason, how will you know when it's time to rotate out of some of these big cap tech plays?\n15:39 spk_2\nYeah. Well, it's an interesting question because you know some people might say the MG 7 or the LG 7 that may happen. But I think the ultimate process here is that the market is broadening out. So a lot of people should be actually reallocating now, maybe not today, on a few of the last trading days in the sessions here, butYou know, from a tax consequence standpoint, but I think you have an opportunity in the forward months coming forward here in 2026, whether it's January that you make a decision to kind of come out of those and reallocate. But I think, I think the point is that you should don't just let those run because that could be a problem as we go forward.\n16:20 spk_0\nWhere do you reallocate to?\n16:23 spk_2\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I, I haven't been a big proponent over the years of international. I think, you know, 1 out of every 10 years that they outperform and we get 7 out of 10 on the broader markets have outperformance. So I like to stay US. So you know my thought is that they've had a good run. They may continue it a little bit into 2026, but you know the dollar mayYou know, not strengthen, but not go down as much as it has, so that may take a little of the air out of those wings. So I'm thinking, you know, take a little out of international, look at the small caps, dollar cast average gym, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping a little cash on the sidelines coming into the front part of the year and just, uh, hold my nose and buy some of the dips when they happen.\n17:02 spk_0\nI'm asking all guests this week, Jason, their one investing resolution for next year. I have about 12 of these things, uh, as I seek to improve what I do here at Yahoo Finance. What's on your plate?\n17:13 spk_2\nYeah, well, I, I just want to, as I mentioned earlier, is that I, I want to have all the information on what I see is going to be the big noise on these midterms. Uh, I, I see that as being a little bit of a volatile factor that people are going to position on, you know, whether you consider that this is a second term for, for the current administration or mid all midterms are bad years. I, I tend to be a little bit more bullish. So, you know, I, I'm hoping for that.\n17:38 spk_0\nAll right, Jason, thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Happy holidays. Uh, we'll be talking to you soon.\n17:42 spk_2\nThank you.\n17:43 spk_0\nAlright, as I was just saying on resolutions, you can always be better, a better family member, a better human being toward others, not in the family and friend circles, a healthier person, hit that gym, and of course a better investor. Anyone that tells you they have the investing game all figured out is, well, a dope. Like on a scale of 1 to 10, think 15 level dopiness. You can tell them that cold hard reality came from me.While it feels as if making money in the market is easy right now, if not for all of 2025, the market could turn on a dime and run you over. Think what would happen if Nvidia came out in a few months and had a key growth rate that slowed quarter over quarter. What if that was backed up with a surprise dose of cautiousness from Nvidia CEO Jensen Wong? Or what if the new Fed chair next year isn't as dovish.The market is currently pricing in that would severely damage the bull thesis on stocks. Whatever the case, markets do not go up in a straight line, and that should mean you try each and every day to improve at the craft of making money in markets. One way to do that is make some investing resolutions at year end and tape them to one of your 8 screens you have at your investing command post. I know you have those 8 screens. I know it.These are my 10 investing related resolutions for next year. Take less management gibberish on earnings calls as gospel, very important.Better understand the intricacies and motives behind executive compensation packages. Hold more weight toward gap financial results compared to non-gap financial results, which often backs out charges and makes earnings look too good. Assign better investing scores for companies clearly seeing profit boosts from new AI actions. Find the next 5 companies likely ripe for an activist investor attack. Go and see an AI data center being built. I need to see one of these being built. I cover these things.Every single day, I need to go see one. I need you to go out there to a construction site and see it. Better track capital expenditures at the 15 largest tech companies. Screen for the 10 cheapest members of the S&P 493, and you can do this on Yahoo Finance via our comparison tool. Become better at spotting the top 5 stock formations. Find one small cap company doing something amazing. Don't forget small cap stocks exist.That does it for Morning Brief presented by Robin Hood. I'll be back in just a moment on Opening bid.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "A Deal With Groq Is Lifting Nvidia's Stock as 2025 Approaches\n\nBill McColl\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:18 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nKey Takeaways Nvidia earlier this week announced a partnership agreement with inference chipmaker Groq.\nThe partnership will have Grog's founder and CEO Jonathan Ross and others from the company joining Nvidia, which is reportedly paying $20 billion for some Groq assets.\nThe trading year is almost over—but Nvidia still has some news to make.\n\nThe chip giant earlier this week struck a deal with inference chipmaker Groq, a non-exclusive licensing pact that according to the announcement leaves the latter company independent—but also has founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra and other members of the company joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) “to help advance and scale the licensed technology.”\nWhy This Matters for Investors Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, has been a powerful stock largely on the back of powerful growth in its business. This week's news of a deal that includes a licensing partnership, the acquisition of some key executives and, reportedly, a multibillion-dollar investment is another signal of optimism about its business.\n\nThe news helped lift Nvidia's shares on Friday, with the stock—up some 40% in 2025 so far—more than 1.5% higher in morning trading. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's trading here .)\nInvestors may be cheered in part by reports that Nvidia is also acquiring some of Groq's assets, with CNBC reporting a $20 billion price tag for them—it's considered Nvidia's biggest-ever acquisition—in an indication of sustained opportunity for dealmaking in the AI sector to close out the year. (Groq referred Investopedia to its statement and to Nvidia; Nvidia in an email said \"We haven’t acquired Groq.\")\nGroq CFO Simon Edwards is set to take over as CEO. The company in September said it raised $750 million at a valuation of $6.9 billion. \"Inference is defining this era of AI, and we’re building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost,\" Ross said at the time.\nWall Street analysts continue to see room for Nvidia's shares to keep rising. The mean price target as tracked by Visible Alpha is $254, well above recently prices around $191. The company remains the world's most-valuable, with a market capitalization above $4.6 billion.\nThis article has been updated since it was first published to reflect comments from Groq and Nvidia and to note recent market action.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferré discuss the deal and what it means for Nvidia investors and the broader AI space.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Brian\nKeith, I've been watching uh, really all day long, um, actually since yesterday, I should say, this Nvidia deal for Groq. And if you zoom out, I think it says so much about the mindset of companies and how the AI bubble, it may only be just beginning, uh despite all this AI bubble talk.\n00:26 Keith\nSure, Brian, and thanks for having me. We're looking at it in a in a similar fashion. It's not necessarily a uh bid for a competitor. It seems like and this is kind of what we've gathered from it is the it's a it's a it's a an investment into capacity expansion beyond the the current um, GPF U platform that Nvidia currently has. Um, it's an investment alongside of uh a competitor in in not only in in the vertical they're in, but also looking at it from aspect of just a capacity growth that seems to be this is a a positive affirmation of that capacity growth that grows beyond what Nvidia currently has in their uh in their vertical. So this is a, in our opinion, a very positive um checkpoint for um where we are in the cycle. Uh there's a lot of questions about where are in the cycle in the infrastructure build and it's overpriced and and have we have we gotten ahead of ourselves. Nvidia with this um investment in our opinion is saying, no, we haven't. Uh there's still a lot to come in this in this investment phase.\n01:31 Brian\nAnd uh I got to give a shout out to one of my uh ex-followers here, watcher of the show, uh sideline 24. One of my resolutions Inez was to go out and visit an AI data center. This user telling me they have he's working on a project out in Arizona to build an AI infrastructure plant. So it's just it's fascinating to see what's happening in this country because of AI. And as question to you on this, which I I haven't seen brought up a lot on this Nvidia Groq deal. Did was Nvidia potentially at risk at losing its number one spot, not today, not tomorrow, but let's say five years down the line to a company like Groq and they figured, why not just pay big now, shell out a big check and then nobody could touch us.\n02:30 Inez\nYou know, Sozzi, I was listening to an investor of Groq uh on his uh channel about what why this is so interesting. And this is basically what he was saying is is that Nvidia is seeing the writing on the wall when it comes to specialized chips because you played that uh sound of Jonathan Ross talking about uh the inference technology that they have. And this is where uh some are seeing that where the money is at with these specialized chips and why Nvidia would pay three times the value of this company. And by the way, Jonathan Ross is seen as an engineering genius within this industry. So, yes, uh it it may be that it the Nvidia chips which are generalized chips, which are good at many tasks are great, but now where the money is being seen going forward, where the reoccurring money may be is in this specialized chip space. And that's why they are essentially uh buying this company in this deal that by the way, is this licensing deal, which is an interesting also format for uh these now we are seeing more and more of these types of deals where the talent goes to the uh goes to now Nvidia where the the company is still um is still sort of more of a shell company and this is because of anti-trust issues to make sure that this goes through. But yes, Jensen Huang, it may be admittedly saying we have a great chip, but now we are now acquiring this specialized chip with Jonathan Ross, did the TPU over at Google. So, uh, it's it's definitely seen as where the market may be going.\n04:31 Brian\nAnd uh I should mention, reach out to Groq. Uh they did decline to make Jonathan available for an interview. Uh Keith, let me get back to you here because really next year, you're getting you're starting to get the sense if we haven't gotten it already. The some of the world's largest tech companies might go hunting in private company land. You know, the companies that have been raising money all the past two years at big valuations, they may go shopping to further boost, you know, their capabilities. Uh what do you think about that?\n05:07 Keith\nWe absolutely think that's that has to happen. In order for the story the story to continue to evolve beyond where it has has started with the quote unquote picks and shovels of the last couple of years. Um, we feel like it justifi the valuations, the story has to continue to to evolve in the spaces that we just haven't really grasped yet. Uh in particular on the private market side, but we've seen um some developments on the private credit side as far as the funding, that would draw some questions as to kind of where how far this can go and how how it will be all capitalized. So, um, in 2026, the story has to continue to evolve away from some of the uh main culprits over the last two years, uh into spaces that the market really hasn't appreciated, um, the AI story to evolve to just yet. So we're looking for that evolution, um, and we feel like it has to come and justifi valuation going forward.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Let's fire up some trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform. We're watching Nvidia, Micron.\n00:10 Speaker A\nFirst up, Nvidia, the chip giant is making its largest deal ever, acquiring the assets of AI chip startup Groq. Nvidia has reportedly paid $20 billion in cash.\n00:23 Speaker A\nThe companies are calling it a non-exclusive licensing agreement. Plus, Groq's founder and CEO Jonathan Ross and other executives will officially join Nvidia.\n00:32 Speaker A\nWhat remains of Groq will operate as an independent company, likely focused on the cloud business. Nvidia's shares are rising ahead of the open.\n00:41 Speaker A\nNext, Micron. The company is set to report at a new record as the memory chipmaker extends its post earnings rally. In mid-December, Micron posted earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations. One analyst even called the report the best in chip history outside of Nvidia's May 2023 results, which kicked off the AI stock rally.\n00:59 Speaker A\nFinally, I'm watching airlines. Major winter weather bearing down on both sides of the country, set to disrupt holiday travel. Nearly 1,000 flights have already been canceled Friday, in hundreds just around New York City due to the threat of a major snowstorm. Between 5 to 9 inches of snow are expected starting late Friday afternoon and into Saturday.\n01:21 Speaker A\nWant to stay up to date on the weather? Of course you do.

      "Content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Bull, Base, & Bear Price Prediction and Forecast (Dec 26)\n\nJoel South\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThe trade war with China was tough on Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) investors. In April, shares hit a year-to-date low below $87 apiece. Like its fellow Magnificent 7 members, Nvidia struggled due to economic uncertainties about the effects of tariffs, as well as due to Chinese AI innovations. Bears saw Nvidia stock falling further because of bearish pressure from the broader market. Yet, some investors remain optimistic for a sustained rebound, and lately that seems to have been the case. The stock returned to all-time highs as some tariff fears dissipated and macro data improved, and Nvidia became the first $5 trillion market cap company.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock continues to recover from the year-to-date low.\nBut with the AI darling rereating from an all-time high, many are wondering where Nvidia stock could go next.\nThis analysis looks at three scenarios and where Nvidia stock could be in 2030.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe bearish argument that prevailed on Wall Street early this year is not entirely gone, though. While the AI rally may continue, it remains speculative, whereas the reasons for Nvidia stock’s decline in the spring were genuine. Given challenges such as being effectively locked out of China, Nvidia may still be at a crossroads right now. We do not know for sure where the stock will go next, but with the data on hand, we can speculate. That’s what we are doing here.\nThree Key Drivers of Nvidia Performance Through 2030 Will Nvidia continue to lead in AI?\n1. AI Infrastructure Dominance: Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market through its H100/H200 GPUs and CUDA software ecosystem. It is tough for Nvidia customers to switch to another supplier. This has allowed the company to dominate the industry, with customers returning year after year. As such, it is well-positioned to capture growth from the $400 billion AI chip market projected for 2030.\n\n2. Data Center Expansion: Its data center revenue has surged from $4.3 billion in Q1 2023 to over $35.6 billion in Q4 2024. Maintaining leadership here requires continuous innovation in GPU architecture and energy efficiency as AI workloads grow exponentially. So far, Nvidia has managed to do that.\n3. Margin Preservation: One of the biggest arguments against Nvidia is that it may not be able to hold on to its massive margins as competitors catch up and become more attractive to Nvidia’s customers. This has not happened yet, and Nvidia has maintained its hold on the market quite well. In turn, this has allowed the company to have industry-leading gross margins at 73% in Q4 FY2025.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction in 2030: Bull, Bear, & Baseline Will it reach new heights or tumble further?\n24/7 Wall St. estimates that Nvidia’s stock price in 2030 will be $491 per share in our bull case, $265 in our base case, and $38 in our bear case. That would represent increases of 160.3% and 40.5%, and a decrease of 79.9%, respectively, from current levels. Each of these estimates comes from a specific scenario analysis of Nvidia’s business segments.\n\nThe Bull Case for Nvidia’s Share Price Assumptions for our bull case are as follows:\nAI growth: Nvidia currently holds about 80% of the AI accelerator market. Analysts project this dominance could continue through Blackwell GPU adoption and CUDA’s software moat. This may allow data center revenue to grow at a 25% CAGR to $351 billion by 2030 vs. $115.2 billion in FY2025. Gross margins could remain above 70% due to limited competition in high-end AI training chips.\nAutomotive and robotics: A 50% CAGR in automotive revenue to $25 billion by 2030 is achievable if Level 4 autonomy reaches even 15% to 20% penetration.\nSoftware: CUDA is already a big part of Nvidia’s moat, but this could get even better if the AI narrative succeeds in the long run. Nvidia could potentially shift this to a SaaS model once more developers become dependent on it.\n\nAll things considered, $491 per share is possible, with around $240 billion in net income if all that revenue materializes and margins hold up. Investors will still have to pay a 50x TTM earnings multiple for the stock. The market cap would be $12 trillion.\nThe likelihood of this happening is quite low, given the amount of ground Nvidia would have to cover.\nThe Base Case for Nvidia’s Share Price Assumptions for our base case are as follows:\nAI growth: Data center revenue can grow at 15% CAGR to $230+ billion by 2030. If Nvidia retains a 60% to 65% market share here, it could reach that goal, especially if competitors keep falling behind.\nAI narrative success: The AI narrative would still have to succeed for Nvidia to reach our base case price of $241. Otherwise, there would be no growth, and investors would quickly slash the growth premium to a discount.\n\nNvidia’s valuation for the base case would be $8.9 trillion. We strongly recommend reading this share price forecast for a more detailed analysis of our base case.\nThe Bear Case for Nvidia’s Share Price You may have noticed the big gap between the base case and the bear case. This is mostly because the bear case assumes that the AI narrative would fail.\nIf that happens, the result would be catastrophic for Nvidia and its stock. The only reason the shares trade at such a high valuation is that the company is directly linked to AI and its prospects. Without it, it will return to being known as a gaming GPU company with some links to crypto mining.\n\nHowever, that scenario is unlikely. AI demand is not going to disappear overnight. However, what can happen is that AI development could slow down. As a result, Nvidia would slow down too. It needs continuous orders from hyperscalers and AI startups to maintain its momentum and strong margins. If AI slows down and companies are no longer willing to run massive AI models at a loss, they’re also unlikely to upgrade their GPUs to whatever Nvidia has to offer. This would crush Nvidia’s margins and turn revenue growth red, and investors would no longer pay a growth premium for the stock. $38 for such a scenario is reasonable, if not a bit rich, considering that would still leave Nvidia with a $932 billion valuation.\nRegardless, our baseline remains at $241 for 2030.\n\nThis Is Why AI Is Not a Bubble and Nvidia Will Reach $10 Trillion\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the company’s revenues from the networking business grew 162% year over year and 13% sequentially to a record level of $8.19 billion.\nCloud service providers and AI-focused data center operators are building large clusters that require high-speed interconnects. NVIDIA benefits from this shift because its networking hardware is tightly integrated with its compute platforms. Customers often buy the full system rather than mixing components from multiple vendors, which increases the total value of each deployment.\nNVIDIA’s growing networking business also supports its margins. High-performance switches and interconnects carry attractive pricing, especially when sold as part of a larger AI system. As cluster sizes increase, networking content per data center also rises, increasing margins.\n\nOverall, AI networking appears well-positioned to support NVIDIA’s next phase of growth. If AI workloads continue to scale, networking could become an even more meaningful contributor to NVDA’s long-term revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2026 networking revenues is pegged at $29.34 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of approximately 126%.\nNVIDIA’s Key Rivals in AI Networking NVIDIA faces competition from Broadcom AVGO and Arista Networks ANET in the AI networking space. Broadcom is a leader in Ethernet switching and custom silicon solutions, providing high-performance chips that form the backbone of modern data centers. Its strong relationships with hyperscalers like Google and Amazon allow it to deliver networking hardware tailored for large-scale AI and cloud workloads.\n\nArista Networks is another important rival, specializing in high-speed Ethernet switches used in AI and cloud environments. Arista Networks’ software-driven architecture and scalable systems make it a preferred choice for cloud service providers building AI clusters.\nNVIDIA’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of NVIDIA have risen around 19.6% over the past six months compared with the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s gain of 17.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA 6-Month Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, NVDA trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 27.52, lower than the industry’s average of 29.29.\nNVIDIA Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies a year-over-year increase of approximately 55.5% and 54.4%, respectively.

      "Content": "Nvidia Signs Licensing Deal With AI Chip Startup Groq\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:06 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nNvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) has agreed to a licensing deal with artificial intelligence startup Groq, a move that could extend its technology portfolio as demand for AI computing continues to expand. Under the agreement, Nvidia paid for the right to use Groq's chip design and plans to integrate the technology into future products, while several Groq executives, including Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Ross, are set to join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology. Groq said it will continue operating as an independent company under a new chief executive, with no financial terms of the deal disclosed.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nNvidia's existing technology already dominates data centers at the center of the surge in AI-driven spending, a position that has made it the most valuable company in the chip industry and provided it with substantial resources to reinvest across the AI ecosystem. Groq, founded in 2016, is among a group of startups and large technology companies developing their own AI chips to compete with Nvidia, and raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion post-funding valuation in September to expand its data center capacity. The company said its outsourced computing business will continue, even as its low-latency chip technology is licensed to Nvidia, which said the design could add new capabilities and potentially open new markets.\n\nThe licensing agreement fits into Nvidia's broader strategy of investing across AI infrastructure while seeking to maintain a lead in inference, or running models once they are developed. The company has pledged billions to projects it believes could support wider AI adoption, agreed to invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI, and taken a stake in Intel, signaling a willingness to work with a wide range of partners as competition intensifies. By incorporating an external chip design alongside its own offerings in hardware, networking, software, and systems, Nvidia appears to be positioning itself to remain central to customers' AI roadmaps as in-house chip efforts at Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) continue to gain momentum.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Futures associated with the Dow were lower by nearly 0.2% in early trading, while those tied to the S&P 500 were fractionally lower. Futures tracking the Nasdaq crept higher. U.S. benchmark crude oil futures were at nearly $58.50 a barrel as the commodity stayed near two-week highs. Bitcoin traded at $88,600, higher than the $87,400 it hit on Wednesday. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a range of consumer loans, were at 4.14%, ticking higher from Wednesday’s levels.\n\nGold, Silver Extend Streak of Highs Gold and silver again touched record highs on Friday as the precious metals continued to see their prices rise. Gold futures were trading around $4543.50 an ounce after earlier pressing as high as $4561.60. Silver futures were at $75.67 an ounce recently after earlier reaching a new high of $75.84. Precious metals continued to add value in December, with silver rising by more than 27% this month and gold adding more than 6%. Silver has more than doubled in value this year, while gold is up by more than 70%. Investors have been pouring into the safe-haven assets as investors anticipate lower interest rates and central banks have been adding to their holdings.\n\nNvidia to Buy Assets from AI Startup Groq Nvidia ( NVDA ) has made a deal with artificial intelligence startup Groq, according to news reports and a post on the startup’s site. Groq in a statement said that Nvidia entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement for the startup’s inference technology.“The agreement reflects a shared focus on expanding access to high-performance, low cost inference,” it said. CNBC reported that the deal include an asset purchase worth $20 billion in cash, citing Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led a $750 million fundraising round for the startup.The move comes as AI stocks have been moving higher to end the year. Nvidia shares were higher by 0.6% in premarket trading.\n\nStory Continues\nFederal Regulators Probe Tesla Door Release Issue The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it earlier this week opened an investigation into Tesla ( TSLA ) after it received a petition saying the mechanical door release for the 2022 Tesla Model 3 wasn’t easily accessible. “The petition cites allegations that the mechanical door release is hidden, unlabeled, and not intuitive to locate during an emergency,” the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation said. The issue is expected to affect about 179,000 vehicles. The NHTSA had opened other investigations into Tesla , including a probe on electronic door lock issues with a different model. Tesla shares ticked higher in premarket trading.\nNike Shares Continue Rise After Apple CEO Stock Purchase Nike ( NKE ) shares continued to rise in premarket trading after the athletic apparel maker helped lead stocks higher in Wednesday’s session. Nike shares gained 4.6% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook, a member of Nike's board, bought nearly $3 million worth of the company’s stock. Despite the surge, Nike shares are lower by 20% so far this year. Nike shares were higher by nearly 0.4% in premarket trading.\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Washington and strategic partners have poured capital into Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ), and that money changes the risk equation for the company's costly foundry pivot. The government's support gives Intel breathing room to push a capital-intensive plan that private markets might otherwise punish.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with INTC.\nIs INTC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nIn Q3 Intel reported solid revenue and a clearer balance sheet after repaying debt and holding meaningful cash. The company keeps its foundry push front and center; that business still loses money, but leadership argues those losses will shrink as yields improve and volumes rise. Nvidia (NVDA) and SoftBank Group (SFTBY) contribute strategic capital and partnership opportunities that pair Intel's logic road map with external AI expertise.\nThe pivot carries real execution risk. Foundry losses run into the billions and management admits some nodes carry higher upfront costs and lower yields in early ramps. At the same time, capacity limits on older, profitable nodes left Intel unable to meet some demand, which complicates near-term margin recovery.\n\nPolicy backing matters. Infusion of cash by the government transforms Intel into a strategic toy, it attracts patient capital and provides company with additional runway to combat the manufacturing headaches. This does not negate the necessity of the fixes to its operations, however. Shareholders still desirous to see consistent yield increases, reduced margins, and a clearer path to foundry profitability.\nAt least, it is the crossroad between industrial policy and a risky, costly technological turnaround that Intel finds itself at now; the market would need to weigh the big picture priority versus immediate financial suffering.\nIs INTC Stock a Buy? Based on the one year price targets offered by 36 analysts, the average target price for Intel Corp is $36.79 with a high estimate of $52.00 and a low estimate of $18.00. The average target implies a upside of +1.74% from the current price of $36.16.Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Intel Corp in one year is $23.92, suggesting a downside of -33.85% from the current price of $36.16. gf value is gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. it is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and the future estimates of the business' performance.

      "Content": "Prediction: 1 Hypergrowth Stock That Will Run Circles Around Nvidia Through 2030\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 1:55 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Nvidia has been the pioneer in AI technology, but it could be overshadowed on the stock market by the memory specialist Micron Technology.\nThe huge demand for memory chips has supercharged this company's growth, and it is trading at a very attractive valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has made investors significantly richer in the past five years. An investment of just $100 in this semiconductor giant five years ago is now worth $1,360.\nNvidia's remarkable gains have been fueled by the terrific demand for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) chips. It is now the world's largest company with a market cap of just over $4.4 trillion. As such, it would be difficult for Nvidia to replicate its remarkable gains in the next five years.\nIts huge market cap, premium valuation, and the rising competition in the AI chip market could weigh on its stock performance through 2030, even though there is a good chance that it may become a $10 trillion company by the end of the decade. However, there is another semiconductor stock that's not just extremely cheap right now but is growing at a phenomenal pace.\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) manufactures memory chips used in data centers, computers, smartphones, and automotive applications. Let's look at the reasons why this company could outperform Nvidia over the next five years.\nMicron Technology is on track to clock stunning growth through 2030 The demand for the memory chips that Micron manufactures is booming, thanks to AI. The high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips that it makes are deployed in large quantities by companies like Nvidia, AMD , Broadcom , Marvell , and others to transport huge amounts of data at high speeds at lower power consumption and low latency to enable AI workloads in data centers.\n\nAnd edge AI devices such as smartphones and computers are now requiring higher dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and storage to run AI workloads. This demand for memory is so strong that there is a shortage of these chips, leading to an increase in prices.\nThis explains why Micron's latest results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended Nov. 27) blew past expectations. The stock rose 8% in extended trading after reporting on Dec. 17. Micron's revenue shot up 57% year over year to $13.6 billion, while adjusted earnings jumped by 167% to $4.78 per share.\nThe company's cloud memory business nearly doubled year over year to $5.3 billion, driven by AI, allowing Micron to crush Wall Street's expectations. The guidance was the icing on the cake. Micron expects its fiscal second-quarter revenue to jump by a multiple of 2.3 year over year in the current quarter to $18.7 billion. Adjusted earnings are projected to increase by a huge 440% to $8.42 per share.\n\nStory Continues\nThe estimates are well above Wall Street's revenue outlook of $14.2 billion and earnings forecast of $4.78 per share. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said on the latest earnings call that the \"growth in AI data center capacity is driving a significant increase in demand for high-performance and high-capacity memory and storage.\"\n\nMicron has raised its server-growth forecast for 2025 to a high teens percentage range, up from the prior expectation of 10%. It expects the server market to keep growing in 2026, a trend that's likely to last through 2030.\nMarket researcher IDC expects global AI infrastructure spending to hit $758 billion in 2029. Accelerated servers that support AI workloads are expected to have a 42% annual growth rate through the end of this period.\nMicron's competitor SK Hynix is estimating a 30% annual increase in the AI memory market through the end of the decade. However, that number could be higher as even custom AI chipmakers are now deploying HBM to make their chips faster and more efficient. Micron, for instance, expects the HBM market to grow at a 40% annual rate through 2028, generating $100 billion in revenue after three years, as compared to $35 billion this year.\n\nAs such, there is a strong possibility that Micron will maintain its healthy growth levels through 2030. Throw in the company's attractive valuation, and it is easy to see why the AI stock is poised to outperform Nvidia through 2030.\nHere's how much upside investors can expect Micron stock is significantly undervalued in relation to the potential growth it can deliver over the next five years. This is evident from the stock's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.53, as per Yahoo! Finance.\nThis multiple is calculated by dividing a company's trailing earnings multiple by the annual earnings growth that it is projected to clock over the next five years. A reading of less than 1 means that a stock is undervalued, and Micron is way below that threshold.\nNvidia, meanwhile, has a PEG ratio of 0.69, suggesting that Micron is the better growth stock of the two. Moreover, analysts have significantly raised their earnings growth expectations for the next couple of years.\nAssuming Micron can increase its earnings by a highly conservative rate of just 10% in fiscal years 2029 and 2030, its bottom line could jump to almost $42.23 per share after five years (using the fiscal 2028 estimate of $34.90 per share seen above as the base). If Micron trades at even 25 times forward earnings at that time (in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple), its stock price could hit $872 in 2030.\n\nThat would be more than triple its current share price. However, bigger gains cannot be ruled out as Micron's rapid growth could be rewarded with a higher multiple in the future, which means that it could indeed run circles around Nvidia through 2030.\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Sells Amazon Stock and Buys an AI Stock Up 1,030% Since 2024 (Hint: Not Nvidia)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nAMZN\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points In the third quarter, billionaire Ken Griffin sold Amazon stock and bought shares of Palantir, a stock up 1,030% since January 2024.\nAmazon's investments in artificial intelligence are bearing fruit, as evidenced by its strong sales growth and expanding operating margin.\nPalantir is growing like wildfire amid demand for its artificial intelligence platform, but the stock trades at an absurd (and unsustainable) valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nKen Griffin runs Citadel Advisors, the most successful hedge fund in history as measured by net gains since inception. Additionally, Citadel outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 8 percentage points over the last three years. That makes Griffin an excellent source of inspiration for retail investors.\nIn the third quarter, Citadel sold 1.6 million shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and purchased 388,000 shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) , a stock that has advanced 1,030% since January 2024. Comparatively, Nvidia stock is up 281% over the same period.\nHere's what investors should know about Amazon and Palantir Technologies.\nAmazon: The stock Ken Griffin sold Amazon has a strong presence in three growing industries: e-commerce , digital advertising, and cloud computing . The company is leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) to increase sales and improve profitability across each operating segment, as detailed below:\nE-commerce: Amazon runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. It has developed generative AI tools for customer service, inventory placement, and last-mile delivery, as well as models that make its industrial robot fleet more efficient. Amazon has also developed an AI shopping assistant called Rufus that is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales this year.\nAdvertising: Amazon is the third-largest ad tech company and the largest retail advertiser, which is one of the fastest-growing categories in the broader digital advertising market. The company has built generative AI tools that let brands create images, video, and audio; Amazon has also developed an agentic AI tool that can research products and create campaigns.\nCloud computing: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud. It has added new platform services, like Bedrock for generative AI application development. AWS has also designed custom AI chips for training and inference workloads that provide clients with a less expensive alternative to Nvidia GPUs. More recently, AWS introduced AI agents that automate software development, security operations, and performance monitoring.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestments in AI are bearing fruit. In the third quarter, Amazon's revenue increased 13% to $180 billion, driven by accelerating sales growth across its advertising and cloud computing segments. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded 60 basis points (excluding two one-time charges) and operating income increased 23% to $21.7 billion.\n\nWall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look reasonable. So, why did Ken Griffin sell Amazon? Perhaps he was simply taking some profits. Whatever the reason, it would be wrong to assume he lost confidence in the company. Amazon is still one of Citadel Advisors' top 10 positions.\nPalantir Technologies: The stock Ken Griffin bought Palantir develops data analytics and artificial intelligence platforms for customers in the public and private sectors. Its key differentiator is ontology-based software, meaning its products are designed around a decisioning framework made more effective over time by machine learning (ML) models. Use cases span supply chain management, retail inventory optimization, financial fraud detection, and battlefield analytics.\n\nLast year, Forrester Research recognized Palantir as the most capable AI/ML platform on the market, ranking it above Alphabet 's Google, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure. The analysts wrote, \"Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market.\" Earlier this year, Forrester ranked Palantir as a leader in AI decisioning platforms.\nThat recognition from industry analysts has come alongside strong financial results. In the third quarter, Palantir's revenue rose 63% to $1.1 billion, the ninth straight acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings more than doubled to $0.21 per diluted share. Management said strong demand for its artificial intelligence platform was key to its strong performance.\nThe problem with Palantir is valuation. Shares currently trade at 119 times sales, which makes it the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 by a wide margin. AppLovin is the next-closest stock at 45 times sales. That means Palantir could lose more than 60% of its value and still be the most expensive stock in the index.\n\nConsider this: Palantir's stock price has increased 11x since January 2024, but its revenue has increased less than 2x. That means the primary reason the stock price has increased is that investors are happily paying higher price-to-sales multiples. Indeed, the stock traded at 18 times sales in January 2024.\nThat figure cannot keep expanding indefinitely. Valuation will matter at some point. When that day comes, Palantir is likely to crash. I'm not sure why Griffin bought shares of Palantir in the third quarter, but investors should not assume he has a great deal of conviction in the company: Palantir does not rank among his top 300 holdings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now? Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be 2026's Top-Performing Artificial Intelligence Stock\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points The market for AI computing devices is massive and growing.\nNvidia is sold out of cloud GPUs.\nNvidia's stock price tag is actually quite reasonable.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) buildout has been ongoing since 2023, but it's far from over.\nThe AI hyperscalers have nearly completed their record-setting capital expenditures for 2025, but they've already informed their investors that 2026 will be a year of even greater spending. While some investors are growing worried over those figures, some of the smartest people in the world think we need more AI computing power, and going against that trend likely isn't a smart move for investors.\n\nInvestors need to find the companies that are slated to cash in on these massive data center buildouts, and there are a handful of companies that can. One of the best to own over the past three years has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . It has delivered investors excellent returns, and seems poised to do so again in 2026.\nWhile I can't say for certain if Nvidia will be the best AI stock for 2026, I'm fairly confident it will be one of the best AI stocks, and it is also an attractive bet that it will outperform the market. These two projections combine to make Nvidia an excellent buy right now, and I can think of few better stocks to scoop up in the last few days of 2025.\nNvidia's dominance appears to be slipping, or is it? Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) and the technology stack that supports them. Combined, Nvidia's technology is the most flexible and easiest to use, and has some of the best performance available. This has made it the go-to computing unit of choice since the AI race began, but investors are worried that the company's dominance is slipping.\n\nHeadlines are filled with rising competition from AMD or how Broadcom has signed another client to spec out a custom AI chip. There are also innovative companies like Amazon that designed their own chip for their cloud computing platform. All of those headlines make it seem like Nvidia's grasp on the market is slipping, but that couldn't be further from the truth.\nIn its FY 2026 third quarter (ended Oct. 26) earnings release, CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. Although Nvidia is ramping up production as fast as it can, it is unable to meet the current computing demands of the market. As a result, clients are starting to look elsewhere to meet their massive computing demands. While they may prefer Nvidia hardware, some computing power is better than none.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, the market for these computing units is expected to be massive. In 2025, Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to total $600 billion. That figure is expected to rapidly increase to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. There is plenty of room for multiple companies to thrive in that space, and with how profitable these devices can be, it's no surprise that there are other entrants to the computing realm.\n\nDemand for AI computing power isn't slowing down, and Nvidia is well-positioned to take advantage of this massive growth.\nNvidia's stock is on sale While the market has remained fairly strong toward the end of the year, AI stocks have sold off. Nvidia recently was down around 15% from its all-time high, giving investors a solid entry price on one of the best companies to own for 2026.\nNvidia's stock trades for 23 times next year's earnings, which is a reasonable price tag to pay for any company.\nOnce you consider that growth is expected to be rapid and persist for several years after 2026, this price tag looks like a steal. However, it requires one thing: AI hyperscalers must keep spending their resources on data centers. If they continue to do that, Nvidia's stock has plenty of room to run. If they do not, it could be a disaster for Nvidia investors.\n\nHowever, all signs point to AI spending continuing to ramp up over the next few years, making Nvidia a fantastic stock to own for 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

But large-caps are attempting to retake the lead, in line with what we&rsquo;ve seen throughout this phenomenal multi-year bull run off the October 2022 lows.\n\nIn any case, the calendar is on the side of the bulls as we remain in the most favorable 3-month stretch of the year that spans November through January. And from a seasonal perspective, the next week of trading tends to lean quite bullish.\nThe Santa Claus Rally &ldquo;If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.&rdquo; &ndash; Yale Hirsch\nWe saw a relatively sluggish start to the Christmas-themed month, with the S&P 500 falling nearly 2% through December 17 th . But the index has come roaring back over the past week and is now up roughly 1% as of Christmas Eve.\n\nThe days surrounding the Christmas holiday have historically been some of the most bullish times of the year. Dating back to 1988, the second day before Christmas (which fell on Tuesday this year) is the most bullish, with the S&P 500 rising more than 70% of the time over the past 37 years. That trend played out again yesterday.\nIt looks like the early December weakness is setting up well for a year-end rally. Today marks the final trading day before Christmas and is also the first day of a period known as the Santa Claus Rally.\nFirst discovered by Yale Hirsch (creator of the Stock Trader&rsquo;s Almanac), the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is a seven-day period that consists of the final five trading days of the year, along with the first two trading days of the New Year. As markets are closed on Thursday for the Christmas holiday (as well as January 1 st for New Year&rsquo;s Day), today marks the first day of the SCR.\n\nSince 1950, these 7 glorious days tend to be overwhelmingly green, as the S&P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3% and is positive nearly 80% of the time. In fact, no other 7 days of the year are more likely to finish higher!\nIf these 7 days are higher, it typically bodes well for the full year. In fact, since 1950, when we have a positive return during this stretch, the S&P 500 gains an average of more than 10% the following year and is higher over 70% of the time.\n\nStory Continues\nYears where markets saw negative returns during the Santa Claus Rally period tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be bought at lower prices later in the year. For example, a negative SCR preceded relatively flat years like 1994, 2005 and 2015, as well as some of the worst years on record like 2008.\n\nAnd while we did see a negative return during the SCR period last year (and still registered solid gains in 2025), the early tariff tantrum provided investors the opportunity to purchase stocks on sale.\nStocks to Watch Chip giant Intel saw its stock fall roughly 2% in early trading on Wednesday, after a report suggested that Nvidia had halted a test to use Intel&rsquo;s production process to make advanced chips.\nNvidia had been in the testing phase of the so-called &ldquo;18A&rdquo; production process, which represented a potential return to manufacturing premium offerings in-house. While Intel touted the technology as a serious breakthrough, the halt raises concerns regarding the practicality of Intel&rsquo;s advanced manufacturing process.\n\nThe negative headline came just months after the two semiconductor companies announced a key collaboration back in September. Under the prior arrangement, Intel agreed to develop custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia&rsquo;s AI infrastructure platforms. In return, Nvidia pledged to invest $5 billion in Intel&rsquo;s common stock, which sent shares notably higher over the past few months. Intel is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Nvidia remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nMeanwhile, gold prices back off slightly from their staggering ascent to all-time highs. Gold producer Agnico Eagle Mines is a leader in the space and has soared more than 130% year-to-date. The company engages in the exploration and production of precious metals including gold, silver, zinc, and copper. AEM stock remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) due to favorable earnings estimate revisions.\n\nConclusion Today marks the second day of the Santa Claus Rally. As we saw, this seven-day stretch is typically positive and has shown predictive power.\nPositive seasonality represents a major tailwind for stocks. Make sure to keep an eye on how markets perform over the SCR period. From all of us here at Zacks, we wish you happy holidays and a prosperous New Year.\n\nDisclosure: Nvidia is a current holding in the Zacks Headline Trader portfolio.

      "Content": "What Is the Smartest Quantum Computing Stock to Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nQBTS\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Pure-play developers like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum are the hottest quantum computing stocks right now.\nBig tech giants are also exploring quantum computing in addition to their established generative artificial intelligence (AI) products.\nNvidia is quietly building a quantum AI ecosystem that stands to benefit, no matter which systems succeed in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOne of the hottest pockets of the artificial intelligence (AI) realm in 2025 was quantum computing. Shares of pure-play quantum developers such as IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum each handily trounced the S&P 500 this year.\nWhat many investors might not fully realize is that several members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are also exploring quantum computing technology alongside their existing generative AI efforts. While Alphabet , Amazon , and Microsoft have received some notoriety around their custom quantum processors, I think there's a more lucrative opportunity hiding in plain sight.\nI'll detail how Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is quietly building a full-spectrum quantum computing suite, and explain why this could be a major catalyst for the company as the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure era begins.\nNvidia is laying the foundation between quantum and accelerated computing At the moment, quantum computing is an exploratory pursuit. While some businesses are assessing how the technology may be integrated within their existing AI framework, quantum technology has little use at the enterprise level today.\nAgainst this backdrop, pure-play developers are primarily focused on research and development right now. IonQ and Rigetti specialize in gate-based approaches leveraging trapped ions and superconducting techniques. D-Wave, for its part, is more niche -- focusing on quantum annealing processes for optimization tasks.\n\nThe main takeaway is that quantum pure plays are currently engaged with the actual physics behind the creation and configuration of quantum bits -- known as qubits -- within new computing architectures.\nAs mentioned, the big three cloud providers have each designed their own quantum processors -- dubbed Willow (Alphabet), Ocelot (Amazon), and Majorana (Microsoft). While quantum computing is not a meaningful contributor to their respective businesses at this time, it's clear that big tech is fascinated by how this emerging technology may eventually impact the broader AI opportunity.\nNvidia's approach is entirely different from that of its megacap counterparts, as well as the pure plays. Instead of building its own quantum computers, Nvidia is seeking to become a bridge between the software and hardware investments necessary to build these systems.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia offers a software platform called CUDA-Q, within which developers can write applications that work across a network of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (quantum processing units). On the hardware side, Nvidia has built a high-speed interconnect called NVQLink. NVQLink represents a pathway for QPUs and GPUs to seamlessly communicate without straining latency and bandwidth.\n\nEssentially, Nvidia's decision to provide a software and hardware ecosystem allows programmers to easily test their AI workloads across a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment. This is a particularly smart move because it positions Nvidia to be a beneficiary regardless of which quantum processor designs or qubit architecture emerges as the market standard down the road.\nWill 2026 be a big year for Nvidia? Nvidia's growth trajectory is directly tied to the budgets of big tech. As the slope of the lines in the chart illustrate, AI hyperscalers are accelerating their capital expenditures (capex) -- suggesting that data center buildouts, networking equipment, and chip procurement remain high priorities.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs suggests that the hyperscalers alone will contribute nearly half a trillion dollars to AI infrastructure in 2026. While this is great news for Nvidia in the short term, AI infrastructure is expected to become a nearly $7 trillion opportunity by the end of the decade, according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a couple of key ideas. First, Nvidia appears well-positioned to benefit from rising data center spend going into next year. More importantly, however, AI infrastructure is shaping up to be a longer-term secular opportunity.\nGiven these dynamics, Nvidia could continue receiving outsized demand for its products as quantum computing becomes a more meaningful contributor to the broader AI narrative over the next several years. So while CUDA-Q and NVQLink may not yet be major contributors to Nvidia's business today relative to its core compute and networking services, I'm encouraged by the company's pursuit of quantum computing and see these products eventually becoming an important storyline in its evolution throughout the AI infrastructure chapter.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a good buy? As of this writing (Dec. 22), Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 24. Considering Nvidia's current growth in combination with Wall Street's outlook, the stock is valued quite reasonably.\nIn my eyes, quantum computing represents just another pillar supporting Nvidia's growth arc as AI continues to dominate the market. For these reasons, I think Nvidia is headed for further valuation expansion heading into 2026 and well beyond -- making it a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Will Rigetti Computing Make a Comeback in 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: RGTI\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Quantum computing stocks have been on a roller-coaster ride.\nThe sector offers a lot of promise -- but also great risks.\nRigetti's latest fall appears tied to a missed contract opportunity.\n10 stocks we like better than Rigetti Computing ›\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) has taken investors on quite the roller-coaster ride in 2025. It entered the year on a strong note thanks to the quantum computing rally in December 2024. However, it crashed nearly 75% from its highs before January was over, thanks to comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about useful quantum computing being a long way away.\n\nHuang quickly pivoted from that stance, and the quantum computing start-up stocks started to rally throughout 2025, before peaking in October. However, the market started to become risk-averse around that time, which caused quantum computing stocks to sell off again. Now, Rigetti Computing sits about 60% down from its high established in October, although it's still up around 50% so far this year.\nSo, will Rigetti make another amazing comeback in 2026? Or will it be stuck in these lower ranges for a while?\nThe real quantum computing winners won't emerge for a few years We're in the early stage of quantum computing development, and knowing who the ultimate winner is not possible. There are private companies, publicly traded upstarts like Rigetti, and legacy big tech companies like Alphabet and Microsoft all developing quantum computing technology.\nWith a crowded industry, it's likely that several of these companies (outside the legacy tech companies) will go bankrupt. This makes quantum computing a high-risk, high-reward sector of the market, which many may not like. If it's too risky for you, there are quantum computing ETFs, or you can invest in one of the legacy tech companies.\n\nHowever, if you're looking to take on a bit more risk in exchange for more upside, Rigetti may be a stock you gravitate toward.\nRigetti isn't a large stock by market cap, as it's valued at around $7 billion. The quantum computing industry could easily be worth several times more than that, with McKinsey & Company estimating that the quantum computing market could be greater than $100 billion by 2035. That's a huge market that Rigetti could capture if it's the first to reach viable quantum computing, making it at least a stock that investors should consider.\nRigetti Computing must rely on outside funding However, Rigetti is showing some signs of weakness that could present a red flag for investors. Because Rigetti doesn't have a legacy business to fund its operations, it must win research contracts to stay solvent.\n\nStory Continues\nOne of the biggest contracts any of the quantum computing companies can win is from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). The winner of this contract will be in line to provide quantum computing hardware to the U.S. military. DARPA recently announced which companies made it to stage B, and Rigetti Computing was not one of them.\n\nFamiliar names like IonQ and International Business Machines made the list, which makes Rigetti's failure to advance from stage A to stage B frustrating for investors. It's also why IonQ is only around 30% down from its all-time high, versus Rigetti's 60%.\nIf you're looking to invest in quantum computing start-ups, you only want to pick the best. Most investors will never be able to understand the complexities and intricacies of quantum computing, so relying on programs like DARPA, which know what's going on, to screen out the winners from the losers is a smart idea.\nRigetti's stock could make a comeback in 2026, but it will likely be based on the broader market's risk appetite. Rigetti may rise in tandem with its peers, but unless it can secure some major quantum computing contracts, I think there are far better quantum computing stock picks for 2026 than Rigetti Computing.\n\nShould you buy stock in Rigetti Computing right now? Before you buy stock in Rigetti Computing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rigetti Computing wasn’t one of them.

Dan, good to see you. Don't know where to start, so I'm going to start on Nvidia. Uh, I mentioned at the top, we're seeing uh the bulls return to Nvidia.\n00:10 Speaker A\nuh not in a big way, but I would say in a nice way. What's the play there?\n00:15 Dan\nLook, I think the reality is China is going to reopen, you know, for Nvidia and I think that's something that wasn't necessarily factored in fully. I think investors are realizing to big change in the beltway.\n00:26 Dan\nAnd look,size, the reality is there's one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution. And and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out,\n00:33 Dan\nnumbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15 to 20% at a minimum going to 2026. You put that together, I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a beast case to end 2026.\n00:45 Speaker A\nAnother case for Nvidia Dan is is it this? and you can tell me if I'm wrong. You know, you and I have I've known each other for for many many years. It's okay. We have a debate here. Um that Nvidia has less exposure\n00:56 Speaker A\nto open AI than its rival AMD because AMD might be partially owned by open AI in 10 years.\n01:02 Dan\nLook, right now the reality is is that, you know, associated with open AI is a bad thing. Now, I disagree with that. just me and you've talked about it, but no doubt in the from a trade perspective.\n01:10 Dan\nNvidia, you know, they're obviously like they're not wed to to an open AI. And I think to some extent, you know, I think you've talked about it, when you look at the divergence of those related to open AI, you know, whether it's Oracle or Microsoft or whatever it may be, you know, their stocks are obviously under more pressure.\n01:27 Dan\nBut look, my view is as we go into 2026, investors are underestimating the scale and scope of the AI revolution. For Nvidia, for open AI, for Oracle, which I think is table pound here despite, you know, obviously a lot of the the negative sentiment for Palantir and others.\n01:40 Dan\nBecause look, only 3% of companies in the US have gone down the AI path and for the first time in 30 years, the US is ahead of China when it comes to tech.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Veteran analyst has blunt message on Intel stock\n\nVuk Zdinjak\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 9:47 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nIntel stock is trading approximately 0.52% lower at $36.16 as of the time of writing. The stock is down, due to a Reuters report stating that Nvidia has decided not to manufacture its chips using Intel’s 18A node (manufacturing process) after conducting some testing.\nIn response to this report, an Intel spokesperson told Reuters the company’s 18A node is “progressing well,” and that it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-gen node 14A.\n\nI have closely followed Intel’s moves this year, and wrote in late September about Intel engaging customers for its fabs: “Intel’s ability to attract customers depends on how the launch of its Panther Lake and Nova Lake CPUs goes.”\nGiven that both CPU lines are set to launch in 2026, at the time, I saw little chance that Nvidia would manufacture anything on Intel’s 18A node until its issues had been completely resolved. We’ll explore this in more detail later.\nVeteran analyst exiting long position in Intel Veteran analyst Stephen Guilfoyle has been long on Intel ( INTC ) for a few months.\nFollowing the news that Nvidia decided not to use Intel’s 18A node, he conducted his analysis, noting that since early August, Intel stock had developed a rising wedge pattern of bearish reversal .\nGuilfoyle offered more detail on TheStreet Pro .\n\nHe added that being long on Nvidia, AMD , Broadcom, and Intel leaves him somewhat overexposed to the space.\nWhat do other analysts think about INTC stock? According to MarketBeat , the consensus rating for Intel's stock is hold, with 20 analysts giving that rating, 6 giving a sell rating, and 5 giving a buy rating. The average target price is $38.09.\n“Importantly, we don’t expect a material improvement in the current unfavorable cost structure for Intel Foundry, given slow internal adoption of 18A node (peak capacity in 2030+) and foundry competition in the U.S.,” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in his research note in October.\n\nHe also explained that Intel stock, trading at a 50 multiple price-to-earnings ratio estimate for calendar year 2027, is overvalued. Arya’s rating for INTC is underperform (sell equivalent), and a price target is $34, based on a 3 multiple of his enterprise value-to-sales ratio estimate for 2027, in line with the historical range of 1.7 to 4.\nWhy Nvidia chips on Intel’s 18A node weren’t going to happen Nvidia sells millions of GPU chips, and it needs a reliable manufacturing process. Even if Intel was going to cover the cost of the defective chips, that would mean the manufacturing would take much longer, depending on how bad the yield rate is.\n\nStory Continues\nIntel hasn’t disclosed yield rates for its 18A node, and its avoidance of the exact answer hints that they are not good.\n\"I would say the yields are adequate to address the supply, but they are not where we need them to be in order to drive the appropriate level of margins,” Intel CFO David Zinsner said during the Q3 earnings call .\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\nJohn Pitzer, corporate vice president of corporate planning and investor relations at Intel, shared his thoughts at the 2025 RBC Capital Markets Global Technology, Internet, Media & Telecommunications Conference.\n“We have [said] in the past that the industry average yield improvement on a new ramp is about 7% per month, and we are now on that curve for Panther Lake, which is giving us some confidence as we launch the product this quarter,” Pitzer said, as reported by Tom’s Hardware .\n\nThe problem with Pitzer’s statement is that it isn’t clear what 7% represents. To illustrate this, let’s say that hypothetically, yields are 10% and they increase by 7% of that 10%, which gives us 10.7%. However, it could also mean that they get a 7% increase, in the sense that they go from 10% to 17%.\nHe said the dramatic increase started about seven or eight months ago, so if it were the latter case, it would mean the yields increased by approximately 56% from whatever the starting point was. If Intel’s yields hit more than 56% and are increasing by 7% per month, it wouldn’t need to keep avoiding the exact answer.\nIn addition to the yield problems, switching to a manufacturing process from another company is not a trivial task. Intel needs to have proof that the switch is worth it. The company was already focusing more on securing major contracts for its next-generation 14A node, due to the difficulties it had in attracting them to the 18A node, as reported by Reuters and Tom’s hardware in July.\nRelated: Bank of America resets Micron stock price target, rating\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 25, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Logan Paul auctions off $5.3 million Pokémon card, urging young people to invest more in nontraditional assets: ‘Don’t be afraid to take a risk’\n\nSydney Lake\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 8:56 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: EBAY\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nHESAF\n\nGC=F\n\nWe’ve all heard the traditional advice that the best investments are those made in the stock market, saving in a 401(k), and buying a house. But younger generations have started touting nontraditional investments like buying a Birkin bag or other collectibles as a surefire way to bring in extra bucks.\n\nInfluencer and WWE wrestler Logan Paul recently said going beyond normal investments can be worth it.\n&#8220;If you&#8217;re young, there are ways to spend and invest your money in ways that might mean more to you than in a traditional conservative environment like the stock market,&#8221; he said on Fox Business&#8217;s &#8220;The Big Money Show&#8221; on Tuesday.\nAnd Paul has certainly gone down the nontraditional path for investing: He recently put up a rare Pokémon card for auction that he bought in 2022 for $5.3 million . The former WWE United States Champion actually used to wear the card—which he says is “the rarest card in the world” and the “Holy Grail”—around his neck during competitions. The card is a PSA-graded 10 Pikachu Illustrator, and only a few dozen copies exist worldwide. But Paul’s card is the only one to receive a 10/10 grade from Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA).\n\nPaul said he plans to auction the card in early 2026 and estimates it will sell for between $7 million and $12 million, which would bank him about $2 million to $7 million. He also argued collectibles like Pokémon cards have “outperformed” the stock market during the last two decades.\n“If you have the money, don&#8217;t be afraid to take a risk, especially if you&#8217;re young,&#8221; Paul said.\nAre collectibles really a good investment? According to global wealth management firm AES , collectibles like wine, manuscripts, vintage cars, rare pieces of art, and more can produce a “ reasonable ” return for investors, but they often don’t come with the same long-term gains of investing in stocks.\nBetween 1900 and 2012, collectibles produced a nominal annual return of 6.4% and a real return of 2.4%, according to the AES report.\n\n“Although the return is reasonable, it’s far lower than the long-term rewards of investing in the equity market,” AES CEO Sam Instone wrote. But, “that’s not to say these collectible items are not for certain investors.”\nStill, Gen Z men have become obsessed with investing in these collectibles, which some argue will beat Nvidia stock and the S&P 500. And they could have a point: Pokémon cards have seen the largest long-term increase in value among all card categories. They’re up 3,261% in the past 20 years, according to data provided to Fortune ’s Preston Fore from Card Ladder. Even a one-year investment is up 46%, which is higher than Nvidia’s 35% jump and the S&P 500’s 17% year-to-date increase.\n\nStory Continues\n“The trading card hobby has entered a new era, driven by technology, innovation, community, and a great balance of modern creativity–with new sets, storylines and characters–alongside good old nostalgia,” Adam Ireland, VP and GM of global collectibles at eBay , previously told Fortune . He also said eBay users searched for “Pokemon” nearly 14,000 times per hour in 2024.\n\nOther collectibles like the Hermes Birkin bag have caught the attention of young investors, who have argued buying one can be more valuable than investing in gold. But recent reports have shown these rare handbags don’t have the same return-on-investment they once did. The average resale premium for Birkin and Kelly bags—a metric that compares the auction price to its retail cost—has fallen from 2.2 times its original value in 2022 to 1.4 times as of November, according to Bernstein Research’s Secondhand Pricing Tracker. To put that in perspective, a Birkin bag originally bought for $10,000 and resold in 2022 would have cost more than $22,000, but a bag originally retailing for the same price and resold today would be worth just $14,000.\nOverall, although investing in collectibles can end in a big payday, they can also be a very risky investment because of liquidity risks, concentration risks, costs and upkeep, the potential for a bubble, and tax treatment, according to an analysis by The Economic Times.\n“It’s also true that some people generate income regularly buying and selling collectibles,” according to Consumers Credit Union. “However, fortunes are determined by the whims of buyers along with the rising and falling popularity of particular items. While the stock market may have a down year, over time it trends to higher value.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could January Spark the Next Big Rally in AI Stocks?\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 8:33 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points The AI-fueled productivity gains are expected to drive a surge in AI infrastructure spending in 2026.\nSolid results from a couple of key companies in this sector should help reinstate investor confidence in AI stocks.\nIt may be a good time to buy a few names in this sector before they go on a bull run in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have hit a rough patch of late. The Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF , which is the largest AI-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF), is down over 5% since the beginning of November.\nConcerns about AI being in a bubble, high valuations, and the huge amounts of debt that certain companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure have been weighing on investors' minds of late. This explains why prominent AI names such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) have been pulling back after hitting 52-week highs in the past couple of months.\nInvestors will now be wondering if AI stocks can witness a turnaround in their fortunes in the new year. Let's check if there is a possibility of a big rally in this sector in January that could set up AI stocks for a solid 2026.\nThe sell-off shouldn't last for long The recent weakness in AI stocks can be attributed to the high valuations of companies in this sector. However, the good news for investors is that they can buy some of the top names in this industry at an attractive valuation right now.\nNvidia, for instance, is trading at just 24 times forward earnings, which is well below the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 32 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). That's quite attractive for a company that's expected to deliver a 60% jump in earnings next year, especially considering that Nvidia has the potential to clock a bigger jump in earnings.\n\nThat's because spending on AI infrastructure is likely to increase even further in 2026. Goldman Sachs estimates that hyperscalers are set to spend $527 billion on data center infrastructure next year, up by 34% from 2025's projected spending. However, it is worth noting that these estimates have moved significantly higher of late.\nGoldman Sachs notes that hyperscalers were initially expected to spend $465 billion in 2026, according to estimates at the beginning of the third quarter. However, that number has increased substantially. A key reason why that's the case is because of the payoff that AI is bringing for its adopters. For instance, customers using Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to connect their data and operations with generative AI tools are witnessing healthy productivity improvements.\n\nStory Continues\nOne of them points out that a problem that earlier took weeks to solve can now be tackled in just five minutes, while another added that a process that used to take nine days to complete is now executed in just seconds. These gains aren't surprising. Market research firm IDC points out that \"every new dollar spent on AI solutions and services by adopters is expected to generate an additional $4.9 in the global economy.\"\n\nSo, it is easy to see the terrific expansion in Palantir's customer base. Its overall customer count increased by 45% year over year in the third quarter of 2025. More importantly, the customers who start using Palantir's offerings tend to go for enterprise-wide deployment of its solutions to maximize productivity gains.\nThis is the reason why Palantir won new contracts worth a record $2.8 billion in Q3, up by 151% from the prior year. For comparison, the company's revenue increased by a relatively slower pace of 63% to $1.18 billion, suggesting that it is winning new business at a faster pace than it can fulfill existing contracts. This situation should ideally lead to an acceleration in its growth in the future, especially considering how much value each dollar spent on AI services could generate for users.\n\nAnd that, in turn, should lead to stronger demand for chips that companies like Nvidia manufacture. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress remarked on the company's November earnings call that the \"demand for AI infrastructure continues to exceed our expectations.\" She added that the three generations of its data center graphics processing units (GPUs) -- Ampere, Blackwell, and Hopper -- are at full utilization.\nIn other words, hyperscalers and AI companies are poised to spend more money on GPUs to train and deploy AI models and inference applications in the cloud. Nvidia itself projects that AI infrastructure spending will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40% through the end of the decade, landing between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in 2030.\nThis is the reason why Nvidia's earnings estimates for the next couple of years have moved significantly higher, a trend that's likely to continue as hyperscalers spend more money to bring online more AI infrastructure to utilize the technology's productivity gains.\nWhy January could be a breakout month for AI stocks AI stocks have played a central role in driving the stock market higher. Again, that's not surprising as the likes of Palantir and Nvidia have jumped nearly 3,000% and 1,000% in the past three years.\nBlackRock , the world's largest asset management firm, anticipates AI to keep driving markets higher in 2026. The firm notes that stocks in this sector are likely to perform well despite periods of volatility. Even Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, a noted tech bull, is expecting AI stocks to rally higher in 2026. And that rally could start as soon as next month when key AI infrastructure companies such as Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) and ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) release their results.\n\nBoth companies are expected to release their results on Jan. 28, 2026. There have been solid signs of strong demand for their chipmaking equipment of late, fueled by AI. Lam Research, for instance, reported a solid increase of 27.5% in revenue in the last reported quarter. Management pointed out on the earnings call that it expects \"the surge in AI data center demand creating billions of dollars of served available market expansion and share gain opportunity for Lam in the coming years.\"\nOn the other hand, Dutch semiconductor giant ASML also posted a bigger-than-expected increase in its bookings in Q3, fueled by AI demand. With the demand for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment used for making AI chips expected to grow in double digits over the next three years, ASML seems poised to deliver healthy guidance.\n\nSo, a solid set of results from Lam and ASML, along with the healthy guidance that they are likely to deliver, should instill confidence in AI stocks as these companies act as a barometer for the sector, which is why it would be a good time to buy the names discussed above before they go on a bull run next month.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Ives is of the opinion that Mr. Market is still underestimating how long and big this AI buildout will be.\n\nHe now sets a head-spinning $250 base-case target for Nvidia by the end of 2026, which represents a 33% gain from its current price at $187.67 (at the time of writing).\nIves is betting that the AI story some investors think they’ve missed is just getting started.\nWall Street listens when Dan Ives talks tech Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities , and he's one of Wall Street ’s most-quoted analysts in the technology space.\nWhat sets him apart is that he isn’t shy in dishing out big numbers on big themes and then explaining his rationale in plain English on TV.\n\nIves has built a rock-solid reputation leaning into tech cycles early, including areas like cloud computing, EVs, and today’s AI-powered stock market boom.\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nHis investing focus is on secular growth, catalyst-driven technology, and a sharp focus on major platform shifts.\nFor perspective, on TipRanks , Ives is rated as a five-star analyst , boasting a 56% success rate across an eyebrow-raising 500 ratings , backed by an average return of about 16% per call .\n\nStory Continues\nThat track record matters immensely, especially when he takes bold positions.\nWhy Dan Ives sees Nvidia at $250 by the end of 2026 For Ives, his massive $250 call on Nvidia has everything to do with earnings power that Wall Street hasn’t fully modeled.\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance , he argues that the market still underestimates how critical Nvidia is to every part of the AI stack, covering everything from training to inference to real-world deployment.\n\nHis incredible conviction in the stock rests primarily on Nvidia’s immense scale and positioning.\nNvidia's 3-year timeline for rewriting its bottom-line positioning Jan. 2022: $9.8 billion baseline year before the AI earnings started to materialize\nJan. 2023: $4.4 billion ( -55% year over year ), a down year as the video gaming giant saw its game-related and data-center demand soften ahead of the AI boom\nJan. 2024: $29.8 billion ( +581% year over year ), the AI inflection point\nJan. 2025: $72.9 billion ( +145% year over year ), when scale kicked in, and margins grew at a breakneck pace, with Nvidia’s AI dominance showing up in profits\nTrailing 12 months: $99.2 billion , representing run-rate earnings that felt virtually impossible just two years ago\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nNvidia sits upstream of hyperscalers, enterprises, and governments that are racing ahead in developing AI infrastructure.\nIves also believes that geopolitical shifts and evolving trade dynamics are currently being mispriced, as enterprise AI adoption remains far from mature.\nSo if estimates move even modestly higher, the math starts to work quickly.\nThe AI buildout is still in early innings The biggest mistake investors continue to make, according to Ives, is that they feel the AI trade is already crowded.\nIn fact, he feels it's the complete opposite, with the market only in year three of an eight-to 10-year buildout , which is why the choppiness hasn’t broken the underlying trend.\nTo illustrate his point further, he says only about 3% of U.S. companies are meaningfully using AI today, with most still in the evaluation or pilot phase.\n\nRelated: A $1 trillion IPO looms, and Amazon may have just locked in early\nHence, Ives focuses a lot less on hype cycles and more on enterprise-related spending . Corporations are budgeting instead of just experimenting in the past.\nIn fact, Goldman Sachs states that AI companies could invest north of $500 billion in 2026 , saying that analyst capex estimates have consistently underestimated the buildout.\nCapital expenditures linked to AI infrastructure have risen a lot quicker than forecasts, surprising investors who were splitting hairs about market pullbacks just a year ago.\nOn top of that, Ives points to a major geopolitical shift at work.\nFor the first time in decades, he feels that the U.S. has regained a decisive lead over China in core technology , which adds new layers to the AI story.\nRelated: Micron surge is bullish for these other stocks, says Bank of America\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 25, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nJordan Rosenfeld\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is not just infiltrating everyday lives; it has been the driving force behind stock market gains for the past two years. From chipmakers to software, anything tied to AI has surged. But investors are starting to wonder what happens if the momentum slows and the market decides AI valuations have gone too far. While no one can predict the future, I asked ChatGPT to look more deeply into the history of stock market bubbles and what might happen if the AI bubble were to burst.\n\nHere are its predictions.\nA Sharp Repricing of AI Stocks A correction in AI stocks would not just be another bad day for tech, ChatGPT warned. Because a handful of companies, including Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, now make up such a large percentage of the S&P 500, their movements shape the entire market.\nIf the market decides these large AI players are overvalued, those big company stocks will be the first to see a rapid decline as well as any company heavily tied to AI infrastructure, ChatGPT said.\n\nBecause these companies now make up a huge share of the market, a correction in even a handful of them could lead to a fall in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. This could lead to an environment similar to the dot-com bubble burst of the early 2000s.\nLearn More: I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Middle Class\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nA Broader Market Correction If the AI market trend reverses, the entire stock market index would likely follow, ChatGPT said. We could be looking at a broad correction of 10% to 20% if sentiment turns and investors begin to question AI revenue projections.\nNot all sectors would be hit equally, however. What tends to happen during sector slowdowns is that investors rotate their money into other areas like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples, ChatGPT noted. That means companies with steady earnings and predictable cash flows tend to look attractive. Thus, investors with diversified portfolios would be less affected than those concentrated in a single theme.\n\nStartup Valuations Could Cool Fast The ripple effects of an AI market correction would also have an impact on startups. Venture funding has been pouring into AI startups with the assumption that adoption will keep accelerating, ChatGPT said. If the market “gets skittish,” these valuations could fall as quickly as public tech stocks. That means less hiring, more consolidation and a good chance that many AI startups might fail.\n\nStory Continues\nLarger companies with strong balance sheets would likely scoop up talent or intellectual property, however, again similar to what happened after the dot-com bust. For workers and entrepreneurs, this could hit hard.\nWill an Economic Crisis Be Coming? The good news for investors is that a complete collapse similar to 2000 or 2008 is much less likely. Many AI companies today generate revenue that’s grounded in other profitable business products or services outside of AI. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon have the funds and the services to withstand a downturn . In the dot-com era, many companies going public had no profits or even customers. ChatGPT said “the fundamentals today are stronger.”\n\nHow Likely Is an AI Bubble To Burst? While an economic crisis is not likely coming, a sharp correction in AI stocks is more likely than not, ChatGPT said. It pointed out that “high-growth sectors tend to overshoot,” and the enthusiasm around AI has created valuations that may be more speculative than accurate in certain areas. A moderate pullback of 15% to 30% in leading AI names would not be surprising.\n\nIt did say that a complete bubble collapse is less likely, however. AI already has real commercial value, and early gains are showing up across industries. Just like the early days of the smartphone, there may be volatility, but the long-term trajectory remains positive.\nWhat Investors Should Focus On Now Everyday investors should expect volatility. The smartest bet is to keep a diversified portfolio , balanced allocation and long-term time horizon to have the best protections.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n10 Kirkland Products Costco Quietly Raised Prices on -- and Where To Buy Instead\n5 Reliable Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Winter 2025\n9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Powerball Jackpot: $1.7 Billion Could Buy 131,645 Ounces of Gold, 3.15 Million Nvidia Shares And More — 10 After‑Tax Spending Ideas\n\nChris Katje\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:46 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThe Powerball drawing set for Wednesday, Dec. 24, is currently the fourth-largest U.S. lottery jackpot ever at $1.7 billion.\nHere's a look at the latest Powerball jackpot and some items you can win if you are the lucky person with the winning ticket.\nThe Powerball Jackpot: At $1.7 billion, the current Powerball drawing is the fourth-largest U.S. jackpot in history and the second-largest of 2025 . The jackpot could grow to be the highest jackpot of 2025, and without a winner drawn on Wednesday, could quickly become the largest jackpot ever.\n\nThe odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million. The overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 24.9 tickets.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\n$100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nLottery players can purchase tickets for $2 each in more than 40 U.S. states, choosing to pick their own numbers or receive a random selection. Five numbers between 1 and 69 are selected, along with a Powerball number 1 to 26. To win the Powerball, a player has to match all six balls in the drawing.\nThe drawing takes place around 10:59 p.m. ET on Mondays, Wednesday and Saturdays. If no ticket matches all six numbers, the jackpot increases for the next drawing.\n\nLottery Winnings: Winners of large jackpots can receive a lump-sum cash payment or be paid the full amount over 29 years in 30 payments. One payment is made upfront and additional payments each year go up by 5% to fight inflation.\nThe cash payout is lower than the full payout over 29 years. The current cash payout listed on the Powerball website is $781.3 million.\nA winner will have to pay federal taxes on the winnings and will be responsible for state taxes depending on where they reside.\nThe IRS takes a 24% withholding on winnings over $5,000. This means that the cash payout for Wednesday's Powerball jackpot would be $593.8 million based on a lump sum cash option after the 24% federal taxes are taken out.\nThe winner could choose to save the money, invest it, or spend it on various items.\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nHere's a look at 10 items that could be considered.\n1. S&P 500: If a winner decides to invest the money, they could consider investing in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ), which tracks the broad-based S&P 500 Index. The $593.8 million could purchase 863,583.48 shares of SPY with the winnings. The S&P 500 averaged annual returns of 10% over the last 30 years, which would be a better return than the 5% return on choosing the 29 years of payouts.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Cryptocurrency: A potential investment for the winner could be to put the money in cryptocurrency, which is often more volatile than the stock market. The winnings could be split between three popular cryptocurrencies of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ), Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE )and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH ). The winnings would turn into 2,251.82 BTC, 1,524,910,118.10 DOGE and 67,191.25 ETH based on prices at the time of writing.\n\n3. Investing with the Oracle of Omaha: Legendary investor Warren Buffett has been one of the top stock pickers of the last 50 years. While Buffett would tell the winner to put their money into bonds or index funds to preserve wealth, the winner could buy 1,188,503.26 B shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK ) (NYSE: BRK ). Of course, Buffett is stepping down as CEO at the end of the year, which may change the future returns.\n4. Nvidia Stock : One of the top-performing stocks of the last 10 years is NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), which is currently the most valuable company in the world, valued at more than $4.5 trillion. Nvidia could remain a market leader for years to come, making it a potential investment idea for someone over the next 29 years. The $593.8 million could purchase 3,151,637.39 shares of Nvidia based on current prices.\n\n5. Magnificent 7 Stocks: One of the popular investment themes in recent years has been buying shares of the Magnificent Seven stocks. The seven components of the popular index are Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) , Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Nvidia and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ).\nHere's a look at how many shares of each the winnings could buy, when split equally seven ways to $84,828,571.43:\nAAPL: 312,122.20 shares\nAMZN: 366,113.82shares\nGOOGL: 269,759.50 shares\nMETA: 127,761.57 shares\nMSFT: 174,271.86 shares\nNVDA: 450,233.91 shares\nTSLA: 175,617.60 shares\nOr an investor could put the lottery winnings into the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (BATS: MAGS ), which tracks the seven stocks.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

Tesla Vehicles: Vehicles from the EV leader are popular with many investors and could be a purchase for a lottery winner looking to flex their winnings in the form of a massive collection and to give away vehicles to family members and friends. The Model Y has a starting price of around $39,990. This means the lottery winner could purchase 14,848 Model Y vehicles, enough to keep and give away.\n7. Real Estate: Another popular investing option for lottery winnings could be real estate. The average home price in the U.S. is $359,241 according to Zillow Group. The winnings could buy 1,652 average-priced homes in the U.S. The winner could hold the homes to gain value over the years or choose to rent them out. Benzinga has a guide on how non-lottery winners can invest in real estate here.\n\n8. Sports Teams: For the ultra-wealthy, buying a professional sports team has been a way to preserve and gain wealth. The after-tax lottery winnings would not be enough to purchase a team in the MLB, NBA, NFL, or NHL. The winner could look to buy a minority stake in a team and gain wealth over time or could dip their toes into ownership in soccer with an MLS team. The New York Red Bulls, Nashville SC, Houston Dynamo FC, FC Dallas, San Jose Earthquakes, New England Revolution, Chicago Fire FC, Real Salt Lake, Orlando City SC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC, CF Montreal and Colorado Rapids are all listed with team valuations under $593.8 million by Forbes , with valuations ranging from $580 million down to $415 million.\n9. Gold: Another popular investment option over the years has been to buy gold , which hit new all-time highs in 2025. The winner of the lottery, who chooses a cash lump sum, could buy 131,645.46 ounces of gold.\n\n10. Superyacht: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is one of the wealthiest people in the world and had no problem shelling out $500 million for a superyacht. The billionaire also spends $25 million annually on the boat and its operation. The winner could buy a superyacht that isn't quite as large or extravagant as the one owned by Bezos.\nThis article is not intended as investment advice.\nThis article was previously published by Benzinga and has been updated.\nRead Next: From Moxy Hotels to $12B in Real Estate — The Firm Behind NYC's Trendiest Properties Is Letting Individual Investors In.\nPhoto: Mehaniq/Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump, giving Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin, Reuters\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:03 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 a.m. Pacific Time on Aug. 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia, AMD, OpenAI, Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\n\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThe transition to Tan comes as Intel is in the middle of an announced $28 billion project to construct microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany . While the factories were originally slated to begin operations this year, that has been delayed to 2030 at the earliest as Intel seeks buyers for the chips those factories are to produce .\n\nStory continues\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 minutes in the Oval Office Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms - Walden International and Walden Catalyst - did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies, including coming to Intel's formal groundbreaking ceremony in Licking County in 2022 .\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nIntel's venture capitalist CEO Born in Malaysia to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger , and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA 'lifeline' for Intel So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Is AMD’s Soaring AI Fueled Share Price Still Justified in 2025?\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:32 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nIf you are wondering whether Advanced Micro Devices at around $215 a share is still a smart buy or if the big gains are largely behind it, you are not alone. This is exactly the question we are going to unpack.\nThe stock is up 8.5% over the last week and 78.3% year to date, building on a 70.3% gain over the past year and a 243.7% return over three years that has reset expectations and risk perceptions for investors.\nRecent headlines have focused on AMD expanding its presence in artificial intelligence and data center chips, including aggressive pushes to challenge Nvidia in AI accelerators and deepen partnerships with major cloud providers. At the same time, ongoing coverage around chip supply chains, US semiconductor policy, and competitive dynamics in GPUs and CPUs has kept AMD firmly in the spotlight and helped fuel the latest moves.\nOn our checklist of undervaluation signals, AMD currently scores a 3/6 valuation score . This means half of the tests suggest the market may be underpricing some aspects of its fundamentals. Next we will break down how different valuation methods look at those signals before circling back to a more nuanced way of thinking about what AMD is really worth.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices delivered 70.3% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Semiconductor industry.\nApproach 1: Advanced Micro Devices Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth today by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and then discounting those amounts back to a present value.\nFor Advanced Micro Devices, the latest twelve month free cash flow is about $5.6 billion. Analysts see that rising sharply, with projections stepping up to roughly $7.2 billion in 2026 and $12.4 billion in 2027, before extrapolated estimates climb further to around $27.9 billion by 2029 and over $59 billion by 2035. Simply Wall St uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, combining these analyst forecasts with longer term growth assumptions to map out the next decade of cash flows.\n\nWhen those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of roughly $302 per share. Compared with a current price near $215, this implies AMD trades at about a 28.8% discount to its DCF based fair value. This suggests potential upside if the projected cash flow path occurs as modeled.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Advanced Micro Devices is undervalued by 28.8%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 904 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\n\nStory Continues\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Advanced Micro Devices.\nApproach 2: Advanced Micro Devices Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like Advanced Micro Devices, the Price to Earnings ratio is a useful way to think about valuation because it directly links what investors pay for each share to the profits the business is currently generating. In general, faster growth and lower risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth and higher uncertainty should command a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nAMD currently trades at around 111.8x earnings, well above the broader semiconductor industry average of about 36.5x and also richer than its peer group average near 58.8x. Simply Wall St goes a step further with its Fair Ratio, an estimate of what a normal PE should be for AMD given its earnings growth outlook, profitability, size, industry and risk profile. For AMD, that Fair Ratio sits at roughly 64.8x, which is already demanding but still meaningfully below the current market multiple.\nThis suggests that, even after accounting for AMD short term growth potential and competitive position, the stock trades at a premium to what its fundamentals justify on an earnings basis.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1460 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Advanced Micro Devices Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple framework that lets you turn your view of Advanced Micro Devices into a clear story behind the numbers by connecting your assumptions about future revenue, earnings and margins to a specific fair value estimate.\n\nA Narrative starts with the company story you believe, links that story to a financial forecast, and then translates the forecast into a fair value you can compare with today’s share price to consider whether AMD looks like a buy, a hold, or a sell.\nOn Simply Wall St, Narratives are an easy, accessible tool inside the Community page, where millions of investors share different AMD outlooks that update automatically as new news, earnings and guidance come in, so the stories and the numbers stay current without you having to rebuild your model.\nFor example, one bullish AMD Narrative on the platform assumes rapid AI data center adoption and arrives at a fair value near $362 per share, while a more cautious Narrative, focused on export controls and margin pressure, lands closer to $137, showing how the same company can justify very different decisions depending on the story you believe.\n\nFor Advanced Micro Devices however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Advanced Micro Devices Narratives:\n🐂 Advanced Micro Devices Bull Case\nFair value estimate: $283.57 per share\nImplied undervaluation vs current price: 23.9%\nAssumed annual revenue growth: 34.73%\nFrames AMD as a long term AI and data center winner, with multiyear accelerator and CPU ramps driving sustained double digit revenue and margin expansion.\nBuilds in rising profitability, with margins moving above 20% as AI, data center, and adaptive computing scale, while operating leverage improves over time.\nSees recent AI supercomputer and hyperscaler agreements as catalysts that justify a premium multiple and a fair value well above the current share price.\n\n🐻 Advanced Micro Devices Bear Case\nFair value estimate: $193.68 per share\nImplied overvaluation vs current price: 11.0%\nAssumed annual revenue growth: 18.84%\nHighlights intense competition from Nvidia, Intel, ARM based designs, and custom silicon, which could limit AMD AI share gains and pressure pricing.\nStresses execution, supply chain, and geopolitical risks, including reliance on TSMC and export restrictions, as potential brakes on growth and margins.\nArgues that while AMD has strong long term AI and data center potential, today’s valuation already prices in much of that upside, leaving less room for error.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Advanced Micro Devices?

      "Content": "Nvidia makes its biggest purchase ever\n\nTobi Opeyemi Amure\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:07 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nAccording to CNBC , Nvidia has agreed to pay about $20 billion in cash for Groq, a specialist in AI accelerator chips used to power inference—the stage where trained AI models actually answer questions, generate text, or drive real-time applications. Alex Davis, CEO of investment firm Disruptive, which led Groq’s latest financing round, told CNBC that the deal came together quickly, months after Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of roughly $6.9 billion.\n\nDisruptive has invested more than $500 million in Groq since its founding in 2016, and Groq is now expected to notify investors of the Nvidia acquisition as details are finalized. The acquisition reportedly includes Groq’s core chip design and related assets, while excluding the company’s early-stage Groq Cloud business, which has been offering developers API-based access to its hardware.\nFrom Nvidia’s side, the financial capacity is clear. The chip giant ended October with around $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up sharply from roughly $13.3 billion at the start of 2023, powered by an explosion in demand for its AI GPUs. An all-cash structure means no dilution for existing shareholders, but it also telegraphs Nvidia’s conviction that securing Groq’s technology will pay off over the long term, even at a steep premium.\n\nWhy this is Nvidia’s biggest acquisition ever This Groq deal instantly becomes Nvidia’s largest acquisition by total value, surpassing its $6.9 billion purchase of Israeli networking company Mellanox in 2019. Mellanox gave Nvidia high-speed networking and interconnect technology that became crucial to building out large AI clusters, effectively turning Nvidia from a GPU vendor into a full-stack data center platform provider.\nNvidia has tried to go even bigger before. In 2020, it announced plans to buy British chip designer Arm from SoftBank for a combination of cash and stock worth up to $40 billion, a move that would have reshaped the global semiconductor landscape. That deal collapsed under regulatory pressure in 2022, after authorities in the U.K., European Union, and U.S. raised concerns that Nvidia could gain too much influence over licensing of Arm’s CPU designs.\n\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nThe Groq acquisition is smaller in dollar terms than the failed Arm attempt but is still huge for a single-technology target. By spending nearly three times Groq’s last valuation, Nvidia is signaling that inference hardware is not just a side business but a core pillar of where it wants AI revenue to grow next.\n\nStory Continues\nThe AI inference race heats up The AI chip market has two big buckets: training and inference. Training is where massive models are built, often using thousands of Nvidia GPUs in data centers run by companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Inference is where those models are actually used for search, chatbots, copilots, AI video, and any application that needs fast, repeated responses at scale.​\n\nGroq has positioned itself as a pure-play inference specialist. Analyst-focused coverage from outlets like AInvest says Groq’s hardware can deliver extremely low-latency performance, with some marketing pointing to speeds up to twice that of rival systems on select workloads while maintaining accuracy. That performance promise, along with a simplified programming model, made Groq an attractive option for developers who wanted something faster and more predictable than general-purpose GPUs for production workloads.\nRelated: Controversial Nvidia rival may finally IPO\nRegulatory scrutiny and antitrust risks Because Nvidia already sits at the center of the AI hardware world, any major deal it does is going to raise eyebrows in Washington, Brussels, London, and Beijing. Reuters notes that regulators have closely watched Nvidia’s expanding role in AI compute, and the Groq deal is expected to face antitrust review in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nThe key questions will likely center on whether acquiring Groq significantly reduces competition in AI inference hardware and whether Nvidia could use control over Groq’s chips to disadvantage rivals or foreclose alternatives for cloud providers and enterprises. Nvidia has argued in past transactions that integrating acquired technologies into its stack benefits customers by improving performance and innovation, but regulators have become more sensitive to vertical consolidation in critical digital infrastructure.\nFor investors, the risk is not only that regulators could block the transaction (as happened with Arm) but also that they might impose remedies. Those could include requirements around licensing, interoperability, or access to Groq’s technology for third parties at fair terms, which might reduce some of the strategic upside Nvidia is paying for.\n\nWhat it means for investors and everyday savers If you own Nvidia, this acquisition tells you a few important things about where the company sees the puck going.\nFirst, Nvidia expects AI demand to shift from a build-out phase, where companies scramble to train models, into a deployment phase where inference workloads explode across industries and devices. Owning specialized inference technology becomes a way to capture that second wave of spending and to keep customers from defecting to rivals that pitch cheaper or more efficient hardware for production use.\n\nSecond, Nvidia is leaning into an ecosystem strategy rather than a product-only strategy. By combining GPUs, networking (from Mellanox), software (CUDA and related libraries), and specialized accelerators (Groq’s chips), Nvidia can offer end-to-end solutions that are harder for competitors like AMD , Intel, or cloud providers’ custom chips to displace. For the average investor, that looks like a moat—but it also concentrates risk in one company.\nThird, consolidation at the chip level can eventually show up in your wallet. If Nvidia can use Groq’s technology to make inference cheaper and more efficient, that could lower the cost for startups and enterprises to deliver AI services, which in turn could mean more competition and better tools for consumers and small investors. But if fewer independent chip options lead to higher prices or stricter vendor lock-in, cloud and software providers may pass on higher infrastructure costs, and some innovation could get squeezed out at the edges.\n\nFor long-term savers, the practical takeaway is that AI infrastructure is becoming a core part of the market story, not just a tech side plot. Nvidia’s willingness to spend $20 billion in cash on Groq reinforces the idea that controlling compute is like owning the toll road on the AI superhighway.\nRelated: Nvidia’s $4 trillion moment came with a quiet warning sign\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 25, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI\n\nOihyun Kim\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:53 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nBLK\n\nSSNLF\n\nNVIDIA has agreed to pay approximately $20 billion to acquire assets from artificial intelligence chip startup Groq, marking the company's largest transaction on record and continuing its strategy of absorbing potential competitors before they can challenge its market dominance.\nThe chipmaker's latest licensing deal mirrors a similar transaction just three months ago, reinforcing the narrative that decentralized AI infrastructure may offer the only alternative to Nvidia's growing dominance.\n\nThreefold Premium in Three Months with Trump Jr. Connection The deal closed just three months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation—a round that included BlackRock, Samsung, Cisco, and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. serves as a partner. Nvidia is acquiring all of the company's assets substantially, except its cloud computing business, though Groq framed the transaction as a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"\n\nGroq CEO Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who helped create the search giant's Tensor Processing Unit, will join Nvidia along with president Sunny Madra and other senior executives. The startup will continue operating independently under CFO Simon Edwards as its new chief executive.\nA Repeating Playbook The Groq transaction follows a pattern Nvidia established just three months earlier. In September, the company paid over $900 million to hire Enfabrica's CEO and employees while licensing the startup's technology. Both deals use licensing structures rather than outright acquisitions, potentially avoiding the antitrust scrutiny that blocked Nvidia's $40 billion bid for Arm Holdings in 2022.\nThe Kobeissi Letter summarized Nvidia's approach bluntly: \"We will buy you before you can compete with us.\"\n\nTechnical Edge and Competitive Pressure Groq's Language Processing Unit uses on-chip SRAM rather than external DRAM, enabling what the company claims is up to 10x better energy efficiency. This architecture excels at real-time inference but limits model size—a tradeoff Nvidia can now explore within its broader ecosystem.\nThe timing is notable. Google recently unveiled its seventh-generation TPU, codenamed Ironwood, and released Gemini 3, trained entirely on TPUs, to top benchmark rankings. Nvidia responded on X: \"We're delighted by Google's success... NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model.\" When incumbents start issuing such reassurance statements, competitive pressure is clearly mounting.\n\nStory Continues\nImplications for Decentralized AI While the deal has no direct impact on cryptocurrency markets, it reinforces the narrative driving decentralized AI computing projects. Platforms like io.net position themselves as alternatives to centralized AI infrastructure.\n\"People can put their own supply onto a network, whether that's data centers or yourself with your laptop, contributing your available GPU power, and getting fairly compensated for it using tokenomics,\" Jack Collier, io.net's Chief Growth Officer, told BeInCrypto. The platform claims enterprise clients, including Leonardo.ai and UC Berkeley, have achieved significant cost savings.\n\nHowever, the gap between narrative and reality remains wide. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq's low-latency technology further extends its technical lead, making it harder for any alternative to offer competitive performance.\nThe transaction also raises questions about independent AI chip development. Cerebras Systems, another Nvidia competitor preparing an IPO, may eventually face similar pressure. Whether it can remain independent or succumb to Nvidia's financial gravity remains to be seen.\nRead original story Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI by Oihyun Kim at beincrypto.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This Dividend-Yielding Tech Stock Looks a ‘Compelling Buy’ for 2026 After 2 Years of Underperformance\n\nMohit Oberoi\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:30 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nWith year-to-date (YTD) gains of just about 15%, Microsoft (MSFT) is underperforming both the broad-based S&P 500 Index ($SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX). The Satya Nadella-led company underperformed last year as well, and its gains of 12% in 2024 paled in comparison to its tech peers as well as the broader markets.\nIncidentally, the “Magnificent 7,” which led the market rally from the front in 2023 and 2024, did not have the best of years, and none of them made it to the list of top 20 gainers in the S&P 500 Index in 2025. The group’s collective price action has been below par, and only Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are outperforming their average S&P 500 Index peer by a noticeable margin. Meanwhile, after the 2025 underperformance, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities—a known perma tech bull—sees MSFT stock rising to $625 next year and termed it a “compelling buy.” Notably, while tech stocks aren’t really known for their dividends and many don’t pay one in the first place, Microsoft’s dividend yield of 0.75% is the highest among Magnificent 7 stocks. It is on the verge of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nThis Dividend Stock Just Scored an FDA Win. Should You Buy Shares Now?\nThis Blue-Chip Stock Topped the Dow Jones in 2025. Should You Buy Its Shares Here?\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWhy Did Microsoft Underperform in 2025? Microsoft’s 2025 underperformance has largely been due to concerns over its burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) capex. The company, which previously said that its capex growth would fall in the fiscal year 2026, now sees it going up instead. The Windows parent splurged almost $35 billion towards capex in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, which ended in September, a record for the company.\n\nTo be sure, rising AI capex is not a Microsoft thing, and Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet have also bumped up spending amid the AI arms race. Barring Alphabet, which entered 2025 with tepid expectations and ended up impressing with its financial performance, the other three are underperforming this year. I find an Alphabet connection to Microsoft’s underperformance. While Gemini gaining ground at OpenAI’s cost helped propel GOOG stock higher, it put pressure on Microsoft, which is OpenAI’s biggest investor and a proxy play on the world’s most valuable unlisted startup.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft Stock's 2026 Forecast Despite the 2025 underperformance, the analyst community is not giving up on Microsoft, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 48 analysts polled by Barchart . MSFT stock trades even below the Street-low target price of $490, while the mean target price of $629.23 is almost 30% higher than current price levels.\n\nNotably, Ives’ target price of $625 is similar to the consensus price target and the same as Wolfe Research, which lowered MSFT’s target price by $50 earlier this month. Looking at the recent action, DA Davidson and Jefferies maintained their bullish bets on Microsoft this month while maintaining their respective target prices of $675 and $650.\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy for 2026? I remain constructive on MSFT stock heading into 2026. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30.6x, which I find balanced. The P/E-to-growth (PEG) multiples do look a bit ugly at 1.82x, but that’s got to do with AI capex hitting the company’s profits in the form of higher capex. “Big Short” Michael Burry’s controversial views on tech companies’ inflating the useful life of AI chips notwithstanding, companies like Microsoft are set to face higher depreciation expenses over the next couple of years.\n\nThere is a lot to like about Microsoft at these levels, though. The stock is a defensive play with a well-diversified business. The company’s Windows and Office business would continue to benefit from the uptick in PC sales, led by an aging base of installed devices and the advent of AI PCs. The ending of Windows 10 support would also help keep that segment buoyed, as more users would feel urged to upgrade to Windows 11.\nMoreover, AI is fueling demand for subscriptions, which would add to Microsoft’s topline. The cloud business is particularly growing at a brisk pace, and Microsoft is closing the gap with market leader Amazon. Specifically, during their recent earnings call, Microsoft said that its commercial cloud remaining performance obligations (RPO) soared 50% to $400 billion at the end of September, with a weighted average duration of just two years.\nOverall, while I haven’t been a permabull on MSFT, I have used the dips to add to my positions, something I repeated this time around as well. At these levels, I find MSFT stock a decent buy and see it delivering double-digit returns next year.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: MSFT, GOOG, NVDA, AMZN, META.

      "Content": "Nvidia’s $4 trillion moment came with a quiet warning sign\n\nFaizan Farooque\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:07 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTCEHY\n\n3905.T\n\nNvidia is hurtling towards the end of 2025, after a very successful year, during which it redefined what it means to be a chip giant during the AI boom. Much of the reason for its success this year is its much-vaunted hardware.\nBut the next set of headlines isn't just about chips that are faster. It's about where the chips go and whether Nvidia can change the direction of the software world it rules.\n\nThe Nvidia chips China wasn’t supposed to touch just showed up anyway U.S. export restrictions were designed to keep Nvidia’s most advanced AI hardware out of China.\nInstead, they've changed demand into a new shape that's harder to control, easier to grow, and already full of cash.\nA Financial Times report says Tencent is acquiring Nvidia's advanced Blackwell chips through a data center outside of Osaka, run by Datasection, a Japanese company that switched from marketing to AI data centers.\n\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nTencent will gain access to a large number of Datasection's 15,000 Nvidia Blackwell processors without the chips ever being sent to China, per people privy to the matter.\nThe \"neocloud\" model suggests you shouldn't buy GPUs, but instead rent them.\nAnd the demand is clear, as Datasection CEO Norihiko Ishihara notes.\nA $272 million check says the business isn’t a side hustle The numbers in the FT reporting are the kind that transcend “interesting” and start looking “systemic.”\nDatasection agreed to pay $272 million for 5,000 Nvidia B200 chips for its Osaka facility, according to the FT. This was backed by a $406 million, three-year contract linked to a major customer relationship.\n\nThen came the next swing: an $800 million, three-year deal for a Sydney data center that will hold tens of thousands of Nvidia's newer B300 chips. Datasection says the first 10,000 B300s will cost $521 million.\nThis is not the move of a company that believes demand is at its peak.\nRather, if you think demand is just starting to pick up and you want to be the toll booth, this is how you build a workaround.\nWashington’s rulebook changed, and the timing is the whole story The Financial Times also said that laws from the Biden administration were going to remove the loophole that made this offshore leasing arrangement possible, but President Donald Trump canceled those plans in May. The FT stated that Datasection promptly finished its Osaka agreement after that.\n\nStory Continues\nPresident Trump's stance on AI has already affected Nvidia in other ways.\nRelated: A $1 trillion IPO looms, and Amazon may have just locked in early\nAn AI action plan from late July lifted limits on Nvidia's H200 processors and made it easier for AI data centers to obtain permits. It also said Nvidia temporarily became the first firm to have a market capitalization of $4 trillion on July 9.\n\nAll of that means investors need to face the fact that Nvidia's policy risk isn't a one-way street. It can get tighter, looser, or turn, and new business models will fill in the gaps.\nNow comes the move that hits Nvidia where it actually lives The following narrative is about why Nvidia hardware is the default in the first place, whereas the \"neocloud\" tale is about where Nvidia hardware can be used.\nAnd this is where Nvidia's problems will worsen in the long run.\nGoogle is working on a project called TorchTPU that will make it easier for Google's TPUs to run PyTorch, Reuters reports. The idea is to make users less dependent on Nvidia's CUDA environment.\n\nRelated: Oracle just made a power move Wall Street can’t ignore\nGoogle can make hardware all day long. The developer experience is what really sets it apart.\nThat's why one sentence from Reuters is important not as a demand indicator, but as a positioning signal: “We are seeing massive, accelerating demand for both our TPU and GPU infrastructure,” a Google Cloud spokesperson told the news agency.\nThat's not a business giving up on the market; it's a corporation telling customers, \"You have choices, and we're going to make them easy for you.\"\nWhy Meta’s involvement should make Nvidia nervous The Reuters article also indicated that Google is working with Meta, the company that runs PyTorch, to speed up the TorchTPU project.\nThat's a major matter, since it goes after Nvidia's edge from the inside.\nDevelopers don't want to have to rewrite stacks. They want the easiest way to go.\nIf PyTorch works well with TPUs, the \"switching cost\" penalty that keeps Nvidia's profits safe becomes smaller — not in a day, but enough that procurement teams start to ask tougher questions, and enough that the top customers can get better prices when they negotiate.\n\nFinancial impact: The numbers show this battlefield's huge scale This is when \"official records\" come in handy: They tie the hype to real money.\nNvidia is making a lot of money from data centers Nvidia's financial report for the third quarter said the firm made a record $57.0 billion in sales. This included a record $51.2 billion in Data Center revenue.\nThat's the engine room that makes the whole AI trade work.\nRelated: US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding\nAnd Nvidia's papers reveal that China is still a big part of the story. In its annual report for fiscal year 2025, Nvidia noted that its Data Center revenue in China rose, but was still \"well below\" pre-export-control levels as a share of overall Data Center revenue.\n\nWhen overseas companies step in to meet Chinese demand, it's not just politics; it's also a straight channel to Nvidia's most crucial development area.\nGoogle Cloud is stacking backlog like a war chest Alphabet’s official 10-Q for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2025, and it reported $157.7 billion in remaining performance obligations (revenue backlog), “primarily related to Google Cloud,” with just over 55% expected to be recognized over the next 24 months.\nThat's the kind of backlog that pays for long fights, like making TPUs more appealing to PyTorch devs.\n\nMeta’s spending tells you this isn’t theory Meta is projected to spend between $70 billion and $72 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, which includes payments on finance leases.\nMeta doesn't want to be stuck with one vendor forever; thus, they don't spend too much money. If TorchTPU makes things easier, Meta has every reason to keep pushing the ecosystem away from relying on one supplier.\n\nThe market doesn’t need Nvidia to “lose” for this to matter This is the portion that investors often miss: If Nvidia can maintain making money, it could still have trouble with margins if:\nHuge buyers have real choices.\nThe costs of switching software go down.\nOffshore demand channels become more responsive to political changes.\nThat's how you get rid of dominance, not destroy it.\n\nWhat to watch next for Nvidia Here's what to watch to determine whether something Nvidia-related is just noise.\nDoes the \"neocloud\" paradigm go beyond Japan and Australia to other places where big data centers are being built?\nDoes TorchTPU come with a true developer experience (documentation, tools, and performance that are the same as other projects), or is it still a project?\nAre the leading AI consumers beginning to discuss multi-stack publicly, even though Nvidia remains their primary supplier?\n\nThe AI economy still depends on Nvidia.\nBut when China can rent Nvidia computers from other countries and Google can make \"not-Nvidia\" easier to use in PyTorch, the next chapter is no longer just a story about demand.\nIt turns into a leverage narrative. And those are always more of a mess.\nRelated: Box office is booming in 2025 but Netflix’s $82.7 billion surprise raises alarms\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 24, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Nvidia, joining Big Tech deal spree, to license Groq technology, hire executives\n\nStephen Nellis\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GROQ.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nCESY.PVT\n\nBy Stephen Nellis\nDec 24 (Reuters) - Nvidia has agreed to license chip technology from startup Groq and hire away its CEO, a veteran of Alphabet's Google, Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday.\nThe deal follows a familiar pattern ​in recent years where the world's biggest technology firms pay large sums in deals with promising startups to take their ‌technology and talent but stop short of formally acquiring the target.\n\nGroq specializes in what is known as inference, where artificial intelligence models that have already been trained respond ‌to requests from users. While Nvidia dominates the market for training AI models, it faces much more competition in inference, where traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices have aimed to challenge it as well as startups such as Groq and Cerebras Systems.\nNvidia has agreed to a \"non-exclusive\" license to Groq's technology, Groq said. It said its founder Jonathan Ross, who helped Google start its AI chip program, as well as Groq ⁠President Sunny Madra and other members of its ‌engineering team, will join Nvidia.\nA person close to Nvidia confirmed the licensing agreement.\nGroq did not disclose financial details of the deal. CNBC reported that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Groq for $20 billion in cash, but neither ‍Nvidia nor Groq commented on the report. Groq said in its blog post that it will continue to operate as an independent company with Simon Edwards as CEO and that its cloud business will continue operating.\n\nIn similar recent deals, Microsoft 's top AI executive came through a $650 million deal with a startup that ​was billed as a licensing fee, and Meta spent $15 billion to hire Scale AI's CEO without acquiring the entire firm. Amazon ‌hired away founders from Adept AI, and Nvidia did a similar deal this year. The deals have faced scrutiny by regulators, though none has yet been unwound.\n\"Antitrust would seem to be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive (even as Groq’s leadership and, we would presume, technical talent move over to Nvidia),\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday after Groq's announcement. And Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's \"relationship with the Trump administration appears among the strongest of ⁠the key US tech companies.\"\n\nGroq more than doubled its valuation to $6.9 billion from $2.8 ​billion in August last year, following a $750 million funding round in September.\nGroq is ​one of a number of upstarts that do not use external high-bandwidth memory chips, freeing them from the memory crunch affecting the global chip industry. The approach, which uses a form of on-chip memory called SRAM, helps ‍speed up interactions with chatbots and ⁠other AI models but also limits the size of the model that can be served.\n\nStory Continues\nGroq's primary rival in the approach is Cerebras Systems, which Reuters this month reported plans to go public as soon as next year. Groq and Cerebras have ⁠signed large deals in the Middle East.\nNvidia's Huang spent much of his biggest keynote speech of 2025 arguing that Nvidia would be able to maintain its lead as ‌AI markets shift from training to inference.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese ‌in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, Matthew Lewis and William Mallard)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia to license Groq technology, hire executives\n\nStephen Nellis\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:06 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GROQ.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nCESY.PVT\n\nBy Stephen Nellis\nDec 24 (Reuters) - Nvidia has agreed to license chip technology from startup Groq and hire away its CEO, a veteran of Alphabet's Google, Groq said ​in a blog post on Wednesday.\nGroq specializes in what is known as inference, ‌where artificial intelligence models that have already been trained respond to requests from users. While Nvidia dominates the market for ‌training AI models, it faces much more competition in inference, where traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices have aimed to challenge it as well as startups such as Groq and Cerebras Systems.\n\nGroq said that Nvidia had agreed to a \"non-exclusive\" license to Groq's technology. Groq said that its founder ⁠Jonathan Ross, who helped Google ‌start its AI chip program, as well as Groq President Sunny Madra and other members of its engineering team will join Nvidia.\nA person close to ‍Nvidia confirmed the licensing agreement.\nGroq did not disclose financial details of the deal. CNBC earlier reported that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Groq for $20 billion in cash, but neither Nvidia nor Groq commented on the ​report. Groq said in its blog post that it will continue to operate as an ‌independent company with Simon Edwards as CEO and that its cloud business will continue operating.\nGroq more than doubled its valuation to $6.9 billion, from $2.8 billion in August last year, following a $750 million funding round in September.\n\nGroq is one of a number of upstarts that do not use external high-bandwidth memory chips, which free them from the memory crunch affecting the global chip industry. The approach, ⁠which uses a form of on-chip memory called SRAM, ​helps speed up interactions with chatbots and other AI ​models but also limits the size of the model that can be served.\nGroq's primary rival in the approach is Cerebras Systems, which Reuters earlier this month ‍reported plans to go ⁠public as soon as next year. Both Groq and Cerebras have signed large deals in the Middle East.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang spent much of his biggest keynote speech of ⁠2025 arguing that Nvidia would be able to maintain its lead as AI markets shift from training to inference.\n(Reporting ‌by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in ‌Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Matthew Lewis)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "A Big China Catalyst Could Be Coming for AMD Stock in 2026. Should You Buy Shares Now?\n\nPathikrit Bose\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 11:42 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nBABA\n\nNVDA\n\nIt looks like after Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is next in line to rehash a deal to resume the sales of its chips to China. After CEO Lisa Su had a meeting with China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao in Beijing last week, reports have emerged that the country's tech giant Alibaba (BABA) is mulling ordering some of AMD's MI308 GPUs. According to this report, Alibaba could order between 40,000 and 50,000 of these GPUs. This could imply a revenue windfall in the range of $600 million to $1.25 billion for AMD.\n\nBut, before one jumps the gun over here, there are some unpleasant facts that one must consider. Firstly, though the U.S. has approved the sale of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, the Chinese regulators have not yet given their approval. So, the chances of AMD getting approval are also low at this point. Secondly, Alibaba is itself a chipmaker, although its chips are more of the ASIC kind rather than AMD's general-purpose chips. This means the latter has broader use cases than Alibaba's chips, which are optimized for its native cloud ecosystems and inference workloads.\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\n$800 for Tesla Stock Could Be Reality in 2026.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nHowever, amid this development, where does AMD stand as an investment option now? It should be pretty high. Let's find out why.\nAMD's Robust Financials With a market cap of about $350 billion, AMD seems like a minnow in front of its larger peer, Nvidia. However, on the basis of share price performance, the AMD stock, with a rally of nearly 78%, has outperformed Nvidia's uptick of 37.1% this year by a considerable margin. But AMD is not just a short-term phenomenon; the company has been growing its revenue and earnings at a healthy clip for a while now.\nAMD has strung together a good five-year run, pushing revenue and earnings higher at compound rates of 29.94% and 28.93%. Notably, the most recent quarter fit right into that pattern, coming in stronger than Wall Street figures.\nQ3 sales hit $9.25 billion, 36% above the year-earlier mark. The core data center segment reported sales of $4.3 billion, implying a 22% growth from last year. Client and gaming put up the biggest jump, however, rising 73% on an annual basis to $4 billion.\nMeanwhile, EPS moved up by 30% in the same period to $1.20, outpacing the $1.17 consensus and stretching the company's run of beats to four quarters straight.\n\nStory Continues\nCash flow stood out as well. Operating cash flow shot up to $1.8 billion, almost three times the $628 million posted in the same quarter last year. Overall, AMD wrapped up September with $4.81 billion in cash, easily topping the $873 million in short-term debt and $2.35 billion in longer-term debt.\nHowever, AMD continues to trade at heady valuations when compared to the industry averages. Its forward P/E, P/S, and P/CF of 54.21, 10.30, and 54.12 are all higher than the sector medians of 24.37, 3.40, and 20.36, respectively.\n\nOptimism Abounds Since my previous analysis on AMD, previewing the company's Financial Analyst Day event on Nov. 11, the company's stock is down 10.3%. However, the case for investing in it may have only gotten stronger amid all the ambitious targets the management aims to hit in the coming years. First up is CEO Lisa Su's assertion that the data center market is set to reach a trillion dollars by 2030, an increase from her earlier projection of a $500 billion market by 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, on a company-specific basis, AMD has targeted a revenue CAGR of >35%, operating margins of >35%, and an annual EPS of $20 in the next 3-5 years, with data center AI revenue exceeding 80% CAGR in the same period. The targets may seem a bit steep, but Lisa Su has walked the walk on many occasions for more than a decade now, with the share price jumping by more than 80 times in her tenure, creating enormous wealth for shareholders.\nMoreover, AMD's GPUs aren't the only thing picking up speed; the full stack around them is growing fast, heading toward complete rack-level setups like Helios, MI400, and MI450. Software is keeping pace, too, with ROCm 7 making it easier to move workloads between systems. Notably, the MI500 lineup is already slated for 2027, so the roadmap looks loaded for years.\n\nOutside pure accelerators, the upcoming “Venice” CPUs and AMD's networking gear open up fresh growth lanes inside data centers.\nIn the bigger picture, what really matters is how AMD has spread its bets across platforms. CPUs, GPUs, adaptive chips, and networking all connect like parts of one machine, where nothing stands alone. That setup cuts the risk from any single trend swinging and lets the company shift gears quickly as AI designs change.\nAnalyst Opinion on AMD Stock Thus, analysts have deemed the stock to be a consensus “Moderate Buy,” with a mean target price of $288.87. This indicates an upside potential of about 34.2% from current levels. Out of 43 analysts covering the stock, 28 have a “Strong Buy” rating, three have a “Moderate Buy” rating, and 12 have a “Hold” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

If it doesn't, you know, the market's going to come off its wheels. But having said that, I mean, recently, you can look at, you know, some poster childs of the AI trade. You know, I think of an AI heavy name like an Nvidia. It's well off its 52-week high, Joseph, but this market has continued to grind higher. I'm just curious what you make of that.\n00:23 Joseph\nWell, I think that it it it bolsters the the thesis that the 493 certainly have legs. And I think that I think more broadly, the economy is stronger than people thought it would be when we started the year. Uh, rates are probably lower than uh, lower today than where where we thought they would be. Inflation is probably a tick lower uh, than we thought it would be. So the underlying conditions are somewhat better for the broad market and the broad market has been able to weather as you talked about, the bumps in the road that are inevitable uh uh with regard to the Mag 7 and and the AI trade. So, I think it's positive for the index as we enter 2026 that we've seen some level of broadening. And obviously, we see opportunities uh in the defense sector, uh in in healthcare and selectively in technology as well as as this rally continues to broaden.\n01:21 Speaker A\nYeah, let's get to some of those specific names and picks, Joseph. Uh you like Broadcom here for example. How come? What do you like about C.O. Hock Tan's company specifically? Is it the business model, margins, his AI story?\n01:40 Joseph\nWell, you know, our strategy is to invest in recurring revenue businesses and Broadcom has one of the great uh technology recurring revenue businesses. When you think about how they're positioned with regard to AI, they're really very, very well positioned uh in a category where the product, the GPU is 90% of the cost of the solution. And Broadcom with their XPUs is dramatically reducing the cost of effectuating the outcome that AI provides. And so we think that they'll continue to take market share among the hyperscalers, which is going to drive fantastic revenue growth in the AI business. We see the AI business doubling uh in 2026 for Broadcom and we see it growing very, very rapidly uh after 2026. So long-term, they're very, very well positioned with a product that is that is highly efficient for their customers.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "LIVE\n\nStock market today: Dow, S&P 500 notch records, Nasdaq gains as Wall Street flies high into Christmas holiday\n\nBrett LoGiurato · Front Page Editor\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:05 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\nINTC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nGC=F\n\nUS stocks set more records on Wednesday, as Wall Street rode into the Christmas holiday on a high note.\nThe blue chip-focused Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) led the way up, gaining 0.6%, or nearly 300 points, to close at a fresh record high. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) picked up 0.3% to notch its second consecutive record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained a bit under 0.2%.\n\nMarkets closed early on Wednesday for Christmas Eve and are off Thursday for the holiday. Wall Street's bid for a \"Santa Claus\" rally is looking hopeful after the major indexes gained for the fifth consecutive day.\nWall Street's advance over the past several sessions has come despite new economic data that only served to dampen bets for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the near term. US GDP growth stood at 4.3% in the third quarter , according to a first estimate from the government, much higher than forecast as consumer spending held up over the summer.\n\nBut the GDP data led investors to trim bets on a January rate cut from the Fed — just more than 13% now expect that outcome.

It's according to Reuters. Nvidia recently tested the so-called 18A process. This highlights a pain point for Intel amid its struggling manufacturing business. Nvidia, remember, earlier this year invested $5 billion in Intel, but did not commit to using its chip manufacturing services.\n00:36 Speaker A\nUp next, take a look at Tesla as the company faces a new investigation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is launching a probe into the EV Maker's Model 3 compact sedans. This comes amid concerns that emergency door release controls may not be easily accessible or clearly identifiable. The focus of this investigation is on model year 2022 electric vehicles. The US auto safety regulator has also been looking into Tesla's advanced driver assistance system over alleged violations of traffic safety laws.\n01:17 Speaker A\nAnd lastly, let's check a check here on crypto. Bitcoin continues to slip missing out on the broader seasonal optimism. The world's largest cryptocurrency stalling here between 85,000 to 90,000 range.

Let's start there, explain that. I mean, is that is that valuation, Joseph, is it is it earnings growth, positioning, explain it.\n00:27 Joseph\nI think that there have been a number of businesses in the magnificent 493 that are perceived as being uh hurt or uh compromised by the growth of AI. Valuations have gone significantly lower for a number of those companies and businesses that are just not participants in in uh the opportunity of AI have also not performed particularly well uh in that bucket of the magnificent 493. And I think in 2026, what we're going to find is that many of these companies are harnessing AI to get better, to lower their costs, to improve the velocity of introducing new products, um, and those businesses will begin to get the benefits of that uh as people recognize it. It hasn't happened uh in the last couple of years, but I think we're going to notice that in the next couple of years.\n01:29 Speaker A\nWell, what does that suggest Joseph about what do you think I do with the Mag 7 though in 2026? You know, am I avoiding those names? Am I trimming exposure? You know, do I have to be more discerning? Maybe next year, Joseph, it's more like, you know, the mag three or four.\n01:46 Joseph\nI think so. I think the Mag 7 it's tough to paint them with a broad brush because each one of them has a specific story associated with them. But I think just from a valuation perspective and the fact that they've performed so well for such a long period of time, I think that some of them will take a break, some of them will perform well, but really the opportunities for outsized returns next year are going to be outside of those seven businesses.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Uh-Oh! Did Nvidia Just Signal Problems with Intel’s Comeback?\n\nRich Duprey\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nTSM\n\nQuick Read Intel ( INTC ) secured $8.9B from the U.S. government and $5B from Nvidia ( NVDA ) to revive its foundry business.\nNvidia halted testing of Intel’s 18A chip manufacturing process and stopped moving forward with production plans.\nIntel’s foundry turnaround depends on 18A attracting major customers beyond smaller deals with Microsoft and Amazon .\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIntel ( NASDAQ: INTC ) has experienced a dramatic shift in fortunes over the past year. Once viewed as a failing chipmaker losing ground to competitors like Broadcom ( NASDAQ: AVGO ), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( NYSE: TSM ), and Nvidia ( NASDAQ: NVDA ), Intel faced speculation that rivals were circling its foundry business and other assets.\nBy the middle of the year, however, Intel regained momentum through significant backing from the Trump administration, which converted CHIPS Act grants into an equity stake worth approximately $8.9 billion, or 10% of the company, making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. This was followed by a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, giving it roughly a 4% stake, as well as partnerships aimed at joint product development in data centers and PCs.\n\nThese moves indicated renewed confidence, positioning Intel as a key player in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing once again. Yet, a Reuters report today suggests a big potential setback, raising questions about whether Intel's revival is beginning to falter.\nA Promising Rebound Built on Execution Intel's recent progress has been notable, driven by strategic investments and a focus on revitalizing its core businesses. The Trump administration's equity stake provided essential capital and aligned Intel with national priorities for domestic chip production.\nWeeks later, Nvidia's $5 billion commitment further supported Intel's turnaround, with the two firms agreeing to collaborate on custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms and integrated system-on-chips for PCs. An Intel spokesperson emphasized that 18A technologies are \"progressing well.\"\n\nDespite these positive developments, the rebound has always hinged on Intel's ability to execute, particularly in its foundry business. The 18A process node has been central to its plans for regaining manufacturing leadership, as it is intended to enable high-volume production of advanced chips and attract customers.\nNvidia's Decision Raises Questions About 18A According to the Reuters article, Nvidia recently evaluated whether to manufacture its next-generation chips using Intel's 18A process but halted the testing and stopped moving forward. Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed this to Reuters, though Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nStory Continues\nThis development comes despite Nvidia's earlier investment and ongoing product collaborations, which explicitly did not include commitments to use Intel's foundry. Intel has previously noted strong interest in 18A, and the company continues to highlight progress on the node, with products like Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest ramping up toward production.\n\nThe reasons for Nvidia's decision remain unclear, but earlier reports indicated both Nvidia and Broadcom conducted tests on 18A. While testing is a standard step, not all evaluations lead to production commitments.\nIf technical or yield issues contributed to the halt, it could signal challenges for Intel in convincing major designers to shift volume from established leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel's foundry has faced scrutiny over quality and scalability before, though the company maintains that 18A is on track and sees interest shifting to the subsequent 14A node for even more advanced applications.\nBroader Implications for Intel's Foundry Strategy Winning high-profile customers has been a key goal for Intel Foundry, which has invested heavily to compete as a contract manufacturer. Deals with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) for custom chips on 18A have been announced, and Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) might go with Intel for its entry-level M-series chips in 2027, but volumes from such clients are relatively small compared to demands from AI leaders like Nvidia.\n\nNvidia halting the testing -- while not a definitive rejection -- underscores the high bar set for advanced nodes. Competitors continue to dominate high-end production, and Intel must demonstrate reliable yields and performance to secure larger commitments.\nKey Takeaway Investors should not read too much into Nvidia's decision to pause 18A testing at this stage, as qualification processes are lengthy and multifaceted. However, greater caution is warranted moving forward.\nMuch of Intel's turnaround depends on the success of the 18A process in delivering competitive manufacturing capabilities. If the node falls short of expectations in attracting major business from customers, it could complicate the company's path to foundry profitability and an overall recovery.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nASML\n\nKey Points Nvidia’s chips are still the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush.\nTSMC manufactures Nvidia’s chips with its best-in-breed foundries.\nASML’s lithography systems enable TSMC to produce those chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe artificial intelligence ( AI ) market has expanded rapidly over the past decade as more powerful chips and generative AI platforms have entered the market. Those AI services became practical tools that could quickly crunch, analyze, and predict trends for businesses and mainstream users.\n\nThe AI market could grow at a CAGR of 30.6% from 2026 to 2033, according to Grand View Research, as more organizations use AI to automate, accelerate, and optimize their operations. To capitalize on this expansion, investors should consider buying and holding these three top tech stocks for the next decade and beyond: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , TSMC (NYSE: TSM) , and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) .\nNvidia Nvidia is the world's top producer of discrete GPUs for data centers, which are used to process complex AI tasks. Most of the top AI companies -- including OpenAI, Meta , and Microsoft -- use its GPUs. It also locks in those clients with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a proprietary programming platform for its own chips.\n\nAs the producer of the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, Nvidia still has plenty of room to grow. It might face tougher competition from AMD 's cheaper GPUs, first-party AI chips from some of its top customers, and other types of AI accelerators -- but its first-mover edge, best-in-breed reputation, and sticky ecosystem will fuel its long-term growth. Tighter export curbs could throttle its shipments to China over the next few years, but it can offset that pressure with its growth in the U.S., Europe, and other Asian markets.\nFrom fiscal 2025 (which ended in January) to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share ( EPS ) to grow at a CAGR of 46% and 29%, respectively. Even though its stock has already soared nearly 23,000% over the past decade, it still looks reasonably valued at 25 times next year's earnings. Therefore, Nvidia should remain one of the simplest ways to profit from the AI boom over the next decade.\n\nTSMC Nvidia outsources the production of its top-tier GPUs to TSMC, the world's largest and most advanced contract chipmaker. TSMC is the only foundry capable of manufacturing Nvidia's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.\nTSMC also produces chips for other leading fabless chipmakers like AMD, Apple , and Qualcomm . It manufactures its most advanced chips in Taiwan, which is exposed to potential trade and military conflicts with China; however, it has been mitigating this risk by building more plants in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.\n\nStory Continues\nIn its latest quarter, TSMC generated 57% of its revenue from the high-performance computing (HPC) market, which includes Nvidia's data center GPUs. That segment is driving its near-term growth and reducing its dependence on the cyclical PC, smartphone, and automotive markets.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect TSMC's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 24% and 27%, respectively, as the AI market expands and its more cyclical markets stabilize. Those are strong growth rates for a stock that trades at 19 times next year's earnings, and it will remain a linchpin of the expanding semiconductor sector for the foreseeable future.\n\nASML TSMC couldn't manufacture its chips without the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML. ASML is the world's leading producer of lithography systems, which optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which produce the smallest and most densely packed chips.\n\nASML perfected its EUV technology over the past two decades, and the high costs of producing those massive systems prevented its potential competitors from gaining any ground. Its EUV systems currently cost $200-$400 million, require multiple planes and trucks to ship, and must be reassembled at the foundries by its own teams.\nASML's monopolization of that market makes it another linchpin of the semiconductor sector, and the world's most advanced AI chips couldn't exist without its cutting-edge technology. The export curbs against China (where it's barred from selling its higher-end systems) are throttling its near-term sales, but its growth across other regions should offset that pressure.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 18%, respectively, as it ramps up its shipments of its latest \"high-NA\" EUV systems for manufacturing even smaller and denser chips. Its stock isn't a bargain at 35 times next year's earnings, but its scale, guaranteed long-term growth, and pricing power justify that higher valuation.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "TSX futures edge lower as liquidity thins ahead of Christmas break\n\nLuke Juricic\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:42 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPTSE\n\nDX\n\nDX-PC\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nInvesting.com -- Canadian equity futures are drifting slightly lower on Wednesday morning as market participants head to the sidelines for a holiday-shortened session. The subtle retreat follows a historic milestone for the S&P/TSX Composite, which reached a record closing high on Tuesday, fueled by a meteoric rise in the metals and mining sectors.\n\nAs of 9:05 ET, S&P/TSX 60 Futures Index Standard Futures were down 2.4 points or 0.13%, mirroring a cautious tone in global markets. Trading volumes are expected to remain exceptionally thin today, as the Toronto Stock Exchange prepares to close early at 1:00 PM ET for Christmas Eve. Analysts warn that low liquidity could amplify price swings, though many investors appear content to lock in profits after a banner year for Canadian equities.\nRecord Territory: Tuesday Recap The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index finished Tuesday’s session up 58.63 points, or 0.18%, to settle at a new record of 32,058.73. The advance marked the fourth consecutive winning day for the index, which has now surged nearly 30% year-to-date.\nTuesday’s gains were driven almost exclusively by commodities:\n\nGold and Silver Miners: Outsized gains in the sub-indexes (up over 100% this year) continued as precious metals hit fresh peaks.\nEnergy: Resilience in crude prices provided a secondary floor for the index, even as domestic economic data surprised to the downside.\nThe bullish momentum successfully offset a disappointing report from Statistics Canada , which revealed that real GDP contracted 0.3% in October . The decline was wider than the 0.2% drop economists had anticipated, hampered by a 1.5% slump in manufacturing and a series of high-profile labor stoppages, including a nation-wide postal strike and teacher strikes in Alberta.\nGold Shatters $4,500 Barrier In a historic move on Wednesday, Gold Futures broke past the $4,500 per ounce resistance level. The yellow metal reached a peak of $4,554/oz in trade, extending a rally that has seen prices climb roughly 70% in 2025. Gold Futures now sit at $4,515.25/oz, a 0.2% gain.\nThe \"flight to safety\" is being propelled by a cocktail of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors:\n\nUS-Venezuela Tensions: Renewed friction between Washington and Caracas over oil shipments has heightened regional supply risks.\nFed Expectations: Despite robust US GDP data, investors remain firm in their belief that the Federal Reserve will pivot toward further rate cuts in 2026.\nCurrency Weakness: The US Dollar Index is hovering near 12-week lows, making dollar-denominated bullion more attractive to international buyers.\n\nStory continues\nEnergy & Commodities Watch\nOil prices remained relatively stable on Wednesday morning. Brent Oil Futures edged up 0.14% to $62.46 per barrel, while Crude Oil WTI Futures gained 0.3% to trade at $58.55.\nSupply risks remain the primary catalyst, as the Trump administration intensifies enforcement actions against vessels linked to Venezuelan crude. While Venezuela accounts for a small fraction of global supply, the potential for wider maritime interdiction has re-introduced a significant risk premium into energy markets.\n\nTech Spotlight: Intel Slumps on Nvidia Snub In corporate news, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) saw its shares tumble 3.3% in premarket trading. The move comes following reporting from Reuters saying that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has halted testing of Intel’s \"18A\" advanced manufacturing process.\nThe 18A node is considered the linchpin of Intel’s turnaround strategy to become a premier foundry for third-party chip designers. While an Intel spokesperson maintained that the technology is \"progressing well,\" the decision by Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, to step away from testing dealt a heavy blow to investor sentiment.\n\nLooking Ahead U.S. markets are also expected to see light activity today, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 Futures trading near flat after their own record-setting sessions on Tuesday. The New York Stock Exchange will join the TSX in an early 1:00 PM ET close today, and both will remain shuttered on Thursday for Christmas Day.\nRelated articles\nTSX futures edge lower as liquidity thins ahead of Christmas break\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Micron Technology and BigBear.ai\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:42 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nBBAI\n\nMU\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 24, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Intel Corp. INTC, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nForget NVIDIA: 2 AI Stocks Crushing It in 2025 with More Upside Ahead Shares of the most sought-after tech stock on Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp. , have surged 36.6% this year amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ongoing demand for NVIDIA's CUDA software platform, along with its competitive advantage in the AI hardware market, fueled growth. Demand for NVIDIA's Blackwell chips remains strong, and the company plans to ship H200 AI chips to China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nHowever, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions remain a risk and could pose a meaningful threat to NVIDIA's future growth trajectory. NVIDIA also faces intensifying competition from rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . and Intel Corp. , as data center capital expenditures continue to rise.\nTherefore, investors may look beyond NVIDIA at stocks that have outperformed it this year and still offer upside as the AI boom continues. Notable among them are Micron Technology, Inc . and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc . whose shares have gained 228.8% and 43.6%, respectively, this year. Let's take a closer look at why these stocks are compelling buys.\nReasons to Be Bullish on Micron Strong demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips is expected to help the company deliver strong quarterly results. These chips have the inherent capacity to reduce power consumption and process large volumes of data. With AI infrastructure rapidly expanding, demand for HBM chips has accelerated.\n\nBanking on rising AI-led demand for HBM chips, Micron expects its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $13.64 billion for the fiscal first quarter, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Analysts had projected revenues of around $12.88 billion.\nMicron expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter, with its cloud memory business unit expected to perform particularly well. Micron's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a solid 23.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nReasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai BigBear.ai's shares were adversely impacted at the beginning of the year due to the Trump administration's move to curb federal spending. Reduced funding may have affected BigBear.ai's sales, but its top-line performance is expected to improve going forward, supported by the definitive $250 million agreement to acquire Ask Sage.\n\nAsk Sage is a fast-growing generative AI platform that has seen broad adoption, with users including the U.S. Space Force and the Defense Health Agency. It is designed for secure AI deployment in restricted fields such as defense and national security, according to ir.bigbear.ai. Ask Sage serves 100,000 users across 16,000 government teams, and with its acquisition, BigBear.ai expects full-year sales to reach $125 million to $140 million.\nMoreover, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" could drive future growth for BigBear.ai, while the company's robust cash position provides ample resources to support its expansion. The company reached a significant milestone toward profitability in the third quarter, and its expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a stellar 73.1%.\n\nWhile BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

NVDA recently overtook the 50-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.\nThe 50-day simple moving average is a widely used technical indicator that helps determine support or resistance levels for different types of securities. It's one of three major moving averages, but takes precedent because it's the first sign of an up or down trend.\n\nShares of NVDA have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 6.4%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, suggesting that NVDA could be poised for a continued surge.\nThe bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account NVDA's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 15 higher compared to none lower for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nInvestors may want to watch NVDA for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is planning roughly $23 billion in AI-related capital spending in 2026, betting heavily on computing power to fuel its next phase of growth.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nMost of that money will go toward the infrastructure behind Doubao, ByteDance's fast-growing AI assistant, along with tools that power advertising and content recommendations. A key part of the plan is a trial of about 20,000 Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) H200 chips, a roughly $400 million investment that would give ByteDance access to top-tier AI hardware at a time when such supply is tightly controlled. Reports suggest more than half of the budget could be dedicated just to AI processors.\nThat spending still trails U.S. giants like Meta ( NASDAQ:META ) and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ), but ByteDance's private status gives it flexibility to play the long game. Doubao's rapid rise in China shows why the company is leaning in.\nWhy it matters: ByteDance is signaling that AI is now core to its business, not an experiment, and it is willing to spend aggressively to stay ahead.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia and Bath & Body Works have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:34 AM PST 10 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSTR\n\nMARA\n\nBBWI\n\nRIOT\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 24, 2025 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Nvidia NVDA as the Bull of the Day and Bath & Body Works, Inc. BBWI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Strategy Inc. MSTR, MARA Holdings MARA and Riot Platforms RIOT.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day : I run screens and conduct research every day, looking for high-quality companies with strong growth profiles and reasonable valuations, and Nvidia consistently stands out. Few companies sit as squarely at the center of today's most important secular trend.\nDemand for Nvidia's GPUs appears either secular or, if cyclical, still early enough that a downturn is not yet a concern. Roughly half a trillion dollars is expected to flow into AI-related capital spending next year, and Nvidia's chips are estimated to account for roughly 20% of that investment. That scale underscores both the company's dominance and the durability of its demand backdrop.\n\nAfter several months of consolidation, Nvidia shares have begun to reaccelerate, recently breaking out from a well-defined technical pattern. At the same time, analysts have continued to raise earnings estimates, earning the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) . Improving clarity around US&ndash;China semiconductor trade policies has also removed a near-term overhang, reopening a source of demand that had previously been constrained.\nBelow, we outline the outlook for the world's largest publicly traded company and explain why Nvidia remains well positioned to continue leading the market going forward.\nNvidia Shares Bolstered by Strong Growth Forecasts Growth expectations for Nvidia remain exceptional. Sales are projected to rise roughly 63% next year and another 43% in 2027, reflecting an incredible $100 billion jump from one year to the next. On the bottom line, earnings are expected to climb 55.5% next year and 53% the following year, underscoring the company's powerful operating leverage.\n\nWhat also makes this growth profile compelling is valuation. Despite its dominance and momentum, Nvidia trades at about 39.5x forward earnings. With consensus estimates calling for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, the stock carries a PEG ratio of roughly 0.85, a level typically associated with undervalued growth stocks, not the world's most important AI supplier.\nIn other words, investors are not paying a premium commensurate with Nvidia's growth trajectory. If current forecasts hold, valuation support alone provides a cushion, while continued execution on revenue, margins, and ecosystem expansion offers meaningful upside.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia Stock Breaks Out Nvidia shares staged a decisive breakout this week, resolving higher from a well-defined descending bullish wedge, a pattern that typically signals trend continuation. After several months of consolidation, the stock has clearly regained momentum, suggesting selling pressure has been absorbed and buyers are regaining control.\n\nWith the breakout now confirmed, the technical setup points to a renewed push higher, and a retest of record highs in the near term would not be surprising. Importantly, this move is occurring alongside rising earnings estimates and improving fundamental visibility, reinforcing the signal and increasing the likelihood that the breakout proves durable.\nCan Investors Buy Shares in NVDA? Given the combination of accelerating earnings growth, reasonable valuation relative to its growth profile, and a confirmed technical breakout, Nvidia remains an attractive buy for investors with a medium- to long-term horizon. The stock has spent several months consolidating prior gains, allowing fundamentals to catch up to price, and that process now appears complete.\n\nWhile near-term volatility is always possible, particularly in a stock that has already delivered outsized returns, the underlying setup argues that pullbacks are more likely to be opportunities rather than warning signs. With earnings estimates still moving higher, demand visibility extending well into next year, and technical momentum turning decisively positive, Nvidia continues to justify its leadership position in the market and remains the core holding in the AI theme.\nBear of the Day: Bath & Body Works, Inc. appears to be facing a structural decline as sales, earnings power, brand relevance, and analyst expectations continue to trend lower. What was once a productive specialty retail model is increasingly under pressure in a more competitive, digitally driven landscape.\nStore traffic remains muted, and the company has struggled to resonate with younger consumers, leading to ongoing market share losses to competitors with stronger product innovation and more effective digital engagement. At the same time, margin visibility is deteriorating. Elevated promotional activity, persistent tariff exposure, and rising operating costs are compressing profitability, with few clear offsets in sight.\n\nManagement's revised outlook points to a longer and more challenging recovery. Softer top-line expectations, combined with continued SG&A deleverage, suggest earnings will remain constrained even if demand stabilizes. With promotional intensity likely to remain elevated, execution risk appears skewed to the downside over the next several quarters.\nReflecting these challenges, analysts have continued to downgrade the stock. Shares have been in a persistent downtrend for roughly four years, underscoring the market's lack of confidence in a near-term turnaround.\nBBWI Stock Drops Along with Earnings Estimates The earnings revision trend for Bath & Body Works has deteriorated meaningfully again over the past 60 days, pushing the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) . Analyst confidence has weakened sharply, with next quarter earnings estimates cut by 42% and next year estimates reduced by 31.5%, reflecting rising concerns around demand, margins, and execution.\n\nThe top line outlook offers little support. Sales are expected to decline 2.3% next year and a further 3% in 2027, signaling ongoing pressure on traffic. On the bottom line, earnings are forecast to fall 11.6% this year and 11.5% next year, suggesting that cost pressures and promotional intensity are overwhelming management's ability to protect profitability.\nThis combination, falling revenue, shrinking margins, and accelerating estimate cuts is particularly concerning. Sustained negative revisions tend to weigh heavily on stock performance, and without a clear catalyst to stabilize earnings expectations, BBWI remains fundamentally challenged in the near to intermediate term.\nShould Investors Avoid BBWI Stock? Given the ongoing deterioration in fundamentals, BBWI remains a stock to avoid. Earnings estimates continue to move sharply lower, revenue trends are negative, and margin pressure shows little sign of abating. In retail, sustained negative revisions are rarely a short-term issue, and BBWI's estimate trajectory suggests deeper structural challenges rather than a temporary slowdown.\n\nUntil the company can demonstrate a clear inflection in traffic, brand relevance, and profitability, and until earnings revisions stabilize, the risk-reward profile remains unattractive. With shares entrenched in a multi-year downtrend and analyst sentiment firmly negative, BBWI lacks the catalysts needed to justify new capital at this stage.\nAdditional content: Strategy's Bitcoin Accretion Continues: Is It Durable? Strategy Inc. continues to deepen its identity as the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 2025 marking a decisive acceleration in Bitcoin accretion. In 2025, the company has meaningfully stepped up its accumulation pace, expanding holdings to roughly 671,000 BTC, including a recent 10,645 BTC purchase in mid-December. With its Bitcoin ownership exceeding 3% of the global supply, Strategy's accumulation has evolved into an ongoing process rather than opportunistic trades.\n\nThat momentum is clearly reflected in key operating metrics. BTC Yield reached 26% year to date, while BTC Gain climbed to 116,555 BTC, marking a sharp rise from earlier quarters. Importantly, Bitcoin per share continued to rise even as new equity was issued, indicating that capital raises remain adding value on a per-share basis. These metrics suggest that Bitcoin accumulation is being executed with discipline.\nThe durability of this momentum is further supported by recent structural tailwinds. Regulatory clarity following IRS guidance on fair-value taxation reduces uncertainty for long-term Bitcoin holders, while the company's new S&P B- credit rating expands access to global high-yield capital markets. At the same time, growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin via ETFs and derivatives has improved liquidity and reduced volatility, creating a more supportive macro backdrop for treasury adoption.\n\nLooking ahead, management reaffirmed its target of a 30% BTC yield and $20 billion in BTC dollar profits for 2025, indicating confidence in maintaining this trajectory. While Bitcoin remains volatile, the company's expanded access to capital supports more sustainable compound growth.\nMSTR Faces Growing Pressure from Crypto Rivals MARA Holdings challenges MSTR with a fundamentally different crypto strategy. MARA Holdings blends Bitcoin production and accumulation, leveraging large-scale mining alongside strategic purchases. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, MARA Holdings held 52,850 BTC, supported by an energized hash rate of 60.4 EH/s, indicating scalable, long-term competitive pressure.\n\nRiot Platforms presents a growing threat to MSTR by monetizing Bitcoin through large-scale mining operations. RIOT strengths include cost efficiency and strategic expansion, and digital infrastructure supporting the Bitcoin network directly. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, RIOT held 19,287 BTC, produced 1,406 BTC and deployed a 36.5 EH/s hash rate. With $180.2 million in revenues and $104.5 million in net income, RIOT highlights growing competitive pressure on MSTR.\nMSTR's Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates MSTR has significantly underperformed both its sector and key competitors. Shares of Strategy have plunged 54.1% over the past year against a 15.7% gain in the Zacks Finance sector. Riot Platforms rose 23.4% during the same period, while MARA Holdings declined 49.7%.\nMSTR has a Value Score of F. It is currently trading at a Price/Book ratio of 0.9X compared to the sector's 4.28X.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSTR's 2025 earnings is pegged at $78.04 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The estimate also indicates a strong year-over-year recovery from a loss of $6.72 per share.\nMSTR stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Intel Shares Fall on Report Nvidia Halts Production Test\n\nJake Rudnitsky\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:14 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. shares fell in premarket trading Wednesday after a report said that Nvidia Corp. halted a test to use Intel’s production process to make advanced chips.\nNvidia recently tested the so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, Reuters reported, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nSpokespeople for Nvidia and Intel didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies are “progressing well.”\nIntel’s shares fell about 2.3% in early trading before markets opened in New York.\nIntel recently opened a new factory at its Ocotillo site in Arizona known as Fab 52 that’s the first to go into mass production with the 18A technique. The company says it’s the most cutting edge production technology developed and deployed in the US. Intel’s push to make advanced chips domestically is an attempt to challenge the global leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and reassert American leadership in the industry.\n\nNvidia agreed to invest $5 billion into Intel in September, following the US government’s decision to take a roughly 10% stake in the company. The investment by the world’s most valuable company and a key designer of chips for the artificial intelligence boom was seen as a boost for Intel, which has struggled to stem losses and catch competitors that have surpassed it in recent years. However, the deal didn’t include a commitment for Intel to make Nvidia chips.\n18A is a bid to return to making Intel’s best offerings in-house. The technology contains two new features that Intel says are breakthroughs for the industry.\nThe first relates to transistors, the microscopic switches that give semiconductors their function. Modern chips cram tens of billions of transistors into a small area. In order to make chips more efficient and use less energy, the ability to switch these transistors on and off becomes critical.\n\nThe 18A products will be the first to have transistors made with so-called gate-all-around technology, a technique that allows finer control over this process, Intel said. That will allow for chips with more transistors — and the ability to handle growing amounts of data — that consume less power.\nThe second innovation pertains to how the chips are powered. The ultimate promise is that chips can have more transistors and be more efficient.\n\nStory Continues\n(Updates with more detail on 18A process.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "These 6 stocks will lead the $1 trillion chip surge in 2026, BofA says\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAVGO\n\n^GSPC\n\nLRCX\n\nKLAC\n\nThe artificial intelligence boom isn't cooling off — it's getting bigger, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya contends.\nWhile AI skeptics have pointed to eye-popping valuations as a reason to run, Arya said the industry is only at the \"midpoint\" of a decade-long transformation, and it's being led by Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ).\n\nIn a report titled \"2026 Year Ahead: choppy, still cheerful,\" Arya forecast a 30% year-over-year surge in global semiconductor sales that will finally push the sector past a historic $1 trillion annual sales milestone in 2026.\nArya noted a strong belief in companies with \"moats that are quantified by their margin structure.\" In addition to Nvidia and Broadcom, he highlighted four other large-cap semiconductor companies — Lam Research ( LRCX ), KLA ( KLAC ), Analog Devices ( ADI ), and Cadence Design Systems ( CDNS ) — as his top picks for 2026.\n\"I often say that investing in semis is very simple,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call. \"You don't need any sell-side analyst to do that. Just take all your companies, sort them by gross margins, and buy the top five, and you're not going to be that wrong.\"\nBofA estimates that the total addressable market for AI data center systems will reach over $1.2 trillion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion opportunity.\nDespite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious because AI data centers are expensive. A typical 1 gigawatt facility requires upwards of $60 billion in capital expenditures, with roughly half of that going directly to hardware, per Bank of America.\n\nThat raises the question: Will the return on investment ever materialize?",

      "Content": "The 20-Year Signal: Preparing for the Predicted Reversal of AI-Fueled Stock Market Gains\n\nDavid Beren\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:45 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nThere is no question that artificial intelligence has transformed the stock market as we know it over the past three years, all but single-handedly driving the S&P 500 to record after record. Companies that are sitting at the forefront of this technology, like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), have delivered returns that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The Shiller CAPE ratio sits above 35, a level seen only twice before: the Great Depression and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\nThe S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022. The Mag 7 tech stocks now represent 30% of total S&P 500 market value.\nAfter the 2000 peak at similar CAPE levels, the S&P 500 fell 49% over 2.5 years and took 7 years to recover.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMost importantly, the AI technology is real, and so far, the enthusiasm for this technology has been mostly justified, all while the long-term potential (and dangers) seems incredible. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolios have grown in a massive way over the last 36 months. But, and there is always a but, beneath this celebratory growth, there is a warning signal that has emerged.\nThis indicator, which looks at the close relationships between stock prices and underlying economics, hasn't flashed at current levels in over 20 years, not since the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. The last time this signal appeared, it was followed by a multi-year bear market that erased roughly half of the market's overall value. While history doesn't always repeat itself, it does at least suggest that we need to look at these readings and consider, as investors, what the next smart move really is.\n\nAI Mania Drives Stocks to Historic, Record Highs The artificial intelligence revolution has, without question, captivated investors in a way that almost no other technology has. The belief that AI is going to and has already started to automate work, revolutionize manufacturing, and create entirely new industries is just scratching the surface of what investors are thinking about.\n\nFor companies that are in the AI world, all of this speculation and promise has led to explosive revenue growth. For example, NVIDIA's data center business has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in corporate America, and Microsoft's AI integration across basically its entire product lineup is driving enterprise adoption. In other words, this technology is actually driving real revenue.\n\nStory Continues\nThis technological transformation has driven stock prices to levels that would have seemed absurd three years ago. The S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022, and NVIDIA has seen its market cap grow by trillions. The Mag 7's technology stocks represent a whopping 30% of the entire S&P 500 market value, a level not seen since the 1990s. Valuations have also exploded as the forward P/E of the S&P 500 now hovers around 21 to 22, 40% above historical averages.\n\nThe optimism that is driving these valuation numbers is assuming that AI will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for years to come. More importantly, it also assumes that AI adoption won't have any obstacles to adoption in the coming years and that companies building AI infrastructure will continue generating returns to justify their current high stock prices and valuations.\nThis pattern of pricing in future success isn't new, as the late 1990s boom also seemed a trajectory where investors were basically paying today for profits they expected companies to deliver in the next five years. However, as the world knows, the technology of the internet boom from the 1990s succeeded, it's how you're reading this today, but many of the stocks crashed because valuations got too far ahead of any financial reality.\n\nA Rare Signal Not Seen in Two Decades: What the Indicator Means The warning signal that is flashing today is the Shiller CAPE ratio, a number that is an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio that measures stock prices relative to average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This metric attempts to smooth out short-term earnings volatility and give a longer-lens look at valuation extremes. As of December 2025, the Shiller CAPE sits above 35, a level that has only been seen twice in modern history: the Great Depression market crash and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\n\nThe last time the US saw the CAPE ratio reach these current levels was in early 2000, right before the stock-market crash. At that peak, investors were paying extreme premiums for stocks based on the expectation (think hope) that internet companies would continue to just deliver on their unprecedented growth. History reminds us that the reality of what took place was that these companies did not enjoy unstoppable growth and that the market declined 49% over a 2.5-year period, the NASDAQ fell 78%, and it took 7 years to recover.\nThe CAPE ratio's predictive power comes from understanding long-term perspectives, and unlike traditional P/E ratios that can be distorted by temporary earnings spikes or collapses, the CAPE ratio looks with a wide lens at a full decade of earnings. When this ratio does hit 30, it can be a historical signal that stocks are priced for perfection and have almost no room for disappointment.\n\nWhat makes the current signal particularly troubling is that it isn't just existing in a silo. Instead, it's appearing alongside three other late-cycle indicators like three consecutive years of double-digit S&P 500 gains, forward P/E ratios at 40-year highs, extreme concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks, and retail investor enthusiasm that feels eerily like the dot-com bubble. While no single indicator is going to be definitive, the combination of all three suggests that a major reversal could be on the horizon, and an entire generation of investors has never experienced what happens when valuations are this stretched.\nHistory's Verdict: A Reversal is Coming - How Smart Investors Respond History is pretty unambiguous about what can happen when an extreme CAPE reading is taking place. For one, you might be in a position that creates a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. At the 1929 stock peak, stocks fell 89% over three years, and again in 2000, you had the 49% S&P 500 drop over 2.5 years. What a drop might look like in the near future is unknown, but the pattern that occurred during these two previous instances of extreme valuations resolving through major corrections seems to be all too familiar to what we're going through now with AI.\n\nFor investors, this could be the strategic opportunity they have been waiting for rather than a situation full of panic. The mistake during previous bubbles wasn't recognizing that stocks were not expensive, but it was remaining fully invested at those prices and then panic-selling at the bottom. The smart approach today is about recognizing that current valuations create a situation where the downside potential far exceeds any upside of staying fully invested.\nBuilding a cash reserve now so investors can \"buy the dip,\" as the saying goes, is arguably the best move, to the tune of upward of 30% of a portfolio being liquidated for cash or put into short-term bonds. If the market does decline by 40-50% from current levels, this cash can be invested into companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA at valuations these companies haven't experienced in years. This could give investors a chance to double their position size.\n\nThe key here is going to be the right amount of discipline, as history shows that bear market pain isn't the actual decline itself, it's the psychology of trying to understand how to buy at the bottom. If the market falls 30%, there might be a voice going on that says it's going to 50% and if it falls 50%, total economic collapse might be the voice on the news. In other words, investors should have capital reserved for buying during these panics so they can ignore the noise and acquire quality companies at steep discounts and prepare for the next decade's best returns.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Talks reportedly broke down with Blue Owl Capital over plans to build a $10 billion data center in Michigan. The Larry Ellison-owned tech giant signed a huge deal with OpenAI this year. Oracle has borrowed heavily to build its AI infrastructure but its rising debt has concerned some investors. Nvidia aims to start shipping its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February. That's what three sources told Reuters, who added the firm said it plans to add new production capacity for the semiconductors. The Trump administration allowed sales of Nvidia's H200 chips to China this month. Although Beijing has yet to approve any purchases of it. SoftBank is reportedly racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by the end of the year. Sources said the Japanese investor has explored cash-raising schemes, including a sale of some investments. The company has already sold all of its $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia. Softbank agreed a deal to invest $300 billion in OpenAI this year in one of the biggest bets yet made by CEO Masayoshi Son. UPS-owned company Happy Returns is using AI to spot fakes in holiday boxless returns. The firm says nearly one in every 10 retail items returned for a refund in the U.S. is fraudulent. Its AI tool helps to find fraudulent returns by flagging suspicious packages, analyzing their contents, and sending them for final audit by humans. David Sobie is CEO of Happy Returns. “Retailers are under a tremendous amount of pressure, pressure from a cost perspective and pressure from a return fraud perspective. And so those are two areas that we're really trying to help them alleviate.\" And around 25,000 people have shown interest in joining the Trump administration's so-called Tech Force. That's according to a U.S. government official - Reuters couldn't independently verify the figure. Washington wants to hire staff with AI expertise in federal roles. The candidates will compete for 1,000 spots in the first Tech Force cohort. Recruits will spend two years working on tech projects inside federal agencies.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Finance and YCharts. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio . EPS = earnings per share. Data as of Dec. 23, 2025.\nNvidia: The dominant maker of AI chips and related tech Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), its flagship semiconductors, are considered the gold standard for training artificial intelligence (AI) models and deploying AI applications.\nThe company's data center platform had been performing well for quite some time. But demand began skyrocketing for its AI-enabling products -- its GPUs and high-performance networking products -- soon after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. This event demonstrated to company leaders and the general public the phenomenal capabilities of generative AI.\n\nIn late October at the company's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, D.C., CEO Jensen Huang said that management has \"visibility\" into $500 billion of demand for its key data center technology over the next five quarters . This demand of $100 billion per quarter, on average, is truly mind-blowing. As context, in its fiscal third quarter (ended late October), Nvidia's total revenue was $57.0 billion, of which $51.2 billion was from the data center platform.\nBroadcom: The leading maker of custom AI chips Broadcom develops semiconductors for various end markets and also develops infrastructure software.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's robust growth is being drven by strong demand for its custom AI-enabling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and Ethernet networking products, both for data centers. Its acquisition of software maker VMware in late 2023 is proving to be a shrewd move, as this business is also growing nicely.\n\nBroadcom is the top partner for big tech companies seeking custom ASICs. As the name suggests, these chips are designed for specific applications. These include internal uses and, in some cases, for availability in their cloud computing services. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs can be considered more general-purpose AI chips. There is a need for both GPUs and ASICs, so investors shouldn't be concerned that one of these types of chips will fully win out over the other.\nTSM: The world's largest chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest chip foundry. That means it produces chips of various types for companies that contract out all or some of the manufacturing of chips they design.\nTSM is the largest producer of AI chips worldwide, which has led to significant financial growth in recent years, driven by surging demand for these chips.\n\nTSM's customers include nearly every major chip company, such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which is Nvidia's main rival in the AI-enabling GPU market. Moreover, it also manufactures chips, including AI chips, for major tech companies that have designed their own chips. This includes Apple , widely considered the company's largest customer, though some Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to soon overtake Apple as TSM's top customer.\nAn added benefit for some investors is that TSM pays a decent dividend for a tech company. The dividend yield was 1.13%, as of the close of the market on Dec. 23.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\n\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\n\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory Continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE\nBefore heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms -- Walden International and Walden Catalyst -- did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO\nBorn in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\n\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\n\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\n\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\n\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL\nSo far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\n\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Nvidia Stock Is Up 31% in 2025, But Here's Another Super Semiconductor Stock to Buy in 2026, According to Wall Street\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 2:38 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nWSFX.BO\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Nvidia continues to experience incredible demand for its data center chips.\nMicron Technology supplies high-bandwidth memory for data centers, which Nvidia has integrated into its GPUs.\nMicron stock has tripled in 2025, but it still looks cheap.\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which are the main chips used to develop artificial intelligence (AI). The company is seeing more demand for its products than it can possibly supply, which is fueling a huge surge in its revenue and earnings.\n\nWith just one week left in 2025, Nvidia stock is sitting on a return of nearly 37%. But it has been trounced by another AI semiconductor stock, which is up by an eye-popping 229% this year: Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) . This company supplies memory and storage chips that are critical for AI workloads in data centers, computers, and even smartphones.\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 43 analysts who cover Micron stock, and the overwhelming majority think it's a buy heading into 2026. In fact, not a single analyst recommends selling. Here's why it could be a great addition to any portfolio for the new year.\nNvidia is one of Micron's many AI customers High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is needed to unlock the best performance from every data center GPU because it stores information in a ready state, which accelerates processing speeds. A low memory capacity can cause bottlenecks by forcing the GPU to pause its computations while it waits to receive more data, whereas a high capacity keeps data flowing constantly. This is especially important in data-intensive AI workloads.\n\nMicron's HBM3E data center solution offers 50% more capacity than the competition, while consuming 30% less energy. This is a winning combination for AI developers that want the best performance at the lowest cost, which is why Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are using it in their latest GPUs.\nMicron is now preparing to ramp up production of its new HBM4E solution, which could offer up to 60% more capacity with a further 20% improvement in energy efficiency. The company says that its entire supply is already sold out for the calendar year 2026. But this opportunity is only just starting to heat up. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra expects the market for data center HBM to almost triple in value by 2028, reaching $100 billion annually.\nWhile data centers are certainly Micron's biggest opportunity right now, many top manufacturers of personal computers and smartphones are integrating AI capabilities into their latest devices. This is fueling more demand for high-capacity memory in those markets, too.\n\nStory Continues\nDuring Micron's fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended Nov. 27, 2025), 59% of its customers' flagship smartphones needed at least 12 gigabytes of memory. That percentage more than doubled from the year-ago period.\nMicron's data center revenue is soaring Micron generated a record $13.6 billion in revenue during its fiscal 2026 first quarter, which was up 56% year over year. But the real growth story was beneath the surface of the headline number, because revenue from the company's cloud memory segment (where it accounts for data center HBM sales) doubled to $5.3 billion.\n\nSince Micron is experiencing so much demand for its chips, it had incredible pricing power during Q1, which led to improved profit margins across its entire business. As a result, the company generated earnings of $4.60 per share, which was a whopping 175% jump from the year-ago period.\nMicron's momentum is still picking up steam. According to its latest guidance, the company expects to generate $18.7 billion in revenue during the current fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ends Feb. 28, 2026), representing an increase of 132% year over year. In other words, Micron's top-line growth rate is poised to more than double from Q1.\nThe company also anticipates a blockbuster bottom-line result in Q2, with earnings of $8.19 per share potentially in the cards. That would be a mind-blowing 480% increase year over year.\n\nMicron stock looks cheap compared to Nvidia stock Out of the 43 analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal , 30 have given Micron stock a buy rating. Nine others are in the overweight (bullish) camp, while three recommend holding. Although one analyst has given the stock an underweight (bearish) rating, none recommend outright selling.\nThe analysts have an average price target of $308.11, suggesting that the stock could climb by 16% over the next 12 to 18 months. However, the Street-high target of $500 implies an even bigger potential return of 88%.\n\nI think both of those targets are realistic because Micron stock looks like a bargain right now, despite tripling in value so far in 2025. Based on the company's trailing 12-month earnings of $10.52 per share, its stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 25.2. That means it's significantly cheaper than Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/E ratio of 44.8 as I write this.\nAs I highlighted earlier, Nvidia uses Micron's data center HBM solutions in its latest GPUs, so if you expect Nvidia to continue selling truckloads of chips (which is likely), then it's only logical to be extremely bullish on Micron's business as well.\nI wouldn't recommend selling Nvidia stock , because it also looks attractive right now. But Micron stock could be an even better way for investors to play the AI boom in 2026 from a value perspective.\n\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now?

      "Content": "Bull of the Day: Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nEthan Feller\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nI run screens and conduct research every day, looking for high-quality companies with strong growth profiles and reasonable valuations, and Nvidia ( NVDA ) consistently stands out. Few companies sit as squarely at the center of today’s most important secular trend.\nDemand for Nvidia’s GPUs appears either secular or, if cyclical, still early enough that a downturn is not yet a concern. Roughly half a trillion dollars is expected to flow into AI-related capital spending next year, and Nvidia’s chips are estimated to account for roughly 20% of that investment. That scale underscores both the company’s dominance and the durability of its demand backdrop.\n\nAfter several months of consolidation, Nvidia shares have begun to reaccelerate, recently breaking out from a well-defined technical pattern. At the same time, analysts have continued to raise earnings estimates, earning the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) . Improving clarity around US–China semiconductor trade policies has also removed a near-term overhang, reopening a source of demand that had previously been constrained.\nBelow, we outline the outlook for the world’s largest publicly traded company and explain why Nvidia remains well positioned to continue leading the market going forward.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia Shares Bolstered by Strong Growth Forecasts Growth expectations for Nvidia remain exceptional. Sales are projected to rise roughly 63% next year and another 43% in 2027, reflecting an incredible $100 billion jump from one year to the next. On the bottom line, earnings are expected to climb 55.5% next year and 53% the following year, underscoring the company’s powerful operating leverage.\n\nWhat also makes this growth profile compelling is valuation. Despite its dominance and momentum, Nvidia trades at about 39.5x forward earnings. With consensus estimates calling for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, the stock carries a PEG ratio of roughly 0.85, a level typically associated with undervalued growth stocks, not the world’s most important AI supplier.\nIn other words, investors are not paying a premium commensurate with Nvidia’s growth trajectory. If current forecasts hold, valuation support alone provides a cushion, while continued execution on revenue, margins, and ecosystem expansion offers meaningful upside.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia Stock Breaks Out Nvidia shares staged a decisive breakout this week, resolving higher from a well-defined descending bullish wedge, a pattern that typically signals trend continuation. After several months of consolidation, the stock has clearly regained momentum, suggesting selling pressure has been absorbed and buyers are regaining control.\n\nStory continues\nWith the breakout now confirmed, the technical setup points to a renewed push higher, and a retest of record highs in the near term would not be surprising. Importantly, this move is occurring alongside rising earnings estimates and improving fundamental visibility, reinforcing the signal and increasing the likelihood that the breakout proves durable.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nCan Investors Buy Shares in NVDA? Given the combination of accelerating earnings growth, reasonable valuation relative to its growth profile, and a confirmed technical breakout, Nvidia remains an attractive buy for investors with a medium- to long-term horizon. The stock has spent several months consolidating prior gains, allowing fundamentals to catch up to price, and that process now appears complete.\n\nWhile near-term volatility is always possible, particularly in a stock that has already delivered outsized returns, the underlying setup argues that pullbacks are more likely to be opportunities rather than warning signs. With earnings estimates still moving higher, demand visibility extending well into next year, and technical momentum turning decisively positive, Nvidia continues to justify its leadership position in the market and remains the core holding in the AI theme.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Sold Nvidia and Palantir and Piled Into One of Wall Street's Hottest Drug Stocks Ahead of 2026\n\nSean Williams, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:11 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Quarterly-filed Form 13Fs allow investors to track which stocks Wall Street's savviest money managers are buying and selling.\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller dumped his fund's stakes in AI darlings Nvidia and Palantir -- and profit-taking may not explain the entire story.\nMeanwhile, Duquesne's investment chief has scooped up shares of an inexpensive drugmaker for five consecutive quarters.\n10 stocks we like better than Teva Pharmaceutical Industries ›\n\nFor the better part of the last three years, no trend has garnered more attention on Wall Street than artificial intelligence (AI) . Empowering software and systems with the tools to make split-second decisions, all without the need for human oversight, is a technological advancement that can benefit most industries around the globe -- and the stock market's savviest money managers know it.\nNo later than 45 calendar days following the end of a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F details which stocks Wall Street's brightest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter.\nAs you can imagine, the stock market's AI darlings, graphics processing unit (GPU) titan Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) giant Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) , have been top-tier holdings for several fund managers. But this optimism isn't universal.\nDuquesne Family Office's billionaire boss, Stanley Druckenmiller, exited his fund's positions in Nvidia and Palantir well in advance of 2026 . Instead of focusing on AI, Druckenmiller has been busy piling into one of Wall Street's hottest drug stocks for five consecutive quarters.\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller showed Nvidia and Palantir to the door Since the beginning of 2023, Nvidia and Palantir have made their patient shareholders considerably richer. Nvidia became the first public company to reach the $5 trillion market cap plateau earlier this year, while shares of Palantir have climbed by more than 2,900%!\nThese near-parabolic ascents reflect the seemingly sustainable moats that both companies hold dear. Nvidia's Hopper, Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra GPUs have been superior, on a compute basis, to external competition. With AI infrastructure demand outpacing supply, and CEO Jensen Huang intent on bringing a new GPU to market annually, Nvidia hasn't had any trouble charging a premium price for its hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, Palantir's AI-driven Gotham and Foundry SaaS platforms lack one-for-one replacements at scale. Gotham assists the U.S. government and its allies in planning and overseeing military missions, as well as in collecting and analyzing data. The multiyear contracts Palantir has signed with the U.S. government ensure predictable double-digit sales growth and abundant operating cash flow.\n\nLa historia continúa\nDespite these sustainable moats, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller parted ways with both stocks. He jettisoned his fund's remaining stake of 214,060 shares of Nvidia during the September-ended quarter of 2024. As for Palantir, 769,965 shares were shown to the door in a nine-month stretch between July 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025.\n\nDruckenmiller dumping the faces of the AI revolution may represent nothing more than simple profit-taking. According to 13F aggregator WhaleWisdom.com, the average hold time for every security in Duquesne Family Office's fund, as of Sept. 30, was less than seven months. This demonstrates the willingness of its investment chief to take profits when the opportunity presents itself.\nThe concern is that there may be more to this selling activity than just a desire to cash in his chips.\nFor example, history tells us that every game-changing technological advancement over the last three decades, including the internet, genome decoding, nanotechnology, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse, has navigated an early stage bubble-bursting event. Although it's impossible to forecast when the music will stop, the common theme has been an overestimation by investors of the adoption rate and/or optimization of a new technology.\n\nWhile Nvidia's and Palantir's sales growth point to robust demand for their respective products and services, most businesses that are aggressively spending on AI have yet to optimize their solutions. In other words, companies deploying AI haven't figured out how to get the highest return out of their investment. It takes time for all technologies to mature and evolve. If an AI bubble forms and subsequently bursts, Nvidia and Palantir stocks would be in trouble.\nFurthermore, the valuations for Wall Street's favorite AI duo are suspect. Historically, price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 for companies at the forefront of next-big-thing innovations have been unsustainable over the long run. Though Nvidia, briefly, topped a P/S ratio of 30 in early November, it's Palantir's P/S ratio of 127, as of the closing bell on Dec. 19, which stands out like a sore thumb.\nDuquesne's billionaire boss has loaded up on shares of this drug stock ahead of 2026 At the other end of the spectrum, Duquesne Family Office's lead investor has continued to scoop up shares of brand-name and generic-drug developer Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE: TEVA) . Shares of Teva have soared by 191% since the beginning of 2024.\nDruckenmiller began loading up on shares of this drug stock during the second half of 2024 and simply hasn't stopped. Between July 1, 2024, and Sept. 30, 2025, 13Fs show:\n\nQ3 2024 : 1,427,950 shares purchased\nQ4 2024 : 7,569,450 shares purchased\nQ1 2025 : 5,882,350 shares purchased\nQ2 2025 : 1,089,189 shares purchased\nQ3 2025 : 625,000 shares purchased (16,593,935 total shares held)\nIn 15 months, Teva has become the third-largest holding by market value in the nearly $4.1 billion fund Druckenmiller oversees.\nOne reason for this optimism likely has to do with Teva working through a series of legal overhangs. In particular, the company resolved litigation in early 2023 with 48 states regarding its role in the opioid crisis. Quantifying this settlement and spreading it out over 13 years alleviated the company's financial concerns, allowing investors to refocus on Teva's innovative capabilities.\nSpeaking of innovation, CEO Richard Francis has made waves by shifting his company's focus toward novel drug development. While Teva continues to be a key player in the global generic drug market, the pricing power of generics hasn't been great for years. Developing brand-name therapies affords Teva improved pricing power and considerably higher margins. For instance, in 2025, tardive dyskinesia drug Austedo is expected to bring in more than $2 billion in global sales.\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical has also vastly improved its balance sheet over the last nine years.\nFollowing the buyout of generic drug company Actavis in August 2016, Teva's net debt surpassed $35 billion. But under the leadership of turnaround specialist CEO Kare Schultz, who preceded Richard Francis, the company lowered its annual operating expenses, sold off non-core assets, and significantly reduced its net debt. As of the end of the third quarter of 2025, Teva's net debt has been more than halved to $14.6 billion.\nLastly, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller was likely drawn to Teva's valuation amid a historically expensive stock market. Though it's trading at a still-reasonable 11 times forward-year earnings per share, as of this writing, Duquesne's billionaire boss began scooping up shares with Teva trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio as low as 5.\n\nShould you buy stock in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries right now?

On December 22, Reuters reported that Nvidia has told its Chinese clients that it aims to start shipping its H200 AI chips to China before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February.\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, the AI chipmaker will fulfil initial orders from existing stock, with shipments anticipated to total 5,000 to 10,000 chip modules.

      "Content": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 10 Years?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's business model has become extremely overexposed to the generative AI hardware market.\nCan new tech trends like autonomous driving, robotics, and quantum computing boost diversification?\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe most resilient businesses constantly reinvent themselves, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is an excellent example of this phenomenon. Its ability to quickly dominate new technology opportunities is a big reason why it has soared to become the largest company in the world with a market cap of $4.4 trillion. And even though generative artificial intelligence (AI) is behind most of the recent expansion, the boom might not last forever. Let's explore what might come next for this legendary chipmaker.\n\nNvidia has a track record of reinventing itself Since its founding in 1993, Nvidia has reliably banked on new use cases for the graphics processing unit (GPU) -- a technology that it named and pioneered for its proficiency in parallel processing, which involves breaking down large tasks into smaller parts and working on them simultaneously. Parallel processing turned out to be extremely useful for rendering video game graphics. And in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Nvidia became a major player in the industry, supplying consumer GPU chips for PCs and even Microsoft 's early Xbox gaming consoles.\n\nNvidia boomed again in the 2010s when people realized that its GPUs were also extremely good at cryptocurrency mining . Cryptocurrency miners relied on the same PC-focused GPUs as gaming, and both growth drivers were included in the company's gaming segment, which was historically the bulk of revenue. However, things have changed.\nWith the growth of generative AI, Nvidia's once-vital gaming segment has become an afterthought, representing a measly 7.5% of the company's $57 billion in third-quarter revenue. The company is now massively dependent on its data center segment, where it sells large enterprise-focused GPU systems to help clients run and train AI large language models (LLMs). This business represented around 90% of Q3 revenue, which suggests Nvidia lacks diversification and is extremely overexposed to a potential slowdown in this particular market.\n\nThe generative AI boom might not last forever While AI-related demand continues to soar year over year, some cracks are forming in the foundation of this opportunity. For starters, many of Nvidia's customers are burning through mountains of cash -- the best example is OpenAI. The ChatGPT creator is estimated to have lost $11.5 billion in its most recent quarter alone. And analysts at Deutsche Bank think the situation could worsen with combined losses totaling $140 billion between 2024 and 2029. It's reasonable to assume that other LLM companies like Anthropic could be experiencing similar cash burn.\n\nStory Continues\nAs a hardware provider, Nvidia operates on the picks and shovels side of the AI equation, shielding it from the challenges faced by some of its clients. That said, over the long term, this will eventually become Nvidia's problem, too. If the LLM clients continue burning money, they could run out of the funds needed to continue buying Nvidia hardware.\nCompared to pure plays like OpenAI, Nvidia's hyperscaler clients like Amazon , Google , and Microsoft are in a better position to absorb AI losses because of their diversified business models. However, over time, their shareholders could push back at their current levels of GPU spending. Furthermore, these companies are turning into major rivals for Nvidia because of their investments in custom chip design.\n\nThis month, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI signed a deal with Amazon to use its chips for training AI workloads. This development follows a similar agreement with Google.\nWhat comes next for Nvidia? Nvidia's challenges seem to be reflected in its rock-bottom forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23. This valuation is low considering the company's strong growth, and it suggests the market is nervous about the sustainability of Nvidia's current business model. Over the next ten years, the company might have to reinvent itself yet again. The good news is that there are some compelling options.\n\nIn Q3, revenue in Nvidia's automotive and robotics segment grew 32% to $592 million. While this is a drop in the bucket compared to its total business, this could become a key growth driver if self-driving cars and humanoid robots become an important part of daily life.\nThe company is also working on quantum computing chips called quantum processing units (QPUs), which could help with things like materials science and drug discovery. That said, this all remains quite speculative, and investors may want to wait for more signs that Nvidia is diversifying its business model before considering a position in the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

It was already a star stock before AI transformed the world as we know it, but it was relatively obscure outside the investing community.\n\nThat focus put it into an excellent position to support the growth of generative AI, which requires the kind of power that Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) provide, although there are many competitors today, including other kinds of chips like Alphabet 's Tensor Processing Units (TPU) and Broadcom 's application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC). However, it's a lot more than GPUs these days, and it continues to stay ahead of the curve and launch new products and systems. Its clients are reliant on its CUDA (compute unified device architecture) software and vertically integrated program that creates a robust economic moat; users are already invested in its systems.\nThis ecosystem is Nvidia's edge, and this is where the company is investing. It has incredible opportunities in data centers, which are huge AI factories using a suite of Nvidia services. These generate the compute and inference power necessary to process the huge data loads that make AI happen.\n\nIt recently rolled out a line of quantum computing hardware, including supercomputers that harness the power of quantum processing units (QPU). These kinds of integrated and hybrid solutions, in which it excels and has an unparalleled program, are fast becoming Nvidia's niche.\nDespite new competition, it still can't keep up with consumer demand. Sales increased 62% year over year in the 2026 fiscal third quarter (ended Oct. 26), and management is expecting sales to increase 65% in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's why it continues to report incredible growth, quarter after quarter. And because it has such a lead in its space, it can price its products at a high gross margin, which translates into a healthy and growing bottom line; gross margin was 73.6% in the third quarter, and earnings per share (EPS) were up from $0.81 to $1.30.\n\nCan Nvidia keep up its growth? Turning $10,000 into $1 million implies growing it a hundredfold, or 10,000%. Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world today, worth $4.3 trillion. It doesn't seem possible for it to gain 10,000% at its stage today, even very far off into the future.\nStock gains typically follow percentage growth, and although Nvidia is still reporting impressive growth, it's hard to imagine it being able to sustain that momentum in percentage terms, even if it keeps increasing in dollar terms. For example, it has $187 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. At a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of even 30% over the next 10 years, which is well below where it's holding today, sales would surpass $2.5 trillion, which doesn't seem like a likely outcome; at some point, the growth rate must decline. As growth slows down, stock gains are going to as well.\n\nEven this year, Nvidia stock is up 35%. While that's still about double the stock market's gain, it's a steep deceleration from the past two years.\nI don't envision a $10,000 investment in Nvidia stock turning into $1 million at this stage, but it could still deliver market-beating results for the growth-oriented investor.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "SoundHound AI vs. GitLab: Which Stock Is the Better 2026 Rebound Candidate?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:26 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SOUN\n\nGTLB\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points SoundHound AI and GitLab both saw their stocks underperform in 2025.\nSoundHound has a big opportunity with voice-powered artificial intelligence (AI) agents.\nInvestors are overestimating the potential negative impact of AI on GitLab and underestimating its opportunity.\n10 stocks we like better than SoundHound AI ›\n\nThe stocks of SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) and GitLab (NASDAQ: GTLB) have both had a rough go in 2025. The former trades down more than 40% on the year, as of this writing, while the latter has lost more than 30% of its value.\nHowever, both stocks could be poised to rebound in 2026. Let's take a close look to see which one has the better opportunity to outperform next year.\nThe case for SoundHoundAI SoundHound's underperformance in 2025 has more to do with investors learning that Nvidia exited the position it took in the stock in Q4 2024 than it does with the company's actual performance. SoundHound has been growing its revenue rapidly, with it more than doubling through the first nine months of the year.\n\nThe company has established itself as a leader in voice artificial intelligence (AI) , as its \"speech-to-meaning\" and \"deep meaning understanding\" technology can understand someone's intent even before they are finished talking, allowing it to interact with people in a more natural and flowing way. This helped it gain strong traction in the automobile industry, where vehicle makers were looking for better AI voice assistants, as well as the restaurant industry.\nHowever, as we enter 2026, the company's biggest opportunity is with voice-powered AI agents. The company acquired a company called Amelia, which was strong in virtual agents, and has since combined the two companies' technologies to make a push with AI voice-powered agents. Amelia also brought with it a solid customer base in different verticals, such as retail, financial services, and healthcare.\n\nSoundHound is now pushing its AI agent technology with the rollout of its Amelia 7 platform. Amelia has some low- gross-margin customers, so this new platform is also an opportunity to improve the margins at Amelia's legacy customers.\nThe case for GitLab Like SoundHound, GitLab's stock performance in 2025 wasn't really reflective of its operating results. The company has grown its revenue by between 25% to 35% for each of the last nine quarters, showing its strong consistency.\nHowever, the company has been subject to the narrative that it will be an AI loser, with the notion that AI agents will replace coders. For those unfamiliar with GitLab, it runs a DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) platform, which is a secure environment for organizations to create software. The bearish argument is that with AI, organizations will reduce their number of programmers, which will hurt GitLab and its seat-based subscription model.\n\nStory Continues\nThus far, that hasn't been the case, with the company continuing to both add new customers and see strong growth with existing customers, as reflected in its 119% dollar-based net retention over the past 12 months. Any number above 100% reflects growth from customers who have been with the company for a year or more, after any churn.\n\nIronically, the bulk of this growth has come from seat expansions, which is exactly what bears are betting will start to deteriorate. It hasn't, but the stock nonetheless hasn't been able to shake the bearish case.\nHowever, the company has also been taking steps to protect itself if such a scenario unfolds. It recently introduced a hybrid seat-plus-usage-based model, which should also help drive growth. The company's solution has become more valuable with the introduction of its own AI tools, such as Duo Agent, and it is now much more of a comprehensive end-to-end software development life cycle (SDLC) platform that saves coders time and customers money.\nMeanwhile, the stock is very attractively valued, trading at a price-to-sales multiple of just 5.7 times fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027) analyst estimates for a company with high 80% gross margins and strong mid-20% revenue growth.\n\nThe verdict I think that SoundHound and GitLab can both nicely rebound in 2026. However, my pick to outperform is GitLab.\nI think the market is overestimating the potential negative impact of AI on GitLab and underestimating its opportunity. I think the platform is sticky (as evidenced by its net dollar retention), and that the new pricing model could be a nice growth driver, as will continued Duo Agent adoption, which nicely expands ARPU (average revenue per user).\n\nMeanwhile, there aren't going to be all these AI agents running around unchecked, as they too will need to be managed and audited within the confines of a centralized platform like the one offered by GitLab. The stock is too cheap, and I think the bear case fades away with another year of strong revenue growth.\nShould you buy stock in SoundHound AI right now?

Stocking stuffers tend to range from gift cards and gadgets to corny holiday-themed sweaters. But just imagine if you’d unwrapped $10,000 worth of Nvidia (NVDA) stock last December instead of a nice pair of socks.\nThat wouldn’t just be a lovely gift. It would be a gift that keeps on giving.\n\nMore News from Barchart Will Tesla Stock Lose Its ‘Elon Musk Premium’ After the SpaceX IPO? And You Should Sell TSLA Here?\n‘Top Pick’ Amazon Had a Dismal Year: What’s AMZN Stock’s Forecast for 2026?\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nNvidia is riding high on the back of the global artificial intelligence boom, and the company’s value has maintained a steady and impressive upward trajectory throughout the year.\nSo, how much would that gift be worth today? And more importantly, what does Nvidia’s performance in 2025 tell us about investor expectations moving into 2026?\nThe Math: What $10,000 of Nvidia at Christmas 2024 Would Be Worth Now Before we look at why this year was a watershed for Nvidia (and the entire semiconductor market), let’s crunch the numbers.\nNvidia’s shares were trading in the neighborhood of $140 each last Christmas. That means an initial $10,000 investment would have bagged you about 71.4 shares.\nNow, fast-forward to December 2025. Nvidia’s rally hasn’t slowed down. The company continues to beat earnings forecasts and remains dominant in the AI sector. The market is loving it.\n\nOn Monday morning, Nvidia’s shares were trading at $180.99. That would make your 71.4 shares from last year worth just over $12,922. You’re looking at a 29% gain.\nOK: That’s nothing like the rally Nvidia saw in 2024, and it doesn’t compare with the run we’ve seen from fellow AI wunderkind Palantir (PLTR) this year. But 29% is still nothing to scoff at, right?\nThe truth is Nvidia’s 2025 rally hasn’t been a smooth journey.\nWhat Has 2025 Looked Like for Nvidia? This has generally been a good year for Nvidia investors. But 2025 wasn’t without its ups and downs.\nIn 2024, the company executed a split that made its shares a lot more accessible to retail investors. But that liquidity didn’t just boost accessibility. It also expanded Nvidia’s investor base and created extra demand for shares. That meant less free float and more upward pressure on its share prices.\n\nNvidia’s sales teams were also dealing with high demand.\nEvery corporation wants a taste of AI right now. It’s become embedded in the infrastructure of enterprise computing, cloud services, and generative models everywhere. Over the past couple of years, Nvidia’s GPUs have emerged as the default hardware for a lot of large-scale models and inference workloads.\n\nStory Continues\nThat’s why its revenues from data center sales eclipsed every other business segment in 2025, driving consecutive earnings beats and pushing Nvidia to become the world’s most valuable company (for a little while, anyway).\nIt seems like a lot of investors just treated Nvidia shares as a proxy for AI exposure in 2025. And that confidence was only increased when management initiated a buyback program.\n\nBut Nvidia’s been a victim of market volatility this year. That has more to do with speculation surrounding a broader AI bubble rather than the company’s fundamentals.\nIn November, price action saw some big pullbacks. Michael Burry bought almost $200 million in put options against Nvidia, and he’s not the only one betting against the company’s value. That’s why 2026 may be a make-or-break year for shareholders.\nWhat’s on the Horizon for Nvidia in 2026? Now that 2025 is nearly in the rearview mirror, market chatter has already started for 2026. The key issue for Nvidia is the balance between AI adoption and saturation.\nEverybody agrees that AI adoption is real. But many investors like Burry are now debating its breadth and pace. To maintain its value and sustain sales, Nvidia needs industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services to accelerate their GPU deployments. If growth shifts to software layers over hardware, Nvidia is likely to be hurt.\n\nThen there’s competition dynamics. AI chip makers aren’t sitting still. If competitors generate meaningful gains, it’ll force Nvidia to accelerate its own R&D (or defend its pricing). The problem? Its margins are already under pressure.\nHigh-growth companies tend to see expanding margins as they scale up. But sustained investment pushes costs higher, too. There’s a good chance retail investors will get tired of Nvidia’s steep run, and then the narrative could shift to profit-taking instead of accumulation.\nThat wouldn’t necessarily be a bearish signal, but it would be a significant rotation dynamic leading to more price volatility.\nAt the end of the day, a $10,000 Christmas gift of Nvidia stock in 2024 would have generated good tidings in the here and now. Nvidia wasn’t just hype in 2025, and the company delivered measurable growth over the last 12 months.\n\nBut looking ahead into the New Year, the picture is a little bit fuzzier. The sentiment for 2026 is one of cautious optimism because AI isn’t slowing down. But the competition in this space is huge, and a lot of big-time investors are already pricing Nvidia’s next chapter. They’re actively betting against Nvidia and the wider AI boom.\nOnly time will tell if those bets pay off, because right now Nvidia is still looking like the Christmas gift that keeps on giving.\nOn the date of publication, Nash Riggins did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Apple spent 2025 setting itself up for the future — and its biggest moves weren't about AI\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nSSNLF\n\nIt’s been quite a year for Apple ( AAPL ). The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ).\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta ( META ) Reality Labs' new design studio .\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times , Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\nCook is steering a $4 trillion behemoth Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nStory Continues\nCook's decisions drove Apple's stock price ever higher. As a result, the company's market cap has increased from $1 trillion in 2018 to a whopping $4 trillion in 2025.\nRevenue has also continued its steady upward pace, with Apple reporting $416 billion in total sales for its fiscal 2025, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nApple is also reportedly preparing some of the biggest changes in years to its iPhone lineup in 2026. According to Gurman , the company will roll out a foldable iPhone, a first for Apple, in the latter half of the year.\n\nThat could help further goose already record iPhone sales. Apple is also reportedly preparing a new low-cost MacBook model, which would open up the company to a broader customer segment.\nAnd while it may not have the same margins as a high-powered MacBook Pro, a lower-cost MacBook could still help draw more customers to Apple's services, driving increased revenue over the long run.\n\nNew challenges ahead If Ternus is chosen to succeed Cook, he'll inherit an Apple at the peak of its power. While smartphone sales have slowed over time, the company is reaping the benefits of its massive install base, which still upgrades devices every few years and increasingly subscribes to Apple's various services.\n\nBut he'll also have to navigate his share of headaches. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting some kind of movement on Apple's AI strategy. And though the company is making progress on its AI rollout, it still needs to showcase its next-generation version of Siri.\nHe'll also have to prepare to take on the likes of Meta, Google, and Samsung ( 005930.KS ) in the smart glasses space. Meta already has two smart glasses on the market, and Google and Samsung are each working on their own intelligent eyewear.\nFor now, though, Cook is still Apple's CEO. We'll just have to see if that changes in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Which Tech Titan Will Win the Quantum Race (and Net You 100% Returns)?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:43 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points You can pick small quantum computing stocks if you want high-risk, high-reward plays.\nBut tech giants are safer plays, and Nvidia's AI chips are pivotal for the quantum build-out.\nNvidia's NVentures is buying stakes in various quantum companies as part of its strategy.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nBig tech's scramble to win the artificial intelligence (AI) race has taken some of the focus off quantum computing stocks and a potential upcoming boom. Last year, the Boston Consulting Group projected that quantum computing can create up to $850 billion of economic value by 2040. Tech giants have invested heavily in the space, with Google's Willow Chip being able to reduce errors exponentially.\nIt's unknown when quantum computing will have mainstream applications, but if this technology is perfected, it will be able to perform complex calculations and solve major problems that current computing can't. Quantum computing could result in major drug discoveries, encrypted codes getting solved, and business optimizations.\nQuantum computing means new chips and data centers. AI chips and data centers that handle AI workloads are not suitable for a quantum computing boom. That means many of the AI winners could also turn into quantum computing winners.\nSo, investing in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might be the best way to ride the quantum boom. Even with its current successes, Nvidia can still double from current levels if it gets quantum computing right. Let's see why.\nNvidia is already working on quantum Nvidia won't get caught behind other chipmakers in the upcoming quantum race. The company has established a reputation as the best AI chipmaker , and it's already set on becoming a leader in the quantum industry.\nNvidia recently announced NVQLink, which bridges the gap from AI chips to quantum computers. The company has already partnered with 17 quantum builders and nine scientific labs for this project. It's developing the software and digital infrastructure that will be necessary for a quantum boom.\n\nWhile Nvidia isn't developing a quantum chip right now, that may change as quantum computing gets closer to mainstream use. AI chips are already necessary for quantum infrastructure, but quantum chips are more advanced and are also needed. Quantum data centers will need both types of chips. Nvidia is already the clear winner on the AI side, and it has more money than its competitors to invest into research and development for quantum chips.\nNvidia is also investing in quantum computing companies Nvidia isn't just advancing its own quantum computing technology, but it is also buying stakes in quantum computing companies through NVentures. The company's venture capital arm invested in three quantum computing companies in the first half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nEven if Nvidia doesn't capitalize on quantum computing as much as expected, its investments can still pay off. Nvidia can also provide those companies with some of the resources they need to achieve higher returns.\nQuantum computing stocks like IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum show how much quantum computing investments can soar in a short time. All three of these growth stocks have rallied by more than 1,000% over the past three years. Those types of gains make it more plausible for Nvidia to double in value as quantum computing becomes a mainstream resource.\n\nNvidia wins regardless of which quantum computing companies win Nvidia isn't trying to create an innovative business that revolves around quantum computing. It's just selling picks and shovels in the middle of a gold rush. Nvidia produces the digital infrastructure and chips for companies that want to build out business models involving quantum computing.\n\nIf Nvidia wants to make quantum chips and additional tools for the industry, it can tap into a strong balance sheet and growing revenue. Nvidia generated $57 billion of revenue in its fiscal 2026's third quarter, up by 62% year over year. Net income came in at $31.8 billion, which represents a 59% increase. Nvidia makes more profits per quarter than the market caps of pure-play quantum computing stocks like IonQ.\nNvidia also closed out the quarter with $116.5 billion in total current assets. The AI chipmaker already has a lead in quantum since it has the best AI chips. However, it has plenty of capital ready to go if it wants to make a bigger push into quantum computing.\nSmaller quantum computing stocks may outperform Nvidia, but the latter already has a proven business model that brings in cold, hard cash.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $502,783 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,126,057 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 975 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

Could the Stock Surge Next?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: APLD\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Applied Digital is in the right place at the right time as AI spending ramps up.\nIts ability to achieve projects on time and on budget may help it win over the trust of big tech companies.\nA single deal could add billions of dollars to Applied Digital's balance sheet, and the company is in a position to sign several big deals.\n10 stocks we like better than Applied Digital ›\n\nArtificial intelligence is revolutionizing the world. AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT quickly became mainstream, with autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots on the way. All of these innovations require AI chips, which is why investors have been loading up on semiconductor stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom .\nThese AI chips work, but there's one big problem. They all require significant power to operate. AI models and innovations require gigawatts to operate, and traditional data centers aren't cutting it. Those buildings aren't optimized for AI workloads, and that's where AI data center providers like Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) come in.\nApplied Digital has roughly 4 gigawatts worth of data center capacity at the moment, and that could translate into billions of dollars in annual recurring revenue once it's all set up and deals have been established. Applied Digital has already entered three lease agreements with CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) , with the total revenue coming to approximately $11 billion over 15 years.\nThe leases cover 400 megawatts, and Applied Digital's 4 gigawatt pipeline suggests the company could support nine additional deals like the CoreWeave contract. Here's why Applied Digital could expand beyond CoreWeave and continue to win over tech giants.\nThe AI race is intense The key players in the AI race have all committed to spending more money on this technology. Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , and Meta Platforms are some of the top players in the industry. These companies generate billions of dollars in quarterly profits and view AI as the next internet boom.\nAI models, autonomous vehicles , and humanoid robots have the potential to change how people shop and interact with the world. Companies know the potential of AI and have already thrown a lot of money at Nvidia. Now, they are increasingly looking at the energy bottleneck that companies like Applied Digital solve.\n\nRight now, Applied Digital makes almost all of its AI revenue from CoreWeave. Other AI data center providers like Iren (NASDAQ: IREN) and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) have made deals with Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and other tech companies. It's fair to assume Applied Digital will land deals like that in the future, especially since it has proven to be a trustworthy option for CoreWeave.\n\nStory Continues\nApplied Digital is a leading data center builder Timelines are critical for maintaining a lead in the AI race, and Applied Digital is doing its part. The AI data center provider told investors that its 100 MW building at Polaris Forge 1 is nearing completion while remaining on time and on budget.\nFulfilling project benchmarks will help Applied Digital build more trust with tech giants. Applied Digital Chairman and CEO Wes Cummins also views it that way.\n\n\"We feel this third lease validates our platform and execution, positioning Applied Digital as a trusted strategic partner to the world's largest technology companies,\" Cummins said in the Q3 press release. \"With hyperscalers expected to invest approximately $350 billion into AI deployment this year, we believe we are in a prime position to serve as the modern-day picks and shovels of the intelligence era.\"\nApplied Digital's 4-gigawatt pipeline also puts it ahead of most AI data center stocks. Iren has approximately 3 gigawatts in its pipeline, while Cipher Mining has 3.2 gigawatts in its pipeline. Applied Digital has the lead, which will come in handy once data centers are built and tech companies scramble to sign big deals.\n\nNew deals can happen quickly and suddenly change the long-term view Applied Digital has a 15-year contract with CoreWeave for $11 billion that covers 400 megawatts. It's a big contract, but it's not the only one in the industry. Iren signed a five-year, $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft for 200 megawatts. Cipher Mining also signed a 15-year deal with Amazon Web Services for $5.5 billion, and that contract covers 300 megawatts.\n\nA single deal adds billions of dollars to an AI data center provider's revenue. These are long-term agreements that result in steady recurring revenue. When Applied Digital has all 4 gigawatts ready to go, it can support enough deals to make billions of dollars each year. The company may have only made $64 million in Q1 FY26, but revenue growth should compound quickly based on the CoreWeave leases and future deals. That development sets the stage for Applied Digital stock to continue its rally.\nShould you buy stock in Applied Digital right now?

      "Content": "What Is One of the Best Chip Stocks to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nDavid Moadel\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:26 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nBABAF\n\nBABA\n\nNVDA\n\nQuick Read Alibaba (BABA) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) MI308 AI accelerators.\nAMD stock looks compelling as Advanced Micro Devices recently demonstrated 35.6% year-over-year revenue growth and 61.2% income growth.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nOver the next decade, you'll surely want to own at least one artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock. You might assume that all you need is NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) stock and nothing else. However, even though NVIDIA is the market's darling, your best pick could actually be Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) stock.\nEven though it's a giant company, Advanced Micro Devices is an underdog in some respects. Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn't a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks.\nThis isn't to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we'll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential.\n\nIssues With AMD Stock One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn't pay a dividend. Consequently, you'll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit.\nMeanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices' valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x .\n\nIn addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock's price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices.\nThose are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here.\nBesides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don't have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let's perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices' financial health.\nBooming Sales, Zooming Profits Advanced Micro Devices' high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you'll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don't own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years.\n\nStory Continues\nAll in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company's results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025.\nImpressively, Advanced Micro Devices' net revenue grew 35.6% year over year, from $6.819 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $9.246 billion. Nearly half of that revenue stemmed from Advanced Micro Devices' Data Center segment; this suggests that the company continues to benefit from AI-associated sales.\n\nTurning to the bottom-line results, Advanced Micro Devices' net income surged 61.2%, from $771 in the year-earlier quarter to $1.243 billion. Also during that time frame, the company's cash and cash equivalents increased 27%, from $3.787 billion to $4.808 billion. So evidently, Advanced Micro Devices remains a cash-rich chipmaker that's on a powerful growth trajectory.\nMaking Headway in China While U.S. chip sales are crucial to Advanced Micro Devices' business model, it definitely appears that the company is making headway in China's chip market. To be more specific, Alibaba ( NASDAQ:BABA ) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices' MI308 AI accelerators.\n\nThis is important because investors need to think globally, not just locally, over the next 10 years. China is a major chip market, and Advanced Micro Devices has a long-term growth opportunity there.\nAdvanced Micro Devices made a savvy move in designing its MI308 chips to be compatible with export restrictions. Furthermore, the company has secured export licenses for these chips and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. on approved sales in China.\nAlso, it's a positive sign that Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently met with Chinese Commerce ​Minister Wang ‌Wentao in Beijing. They \"exchanged views on the company's business ⁠development in ​China and ​strengthening cooperation with China,\" according to the ‍ministry.\n\nSure, NVIDIA is also making headway into China's chip market. At the same time, however, NVDA stock may have already priced in the company's progress in this region.\nIn contrast, Advanced Micro Devices' growth story in China is still developing and the market needs time to recognize this. Give it a few years, and you should see AMD stock reflect strong chip sales in both the U.S. and China.\nGive AMD Stock a Chance In the final analysis, there's no need to overload your portfolio with AMD stock. Just holding a moderately sized share position for 10 years will, most likely, put you in a profitable position without undue risk.\nWhile Advanced Micro Devices doesn't pay a dividend and appears overvalued at first glance, I still encourage you to give the company a chance. If AI chip sales remain strong and Advanced Micro Devices keeps on growing its sales and profits, there's an attractive reward-to-risk profile here for buy-and-hold investors.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

The narrative leans on powerful margins and a premium future earnings multiple. Curious how those moving parts combine into one bold valuation call? The full breakdown reveals the exact assumptions driving that fair value line.\n\nResult: Fair Value of $235 (UNDERVALUED)\nHave a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.\nHowever, slower AI spending or tougher export rules could compress margins and delay growth and may challenge the idea that today’s price still offers clear upside.\nFind out about the key risks to this NVIDIA narrative.\nAnother Lens on Value While the narrative sees NVDA as 21.8% undervalued, our price to earnings work paints a more cautious picture. The current 45x P/E is richer than the US semiconductor sector at 36.7x, though still below peers at 60.3x and a fair ratio of 58.3x. This leaves room for both upside and de rating risk if sentiment turns.\nSee what the numbers say about this price — find out in our valuation breakdown.\nBuild Your Own NVIDIA Narrative If you see the numbers differently or want to dig into the details yourself, you can shape a full Nvidia story in just minutes with Do it your way .\n\nStory Continues\nA great starting point for your NVIDIA research is our analysis highlighting 2 key rewards and 2 important warning signs that could impact your investment decision.\nLooking for more investment ideas?

Nowadays, many investors find themselves having that thought about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- me included. And when you look at its performance over the past decade, it's very easy to see why.\nIn the past 10 years, Nvidia's stock is up an eye-popping 22,420%, meaning a $1,000 investment made a decade ago would be worth over $225,000. Talk about a return on investment.\nNvidia has been on the stock market since January 1999, but the bulk of its gains since then have come in the past few years, thanks to the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. For a while, Nvidia's main business was supplying graphics cards for video games. However, the company realized that the same technology was useful for processing massive amounts of data, and it's now arguably the most important supplier of computing power.\n\nIf you're interested in investing in Nvidia, it's not too late. However, I wouldn't expect its gains over the next decade to compare with those from this past decade. It still has long-term market-beating potential, but expecting the gains to replicate is asking a lot.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Will Google Pass Nvidia in 2026 as the World’s Biggest Company?\n\nOmor Ibne Ehsan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 10:25 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nQuick Read Google (GOOG) now leads AI software after overtaking Microsoft. Google is less than $200B away from surpassing Apple as the world’s second-largest company.\nGoogle holds four of the top 10 AI models on LLMArena. OpenAI’s best model ranks eighth.\nMeta is negotiating billions in purchases of Google’s TPUs. Anthropic already bought 1 million TPUs from Google instead of buying from Nvidia (NVDA).\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) as the world's second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street.\nThere are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI \"replacing\" the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals.\n\nLet's take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026.\nGoogle is firing on all cylinders Google was supposed to \"die\" after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can.\nThen, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI \"Bard\" rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in \"code red\" mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards.\n\nIf you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI's sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each.\nIf you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI's GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn't spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) have gone into net debt.\nWhy Google's search business will never be replaced If Google's rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated.\nAs for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with.\n\nIn contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it.\nNvidia's AI GPUs at risk? Software isn't Alphabet's only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia's near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient.\nMeta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth \"billions of dollars,\" with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia's coffers instead.\n\nThe threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google's AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating.\nCould Google become the biggest company in 2026? I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world's largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030.\n\nNvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?
