The business sells the high-end parallel processing chips that tech companies need to power artificial intelligence (AI) models. It's a legitimate pick-and-shovel investment play .\nThe stock has been a big winner, and not just since the AI trend took off. If you'd invested $100 in Nvidia 10 years ago and held on through the ups and downs that followed, here's how much your investment would be worth today.\nNvidia shares have gone parabolic In the past decade, Nvidia shares have produced a monster total return of 22,980% (as of Dec. 19), which would have turned a $100 investment into a holding worth more than $23,000. The company does pay a small dividend, currently just $0.01 per share quarterly, that has had a tiny effect on investor gains.\n\nNvidia has crushed the S&P 500 . The market's large-cap barometer had a 10-year total return of 305% -- not even remotely close to Nvidia's returns.\nThe chipmaker's shares have been lifted by its robust fundamentals. Revenue and net income skyrocketed by 4,285% and 12,867%, respectively, between its fiscal Q3 2016 and its fiscal Q3 2026 (which ended Oct. 26). Nvidia is now the world's most valuable company, sporting a market cap of $4.4 trillion.\nSome investors fear that we're in an AI bubble. Should spending on AI infrastructure slow down, it could have a negative effect on Nvidia's impressive growth trajectory.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $504,994 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,156,218 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 986 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Trading volume only reached 136.8 million shares, coming in about 27% below versus its three-month average of 188.5 million shares.\n\nFriday's action centered on Nvidia's $20 billion Groq licensing deal and analyst commentary framing it as a strategic AI and data center win that investors are watching for implications on future chip demand.\n\nHow the markets moved today The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.02% to 6,931, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) eased 0.09% to 23,593. In Semiconductors, industry peers Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 0.02% and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) edged up 0.11%, as traders weighed Nvidia-driven AI server momentum.\n\nWhat this means for investors Nvidia acquired assets from chip start-up Groq for about $20 billion. Groq was founded in 2016 by the developers of Alphabet 's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tensor processing unit (TPU), which competes with Nvidia in the field of artificial intelligence workloads.\nThe deal also brought Groq executives, including its CEO, under Nvidia's umbrella. Investors see the move as a way to integrate Groq's AI inference technology, expanding Nvidia's leadership in the sector.\n\nToday's move higher extended Nvidia's recent winning streak with the stock up over 11% in just the past six days.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Still, all three indexes logged gains for the holiday-shortened week. Just three trading days remain in a turbulent year in which tariff jitters, simmering geopolitical tensions, and the rapid growth of AI-related momentum stocks took investors on a bumpy ride. But it was a year that put the three major indexes, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq, on track to register double-digit percentage gains. Stocks on the move on Friday included Nvidia, which gained 1% after the AI chipmaker agreed to license chip technology from startup Groq and hire its CEO. Shares of Target rose more than 3% after the Financial Times reported the retailer is facing activism from hedge fund Toms Capital Investment Management, which has made a significant investment in the company. And U.S.-listed shares of precious metal miners such as First Majestic, Coeur Mining and Endeavour Silver advanced as silver and gold prices touched fresh record highs.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Gains in materials names such as Freeport‑McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) and Southern Copper (NYSE:SCCO) versus an almost 6% loss from Standard Lithium (NYSEMKT:SLI) reflected sharp divergences tied to the powerful precious‑metals rally.\n\nWhat this means for investors While today's final performance was muted, the S&P 500 set a new record in intraday trading as investors returned from the Christmas break. The index is up 2.3% for the week, and there's debate about whether we're about to see a final end-of-year rally or the start of a consolidation phase.\n\nNvidia continued to dominate the news today with more AI-driven gains. 2026 is already being framed as the year of AI, even as commentators warn that it will only take a small negative shock to disrupt momentum.\nGold and silver prices set new highs with spot gold nearing $4,550 an ounce and spot silver passing $77 an ounce.

      "Content": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: ASML vs. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points ASML's equipment is essential to producing the world's most advanced semiconductors.\nTSMC has effectively leveraged ASML's equipment to produce the world's most advanced chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) are arguably the two most essential artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the hardware space. TSMC is well known for being the foundry of choice for Nvidia , Apple , and other top semiconductor companies.\n\nHowever, TSMC's success is not possible without ASML. It uses the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines built by ASML to manufacture the world's most advanced chips.\nThis creates a harder job for investors trying to discern which stock is more likely to make the highest long-term gains. Although both companies are critical to this process, investors need to take a closer look to see which is the more suitable stock for them to own.\nThe case for ASML Investors should remember one thing about ASML. Despite ASML's importance, only a tiny client base is interested in its EUV machines, which can cost as much as $400 million each. Worse, political concerns bar what equipment it can sell to countries like China, further adding to that limitation.\nNonetheless, companies such as Samsung and Intel are among the companies buying EUV machines. Additionally, ASML operates in the deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) market. Although the market has more competitors, it also allows it to earn business from foundry companies that produce other types of chips.\n\nFurthermore, such costly equipment needs periodic maintenance. With that, the Netherlands-based company runs a thriving maintenance business that accounts for more than one-third of ASML's revenue.\nAmid the growth in AI, its machines are more in demand, so much so that ASML earned almost 23 billion euros ($27 billion) in revenue in the first nine months of 2025, a yearly increase of 21%.\nAlso, ASML limited expense growth, leading to a net income of 6.8 billion euros ($7.9 billion), a 39% rise from year-ago levels. With the rising profits, the stock is up by almost 50% over the last year.\nInvestors should also note the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. While that is above the S&P 500\naverage of 31, it closely approximates the company's average over the last five years. Considering the demand in AI, such a valuation is unlikely to deter investors from bidding the stock price higher over time.\n\nWhy investors might consider TSMC However, with a larger client base, investors might find TSMC stock more appealing. They might also like its dominance.\n\nStory Continues\nAs mentioned, TSMC makes the world's most advanced chips. While companies like Samsung and Intel have attempted to compete, TSMC's dominant market share continues to grow. As of the second quarter of 2025, that market share reached 70%, giving the company a tremendous competitive advantage.\nThis arguably makes TSMC's biggest threat operating in Taiwan, an island that has dealt with periodic threats of an invasion by China. Since Chinese companies also depend on its chips, the threat could be overblown. Still, it was concerning enough that Warren Buffett reversed a decision by his lieutenants to invest Berkshire Hathaway 's capital in the company.\n\nThat threat has not stopped TSMC's growth. The $87 billion in revenue TSMC earned in the first nine months of 2025 rose 36% compared to the same period last year.\nAlso, like with ASML, expenses grew more slowly than revenue. Still, with other comprehensive losses weighing on the bottom line, its comprehensive income of $35 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 increased by 30% year over year. If not including those losses, net income would have grown by 52%.\nAmid the rising demand and income, TSMC stock is up by almost 50% over the last year. Also, with a 30 P/E ratio, it is cheaper than ASML and trades at a valuation that closely matches the S&P 500 average.\nStill, TSMC has tended to trade at a discount, and for that reason, it is above its average earnings multiple of 25 over the last five years. That makes it unclear whether TSMC is a better bargain, or whether investors feel the geopolitical concerns justify the discounted multiples of the past.\n\nASML or TSMC? Considering these similarities, investors will likely win by choosing either or both stocks. However, choosing between the two probably comes down to risk tolerances.\nTSMC offers similar revenue and stock price growth at a lower valuation. Hence, if one is comfortable with the geopolitical risk, it might make sense to lean more toward TSMC.\n\nConversely, if one feels as Buffett does about the geopolitical concerns, ASML is probably the more suitable choice, as most of its manufacturing takes place far away from geopolitical hotbeds.\nUltimately, investors have the choice between two critical AI hardware stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market. Thus, this is one case where they should assess their risk tolerances and act accordingly.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

Stock is up nearly 3% on that news even as Target remains down about 25% over the past year, following a tough stretch marked by weaker sales and lost market share. Target says it remains focused on getting back to growth while details of the activist stake have not yet been disclosed.\n00:36 Speaker A\nOil moving lower as investors react to progress in Ukraine peace talks, prospect of a deal could allow more Russian crude back onto the global market, adding to supply concerns. Crude oil prices are hovering around $57 a barrel with Brent near 60. Traders continuing to weigh geopolitics against expectations of a global oil glut in 2026.\n01:13 Speaker A\nAnd shares of Nvidia rising after announcing its largest deal ever, agreeing to buy assets from AI chip startup Groq for a reported $20 billion. The move deepens Nvidia's push into AI inferencing as it looks to extend its dominance beyond chips. Groq, founded by former Google TPU engineers, was valued at just under $7 billion in a recent funding round. Nvidia says it's licensing Groq's technology and bringing key talent on board, not acquiring the company outright, as competition in AI hardware continues to intensify.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Leading AI Stocks Investors Can Buy for 2026 (NVDA, AVGO, VRT)\n\nEthan Feller\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 10:58 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: VRT\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nThe market, and many leading AI stocks, are at an inflection point. In the near term, further volatility or even a pullback is possible. However, the longer-term opportunity remains compelling, with upside potential that extends well into 2026 and beyond.\nAI capital spending is projected to reach an estimated $571 billion in 2026, and Nvidia ( NVDA ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Vertiv ( VRT ) sit at the center of this historic infrastructure buildout. These companies are among the most critical enablers of the AI expansion.\n\nAfter running multiple screens focused on growth, valuation, and margin strength, these three names consistently rose to the top. Collectively, they represent exceptional businesses with durable competitive advantages and strong earnings power.\nDespite their leadership positions, these stocks are not stretched on valuation and in recent weeks have experienced earnings upgrades, giving two of them top Zacks Ranks.\nRecent months have been choppy in these stocks, with prices moving sideways to lower, leaving shares near technically important levels. Whether those levels hold or break in the short term is uncertain, but the risk-reward profile remains attractive at current prices regardless.\nEven if further downside materializes and bearish narratives resurface, any weakness is unlikely to persist given the scale and durability of AI-driven demand. If support holds, these stocks may already be positioning for their next leg higher.\nBelow, I will break down the recent developments, fundamental strength of these businesses and highlight a tactical trading plan using the technical charts.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia Stocks Breaks Out on Bullish Developments Nvidia continues to anchor the AI boom as the critical infrastructure provider through its leadership in GPU technology. While 2025 was comparatively subdued for the now roughly $4.5 trillion semiconductor giant, with shares delivering a tidy 42% return, the company has remained firmly on offense.\nOver the past week, Nvidia advanced its largest acquisition to date, agreeing to acquire assets from AI chip startup Groq in a deal valued at approximately $20 billion. Groq, founded by former Google TPU architects, develops high-performance inference-focused silicon that competes in certain AI workloads. While Groq described the transaction as a “non-exclusive licensing agreement,” the deal includes the integration of Groq’s CEO and senior leadership into Nvidia, signaling deeper strategic alignment.\nFrom a competitive standpoint, the acquisition strengthens Nvidia’s already formidable moat at the leading edge of AI semiconductors.\n\nStory Continues\nFundamentals also continue to move in the right direction. Analysts have resumed raising earnings estimates, earning Nvidia a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) . Consensus forecasts for next year’s earnings have climbed nearly 16% over the past two months, and longer-term projections call for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years. At roughly 40.6x forward earnings, the valuation remains reasonable given Nvidia’s growth profile and its central role in the most powerful technology cycle in more than a decade.\n\nThe technical picture has also improved meaningfully. After months of choppy, volatile trading marked by sharp rallies and pullbacks, NVDA has made a decisive bullish turn. During the low-volume holiday period, the stock broke out from a clear descending bullish wedge, marking its most constructive advance in several months. As long as shares hold above the breakout level, the setup points to further upside as 2026 begins.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nBroadcom Shares Consolidate at Key Price Level Broadcom has been a core beneficiary of the AI boom since the trend began, but its importance has become even more apparent in recent months. After being viewed as a relative laggard for several years, Alphabet ( GOOGL ) has reasserted itself as a leader in AI and large language models. A major driver of that shift has been renewed appreciation for Alphabet’s proprietary hardware stack, most notably its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which Google has deployed internally for nearly a decade.\n\nBroadcom plays a critical role in that ecosystem. While TPUs are branded as Google-designed chips, Broadcom provides the underlying expertise in ASIC design, networking, and high-speed I/O, effectively enabling Google to scale these systems reliably at hyperscale. As Alphabet rapidly expands AI infrastructure across Search, cloud services, and generative AI models, custom silicon becomes economically unavoidable. Broadcom sits squarely at the center of that transition, helping design chips optimized for inference, training, and internal workloads, areas where generic GPUs are often less cost-efficient. As Alphabet’s AI leadership has become clearer, Broadcom’s strategic importance has risen alongside it.\nFrom a fundamentals perspective, Broadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) , reflecting a pause in earnings revisions rather than any deterioration in outlook. Consensus estimates still call for 35.7% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, and the stock trades at roughly 36x one-year forward earnings. Given that growth profile and Broadcom’s deep entrenchment in the AI infrastructure stack, valuation remains reasonable relative to peers.\n\nTechnically, Broadcom had been outperforming much of the AI complex in recent months as investors increasingly recognized its role within the Alphabet AI ecosystem. The sharp selloff following its most recent earnings report was less about weakening fundamentals and more about positioning and nuanced guidance, a classic “sell-the-news” event after a strong run. Importantly, shares found support at a level that has held up the stock since late summer. As long as that support holds, the consolidation looks constructive, and the near-term technical outlook remains encouraging.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nVertiv Stock Sits Within Trading Range Vertiv remains one of the purest plays on the physical backbone of the AI buildout, supplying critical power, cooling, and thermal-management solutions to hyperscale and enterprise data centers. Recent developments continue to reinforce that positioning. Over the past several months, Vertiv has announced expanded partnerships with large data center operators and hyperscalers, while management has highlighted strong backlog growth and improving visibility tied directly to AI-driven capacity expansion. Demand for high-density cooling solutions continues to exceed expectations as next-generation AI workloads push power and thermal limits higher.\n\nFundamentally, the story remains compelling. Vertiv currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as earnings estimates continue to trend higher. Consensus forecasts call for 30.2% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, reflecting operating leverage, improving margins, and sustained AI-related demand. While the stock trades at a 40.6x forward earnings multiple, that valuation appears justified given Vertiv’s growth rate, expanding addressable market, and increasingly important role in AI infrastructure.\nThe technical setup adds another layer of appeal. After a sharp advance earlier in the cycle, VRT has spent recent months consolidating within a well-defined trading range. Importantly, the stock recently bounced cleanly off support within its rising channel. The key level to watch on the upside is the ~$180 area, which marks the top of the current range. A decisive breakout above that level would likely signal the next leg higher, while continued support near the lower end of the channel keeps the risk-reward profile attractive.\n\nTaken together, Vertiv offers a differentiated way to participate in the AI boom—not through chips or software, but through the indispensable infrastructure that makes large-scale AI deployment possible. With fundamentals strengthening and the technical picture improving, VRT remains well positioned as investors look ahead to 2026.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nShould Investors Buy Shares in VRT, NVDA and AVGO? Taken together, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Vertiv offer complementary exposure to the core layers of the AI buildout—compute, custom silicon and networking, and physical infrastructure. While near-term volatility is always possible, fundamentals, earnings momentum, and long-term demand visibility remain firmly intact. With each stock positioned at a critical point in the AI value chain and trading near technically important levels, the current setup favors accumulation opportunistically as the AI investment cycle extends into 2026 and beyond.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Nvidia's Groq deal underscores how the AI chip giant uses its massive balance sheet to 'maintain dominance'\n\nLaura Bratton\nUpdated Fri, December 26, 2025 at 10:33 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nMU\n\nXAAI.PVT\n\nNvidia’s ( NVDA ) licensing deal with chip startup Groq ( GROQ.PVT ) shows how the tech giant is leveraging its massive cash pile to sustain its preeminence in the AI market.\nNvidia this week said it struck a non-exclusive deal with Groq to license its technology and hired the startup’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, its president, and other employees. CNBC reported the agreement to be worth $20 billion , marking Nvidia’s largest-ever deal. (The company declined a request for comment on the figure.)\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note to clients Thursday that the Nvidia-Groq deal “appears strategic in nature for NVDA as they leverage their increasingly powerful balance sheet to maintain dominance in key areas.” Nvidia’s cash inflow climbed more than 30% from the previous year to $22 billion in its most recent quarter.\n\"This transaction is ... essentially an acquisition of Groq without being labeled one (to avoid the regulators' scrutiny),\" added Hedgeye Risk Management analysts in a note Friday.\n\nThe move is just the latest in a string of AI deals by Nvidia, the world’s first $5 trillion company . The chipmaker’s investments in AI firms span the entire market, ranging from large language model developers such as OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) and xAI ( XAAI.PVT ) to “neoclouds” like Lambda ( LAMD.PVT ) and CoreWeave ( CRWV ), which specialize in AI services and compete with its Big Tech customers.\n\nNvidia has also invested in chipmakers Intel ( INTC ) and Enfabrica. The company made a failed attempt around 2020 to acquire British chip architecture designer Arm ( ARM ).\nNvidia’s wide-ranging investments — many of them in its own customers — have led to accusations that it’s involved in circular financing schemes reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. The company has vehemently denied those claims.\nGroq, meanwhile, was looking to become one of Nvidia’s rivals.\nFounded in 2016, Groq makes LPUs (language processing units) geared toward AI inferencing and marketed as alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units).\nTraining AI models involves teaching a model to learn patterns from large amounts of data, while \"inferencing\" refers to using that trained model to generate outputs. Both processes demand massive computing power from AI chips.\n\nWhile Nvidia easily dominates the chip market for AI training, some analysts argue that Nvidia could soon see greater competition in the inference space. That’s because custom chips like Google's ( GOOG ) TPUs (tensor processing units) — and arguably Groq’s chips called LPUs (language processing units) — may be better suited for certain tasks. LPUs, for instance, are faster and more energy efficient when used for certain models, utilizing a type of memory technology called SRAM within the chips. On the other hand, Nvidia GPUs rely on off-chip HBM made by companies like Micron ( MU ) and Samsung ( 005930.KS ).\n\nStory Continues\nRoss, the Groq CEO, said in a recent interview that the upstart aimed to provide chips for half the world’s AI inference computing needs — and cheaply.\n“What we want to do is we want to drive the cost of compute as close to zero as we can get it. Every year we want to make it cheaper,” he told Indian business outlet YourStory . Notably, Ross already helped create Nvidia’s greatest source of competition: The executive led the development of Google’s first-generation TPUs.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst CJ Muse said Nvidia’s \"acqui-hire\" of Groq talent and licensing of its intellectual property showed the chipmaker “is playing both offense and defense” in the AI space. Muse said the deal would allow Nvidia to take “even greater share of the inference market.”\nNvidia shares rose more than 1% Friday.\nOthers on Wall Street were more confused by Nvidia’s move and its potential $20 billion price tag. Hedgeye Risk Management analysts argued that Groq's chips are \"still unproven\" when it comes to large AI models, due to their low memory capacity.\n\"Groq's current technology is greatly limited to only a small subset of inference workloads,\" added DA Davidson analyst Alex Platt.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nVance Cariaga\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 9:39 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 in Tesla’s (TSLA) stock four years ago, it would be worth about $13,700 today, thanks to a 37% price gain since late December 2021.\nThat’s a solid profit, but it falls well short of the massive returns you’d have gotten with other high-profile stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) or Alphabet (GOOG). The next four years could be a lot more lucrative for Tesla investors — or a lot worse.\n\nWhat could a $10,000 Tesla investment today look like by 2030? Here’s what a couple of experts had to say.\nAlso see the Tesla investing mistake that could cost you thousands .\nThe Bull Case A $10,000 investment in Tesla today could be worth twice that much by 2030 if the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle (EV) maker reaches certain benchmarks, according to Chad Cummings, an attorney and certified public accountant (CPA) at Cummings & Cummings Law who previously worked in finance and tax.\n\nBut for that to happen, a lot of things would have to go the right way.\n“If Tesla scales its energy storage segment and increases paid software penetration above current rates, [its] position could exceed $20,000,” Cummings told GOBankingRates. “The S&P 500 at an 8% compound rate places the same $10,000 near $15,900, which is the realistic hurdle Tesla must beat. Even so, there are some major headwinds.”\nThose headwinds include “litigation and regulatory exposure” that could drive Tesla’s downside more than macro trends, according to Cummings.\n“A single autonomous-related fatality that triggers a regulatory halt can cut Tesla’s valuation by tens of billions within days,” he said. “The insurance and legal systems still have yet to fully price in autonomous driving and the results, which creates something of a hot potato.”\n\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster\nLooking Beyond the EV Market Another thing to keep an eye on is how Tesla’s non-EV businesses perform over the next few years — mainly its energy generation/storage and other services. These businesses are considered by many to be the stock’s main growth drivers.\n“A $10,000 investment in Tesla right now depends less on the EV side than people think,” said Edward Corona, founder of The Options Oracle AI Trade Manager . “I honestly don’t believe Tesla’s main focus is cars anymore — but they still need the car business to keep the money flowing while they build everything else. And Elon has about one trillion reasons now to make sure the long-term plan pays off.”\nThe “one trillion reasons” comment refers to Musk’s new compensation package , which could be worth about $1 trillion if certain milestones are met.\n\nStory Continues\nBy 2030, a $10,000 investment will “come down to whether Tesla can use the EV side to fund the bigger vision without letting margins fall apart,” Corona told GOBankingRates. “If they balance that right, the stock could look a lot different in a few years. If they don’t, investors will feel it. Tesla’s future isn’t about selling cars — it’s about whether the rest of the plan actually gets executed.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : What a $10K Investment in Tesla Could Look Like by 2030\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia’s AI Cash Machine: The 1 Metric Proving Its Dominance Isn’t Going Anywhere\n\nRich Duprey\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:39 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nQuick Read Nvidia ( NVDA ) reached a $4.6T market capitalization driven by dominance in AI chips.\nConcerns have grown that Nvidia will lose its top dog position as competition grows.\nBut there is one number that shows the fears may be overblown.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) has become the face of the AI revolution. Its graphics processing units have powered the breakthrough advances in generative AI, enabling applications from chatbots to image generation and beyond. As a result, the company has experienced enormous growth, reaching a market capitalization of $4.6 trillion.\nAnalysts and investors remain focused on growing competition in the AI chip market, where Nvidia faces pressure to continue advancing new, more powerful chips to stay ahead. The belief is that it must innovate rapidly with architectures like Blackwell and Rubin to maintain its lead, or risk ceding the field to the competition.\nYet one key number has emerged that underscores why Nvidia remains the undisputed king of AI -- and is likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future.\n\nGrowing Competition in AI Accelerators Despite Nvidia's dominance, concerns persist about potential market share losses. Competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ), and Marvell Technology ( NASDAQ:MRVL ) are gaining traction in AI chips. Major cloud providers and tech giants, including Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) with its Trainium chips and Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) with Tensor Processing Units, are developing custom accelerators to reduce or replace their reliance on Nvidia's products.\n\nThese in-house efforts aim to lower costs and optimize specific workloads, particularly inference. Analysts project that custom silicon from hyperscalers could account for a larger portion of the AI accelerator market in coming years. Big Tech companies continue heavy investments in their own chips, partnering with designers like Broadcom to challenge Nvidia's position.\nThe Power of Nvidia's Installed Base It is true that Nvidia can't rest on its laurels amid this intense competition. It must sustain rapid innovation cycles and expand its software ecosystem, including CUDA, to keep developers tied to its platform as the data center buildout continues. However, the company's existing strengths provide a real and durable substantial moat.\n\nUsing data from company reports and UBS estimates, analysts at Creative Strategies compared Nvidia's data center compute revenue from all of its GPU generations -- Ampere, Hopper, Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and beyond -- and compared them to peers including AMD, Broadcom, and Marvell. The results are staggering: Hopper revenue alone exceeds the combined compute revenue of all its rivals combined .\n\nStory Continues\nFrom the beginning in early 2023 when the AI revolution really sprung into the public consciousness until today, Hopper GPUs remain a dominant force for growth. Even as Blackwell and Rubin ramp up, Hopper's ongoing sales -- driven by the massive installed base for training, inference, and other workloads -- outpace competitors' collective offerings.\n\nWhile the Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs now surpass Hopper and will accelerate their growth in the quarters to come, Hopper's sustained cash flows provide a revenue foundation for Nvidia's aggressive R&D for future architectures. This has funded the development and production of Blackwell and Rubin, allowing an annual release cadence that competitors struggle to match. The prior-generation chips reinforce Nvidia's dominance while enabling advances that widen the performance gap.\nKey Takeaway This single metric of Hopper revenue surpassing all peers combined illustrates Nvidia's structural lead in AI. The installed base generates enormous ongoing revenue, supporting innovation and locking in customers to its ecosystem, which deters share erosion.\nWhile competition intensifies, Nvidia's position remains as strong as ever. Investors can confidently view any significant price weakness as a buying opportunity for Nvidia stock. Given the chipmaker's history of leadership in powering the AI revolution, and no clear threat to its dominance, investors can be assured Nvidia's leadership atop AI will remain well into the future.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Nvidia makes boldest move yet, and the fallout begins\n\nFaizan Farooque\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nNvidia recently struck a $20 billion deal to acquire the brains of a fierce rival, marking its biggest move to date in the AI arms race. However, the massive chip manufacturer may soon have to respond to more difficult inquiries about the future of its chips.\nCEO Jensen Huang offered further detail in an internal email obtained by CNBC .\n\nThe move comes as Nvidia is getting more attention in Asia. Megaspeed International, a fast-growing Singapore-based importer of Nvidia chips, is being looked into for possibly smuggling banned H100 and H200 chips into China, according to a recent Bloomberg report .\nThe world's most valuable chipmaker is now stuck between two extremes: It has to deal with rising geopolitical threats and regulatory difficulties in one of its hottest regions while still dominating AI infrastructure around the world.\nNvidia buys brainpower, not branding, in record-breaking Groq deal Groq, a nine-year-old firm started by former Google TPU engineers, was never for sale — at least not in public. But Nvidia came in with a $20 billion deal that includes licensing Groq's cutting-edge AI inference technology and bringing on its top leaders, such as CEO Jonathan Ross.\nSources informed CNBC that Nvidia is really buying all of Groq's assets, except for a small GroqCloud firm, even though Groq called the purchase a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"\n\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nThis is Nvidia's biggest deal ever in terms of money. The price of $20 billion is over three times what Groq was worth in its most recent investment round, which was $6.9 billion.\nIt also beats Nvidia's previous record, the $7 billion purchase of Mellanox in 2019, by a wide margin.\nKey takeaways on Nvidia-Groq deal: Nvidia now controls Groq’s high-speed inference chip designs, allowing tighter integration into its broader AI platform.\nGroq’s leadership, including Ross and president Sunny Madra, will join Nvidia’s leadership team.\nThe remaining GroqCloud unit will continue operating independently, led by its CFO.\nThis aggressive move is like Nvidia's smaller but similar AI acquisition in September, when it spent $900 million for chip IP and key staff from Enfabrica.\n\nU.S. authorities zero in on Nvidia's Southeast Asian partner As Nvidia continues to lead in AI, it is being caught up in the sticky politics of the semiconductor supply chain .\nMegaspeed International, which used to be a small part of a Chinese gaming company, is now Nvidia's biggest customer in Southeast Asia. But U.S. investigators are now looking into the company because it may have smuggled prohibited AI chips into China.\n\nStory Continues\nRelated: Oracle just made a power move Wall Street can’t ignore\nThe dispute is over the difference between the number of chips Nvidia claimed to have for Megaspeed and what was found during inspections. This might put Nvidia in the sights of regulators who are already making it harder to export goods.\n\nThe H100 and H200 chips at the center of this drama are subject to U.S. trade restrictions aimed at curbing China’s AI ambitions.\nSingapore is becoming a popular place for AI startups, but U.S. officials are still worried that they might be diverted to other countries through regional partners.\nNvidia has repeatedly insisted it complies with all export laws, but the Megaspeed case could test that stance.\nThere is no proof of wrongdoing, but the optics are bad. Nvidia now has to convince both investors and authorities that its record-breaking expansion isn't causing problems with AI compliance.\nThe financial stakes are rising Some analysts, such as Loop Capital, say that Nvidia's value might reach $6 trillion in a year, after it just exceeded the $4 trillion mark, Bloomberg reports . Its AI chips power everything from Google's data centers to OpenAI's models. But as Nvidia's profile grows, so does the scrutiny from regulators.\n\nNvidia is solidifying its dominance over real-time workloads in the AI chip market with its Groq integration.\nThe corporation has full control over AI infrastructure, since it has a growing collection of chip IP, developer tools, and cloud services.\nBut probes like Megaspeed's could lead to stricter laws around the world or make it harder for companies to export.\nInvestors can clearly see that although Nvidia is outpacing its competitors in technology, its vulnerability to geopolitical events now poses a significant risk.\nAs 2026 nears, the world's top AI company may face more than just speed and size; it may also face scrutiny.\nRelated: Microsoft sends harsh message to millions of Microsoft 365 customers\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 26, 2025, where it first appeared in the Economy section.

Today, it’s up another $5 in premarket.\nNike is still showing big signs of life after plummeting on weak Chinese sales and guidance.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAfter finding strong support at $170, Nvidia ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) continues to ramp higher.\nLast trading at $190 in premarket, NVDA is up on news that it agreed to pay $20 billion to acquire assets from Groq, an AI startup. From here, given the strength of the AI boom, we’d like to see NVDA closer to $200 before the year is over.\nHelping, just days ago, Barclays upgraded NVDA to a buy on stronger AI spending.\n“We are OW as the company has long-term sustainable growth led by a large lead in GPUs for AI in DC, with further Edge opportunities (autos, robots, etc.) and a competitive moat around a large portion of the market,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC.\nEven better, Wedbush’s Dan Ives says NVDA could see $250 by the end of 2026. In fact, he argues that the market is still underestimating how critical NVDA is to AI.\n\n“The reality is there's one chip in the world, fueling the AI revolution, and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out, numbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15% to 20% at a minimum going into 2026. You put that together, I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a base case to end 2026,” said Ives, as quoted by Yahoo Finance.\nMicron Just the other day, Micron ( NASDAQ: MU ) knocked it out of the park with earnings and guidance. Today, it’s up another $5 in premarket.\nAs noted by CNBC, the stock is up after DigiTimes reported that, “citing industry sources, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are raising prices for their fifth-generation high-bandwidth memory 3E chips by nearly 20% for 2026 deliveries.”\n\nThis comes just days after Micron crushed earnings and guidance.\nAs we reported just days ago, Micron’s EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share. It also expects revenue to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter.\nNike Nike ( NYSE: NKE ) is still showing big signs of life after plummeting on weak Chinese sales and guidance.\n\nStory Continues\n“However, Apple’s Tim Cook sees value, having just bought $3 million worth of Nike stock at the bottom of trend. Cook, who has been on the NKE board since 2005, bought 50,000 shares at an average price of $58.97 a share. Robert Swan, another Nike director, bought about $500,000 of stock on Dec. 22 at an average price of $57.54,” we noted just last week.\n\nTechnically, after catching support at $56.99, Nike is just starting to pivot higher again. Last trading at $60, we’d like to see it refill its bearish gap at around $66 initially. Nike is also just starting to pivot from oversold reads on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

I'm Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sazi. Let's fire up three things you need to know on this day after Christmas trading session. First up, I remain on Santa Claus rally watch as the Grinch may not rip this from the mouths of the bulls. Stocks flirting with fresh records as the Santa rally period is now underway. A little news you can use here.The Sox have enjoyed a Santa Claus rally in nearly 80% of the last 50 years. The largest Santa Claus rally of the 21st century occurred from late 2008 to early 2009. During this period, the S&P 500 advanced 7.4% in a much needed rebound following the steep sell-off in October 2008. Plus, the year's red hot run up in precious metals has broken new ground today, no pun intended, actually it was.I wrote this. Gold is at another record. Silver is at a new record and up 40% in the past month. Quick fun fact here. Shares of top gold and silver miner Freeport McEbra are up a sizzling 28% in the last month. The stock has shot up 8% in the last five sessions alone. Hope that earnings report is good from them in a few weeks. And Nvidia has made its largest acquisition ever buying assets from 9-year-old AI chip startup Gronk.For roughly $20 billion Grok was just valued at $6.9 billion in the $750 million capital raise three months ago. Grok founder and CEO Jonathan Ross will join Nvidia as an employee, while Google Ross, while at Google Ross designed custom chips that the tech giant would go on to train its AI models on. Ross is no joke. Let's get a check on the markets here on the day after Christmas.And uh you can see it right there. Things are looking pretty meager out there, thin trading volumes, not much going on, but the markets are open for business.Alright, investing in AI has been a moneymaker in 2025, with big tech stocks like Nvidia and Alphabet helping to drive up the NASDAQ more than 20% this year. But there are growing concerns that AI stocks could be overvalued and headed for doom in 2026. I spoke to Wedbush tech analyst and tech bull Dan Ives about all this.Dan, good to see you. Don't know where to start, so I'm gonna start on Nvidia. Uh, I mentioned at the top, we're seeing, uh, the Bulls return to Nvidia, uh, not in a big way, but I would say in a nice way. What's the play there?\n2:17 spk_1\nLook, I think the reality is China's going to reopen, you know, for Nvidia, and I think that's something that wasn't necessarily factored in fully. I think investors are realizing it's a big change in the Beltway. And look, Saz, the reality is there's one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution, and, and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out, numbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15 to 20% at a minimum going in 2026.Put that together, I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a base case to end 2026.\n2:51 spk_0\nAnother case for Nvidia, Dan, is, is it this, and you can tell me if I'm wrong, you know, you and I have, have known each other for, for many, many years. It's OK. We have a debate here, um, that Nvidia has less exposure to OpenAI than its rival AMD because AMD might be partially owned by OpenAI in 10 years.\n3:10 spk_1\nLook, right now, the reality is, is that, you know, associated with open AI is a bad thing. Now I disagree with that. Just, I mean, you've talked about it, but no doubt from a trade perspective, Nvidia, you know, they're obviously like they're not wed to an open AI, and I think to some extent.You know, I think you've talked about it. When you look at the divergence of those related to OpenAI, you know, whether it's Oracle or Microsoft or whatever it may be, you know, those stocks are obviously under more pressure. But look, my view is, as we go into 2026, investors are underestimating the scale and scope of the.AI revolution for Nvidia, for OpenAI, for Oracle, which I think is table pounded here despite, you know, obviously a lot of the negative sentiment for Palantir and others, because look, only 3% of companies in the US have gone down the AI path, and for the first time in 30 years, the US is ahead of China when it comes to tech.\n4:06 spk_0\nDan, later on in the show, I'm gonna have uh Marianne Bartels on, uh, really excited to talk to her. She's making the case that tech might see, her words, not mine, a reset year next year, but then go off on a very strong bull run looking out over the next decade. If there is a reset in tech, let's just say the first quarter next year, what, what triggers that?\n4:25 spk_1\nYeah, look, and she, and she obviously always has great thoughts.I think my view is, look at the white knuckle moments, whether they're resets or whatever you may call it, like they create the opportunities. I mean, go back to, you know, we'll be at CES again, go back to a year ago, right? I mean, Jensen comes out, the black leather jacket, I think even maybe potentially diamond studs in the back or whatever.You know, talk about Quantum.\n4:48 spk_0\nI think that's your jacket, Dan. I think\n4:49 spk_1\nthat's your, I, I think that could be your jacket dollars, but, but, but we, we're getting off topic. But the point is, look, the reality is negative on Quantum. Remember the sentiment going to the deep seek moment in January. You're gonna have these moments, but my view is like you're in year 3 of an 8 to 10 year buildout of the AIrevolution.\n5:09 spk_0\nOutside of, uh, Nvidia. I love what some of the thoughts you've been putting on your X account, Dan, on, uh, Tesla.Now, I, I'm sure you saw the photos of Waymos getting stuck in San Francisco with the power outage, and my first thought was, uh, this is everything that could go wrong with the Tesla robotaxi.\n5:27 spk_1\nLook, my view is 2026 is going to be probably the most important year, I'd say maybe in its history for Musk and Tesla, because look, the autonomous chapter now comes to Tesla, 30 cities where we see robotaxis, you know, ultimately in the United States. Are there going to be issues? Are there going to be speed bumps? Could there be?Delays here and there, yeah, I mean, obviously you saw the blackout in terms of Waymo in San Francisco, but look, I think next 3 to 4 years, 20% of vehicles are going to be autonomous, and I think that ultimately is where it's heading. And that's why I think when it comes to physical AI plays, the best physical AI plays in the world are Nvidia and Tesla.\n6:10 spk_0\nHow much value, Dan, are you assigning to Tesla's robotics initiatives?\n6:16 spk_1\nA trillion is what conservatively we view. I mean, look, if you, if you own Tesla here, you're not owning it for what deliveries look like on Jan 2nd, right? I mean, you're owning it for autonomous robotaxis, and we talk about bulk case 3 trillion, base case 2 trillion. Now look, if I showed you a year ago where numbers were going to go for Tesla this year, you'd be like, oh, the stock's 200, 250 bucks.The reality is that investors are looking through deliveries and near term numbers to understand what the autonomous chapter is going to ultimately bring, because I could argue.Numbers could be up 4, 5x when you look out over the next 456 years. I think that's the way to, to view a name like Tesla.\n7:06 spk_0\nDan, uh, before, I want to get to pound here, but why I love you and many reasons why, uh, as you know, but one is you covered damn, you, you covered damn near everything. So if Tesla's going to dominate in robotaxis, what does that mean to a General Motors and a Ford who are not really playing in this industry at all?\n7:22 spk_1\nWell, first of all, to lump GM and Ford together, I disagree. I mean, I think, I think what Mary's done and Paul at GM has been Hall of Fame moment for them, right? And the stock, I think, speaks for that. They've been able to navigate supply chain issues, pull back on EVs, but I believe like GM is in a much better situation.And again, they're gonna kind of pick their spots. Ford obviously much more back against the wall, and we see that in terms of what far we're trying to navigate. Look, I think what it means for the GM and Ford's, they gotta pick their spots. They gotta figure out how they're gonna go down the autonomous chapter. Do they eventually partner at one point with Tesla? I don't think that that's out of the realm, given where we see the autonomous world heading.\n8:08 spk_0\nAnd Dan, making some good points here. General Motors shares up about 56% year to date. Ford about 35% year to date. They're just coming off a big, almost $20 billion charge uh to their EV business. Dan, so on Palantir, I know you're watching this name. Is this, is Palantir double next year? And if so, why?\n8:24 spk_1\nI think it's a $1 trillion mark cap next 2 to 3 years. I, I think investors are underestimating how disruptive Palantir is on the enterprise. We've justWe, they, they've, they've just started to tap into that market on the commercial business. So, now, is it's super expensive, of course. But if you look at the next 345 years, like I view it as like, it's gonna be the next Salesforce, the next Oracle, however you want to think about it in terms of, on the software side, and I think Carp's playing a different game. He's playing chess.You know, as a mastered wizard, and I think a lot of others are playing, uh, you know, checkers at the kids' table.\n9:02 spk_0\nI'm, I'm loving this comparison or this duel that erupted in the fall, Dan, between Mark Benioff and Alex Carp, kind of taking shots at, you know, the other out there in media and, and X, I believe. If, if Palantir is a winner, then is Salesforce a loser?\n9:17 spk_1\nLook, I don't think Salesforce is a loser because I believe Benioff's going to be able to turn this around. Agent 4 needs to be successful. They're probably going to have to do more acquisitions, but no doubt, like, look, Benioff, top of the mountain, the Hall of Fame, Mount Rushmore CEO. But for the first time in many, many years, like there's, I won't call it a code red, but like there's a threat to the business model, and I think they have to adjust. And that's why when you look at Palantir with no direct salespeople doing what they're doing.I think that it's a shot across the bow, not just at Salesforce, at ServiceNow with the traditionalsoftware.\n9:53 spk_0\nDan, hit me with a tech stock you hate.\n9:56 spk_1\nLook, Adobe is the one, I wouldn't say hate, but Adobe is the one that's probably under the most pressure, given you think about AI, what it's doing to their business model, what they need to prove, massive success story obviously over the decades. But I think when you think about AI as a threat to a business model, I think Adobe, like, look, they're going through like a turbulent little white knuckle period here.\n10:22 spk_0\nYeah, why do we need, we're not gonna be printing out PDFs anymore, right, Dan?\n10:26 spk_1\nLook, they gotta change, they, they're gonna have to adjust and change part of their business model. But I mean, look, it's no different than Salesforce, no different than Workday. I mean, these are companies like you either pivot.Or stay on the treadmill at 2.0 speed.\n10:42 spk_0\nLastly, Dan, lastly, uh, this may be the last time I see you this year, and if it is, you've been traveling around the world all year, meeting with investors, covering this tech AI revolution. What has surprised you? Is there one thing that has absolutely blown you away this year?\n10:58 spk_1\nLook, I think the thing that's maybe surprised me is just what I ultimately view as the enterprise adoption and how accelerated it's been. Go back to capbacks a year ago, right? Concerns about AI, big tech capbacks.And, and it's ultimately 50% higher than ultimately it was at the beginning of the year. I think that's ultimately the thing that it's that acceleration that surprised me the most. And maybe the other surprise, you know, obviously is, uh, you know, I was hoping for more from the Giants and Penn State, but what are you gonna do? I mean, we, we got another year nextyear.\n11:33 spk_0\nThere's not much you can do, Dan. You know, sometimes we're just at the whims of bad decisions by our sports teams. Uh, Dan Ives, happy holidays to you, my friend. You too. Thanks for making time, man. Appreciate you.Coming up on Morning Brief, I have a few hot trending tickers to shout out. I'll be right back.Welcome back to Morning Brief presented by Robinhood. Let's fire up some trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform. We're watching Nvidia Micron. First up, Nvidia, the chip giant is making its largest deal ever, acquiring the assets of AI chip startup Grok. Nvidia has reportedly paid $20 billion in cash.The companies are calling it a non-exclusive licensing agreement, plus Grok's founder and CEO Jonathan Ross and other executives will officially join Nvidia, where remains of Grok will operate as an independent company likely focused on the cloud business. Nvidia shares are rising ahead of the open.Next, Micron. The company is set to report at a new record as the memory chip maker extends its post earnings rally. In mid-December, Micron posted earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations. One analyst even called the report the best in chip history, outside of Nvidia's May 2023 results, which kicked off the AI stock rally.Finally, I'm watching airlines. Major winter weather bearing down on both sides of the country, set to disrupt holiday travel. Nearly 1000 flights have already been canceled Friday and hundreds just around New York City due to the threat of a major snowstorm. Between 5 to 9 inches of snow are expected, starting late Friday afternoon and into Saturday. Want to stay up to date on the weather? Of course you do. Download the awesome Yahoo Weather app. I use it around the clock. Love this app.All right, from lingering tariff questions and AI's impact on jobs to changing Fed leadership and another election cycle, the list of things that could rip the face off the bulls next year is longer than they think. The investing backdrop may feel perfect today, but that site, that great feeling isn't guaranteed for tomorrow. Jason Bonfield is a global advisory partner and managing director at Stewart Partners. Jason, good to see you here. Biggest concern you have on these markets going into next year?\n13:44 spk_2\nYeah, thanks for having me, Brian. The, the biggest concern I really have is just that, you know, there's going to be a lot of uncertainty. I mean, we have, you know, tariff questions and noise that's just going to be out there that's common in these markets, and, and we also have midterm elections. So I think there's, there's going to be a lot of aspects that come at investors as they go through 2026. And you know those are, that's the biggest thing that I'm thinking about is the noise, because we're going to have volatility because of these coming through, and it's really going to come down toYou know, are we doing the research before they happen, or are they just going to react to it when it happens? Of\n14:16 spk_0\ncourse, Jason, there's so much focus on what is happening with AI in this country, the infrastructure buildout, investors hanging on every single world, a word, a seal like Jensen Wong says in Nvidia. But do you think investors are forgetting that we will have a new Fed chair next year? And if that is in fact the case, can that, whoever that person may be, can they be as, I guess, dovish as the marketexpects?\n14:39 spk_2\nYeah, well, we're definitely going to get a new Fed chair in May, I think. I think that's pretty much locked in. And you know as far as you know the markets and AI, I see a lot of impacts there with what's going to go on withThe interpretation of, is it unemployment going up because of AI and what's happening in that space. And we also have, you know, the baby boomers retiring at a greater scale. So, are we actually going through a weaker economy and does that make the Fed make different decisions?You know, we're going to have to see, but I think AI is going to continue to play in. It's not fully adopted by everyone and not all companies at this point. I mean, Nvidias, as you talk about, are, are definitely at the forefront, but as far as companies translating down and do we see that unemployment, I think that's going to be the big pivoting point that we're all going to look at is, is how are they going to interpret that unemployment number.\n15:33 spk_0\nJason, how will you know when it's time to rotate out of some of these big cap tech plays?\n15:39 spk_2\nYeah. Well, it's an interesting question because you know some people might say the MG 7 or the LG 7 that may happen. But I think the ultimate process here is that the market is broadening out. So a lot of people should be actually reallocating now, maybe not today, on a few of the last trading days in the sessions here, butYou know, from a tax consequence standpoint, but I think you have an opportunity in the forward months coming forward here in 2026, whether it's January that you make a decision to kind of come out of those and reallocate. But I think, I think the point is that you should don't just let those run because that could be a problem as we go forward.\n16:20 spk_0\nWhere do you reallocate to?\n16:23 spk_2\nYeah, yeah, I mean, I, I haven't been a big proponent over the years of international. I think, you know, 1 out of every 10 years that they outperform and we get 7 out of 10 on the broader markets have outperformance. So I like to stay US. So you know my thought is that they've had a good run. They may continue it a little bit into 2026, but you know the dollar mayYou know, not strengthen, but not go down as much as it has, so that may take a little of the air out of those wings. So I'm thinking, you know, take a little out of international, look at the small caps, dollar cast average gym, but I wouldn't be opposed to keeping a little cash on the sidelines coming into the front part of the year and just, uh, hold my nose and buy some of the dips when they happen.\n17:02 spk_0\nI'm asking all guests this week, Jason, their one investing resolution for next year. I have about 12 of these things, uh, as I seek to improve what I do here at Yahoo Finance. What's on your plate?\n17:13 spk_2\nYeah, well, I, I just want to, as I mentioned earlier, is that I, I want to have all the information on what I see is going to be the big noise on these midterms. Uh, I, I see that as being a little bit of a volatile factor that people are going to position on, you know, whether you consider that this is a second term for, for the current administration or mid all midterms are bad years. I, I tend to be a little bit more bullish. So, you know, I, I'm hoping for that.\n17:38 spk_0\nAll right, Jason, thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Happy holidays. Uh, we'll be talking to you soon.\n17:42 spk_2\nThank you.\n17:43 spk_0\nAlright, as I was just saying on resolutions, you can always be better, a better family member, a better human being toward others, not in the family and friend circles, a healthier person, hit that gym, and of course a better investor. Anyone that tells you they have the investing game all figured out is, well, a dope. Like on a scale of 1 to 10, think 15 level dopiness. You can tell them that cold hard reality came from me.While it feels as if making money in the market is easy right now, if not for all of 2025, the market could turn on a dime and run you over. Think what would happen if Nvidia came out in a few months and had a key growth rate that slowed quarter over quarter. What if that was backed up with a surprise dose of cautiousness from Nvidia CEO Jensen Wong? Or what if the new Fed chair next year isn't as dovish.The market is currently pricing in that would severely damage the bull thesis on stocks. Whatever the case, markets do not go up in a straight line, and that should mean you try each and every day to improve at the craft of making money in markets. One way to do that is make some investing resolutions at year end and tape them to one of your 8 screens you have at your investing command post. I know you have those 8 screens. I know it.These are my 10 investing related resolutions for next year. Take less management gibberish on earnings calls as gospel, very important.Better understand the intricacies and motives behind executive compensation packages. Hold more weight toward gap financial results compared to non-gap financial results, which often backs out charges and makes earnings look too good. Assign better investing scores for companies clearly seeing profit boosts from new AI actions. Find the next 5 companies likely ripe for an activist investor attack. Go and see an AI data center being built. I need to see one of these being built. I cover these things.Every single day, I need to go see one. I need you to go out there to a construction site and see it. Better track capital expenditures at the 15 largest tech companies. Screen for the 10 cheapest members of the S&P 493, and you can do this on Yahoo Finance via our comparison tool. Become better at spotting the top 5 stock formations. Find one small cap company doing something amazing. Don't forget small cap stocks exist.That does it for Morning Brief presented by Robin Hood. I'll be back in just a moment on Opening bid.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "A Deal With Groq Is Lifting Nvidia's Stock as 2025 Approaches\n\nBill McColl\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:18 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nKey Takeaways Nvidia earlier this week announced a partnership agreement with inference chipmaker Groq.\nThe partnership will have Grog's founder and CEO Jonathan Ross and others from the company joining Nvidia, which is reportedly paying $20 billion for some Groq assets.\nThe trading year is almost over—but Nvidia still has some news to make.\n\nThe chip giant earlier this week struck a deal with inference chipmaker Groq, a non-exclusive licensing pact that according to the announcement leaves the latter company independent—but also has founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra and other members of the company joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) “to help advance and scale the licensed technology.”\nWhy This Matters for Investors Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, has been a powerful stock largely on the back of powerful growth in its business. This week's news of a deal that includes a licensing partnership, the acquisition of some key executives and, reportedly, a multibillion-dollar investment is another signal of optimism about its business.\n\nThe news helped lift Nvidia's shares on Friday, with the stock—up some 40% in 2025 so far—more than 1.5% higher in morning trading. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's trading here .)\nInvestors may be cheered in part by reports that Nvidia is also acquiring some of Groq's assets, with CNBC reporting a $20 billion price tag for them—it's considered Nvidia's biggest-ever acquisition—in an indication of sustained opportunity for dealmaking in the AI sector to close out the year. (Groq referred Investopedia to its statement and to Nvidia; Nvidia in an email said \"We haven’t acquired Groq.\")\nGroq CFO Simon Edwards is set to take over as CEO. The company in September said it raised $750 million at a valuation of $6.9 billion. \"Inference is defining this era of AI, and we’re building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost,\" Ross said at the time.\nWall Street analysts continue to see room for Nvidia's shares to keep rising. The mean price target as tracked by Visible Alpha is $254, well above recently prices around $191. The company remains the world's most-valuable, with a market capitalization above $4.6 billion.\nThis article has been updated since it was first published to reflect comments from Groq and Nvidia and to note recent market action.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia's huge Groq deal: What investors need to know\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST\n\nIn this video: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) reached a deal to license AI chip startup Groq's ( GROQ.PVT ) technology. Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferré discuss the deal and what it means for Nvidia investors and the broader AI space.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Brian\nKeith, I've been watching uh, really all day long, um, actually since yesterday, I should say, this Nvidia deal for Groq. And if you zoom out, I think it says so much about the mindset of companies and how the AI bubble, it may only be just beginning, uh despite all this AI bubble talk.\n00:26 Keith\nSure, Brian, and thanks for having me. We're looking at it in a in a similar fashion. It's not necessarily a uh bid for a competitor. It seems like and this is kind of what we've gathered from it is the it's a it's a it's a an investment into capacity expansion beyond the the current um, GPF U platform that Nvidia currently has. Um, it's an investment alongside of uh a competitor in in not only in in the vertical they're in, but also looking at it from aspect of just a capacity growth that seems to be this is a a positive affirmation of that capacity growth that grows beyond what Nvidia currently has in their uh in their vertical. So this is a, in our opinion, a very positive um checkpoint for um where we are in the cycle. Uh there's a lot of questions about where are in the cycle in the infrastructure build and it's overpriced and and have we have we gotten ahead of ourselves. Nvidia with this um investment in our opinion is saying, no, we haven't. Uh there's still a lot to come in this in this investment phase.\n01:31 Brian\nAnd uh I got to give a shout out to one of my uh ex-followers here, watcher of the show, uh sideline 24. One of my resolutions Inez was to go out and visit an AI data center. This user telling me they have he's working on a project out in Arizona to build an AI infrastructure plant. So it's just it's fascinating to see what's happening in this country because of AI. And as question to you on this, which I I haven't seen brought up a lot on this Nvidia Groq deal. Did was Nvidia potentially at risk at losing its number one spot, not today, not tomorrow, but let's say five years down the line to a company like Groq and they figured, why not just pay big now, shell out a big check and then nobody could touch us.\n02:30 Inez\nYou know, Sozzi, I was listening to an investor of Groq uh on his uh channel about what why this is so interesting. And this is basically what he was saying is is that Nvidia is seeing the writing on the wall when it comes to specialized chips because you played that uh sound of Jonathan Ross talking about uh the inference technology that they have. And this is where uh some are seeing that where the money is at with these specialized chips and why Nvidia would pay three times the value of this company. And by the way, Jonathan Ross is seen as an engineering genius within this industry. So, yes, uh it it may be that it the Nvidia chips which are generalized chips, which are good at many tasks are great, but now where the money is being seen going forward, where the reoccurring money may be is in this specialized chip space. And that's why they are essentially uh buying this company in this deal that by the way, is this licensing deal, which is an interesting also format for uh these now we are seeing more and more of these types of deals where the talent goes to the uh goes to now Nvidia where the the company is still um is still sort of more of a shell company and this is because of anti-trust issues to make sure that this goes through. But yes, Jensen Huang, it may be admittedly saying we have a great chip, but now we are now acquiring this specialized chip with Jonathan Ross, did the TPU over at Google. So, uh, it's it's definitely seen as where the market may be going.\n04:31 Brian\nAnd uh I should mention, reach out to Groq. Uh they did decline to make Jonathan available for an interview. Uh Keith, let me get back to you here because really next year, you're getting you're starting to get the sense if we haven't gotten it already. The some of the world's largest tech companies might go hunting in private company land. You know, the companies that have been raising money all the past two years at big valuations, they may go shopping to further boost, you know, their capabilities. Uh what do you think about that?\n05:07 Keith\nWe absolutely think that's that has to happen. In order for the story the story to continue to evolve beyond where it has has started with the quote unquote picks and shovels of the last couple of years. Um, we feel like it justifi the valuations, the story has to continue to to evolve in the spaces that we just haven't really grasped yet. Uh in particular on the private market side, but we've seen um some developments on the private credit side as far as the funding, that would draw some questions as to kind of where how far this can go and how how it will be all capitalized. So, um, in 2026, the story has to continue to evolve away from some of the uh main culprits over the last two years, uh into spaces that the market really hasn't appreciated, um, the AI story to evolve to just yet. So we're looking for that evolution, um, and we feel like it has to come and justifi valuation going forward.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Bank of America analysts said the move signals recognition that inference needs specialized chips, while Bernstein flagged the $20 billion figure as large for a licensing deal.\nNvidia's stock was up about 2% on Friday morning following the reports.\nThe deal could see GPUs and LPUs coexist in future AI systems, potentially reshaping inference economics in coming years.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Let's fire up some trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform. We're watching Nvidia, Micron.\n00:10 Speaker A\nFirst up, Nvidia, the chip giant is making its largest deal ever, acquiring the assets of AI chip startup Groq. Nvidia has reportedly paid $20 billion in cash.\n00:23 Speaker A\nThe companies are calling it a non-exclusive licensing agreement. Plus, Groq's founder and CEO Jonathan Ross and other executives will officially join Nvidia.\n00:32 Speaker A\nWhat remains of Groq will operate as an independent company, likely focused on the cloud business. Nvidia's shares are rising ahead of the open.\n00:41 Speaker A\nNext, Micron. The company is set to report at a new record as the memory chipmaker extends its post earnings rally. In mid-December, Micron posted earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations. One analyst even called the report the best in chip history outside of Nvidia's May 2023 results, which kicked off the AI stock rally.\n00:59 Speaker A\nFinally, I'm watching airlines. Major winter weather bearing down on both sides of the country, set to disrupt holiday travel. Nearly 1,000 flights have already been canceled Friday, in hundreds just around New York City due to the threat of a major snowstorm. Between 5 to 9 inches of snow are expected starting late Friday afternoon and into Saturday.\n01:21 Speaker A\nWant to stay up to date on the weather? Of course you do.

      "Content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Bull, Base, & Bear Price Prediction and Forecast (Dec 26)\n\nJoel South\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThe trade war with China was tough on Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) investors. In April, shares hit a year-to-date low below $87 apiece. Like its fellow Magnificent 7 members, Nvidia struggled due to economic uncertainties about the effects of tariffs, as well as due to Chinese AI innovations. Bears saw Nvidia stock falling further because of bearish pressure from the broader market. Yet, some investors remain optimistic for a sustained rebound, and lately that seems to have been the case. The stock returned to all-time highs as some tariff fears dissipated and macro data improved, and Nvidia became the first $5 trillion market cap company.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock continues to recover from the year-to-date low.\nBut with the AI darling rereating from an all-time high, many are wondering where Nvidia stock could go next.\nThis analysis looks at three scenarios and where Nvidia stock could be in 2030.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe bearish argument that prevailed on Wall Street early this year is not entirely gone, though. While the AI rally may continue, it remains speculative, whereas the reasons for Nvidia stock’s decline in the spring were genuine. Given challenges such as being effectively locked out of China, Nvidia may still be at a crossroads right now. We do not know for sure where the stock will go next, but with the data on hand, we can speculate. That’s what we are doing here.\nThree Key Drivers of Nvidia Performance Through 2030 Will Nvidia continue to lead in AI?\n1. AI Infrastructure Dominance: Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market through its H100/H200 GPUs and CUDA software ecosystem. It is tough for Nvidia customers to switch to another supplier. This has allowed the company to dominate the industry, with customers returning year after year. As such, it is well-positioned to capture growth from the $400 billion AI chip market projected for 2030.\n\n2. Data Center Expansion: Its data center revenue has surged from $4.3 billion in Q1 2023 to over $35.6 billion in Q4 2024. Maintaining leadership here requires continuous innovation in GPU architecture and energy efficiency as AI workloads grow exponentially. So far, Nvidia has managed to do that.\n3. Margin Preservation: One of the biggest arguments against Nvidia is that it may not be able to hold on to its massive margins as competitors catch up and become more attractive to Nvidia’s customers. This has not happened yet, and Nvidia has maintained its hold on the market quite well. In turn, this has allowed the company to have industry-leading gross margins at 73% in Q4 FY2025.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia Stock Price Prediction in 2030: Bull, Bear, & Baseline Will it reach new heights or tumble further?\n24/7 Wall St. estimates that Nvidia’s stock price in 2030 will be $491 per share in our bull case, $265 in our base case, and $38 in our bear case. That would represent increases of 160.3% and 40.5%, and a decrease of 79.9%, respectively, from current levels. Each of these estimates comes from a specific scenario analysis of Nvidia’s business segments.\n\nThe Bull Case for Nvidia’s Share Price Assumptions for our bull case are as follows:\nAI growth: Nvidia currently holds about 80% of the AI accelerator market. Analysts project this dominance could continue through Blackwell GPU adoption and CUDA’s software moat. This may allow data center revenue to grow at a 25% CAGR to $351 billion by 2030 vs. $115.2 billion in FY2025. Gross margins could remain above 70% due to limited competition in high-end AI training chips.\nAutomotive and robotics: A 50% CAGR in automotive revenue to $25 billion by 2030 is achievable if Level 4 autonomy reaches even 15% to 20% penetration.\nSoftware: CUDA is already a big part of Nvidia’s moat, but this could get even better if the AI narrative succeeds in the long run. Nvidia could potentially shift this to a SaaS model once more developers become dependent on it.\n\nAll things considered, $491 per share is possible, with around $240 billion in net income if all that revenue materializes and margins hold up. Investors will still have to pay a 50x TTM earnings multiple for the stock. The market cap would be $12 trillion.\nThe likelihood of this happening is quite low, given the amount of ground Nvidia would have to cover.\nThe Base Case for Nvidia’s Share Price Assumptions for our base case are as follows:\nAI growth: Data center revenue can grow at 15% CAGR to $230+ billion by 2030. If Nvidia retains a 60% to 65% market share here, it could reach that goal, especially if competitors keep falling behind.\nAI narrative success: The AI narrative would still have to succeed for Nvidia to reach our base case price of $241. Otherwise, there would be no growth, and investors would quickly slash the growth premium to a discount.\n\nNvidia’s valuation for the base case would be $8.9 trillion. We strongly recommend reading this share price forecast for a more detailed analysis of our base case.\nThe Bear Case for Nvidia’s Share Price You may have noticed the big gap between the base case and the bear case. This is mostly because the bear case assumes that the AI narrative would fail.\nIf that happens, the result would be catastrophic for Nvidia and its stock. The only reason the shares trade at such a high valuation is that the company is directly linked to AI and its prospects. Without it, it will return to being known as a gaming GPU company with some links to crypto mining.\n\nHowever, that scenario is unlikely. AI demand is not going to disappear overnight. However, what can happen is that AI development could slow down. As a result, Nvidia would slow down too. It needs continuous orders from hyperscalers and AI startups to maintain its momentum and strong margins. If AI slows down and companies are no longer willing to run massive AI models at a loss, they’re also unlikely to upgrade their GPUs to whatever Nvidia has to offer. This would crush Nvidia’s margins and turn revenue growth red, and investors would no longer pay a growth premium for the stock. $38 for such a scenario is reasonable, if not a bit rich, considering that would still leave Nvidia with a $932 billion valuation.\nRegardless, our baseline remains at $241 for 2030.\n\nThis Is Why AI Is Not a Bubble and Nvidia Will Reach $10 Trillion\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Can NVIDIA's Networking Business Power the Next Phase of Growth?\n\nAnirudha Bhagat\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:09 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nANET\n\nNVIDIA Corporation ’s NVDA networking business is emerging as an important growth driver. As artificial intelligence (AI) models grow larger and more complex, customers need faster and more efficient ways to connect thousands of processors. This trend is boosting demand for NVIDIA’s networking products, including NVLink, InfiniBand and Spectrum-X Ethernet. These solutions are designed to move data quickly between graphics processing units, which is critical for both training and inference workloads.\n\nIn recent quarters, NVIDIA’s networking revenues have grown faster than many other business segments. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the company’s revenues from the networking business grew 162% year over year and 13% sequentially to a record level of $8.19 billion.\nCloud service providers and AI-focused data center operators are building large clusters that require high-speed interconnects. NVIDIA benefits from this shift because its networking hardware is tightly integrated with its compute platforms. Customers often buy the full system rather than mixing components from multiple vendors, which increases the total value of each deployment.\nNVIDIA’s growing networking business also supports its margins. High-performance switches and interconnects carry attractive pricing, especially when sold as part of a larger AI system. As cluster sizes increase, networking content per data center also rises, increasing margins.\n\nOverall, AI networking appears well-positioned to support NVIDIA’s next phase of growth. If AI workloads continue to scale, networking could become an even more meaningful contributor to NVDA’s long-term revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2026 networking revenues is pegged at $29.34 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of approximately 126%.\nNVIDIA’s Key Rivals in AI Networking NVIDIA faces competition from Broadcom AVGO and Arista Networks ANET in the AI networking space. Broadcom is a leader in Ethernet switching and custom silicon solutions, providing high-performance chips that form the backbone of modern data centers. Its strong relationships with hyperscalers like Google and Amazon allow it to deliver networking hardware tailored for large-scale AI and cloud workloads.\n\nArista Networks is another important rival, specializing in high-speed Ethernet switches used in AI and cloud environments. Arista Networks’ software-driven architecture and scalable systems make it a preferred choice for cloud service providers building AI clusters.\nNVIDIA’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of NVIDIA have risen around 19.6% over the past six months compared with the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s gain of 17.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nNVIDIA 6-Month Price Return Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, NVDA trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 27.52, lower than the industry’s average of 29.29.\nNVIDIA Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA’s fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings implies a year-over-year increase of approximately 55.5% and 54.4%, respectively. Estimates for fiscal 2026 and 2027 earnings have been revised upward in the past 30 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

      "Content": "Nvidia Signs Licensing Deal With AI Chip Startup Groq\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:06 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nNvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) has agreed to a licensing deal with artificial intelligence startup Groq, a move that could extend its technology portfolio as demand for AI computing continues to expand. Under the agreement, Nvidia paid for the right to use Groq's chip design and plans to integrate the technology into future products, while several Groq executives, including Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Ross, are set to join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology. Groq said it will continue operating as an independent company under a new chief executive, with no financial terms of the deal disclosed.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nNvidia's existing technology already dominates data centers at the center of the surge in AI-driven spending, a position that has made it the most valuable company in the chip industry and provided it with substantial resources to reinvest across the AI ecosystem. Groq, founded in 2016, is among a group of startups and large technology companies developing their own AI chips to compete with Nvidia, and raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion post-funding valuation in September to expand its data center capacity. The company said its outsourced computing business will continue, even as its low-latency chip technology is licensed to Nvidia, which said the design could add new capabilities and potentially open new markets.\n\nThe licensing agreement fits into Nvidia's broader strategy of investing across AI infrastructure while seeking to maintain a lead in inference, or running models once they are developed. The company has pledged billions to projects it believes could support wider AI adoption, agreed to invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI, and taken a stake in Intel, signaling a willingness to work with a wide range of partners as competition intensifies. By incorporating an external chip design alongside its own offerings in hardware, networking, software, and systems, Nvidia appears to be positioning itself to remain central to customers' AI roadmaps as in-house chip efforts at Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) continue to gain momentum.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Futures associated with the Dow were lower by nearly 0.2% in early trading, while those tied to the S&P 500 were fractionally lower. Futures tracking the Nasdaq crept higher. U.S. benchmark crude oil futures were at nearly $58.50 a barrel as the commodity stayed near two-week highs. Bitcoin traded at $88,600, higher than the $87,400 it hit on Wednesday. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which can influence a range of consumer loans, were at 4.14%, ticking higher from Wednesday’s levels.\n\nGold, Silver Extend Streak of Highs Gold and silver again touched record highs on Friday as the precious metals continued to see their prices rise. Gold futures were trading around $4543.50 an ounce after earlier pressing as high as $4561.60. Silver futures were at $75.67 an ounce recently after earlier reaching a new high of $75.84. Precious metals continued to add value in December, with silver rising by more than 27% this month and gold adding more than 6%.

Groq in a statement said that Nvidia entered a non-exclusive licensing agreement for the startup’s inference technology.“The agreement reflects a shared focus on expanding access to high-performance, low cost inference,” it said. CNBC reported that the deal include an asset purchase worth $20 billion in cash, citing Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led a $750 million fundraising round for the startup.The move comes as AI stocks have been moving higher to end the year. Nvidia shares were higher by 0.6% in premarket trading.\n\nStory Continues\nFederal Regulators Probe Tesla Door Release Issue The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it earlier this week opened an investigation into Tesla ( TSLA ) after it received a petition saying the mechanical door release for the 2022 Tesla Model 3 wasn’t easily accessible. “The petition cites allegations that the mechanical door release is hidden, unlabeled, and not intuitive to locate during an emergency,” the NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation said. The issue is expected to affect about 179,000 vehicles. The NHTSA had opened other investigations into Tesla , including a probe on electronic door lock issues with a different model. Tesla shares ticked higher in premarket trading.\nNike Shares Continue Rise After Apple CEO Stock Purchase Nike ( NKE ) shares continued to rise in premarket trading after the athletic apparel maker helped lead stocks higher in Wednesday’s session. Nike shares gained 4.6% Wednesday after a regulatory filing revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook, a member of Nike's board, bought nearly $3 million worth of the company’s stock. Despite the surge, Nike shares are lower by 20% so far this year. Nike shares were higher by nearly 0.4% in premarket trading.\n\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Washington and strategic partners have poured capital into Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ), and that money changes the risk equation for the company's costly foundry pivot. The government's support gives Intel breathing room to push a capital-intensive plan that private markets might otherwise punish.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with INTC.\nIs INTC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nIn Q3 Intel reported solid revenue and a clearer balance sheet after repaying debt and holding meaningful cash. The company keeps its foundry push front and center; that business still loses money, but leadership argues those losses will shrink as yields improve and volumes rise. Nvidia (NVDA) and SoftBank Group (SFTBY) contribute strategic capital and partnership opportunities that pair Intel's logic road map with external AI expertise.\nThe pivot carries real execution risk. Foundry losses run into the billions and management admits some nodes carry higher upfront costs and lower yields in early ramps. At the same time, capacity limits on older, profitable nodes left Intel unable to meet some demand, which complicates near-term margin recovery.\n\nPolicy backing matters. Infusion of cash by the government transforms Intel into a strategic toy, it attracts patient capital and provides company with additional runway to combat the manufacturing headaches. This does not negate the necessity of the fixes to its operations, however. Shareholders still desirous to see consistent yield increases, reduced margins, and a clearer path to foundry profitability.\nAt least, it is the crossroad between industrial policy and a risky, costly technological turnaround that Intel finds itself at now; the market would need to weigh the big picture priority versus immediate financial suffering.\nIs INTC Stock a Buy? Based on the one year price targets offered by 36 analysts, the average target price for Intel Corp is $36.79 with a high estimate of $52.00 and a low estimate of $18.00. The average target implies a upside of +1.74% from the current price of $36.16.Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Intel Corp in one year is $23.92, suggesting a downside of -33.85% from the current price of $36.16. gf value is gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. it is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and the future estimates of the business' performance.

      "Content": "Prediction: 1 Hypergrowth Stock That Will Run Circles Around Nvidia Through 2030\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 1:55 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Nvidia has been the pioneer in AI technology, but it could be overshadowed on the stock market by the memory specialist Micron Technology.\nThe huge demand for memory chips has supercharged this company's growth, and it is trading at a very attractive valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has made investors significantly richer in the past five years. An investment of just $100 in this semiconductor giant five years ago is now worth $1,360.\nNvidia's remarkable gains have been fueled by the terrific demand for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) chips. It is now the world's largest company with a market cap of just over $4.4 trillion. As such, it would be difficult for Nvidia to replicate its remarkable gains in the next five years.\nIts huge market cap, premium valuation, and the rising competition in the AI chip market could weigh on its stock performance through 2030, even though there is a good chance that it may become a $10 trillion company by the end of the decade. However, there is another semiconductor stock that's not just extremely cheap right now but is growing at a phenomenal pace.\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) manufactures memory chips used in data centers, computers, smartphones, and automotive applications. Let's look at the reasons why this company could outperform Nvidia over the next five years.\nMicron Technology is on track to clock stunning growth through 2030 The demand for the memory chips that Micron manufactures is booming, thanks to AI. The high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips that it makes are deployed in large quantities by companies like Nvidia, AMD , Broadcom , Marvell , and others to transport huge amounts of data at high speeds at lower power consumption and low latency to enable AI workloads in data centers.\n\nAnd edge AI devices such as smartphones and computers are now requiring higher dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and storage to run AI workloads. This demand for memory is so strong that there is a shortage of these chips, leading to an increase in prices.\nThis explains why Micron's latest results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended Nov. 27) blew past expectations. The stock rose 8% in extended trading after reporting on Dec. 17. Micron's revenue shot up 57% year over year to $13.6 billion, while adjusted earnings jumped by 167% to $4.78 per share.\nThe company's cloud memory business nearly doubled year over year to $5.3 billion, driven by AI, allowing Micron to crush Wall Street's expectations. The guidance was the icing on the cake. Micron expects its fiscal second-quarter revenue to jump by a multiple of 2.3 year over year in the current quarter to $18.7 billion. Adjusted earnings are projected to increase by a huge 440% to $8.42 per share.\n\nStory Continues\nThe estimates are well above Wall Street's revenue outlook of $14.2 billion and earnings forecast of $4.78 per share. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said on the latest earnings call that the \"growth in AI data center capacity is driving a significant increase in demand for high-performance and high-capacity memory and storage.\"\n\nMicron has raised its server-growth forecast for 2025 to a high teens percentage range, up from the prior expectation of 10%. It expects the server market to keep growing in 2026, a trend that's likely to last through 2030.\nMarket researcher IDC expects global AI infrastructure spending to hit $758 billion in 2029. Accelerated servers that support AI workloads are expected to have a 42% annual growth rate through the end of this period.\nMicron's competitor SK Hynix is estimating a 30% annual increase in the AI memory market through the end of the decade. However, that number could be higher as even custom AI chipmakers are now deploying HBM to make their chips faster and more efficient. Micron, for instance, expects the HBM market to grow at a 40% annual rate through 2028, generating $100 billion in revenue after three years, as compared to $35 billion this year.\n\nAs such, there is a strong possibility that Micron will maintain its healthy growth levels through 2030. Throw in the company's attractive valuation, and it is easy to see why the AI stock is poised to outperform Nvidia through 2030.\nHere's how much upside investors can expect Micron stock is significantly undervalued in relation to the potential growth it can deliver over the next five years. This is evident from the stock's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.53, as per Yahoo! Finance.\nThis multiple is calculated by dividing a company's trailing earnings multiple by the annual earnings growth that it is projected to clock over the next five years. A reading of less than 1 means that a stock is undervalued, and Micron is way below that threshold.\nNvidia, meanwhile, has a PEG ratio of 0.69, suggesting that Micron is the better growth stock of the two. Moreover, analysts have significantly raised their earnings growth expectations for the next couple of years.\nAssuming Micron can increase its earnings by a highly conservative rate of just 10% in fiscal years 2029 and 2030, its bottom line could jump to almost $42.23 per share after five years (using the fiscal 2028 estimate of $34.90 per share seen above as the base). If Micron trades at even 25 times forward earnings at that time (in line with the Nasdaq-100 index's forward earnings multiple), its stock price could hit $872 in 2030.\n\nThat would be more than triple its current share price. However, bigger gains cannot be ruled out as Micron's rapid growth could be rewarded with a higher multiple in the future, which means that it could indeed run circles around Nvidia through 2030.\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Sells Amazon Stock and Buys an AI Stock Up 1,030% Since 2024 (Hint: Not Nvidia)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nAMZN\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points In the third quarter, billionaire Ken Griffin sold Amazon stock and bought shares of Palantir, a stock up 1,030% since January 2024.\nAmazon's investments in artificial intelligence are bearing fruit, as evidenced by its strong sales growth and expanding operating margin.\nPalantir is growing like wildfire amid demand for its artificial intelligence platform, but the stock trades at an absurd (and unsustainable) valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nKen Griffin runs Citadel Advisors, the most successful hedge fund in history as measured by net gains since inception. Additionally, Citadel outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 8 percentage points over the last three years. That makes Griffin an excellent source of inspiration for retail investors.\nIn the third quarter, Citadel sold 1.6 million shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and purchased 388,000 shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) , a stock that has advanced 1,030% since January 2024. Comparatively, Nvidia stock is up 281% over the same period.\nHere's what investors should know about Amazon and Palantir Technologies.\nAmazon: The stock Ken Griffin sold Amazon has a strong presence in three growing industries: e-commerce , digital advertising, and cloud computing . The company is leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) to increase sales and improve profitability across each operating segment, as detailed below:\nE-commerce: Amazon runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. It has developed generative AI tools for customer service, inventory placement, and last-mile delivery, as well as models that make its industrial robot fleet more efficient. Amazon has also developed an AI shopping assistant called Rufus that is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales this year.\nAdvertising: Amazon is the third-largest ad tech company and the largest retail advertiser, which is one of the fastest-growing categories in the broader digital advertising market. The company has built generative AI tools that let brands create images, video, and audio; Amazon has also developed an agentic AI tool that can research products and create campaigns.\nCloud computing: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud. It has added new platform services, like Bedrock for generative AI application development. AWS has also designed custom AI chips for training and inference workloads that provide clients with a less expensive alternative to Nvidia GPUs. More recently, AWS introduced AI agents that automate software development, security operations, and performance monitoring.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestments in AI are bearing fruit. In the third quarter, Amazon's revenue increased 13% to $180 billion, driven by accelerating sales growth across its advertising and cloud computing segments. Meanwhile, operating margin expanded 60 basis points (excluding two one-time charges) and operating income increased 23% to $21.7 billion.\n\nWall Street estimates Amazon's earnings will increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look reasonable. So, why did Ken Griffin sell Amazon? Perhaps he was simply taking some profits. Whatever the reason, it would be wrong to assume he lost confidence in the company. Amazon is still one of Citadel Advisors' top 10 positions.\nPalantir Technologies: The stock Ken Griffin bought Palantir develops data analytics and artificial intelligence platforms for customers in the public and private sectors. Its key differentiator is ontology-based software, meaning its products are designed around a decisioning framework made more effective over time by machine learning (ML) models. Use cases span supply chain management, retail inventory optimization, financial fraud detection, and battlefield analytics.\n\nLast year, Forrester Research recognized Palantir as the most capable AI/ML platform on the market, ranking it above Alphabet 's Google, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure. The analysts wrote, \"Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market.\" Earlier this year, Forrester ranked Palantir as a leader in AI decisioning platforms.\nThat recognition from industry analysts has come alongside strong financial results. In the third quarter, Palantir's revenue rose 63% to $1.1 billion, the ninth straight acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings more than doubled to $0.21 per diluted share. Management said strong demand for its artificial intelligence platform was key to its strong performance.\nThe problem with Palantir is valuation. Shares currently trade at 119 times sales, which makes it the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 by a wide margin. AppLovin is the next-closest stock at 45 times sales. That means Palantir could lose more than 60% of its value and still be the most expensive stock in the index.\n\nConsider this: Palantir's stock price has increased 11x since January 2024, but its revenue has increased less than 2x. That means the primary reason the stock price has increased is that investors are happily paying higher price-to-sales multiples. Indeed, the stock traded at 18 times sales in January 2024.\nThat figure cannot keep expanding indefinitely. Valuation will matter at some point. When that day comes, Palantir is likely to crash. I'm not sure why Griffin bought shares of Palantir in the third quarter, but investors should not assume he has a great deal of conviction in the company: Palantir does not rank among his top 300 holdings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now? Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be 2026's Top-Performing Artificial Intelligence Stock\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points The market for AI computing devices is massive and growing.\nNvidia is sold out of cloud GPUs.\nNvidia's stock price tag is actually quite reasonable.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) buildout has been ongoing since 2023, but it's far from over.\nThe AI hyperscalers have nearly completed their record-setting capital expenditures for 2025, but they've already informed their investors that 2026 will be a year of even greater spending. While some investors are growing worried over those figures, some of the smartest people in the world think we need more AI computing power, and going against that trend likely isn't a smart move for investors.\n\nInvestors need to find the companies that are slated to cash in on these massive data center buildouts, and there are a handful of companies that can. One of the best to own over the past three years has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . It has delivered investors excellent returns, and seems poised to do so again in 2026.\nWhile I can't say for certain if Nvidia will be the best AI stock for 2026, I'm fairly confident it will be one of the best AI stocks, and it is also an attractive bet that it will outperform the market. These two projections combine to make Nvidia an excellent buy right now, and I can think of few better stocks to scoop up in the last few days of 2025.\nNvidia's dominance appears to be slipping, or is it? Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) and the technology stack that supports them. Combined, Nvidia's technology is the most flexible and easiest to use, and has some of the best performance available. This has made it the go-to computing unit of choice since the AI race began, but investors are worried that the company's dominance is slipping.\n\nHeadlines are filled with rising competition from AMD or how Broadcom has signed another client to spec out a custom AI chip. There are also innovative companies like Amazon that designed their own chip for their cloud computing platform. All of those headlines make it seem like Nvidia's grasp on the market is slipping, but that couldn't be further from the truth.\nIn its FY 2026 third quarter (ended Oct. 26) earnings release, CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. Although Nvidia is ramping up production as fast as it can, it is unable to meet the current computing demands of the market. As a result, clients are starting to look elsewhere to meet their massive computing demands. While they may prefer Nvidia hardware, some computing power is better than none.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, the market for these computing units is expected to be massive. In 2025, Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to total $600 billion. That figure is expected to rapidly increase to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. There is plenty of room for multiple companies to thrive in that space, and with how profitable these devices can be, it's no surprise that there are other entrants to the computing realm.\n\nDemand for AI computing power isn't slowing down, and Nvidia is well-positioned to take advantage of this massive growth.\nNvidia's stock is on sale While the market has remained fairly strong toward the end of the year, AI stocks have sold off. Nvidia recently was down around 15% from its all-time high, giving investors a solid entry price on one of the best companies to own for 2026.\nNvidia's stock trades for 23 times next year's earnings, which is a reasonable price tag to pay for any company.\nOnce you consider that growth is expected to be rapid and persist for several years after 2026, this price tag looks like a steal. However, it requires one thing: AI hyperscalers must keep spending their resources on data centers. If they continue to do that, Nvidia's stock has plenty of room to run. If they do not, it could be a disaster for Nvidia investors.\n\nHowever, all signs point to AI spending continuing to ramp up over the next few years, making Nvidia a fantastic stock to own for 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Intel, Nvidia and Agnico Eagle Mines\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 11:39 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAEM\n\n^GSPC\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 26, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Intel INTC, Nvidia NVDA and Agnico Eagle Mines AEM.\nSanta Claus Rally Underway: Stocks to Watch The market&rsquo;s recent momentum continued heading into the Christmas holiday as the S&P 500 clinched a new all-time closing high.\nWe&rsquo;ve certainly seen a rotation lately into rate-sensitive areas like small-caps after the Fed cut interest rates in December for the third time this year. But large-caps are attempting to retake the lead, in line with what we&rsquo;ve seen throughout this phenomenal multi-year bull run off the October 2022 lows.\n\nIn any case, the calendar is on the side of the bulls as we remain in the most favorable 3-month stretch of the year that spans November through January. And from a seasonal perspective, the next week of trading tends to lean quite bullish.\nThe Santa Claus Rally &ldquo;If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.&rdquo; &ndash; Yale Hirsch\nWe saw a relatively sluggish start to the Christmas-themed month, with the S&P 500 falling nearly 2% through December 17 th . But the index has come roaring back over the past week and is now up roughly 1% as of Christmas Eve.\n\nThe days surrounding the Christmas holiday have historically been some of the most bullish times of the year. Dating back to 1988, the second day before Christmas (which fell on Tuesday this year) is the most bullish, with the S&P 500 rising more than 70% of the time over the past 37 years. That trend played out again yesterday.\nIt looks like the early December weakness is setting up well for a year-end rally. Today marks the final trading day before Christmas and is also the first day of a period known as the Santa Claus Rally.\nFirst discovered by Yale Hirsch (creator of the Stock Trader&rsquo;s Almanac), the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is a seven-day period that consists of the final five trading days of the year, along with the first two trading days of the New Year. As markets are closed on Thursday for the Christmas holiday (as well as January 1 st for New Year&rsquo;s Day), today marks the first day of the SCR.\n\nSince 1950, these 7 glorious days tend to be overwhelmingly green, as the S&P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3% and is positive nearly 80% of the time. In fact, no other 7 days of the year are more likely to finish higher!\nIf these 7 days are higher, it typically bodes well for the full year. In fact, since 1950, when we have a positive return during this stretch, the S&P 500 gains an average of more than 10% the following year and is higher over 70% of the time.\n\nStory Continues\nYears where markets saw negative returns during the Santa Claus Rally period tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be bought at lower prices later in the year. For example, a negative SCR preceded relatively flat years like 1994, 2005 and 2015, as well as some of the worst years on record like 2008.\n\nAnd while we did see a negative return during the SCR period last year (and still registered solid gains in 2025), the early tariff tantrum provided investors the opportunity to purchase stocks on sale.\nStocks to Watch Chip giant Intel saw its stock fall roughly 2% in early trading on Wednesday, after a report suggested that Nvidia had halted a test to use Intel&rsquo;s production process to make advanced chips.\nNvidia had been in the testing phase of the so-called &ldquo;18A&rdquo; production process, which represented a potential return to manufacturing premium offerings in-house. While Intel touted the technology as a serious breakthrough, the halt raises concerns regarding the practicality of Intel&rsquo;s advanced manufacturing process.\n\nThe negative headline came just months after the two semiconductor companies announced a key collaboration back in September. Under the prior arrangement, Intel agreed to develop custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia&rsquo;s AI infrastructure platforms. In return, Nvidia pledged to invest $5 billion in Intel&rsquo;s common stock, which sent shares notably higher over the past few months. Intel is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Nvidia remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nMeanwhile, gold prices back off slightly from their staggering ascent to all-time highs. Gold producer Agnico Eagle Mines is a leader in the space and has soared more than 130% year-to-date. The company engages in the exploration and production of precious metals including gold, silver, zinc, and copper. AEM stock remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) due to favorable earnings estimate revisions.\n\nConclusion Today marks the second day of the Santa Claus Rally. As we saw, this seven-day stretch is typically positive and has shown predictive power.\nPositive seasonality represents a major tailwind for stocks. Make sure to keep an eye on how markets perform over the SCR period. From all of us here at Zacks, we wish you happy holidays and a prosperous New Year.\n\nDisclosure: Nvidia is a current holding in the Zacks Headline Trader portfolio.

      "Content": "What Is the Smartest Quantum Computing Stock to Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nQBTS\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Pure-play developers like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum are the hottest quantum computing stocks right now.\nBig tech giants are also exploring quantum computing in addition to their established generative artificial intelligence (AI) products.\nNvidia is quietly building a quantum AI ecosystem that stands to benefit, no matter which systems succeed in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOne of the hottest pockets of the artificial intelligence (AI) realm in 2025 was quantum computing. Shares of pure-play quantum developers such as IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum each handily trounced the S&P 500 this year.\nWhat many investors might not fully realize is that several members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are also exploring quantum computing technology alongside their existing generative AI efforts. While Alphabet , Amazon , and Microsoft have received some notoriety around their custom quantum processors, I think there's a more lucrative opportunity hiding in plain sight.\nI'll detail how Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is quietly building a full-spectrum quantum computing suite, and explain why this could be a major catalyst for the company as the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure era begins.\nNvidia is laying the foundation between quantum and accelerated computing At the moment, quantum computing is an exploratory pursuit. While some businesses are assessing how the technology may be integrated within their existing AI framework, quantum technology has little use at the enterprise level today.\nAgainst this backdrop, pure-play developers are primarily focused on research and development right now. IonQ and Rigetti specialize in gate-based approaches leveraging trapped ions and superconducting techniques. D-Wave, for its part, is more niche -- focusing on quantum annealing processes for optimization tasks.\n\nThe main takeaway is that quantum pure plays are currently engaged with the actual physics behind the creation and configuration of quantum bits -- known as qubits -- within new computing architectures.\nAs mentioned, the big three cloud providers have each designed their own quantum processors -- dubbed Willow (Alphabet), Ocelot (Amazon), and Majorana (Microsoft). While quantum computing is not a meaningful contributor to their respective businesses at this time, it's clear that big tech is fascinated by how this emerging technology may eventually impact the broader AI opportunity.\nNvidia's approach is entirely different from that of its megacap counterparts, as well as the pure plays. Instead of building its own quantum computers, Nvidia is seeking to become a bridge between the software and hardware investments necessary to build these systems.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia offers a software platform called CUDA-Q, within which developers can write applications that work across a network of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (quantum processing units). On the hardware side, Nvidia has built a high-speed interconnect called NVQLink. NVQLink represents a pathway for QPUs and GPUs to seamlessly communicate without straining latency and bandwidth.\n\nEssentially, Nvidia's decision to provide a software and hardware ecosystem allows programmers to easily test their AI workloads across a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment. This is a particularly smart move because it positions Nvidia to be a beneficiary regardless of which quantum processor designs or qubit architecture emerges as the market standard down the road.\nWill 2026 be a big year for Nvidia? Nvidia's growth trajectory is directly tied to the budgets of big tech. As the slope of the lines in the chart illustrate, AI hyperscalers are accelerating their capital expenditures (capex) -- suggesting that data center buildouts, networking equipment, and chip procurement remain high priorities.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs suggests that the hyperscalers alone will contribute nearly half a trillion dollars to AI infrastructure in 2026. While this is great news for Nvidia in the short term, AI infrastructure is expected to become a nearly $7 trillion opportunity by the end of the decade, according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a couple of key ideas. First, Nvidia appears well-positioned to benefit from rising data center spend going into next year. More importantly, however, AI infrastructure is shaping up to be a longer-term secular opportunity.\nGiven these dynamics, Nvidia could continue receiving outsized demand for its products as quantum computing becomes a more meaningful contributor to the broader AI narrative over the next several years. So while CUDA-Q and NVQLink may not yet be major contributors to Nvidia's business today relative to its core compute and networking services, I'm encouraged by the company's pursuit of quantum computing and see these products eventually becoming an important storyline in its evolution throughout the AI infrastructure chapter.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a good buy? As of this writing (Dec. 22), Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 24. Considering Nvidia's current growth in combination with Wall Street's outlook, the stock is valued quite reasonably.\nIn my eyes, quantum computing represents just another pillar supporting Nvidia's growth arc as AI continues to dominate the market. For these reasons, I think Nvidia is headed for further valuation expansion heading into 2026 and well beyond -- making it a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Will Rigetti Computing Make a Comeback in 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: RGTI\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Quantum computing stocks have been on a roller-coaster ride.\nThe sector offers a lot of promise -- but also great risks.\nRigetti's latest fall appears tied to a missed contract opportunity.\n10 stocks we like better than Rigetti Computing ›\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) has taken investors on quite the roller-coaster ride in 2025. It entered the year on a strong note thanks to the quantum computing rally in December 2024. However, it crashed nearly 75% from its highs before January was over, thanks to comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about useful quantum computing being a long way away.\n\nHuang quickly pivoted from that stance, and the quantum computing start-up stocks started to rally throughout 2025, before peaking in October. However, the market started to become risk-averse around that time, which caused quantum computing stocks to sell off again. Now, Rigetti Computing sits about 60% down from its high established in October, although it's still up around 50% so far this year.\nSo, will Rigetti make another amazing comeback in 2026? Or will it be stuck in these lower ranges for a while?\nThe real quantum computing winners won't emerge for a few years We're in the early stage of quantum computing development, and knowing who the ultimate winner is not possible. There are private companies, publicly traded upstarts like Rigetti, and legacy big tech companies like Alphabet and Microsoft all developing quantum computing technology.\nWith a crowded industry, it's likely that several of these companies (outside the legacy tech companies) will go bankrupt. This makes quantum computing a high-risk, high-reward sector of the market, which many may not like. If it's too risky for you, there are quantum computing ETFs, or you can invest in one of the legacy tech companies.\n\nHowever, if you're looking to take on a bit more risk in exchange for more upside, Rigetti may be a stock you gravitate toward.\nRigetti isn't a large stock by market cap, as it's valued at around $7 billion. The quantum computing industry could easily be worth several times more than that, with McKinsey & Company estimating that the quantum computing market could be greater than $100 billion by 2035. That's a huge market that Rigetti could capture if it's the first to reach viable quantum computing, making it at least a stock that investors should consider.\nRigetti Computing must rely on outside funding However, Rigetti is showing some signs of weakness that could present a red flag for investors. Because Rigetti doesn't have a legacy business to fund its operations, it must win research contracts to stay solvent.\n\nStory Continues\nOne of the biggest contracts any of the quantum computing companies can win is from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). The winner of this contract will be in line to provide quantum computing hardware to the U.S. military. DARPA recently announced which companies made it to stage B, and Rigetti Computing was not one of them.\n\nFamiliar names like IonQ and International Business Machines made the list, which makes Rigetti's failure to advance from stage A to stage B frustrating for investors. It's also why IonQ is only around 30% down from its all-time high, versus Rigetti's 60%.\nIf you're looking to invest in quantum computing start-ups, you only want to pick the best. Most investors will never be able to understand the complexities and intricacies of quantum computing, so relying on programs like DARPA, which know what's going on, to screen out the winners from the losers is a smart idea.\nRigetti's stock could make a comeback in 2026, but it will likely be based on the broader market's risk appetite. Rigetti may rise in tandem with its peers, but unless it can secure some major quantum computing contracts, I think there are far better quantum computing stock picks for 2026 than Rigetti Computing.\n\nShould you buy stock in Rigetti Computing right now? Before you buy stock in Rigetti Computing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rigetti Computing wasn’t one of them.

Dan, good to see you. Don't know where to start, so I'm going to start on Nvidia. Uh, I mentioned at the top, we're seeing uh the bulls return to Nvidia.\n00:10 Speaker A\nuh not in a big way, but I would say in a nice way. What's the play there?\n00:15 Dan\nLook, I think the reality is China is going to reopen, you know, for Nvidia and I think that's something that wasn't necessarily factored in fully. I think investors are realizing to big change in the beltway.\n00:26 Dan\nAnd look,size, the reality is there's one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution. And and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out,\n00:33 Dan\nnumbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15 to 20% at a minimum going to 2026. You put that together, I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a beast case to end 2026.\n00:45 Speaker A\nAnother case for Nvidia Dan is is it this? and you can tell me if I'm wrong. You know, you and I have I've known each other for for many many years. It's okay. We have a debate here. Um that Nvidia has less exposure\n00:56 Speaker A\nto open AI than its rival AMD because AMD might be partially owned by open AI in 10 years.\n01:02 Dan\nLook, right now the reality is is that, you know, associated with open AI is a bad thing. Now, I disagree with that. just me and you've talked about it, but no doubt in the from a trade perspective.\n01:10 Dan\nNvidia, you know, they're obviously like they're not wed to to an open AI. And I think to some extent, you know, I think you've talked about it, when you look at the divergence of those related to open AI, you know, whether it's Oracle or Microsoft or whatever it may be, you know, their stocks are obviously under more pressure.\n01:27 Dan\nBut look, my view is as we go into 2026, investors are underestimating the scale and scope of the AI revolution. For Nvidia, for open AI, for Oracle, which I think is table pound here despite, you know, obviously a lot of the the negative sentiment for Palantir and others.\n01:40 Dan\nBecause look, only 3% of companies in the US have gone down the AI path and for the first time in 30 years, the US is ahead of China when it comes to tech.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Veteran analyst has blunt message on Intel stock\n\nVuk Zdinjak\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 9:47 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nIntel stock is trading approximately 0.52% lower at $36.16 as of the time of writing. The stock is down, due to a Reuters report stating that Nvidia has decided not to manufacture its chips using Intel’s 18A node (manufacturing process) after conducting some testing.\nIn response to this report, an Intel spokesperson told Reuters the company’s 18A node is “progressing well,” and that it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-gen node 14A.\n\nI have closely followed Intel’s moves this year, and wrote in late September about Intel engaging customers for its fabs: “Intel’s ability to attract customers depends on how the launch of its Panther Lake and Nova Lake CPUs goes.”\nGiven that both CPU lines are set to launch in 2026, at the time, I saw little chance that Nvidia would manufacture anything on Intel’s 18A node until its issues had been completely resolved. We’ll explore this in more detail later.\nVeteran analyst exiting long position in Intel Veteran analyst Stephen Guilfoyle has been long on Intel ( INTC ) for a few months.\nFollowing the news that Nvidia decided not to use Intel’s 18A node, he conducted his analysis, noting that since early August, Intel stock had developed a rising wedge pattern of bearish reversal .\nGuilfoyle offered more detail on TheStreet Pro .\n\nHe added that being long on Nvidia, AMD , Broadcom, and Intel leaves him somewhat overexposed to the space.\nWhat do other analysts think about INTC stock? According to MarketBeat , the consensus rating for Intel's stock is hold, with 20 analysts giving that rating, 6 giving a sell rating, and 5 giving a buy rating. The average target price is $38.09.\n“Importantly, we don’t expect a material improvement in the current unfavorable cost structure for Intel Foundry, given slow internal adoption of 18A node (peak capacity in 2030+) and foundry competition in the U.S.,” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in his research note in October.\n\nHe also explained that Intel stock, trading at a 50 multiple price-to-earnings ratio estimate for calendar year 2027, is overvalued. Arya’s rating for INTC is underperform (sell equivalent), and a price target is $34, based on a 3 multiple of his enterprise value-to-sales ratio estimate for 2027, in line with the historical range of 1.7 to 4.\nWhy Nvidia chips on Intel’s 18A node weren’t going to happen Nvidia sells millions of GPU chips, and it needs a reliable manufacturing process. Even if Intel was going to cover the cost of the defective chips, that would mean the manufacturing would take much longer, depending on how bad the yield rate is.\n\nStory Continues\nIntel hasn’t disclosed yield rates for its 18A node, and its avoidance of the exact answer hints that they are not good.\n\"I would say the yields are adequate to address the supply, but they are not where we need them to be in order to drive the appropriate level of margins,” Intel CFO David Zinsner said during the Q3 earnings call .\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\nJohn Pitzer, corporate vice president of corporate planning and investor relations at Intel, shared his thoughts at the 2025 RBC Capital Markets Global Technology, Internet, Media & Telecommunications Conference.\n“We have [said] in the past that the industry average yield improvement on a new ramp is about 7% per month, and we are now on that curve for Panther Lake, which is giving us some confidence as we launch the product this quarter,” Pitzer said, as reported by Tom’s Hardware .\n\nThe problem with Pitzer’s statement is that it isn’t clear what 7% represents. To illustrate this, let’s say that hypothetically, yields are 10% and they increase by 7% of that 10%, which gives us 10.7%. However, it could also mean that they get a 7% increase, in the sense that they go from 10% to 17%.\nHe said the dramatic increase started about seven or eight months ago, so if it were the latter case, it would mean the yields increased by approximately 56% from whatever the starting point was. If Intel’s yields hit more than 56% and are increasing by 7% per month, it wouldn’t need to keep avoiding the exact answer.\nIn addition to the yield problems, switching to a manufacturing process from another company is not a trivial task. Intel needs to have proof that the switch is worth it. The company was already focusing more on securing major contracts for its next-generation 14A node, due to the difficulties it had in attracting them to the 18A node, as reported by Reuters and Tom’s hardware in July.\nRelated: Bank of America resets Micron stock price target, rating\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 25, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Logan Paul auctions off $5.3 million Pokémon card, urging young people to invest more in nontraditional assets: ‘Don’t be afraid to take a risk’\n\nSydney Lake\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 8:56 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: EBAY\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nHESAF\n\nGC=F\n\nWe’ve all heard the traditional advice that the best investments are those made in the stock market, saving in a 401(k), and buying a house. But younger generations have started touting nontraditional investments like buying a Birkin bag or other collectibles as a surefire way to bring in extra bucks.\n\nInfluencer and WWE wrestler Logan Paul recently said going beyond normal investments can be worth it.\n&#8220;If you&#8217;re young, there are ways to spend and invest your money in ways that might mean more to you than in a traditional conservative environment like the stock market,&#8221; he said on Fox Business&#8217;s &#8220;The Big Money Show&#8221; on Tuesday.\nAnd Paul has certainly gone down the nontraditional path for investing: He recently put up a rare Pokémon card for auction that he bought in 2022 for $5.3 million . The former WWE United States Champion actually used to wear the card—which he says is “the rarest card in the world” and the “Holy Grail”—around his neck during competitions. The card is a PSA-graded 10 Pikachu Illustrator, and only a few dozen copies exist worldwide. But Paul’s card is the only one to receive a 10/10 grade from Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA).\n\nPaul said he plans to auction the card in early 2026 and estimates it will sell for between $7 million and $12 million, which would bank him about $2 million to $7 million. He also argued collectibles like Pokémon cards have “outperformed” the stock market during the last two decades.\n“If you have the money, don&#8217;t be afraid to take a risk, especially if you&#8217;re young,&#8221; Paul said.\nAre collectibles really a good investment? According to global wealth management firm AES , collectibles like wine, manuscripts, vintage cars, rare pieces of art, and more can produce a “ reasonable ” return for investors, but they often don’t come with the same long-term gains of investing in stocks.\nBetween 1900 and 2012, collectibles produced a nominal annual return of 6.4% and a real return of 2.4%, according to the AES report.\n\n“Although the return is reasonable, it’s far lower than the long-term rewards of investing in the equity market,” AES CEO Sam Instone wrote. But, “that’s not to say these collectible items are not for certain investors.”\nStill, Gen Z men have become obsessed with investing in these collectibles, which some argue will beat Nvidia stock and the S&P 500. And they could have a point: Pokémon cards have seen the largest long-term increase in value among all card categories. They’re up 3,261% in the past 20 years, according to data provided to Fortune ’s Preston Fore from Card Ladder. Even a one-year investment is up 46%, which is higher than Nvidia’s 35% jump and the S&P 500’s 17% year-to-date increase.\n\nStory Continues\n“The trading card hobby has entered a new era, driven by technology, innovation, community, and a great balance of modern creativity–with new sets, storylines and characters–alongside good old nostalgia,” Adam Ireland, VP and GM of global collectibles at eBay , previously told Fortune . He also said eBay users searched for “Pokemon” nearly 14,000 times per hour in 2024.\n\nOther collectibles like the Hermes Birkin bag have caught the attention of young investors, who have argued buying one can be more valuable than investing in gold. But recent reports have shown these rare handbags don’t have the same return-on-investment they once did. The average resale premium for Birkin and Kelly bags—a metric that compares the auction price to its retail cost—has fallen from 2.2 times its original value in 2022 to 1.4 times as of November, according to Bernstein Research’s Secondhand Pricing Tracker. To put that in perspective, a Birkin bag originally bought for $10,000 and resold in 2022 would have cost more than $22,000, but a bag originally retailing for the same price and resold today would be worth just $14,000.\nOverall, although investing in collectibles can end in a big payday, they can also be a very risky investment because of liquidity risks, concentration risks, costs and upkeep, the potential for a bubble, and tax treatment, according to an analysis by The Economic Times.\n“It’s also true that some people generate income regularly buying and selling collectibles,” according to Consumers Credit Union. “However, fortunes are determined by the whims of buyers along with the rising and falling popularity of particular items. While the stock market may have a down year, over time it trends to higher value.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could January Spark the Next Big Rally in AI Stocks?\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 8:33 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points The AI-fueled productivity gains are expected to drive a surge in AI infrastructure spending in 2026.\nSolid results from a couple of key companies in this sector should help reinstate investor confidence in AI stocks.\nIt may be a good time to buy a few names in this sector before they go on a bull run in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have hit a rough patch of late. The Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF , which is the largest AI-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF), is down over 5% since the beginning of November.\nConcerns about AI being in a bubble, high valuations, and the huge amounts of debt that certain companies are taking on to build AI infrastructure have been weighing on investors' minds of late. This explains why prominent AI names such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) have been pulling back after hitting 52-week highs in the past couple of months.\nInvestors will now be wondering if AI stocks can witness a turnaround in their fortunes in the new year. Let's check if there is a possibility of a big rally in this sector in January that could set up AI stocks for a solid 2026.\nThe sell-off shouldn't last for long The recent weakness in AI stocks can be attributed to the high valuations of companies in this sector. However, the good news for investors is that they can buy some of the top names in this industry at an attractive valuation right now.\nNvidia, for instance, is trading at just 24 times forward earnings, which is well below the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 32 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). That's quite attractive for a company that's expected to deliver a 60% jump in earnings next year, especially considering that Nvidia has the potential to clock a bigger jump in earnings.\n\nThat's because spending on AI infrastructure is likely to increase even further in 2026. Goldman Sachs estimates that hyperscalers are set to spend $527 billion on data center infrastructure next year, up by 34% from 2025's projected spending. However, it is worth noting that these estimates have moved significantly higher of late.\nGoldman Sachs notes that hyperscalers were initially expected to spend $465 billion in 2026, according to estimates at the beginning of the third quarter. However, that number has increased substantially. A key reason why that's the case is because of the payoff that AI is bringing for its adopters. For instance, customers using Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to connect their data and operations with generative AI tools are witnessing healthy productivity improvements.\n\nStory Continues\nOne of them points out that a problem that earlier took weeks to solve can now be tackled in just five minutes, while another added that a process that used to take nine days to complete is now executed in just seconds. These gains aren't surprising. Market research firm IDC points out that \"every new dollar spent on AI solutions and services by adopters is expected to generate an additional $4.9 in the global economy.\"\n\nSo, it is easy to see the terrific expansion in Palantir's customer base. Its overall customer count increased by 45% year over year in the third quarter of 2025. More importantly, the customers who start using Palantir's offerings tend to go for enterprise-wide deployment of its solutions to maximize productivity gains.\nThis is the reason why Palantir won new contracts worth a record $2.8 billion in Q3, up by 151% from the prior year. For comparison, the company's revenue increased by a relatively slower pace of 63% to $1.18 billion, suggesting that it is winning new business at a faster pace than it can fulfill existing contracts. This situation should ideally lead to an acceleration in its growth in the future, especially considering how much value each dollar spent on AI services could generate for users.\n\nAnd that, in turn, should lead to stronger demand for chips that companies like Nvidia manufacture. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress remarked on the company's November earnings call that the \"demand for AI infrastructure continues to exceed our expectations.\" She added that the three generations of its data center graphics processing units (GPUs) -- Ampere, Blackwell, and Hopper -- are at full utilization.\nIn other words, hyperscalers and AI companies are poised to spend more money on GPUs to train and deploy AI models and inference applications in the cloud. Nvidia itself projects that AI infrastructure spending will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40% through the end of the decade, landing between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in 2030.\nThis is the reason why Nvidia's earnings estimates for the next couple of years have moved significantly higher, a trend that's likely to continue as hyperscalers spend more money to bring online more AI infrastructure to utilize the technology's productivity gains.\nWhy January could be a breakout month for AI stocks AI stocks have played a central role in driving the stock market higher. Again, that's not surprising as the likes of Palantir and Nvidia have jumped nearly 3,000% and 1,000% in the past three years.\nBlackRock , the world's largest asset management firm, anticipates AI to keep driving markets higher in 2026. The firm notes that stocks in this sector are likely to perform well despite periods of volatility. Even Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, a noted tech bull, is expecting AI stocks to rally higher in 2026. And that rally could start as soon as next month when key AI infrastructure companies such as Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) and ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) release their results.\n\nBoth companies are expected to release their results on Jan. 28, 2026. There have been solid signs of strong demand for their chipmaking equipment of late, fueled by AI. Lam Research, for instance, reported a solid increase of 27.5% in revenue in the last reported quarter. Management pointed out on the earnings call that it expects \"the surge in AI data center demand creating billions of dollars of served available market expansion and share gain opportunity for Lam in the coming years.\"\nOn the other hand, Dutch semiconductor giant ASML also posted a bigger-than-expected increase in its bookings in Q3, fueled by AI demand. With the demand for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment used for making AI chips expected to grow in double digits over the next three years, ASML seems poised to deliver healthy guidance.\n\nSo, a solid set of results from Lam and ASML, along with the healthy guidance that they are likely to deliver, should instill confidence in AI stocks as these companies act as a barometer for the sector, which is why it would be a good time to buy the names discussed above before they go on a bull run next month.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Ives is of the opinion that Mr. Market is still underestimating how long and big this AI buildout will be.\n\nHe now sets a head-spinning $250 base-case target for Nvidia by the end of 2026, which represents a 33% gain from its current price at $187.67 (at the time of writing).\nIves is betting that the AI story some investors think they’ve missed is just getting started.\nWall Street listens when Dan Ives talks tech Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities , and he's one of Wall Street ’s most-quoted analysts in the technology space.\nWhat sets him apart is that he isn’t shy in dishing out big numbers on big themes and then explaining his rationale in plain English on TV.\n\nIves has built a rock-solid reputation leaning into tech cycles early, including areas like cloud computing, EVs, and today’s AI-powered stock market boom.\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nHis investing focus is on secular growth, catalyst-driven technology, and a sharp focus on major platform shifts.\nFor perspective, on TipRanks , Ives is rated as a five-star analyst , boasting a 56% success rate across an eyebrow-raising 500 ratings , backed by an average return of about 16% per call .\n\nStory Continues\nThat track record matters immensely, especially when he takes bold positions.\nWhy Dan Ives sees Nvidia at $250 by the end of 2026 For Ives, his massive $250 call on Nvidia has everything to do with earnings power that Wall Street hasn’t fully modeled.\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance , he argues that the market still underestimates how critical Nvidia is to every part of the AI stack, covering everything from training to inference to real-world deployment.\n\nHis incredible conviction in the stock rests primarily on Nvidia’s immense scale and positioning.\nNvidia's 3-year timeline for rewriting its bottom-line positioning Jan. 2022: $9.8 billion baseline year before the AI earnings started to materialize\nJan. 2023: $4.4 billion ( -55% year over year ), a down year as the video gaming giant saw its game-related and data-center demand soften ahead of the AI boom\nJan. 2024: $29.8 billion ( +581% year over year ), the AI inflection point\nJan. 2025: $72.9 billion ( +145% year over year ), when scale kicked in, and margins grew at a breakneck pace, with Nvidia’s AI dominance showing up in profits\nTrailing 12 months: $99.2 billion , representing run-rate earnings that felt virtually impossible just two years ago\nSource: Seeking Alpha\n\nNvidia sits upstream of hyperscalers, enterprises, and governments that are racing ahead in developing AI infrastructure.\nIves also believes that geopolitical shifts and evolving trade dynamics are currently being mispriced, as enterprise AI adoption remains far from mature.\nSo if estimates move even modestly higher, the math starts to work quickly.\nThe AI buildout is still in early innings The biggest mistake investors continue to make, according to Ives, is that they feel the AI trade is already crowded.\nIn fact, he feels it's the complete opposite, with the market only in year three of an eight-to 10-year buildout , which is why the choppiness hasn’t broken the underlying trend.\nTo illustrate his point further, he says only about 3% of U.S. companies are meaningfully using AI today, with most still in the evaluation or pilot phase.\n\nRelated: A $1 trillion IPO looms, and Amazon may have just locked in early\nHence, Ives focuses a lot less on hype cycles and more on enterprise-related spending . Corporations are budgeting instead of just experimenting in the past.\nIn fact, Goldman Sachs states that AI companies could invest north of $500 billion in 2026 , saying that analyst capex estimates have consistently underestimated the buildout.\nCapital expenditures linked to AI infrastructure have risen a lot quicker than forecasts, surprising investors who were splitting hairs about market pullbacks just a year ago.\nOn top of that, Ives points to a major geopolitical shift at work.\nFor the first time in decades, he feels that the U.S. has regained a decisive lead over China in core technology , which adds new layers to the AI story.\nRelated: Micron surge is bullish for these other stocks, says Bank of America\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 25, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nJordan Rosenfeld\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is not just infiltrating everyday lives; it has been the driving force behind stock market gains for the past two years. From chipmakers to software, anything tied to AI has surged. But investors are starting to wonder what happens if the momentum slows and the market decides AI valuations have gone too far. While no one can predict the future, I asked ChatGPT to look more deeply into the history of stock market bubbles and what might happen if the AI bubble were to burst.\n\nHere are its predictions.\nA Sharp Repricing of AI Stocks A correction in AI stocks would not just be another bad day for tech, ChatGPT warned. Because a handful of companies, including Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, now make up such a large percentage of the S&P 500, their movements shape the entire market.\nIf the market decides these large AI players are overvalued, those big company stocks will be the first to see a rapid decline as well as any company heavily tied to AI infrastructure, ChatGPT said.\n\nBecause these companies now make up a huge share of the market, a correction in even a handful of them could lead to a fall in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. This could lead to an environment similar to the dot-com bubble burst of the early 2000s.\nLearn More: I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Middle Class\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nA Broader Market Correction If the AI market trend reverses, the entire stock market index would likely follow, ChatGPT said. We could be looking at a broad correction of 10% to 20% if sentiment turns and investors begin to question AI revenue projections.\nNot all sectors would be hit equally, however. What tends to happen during sector slowdowns is that investors rotate their money into other areas like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples, ChatGPT noted. That means companies with steady earnings and predictable cash flows tend to look attractive. Thus, investors with diversified portfolios would be less affected than those concentrated in a single theme.\n\nStartup Valuations Could Cool Fast The ripple effects of an AI market correction would also have an impact on startups. Venture funding has been pouring into AI startups with the assumption that adoption will keep accelerating, ChatGPT said. If the market “gets skittish,” these valuations could fall as quickly as public tech stocks. That means less hiring, more consolidation and a good chance that many AI startups might fail.\n\nStory Continues\nLarger companies with strong balance sheets would likely scoop up talent or intellectual property, however, again similar to what happened after the dot-com bust. For workers and entrepreneurs, this could hit hard.\nWill an Economic Crisis Be Coming? The good news for investors is that a complete collapse similar to 2000 or 2008 is much less likely. Many AI companies today generate revenue that’s grounded in other profitable business products or services outside of AI. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon have the funds and the services to withstand a downturn . In the dot-com era, many companies going public had no profits or even customers. ChatGPT said “the fundamentals today are stronger.”\n\nHow Likely Is an AI Bubble To Burst? While an economic crisis is not likely coming, a sharp correction in AI stocks is more likely than not, ChatGPT said. It pointed out that “high-growth sectors tend to overshoot,” and the enthusiasm around AI has created valuations that may be more speculative than accurate in certain areas. A moderate pullback of 15% to 30% in leading AI names would not be surprising.\n\nIt did say that a complete bubble collapse is less likely, however. AI already has real commercial value, and early gains are showing up across industries. Just like the early days of the smartphone, there may be volatility, but the long-term trajectory remains positive.\nWhat Investors Should Focus On Now Everyday investors should expect volatility. The smartest bet is to keep a diversified portfolio , balanced allocation and long-term time horizon to have the best protections.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n10 Kirkland Products Costco Quietly Raised Prices on -- and Where To Buy Instead\n5 Reliable Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Winter 2025\n9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Powerball Jackpot: $1.7 Billion Could Buy 131,645 Ounces of Gold, 3.15 Million Nvidia Shares And More — 10 After‑Tax Spending Ideas\n\nChris Katje\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:46 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThe Powerball drawing set for Wednesday, Dec. 24, is currently the fourth-largest U.S. lottery jackpot ever at $1.7 billion.\nHere's a look at the latest Powerball jackpot and some items you can win if you are the lucky person with the winning ticket.\nThe Powerball Jackpot: At $1.7 billion, the current Powerball drawing is the fourth-largest U.S. jackpot in history and the second-largest of 2025 . The jackpot could grow to be the highest jackpot of 2025, and without a winner drawn on Wednesday, could quickly become the largest jackpot ever.\n\nThe odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292.2 million. The overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 24.9 tickets.\nDon't Miss:\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 .\n$100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\nLottery players can purchase tickets for $2 each in more than 40 U.S. states, choosing to pick their own numbers or receive a random selection. Five numbers between 1 and 69 are selected, along with a Powerball number 1 to 26. To win the Powerball, a player has to match all six balls in the drawing.\nThe drawing takes place around 10:59 p.m. ET on Mondays, Wednesday and Saturdays. If no ticket matches all six numbers, the jackpot increases for the next drawing.\n\nLottery Winnings: Winners of large jackpots can receive a lump-sum cash payment or be paid the full amount over 29 years in 30 payments. One payment is made upfront and additional payments each year go up by 5% to fight inflation.\nThe cash payout is lower than the full payout over 29 years. The current cash payout listed on the Powerball website is $781.3 million.\nA winner will have to pay federal taxes on the winnings and will be responsible for state taxes depending on where they reside.\nThe IRS takes a 24% withholding on winnings over $5,000. This means that the cash payout for Wednesday's Powerball jackpot would be $593.8 million based on a lump sum cash option after the 24% federal taxes are taken out.\nThe winner could choose to save the money, invest it, or spend it on various items.\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nHere's a look at 10 items that could be considered.\n1. S&P 500: If a winner decides to invest the money, they could consider investing in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY ), which tracks the broad-based S&P 500 Index. The $593.8 million could purchase 863,583.48 shares of SPY with the winnings. The S&P 500 averaged annual returns of 10% over the last 30 years, which would be a better return than the 5% return on choosing the 29 years of payouts.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Cryptocurrency: A potential investment for the winner could be to put the money in cryptocurrency, which is often more volatile than the stock market. The winnings could be split between three popular cryptocurrencies of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC ), Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE )and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH ). The winnings would turn into 2,251.82 BTC, 1,524,910,118.10 DOGE and 67,191.25 ETH based on prices at the time of writing.\n\n3. Investing with the Oracle of Omaha: Legendary investor Warren Buffett has been one of the top stock pickers of the last 50 years. While Buffett would tell the winner to put their money into bonds or index funds to preserve wealth, the winner could buy 1,188,503.26 B shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK ) (NYSE: BRK ). Of course, Buffett is stepping down as CEO at the end of the year, which may change the future returns.\n4. Nvidia Stock : One of the top-performing stocks of the last 10 years is NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ), which is currently the most valuable company in the world, valued at more than $4.5 trillion. Nvidia could remain a market leader for years to come, making it a potential investment idea for someone over the next 29 years. The $593.8 million could purchase 3,151,637.39 shares of Nvidia based on current prices.\n\n5. Magnificent 7 Stocks: One of the popular investment themes in recent years has been buying shares of the Magnificent Seven stocks. The seven components of the popular index are Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) , Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META ), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Nvidia and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ).\nHere's a look at how many shares of each the winnings could buy, when split equally seven ways to $84,828,571.43:\nAAPL: 312,122.20 shares\nAMZN: 366,113.82shares\nGOOGL: 269,759.50 shares\nMETA: 127,761.57 shares\nMSFT: 174,271.86 shares\nNVDA: 450,233.91 shares\nTSLA: 175,617.60 shares\nOr an investor could put the lottery winnings into the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (BATS: MAGS ), which tracks the seven stocks.\n\nSee Also: Buffett's Secret to Wealth?

Tesla Vehicles: Vehicles from the EV leader are popular with many investors and could be a purchase for a lottery winner looking to flex their winnings in the form of a massive collection and to give away vehicles to family members and friends. The Model Y has a starting price of around $39,990. This means the lottery winner could purchase 14,848 Model Y vehicles, enough to keep and give away.\n7. Real Estate: Another popular investing option for lottery winnings could be real estate. The average home price in the U.S. is $359,241 according to Zillow Group. The winnings could buy 1,652 average-priced homes in the U.S. The winner could hold the homes to gain value over the years or choose to rent them out. Benzinga has a guide on how non-lottery winners can invest in real estate here.\n\n8. Sports Teams: For the ultra-wealthy, buying a professional sports team has been a way to preserve and gain wealth. The after-tax lottery winnings would not be enough to purchase a team in the MLB, NBA, NFL, or NHL. The winner could look to buy a minority stake in a team and gain wealth over time or could dip their toes into ownership in soccer with an MLS team. The New York Red Bulls, Nashville SC, Houston Dynamo FC, FC Dallas, San Jose Earthquakes, New England Revolution, Chicago Fire FC, Real Salt Lake, Orlando City SC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC, CF Montreal and Colorado Rapids are all listed with team valuations under $593.8 million by Forbes , with valuations ranging from $580 million down to $415 million.\n9. Gold: Another popular investment option over the years has been to buy gold , which hit new all-time highs in 2025. The winner of the lottery, who chooses a cash lump sum, could buy 131,645.46 ounces of gold.\n\n10. Superyacht: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is one of the wealthiest people in the world and had no problem shelling out $500 million for a superyacht. The billionaire also spends $25 million annually on the boat and its operation. The winner could buy a superyacht that isn't quite as large or extravagant as the one owned by Bezos.\nThis article is not intended as investment advice.\nThis article was previously published by Benzinga and has been updated.\nRead Next: From Moxy Hotels to $12B in Real Estate — The Firm Behind NYC's Trendiest Properties Is Letting Individual Investors In.\nPhoto: Mehaniq/Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump, giving Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin, Reuters\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:03 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 a.m. Pacific Time on Aug. 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia, AMD, OpenAI, Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\n\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThe transition to Tan comes as Intel is in the middle of an announced $28 billion project to construct microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany . While the factories were originally slated to begin operations this year, that has been delayed to 2030 at the earliest as Intel seeks buyers for the chips those factories are to produce .\n\nStory continues\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 minutes in the Oval Office Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms - Walden International and Walden Catalyst - did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies, including coming to Intel's formal groundbreaking ceremony in Licking County in 2022 .\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nIntel's venture capitalist CEO Born in Malaysia to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger , and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA 'lifeline' for Intel So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Is AMD’s Soaring AI Fueled Share Price Still Justified in 2025?\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:32 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nIf you are wondering whether Advanced Micro Devices at around $215 a share is still a smart buy or if the big gains are largely behind it, you are not alone. This is exactly the question we are going to unpack.\nThe stock is up 8.5% over the last week and 78.3% year to date, building on a 70.3% gain over the past year and a 243.7% return over three years that has reset expectations and risk perceptions for investors.\nRecent headlines have focused on AMD expanding its presence in artificial intelligence and data center chips, including aggressive pushes to challenge Nvidia in AI accelerators and deepen partnerships with major cloud providers. At the same time, ongoing coverage around chip supply chains, US semiconductor policy, and competitive dynamics in GPUs and CPUs has kept AMD firmly in the spotlight and helped fuel the latest moves.\nOn our checklist of undervaluation signals, AMD currently scores a 3/6 valuation score . This means half of the tests suggest the market may be underpricing some aspects of its fundamentals. Next we will break down how different valuation methods look at those signals before circling back to a more nuanced way of thinking about what AMD is really worth.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices delivered 70.3% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Semiconductor industry.\nApproach 1: Advanced Micro Devices Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth today by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and then discounting those amounts back to a present value.\nFor Advanced Micro Devices, the latest twelve month free cash flow is about $5.6 billion. Analysts see that rising sharply, with projections stepping up to roughly $7.2 billion in 2026 and $12.4 billion in 2027, before extrapolated estimates climb further to around $27.9 billion by 2029 and over $59 billion by 2035. Simply Wall St uses a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, combining these analyst forecasts with longer term growth assumptions to map out the next decade of cash flows.\n\nWhen those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of roughly $302 per share. Compared with a current price near $215, this implies AMD trades at about a 28.8% discount to its DCF based fair value. This suggests potential upside if the projected cash flow path occurs as modeled.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Advanced Micro Devices is undervalued by 28.8%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 904 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\n\nStory Continues\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Advanced Micro Devices.\nApproach 2: Advanced Micro Devices Price vs Earnings For profitable companies like Advanced Micro Devices, the Price to Earnings ratio is a useful way to think about valuation because it directly links what investors pay for each share to the profits the business is currently generating. In general, faster growth and lower risk justify a higher PE, while slower growth and higher uncertainty should command a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nAMD currently trades at around 111.8x earnings, well above the broader semiconductor industry average of about 36.5x and also richer than its peer group average near 58.8x. Simply Wall St goes a step further with its Fair Ratio, an estimate of what a normal PE should be for AMD given its earnings growth outlook, profitability, size, industry and risk profile. For AMD, that Fair Ratio sits at roughly 64.8x, which is already demanding but still meaningfully below the current market multiple.\nThis suggests that, even after accounting for AMD short term growth potential and competitive position, the stock trades at a premium to what its fundamentals justify on an earnings basis.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1460 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Advanced Micro Devices Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple framework that lets you turn your view of Advanced Micro Devices into a clear story behind the numbers by connecting your assumptions about future revenue, earnings and margins to a specific fair value estimate.\n\nA Narrative starts with the company story you believe, links that story to a financial forecast, and then translates the forecast into a fair value you can compare with today’s share price to consider whether AMD looks like a buy, a hold, or a sell.\nOn Simply Wall St, Narratives are an easy, accessible tool inside the Community page, where millions of investors share different AMD outlooks that update automatically as new news, earnings and guidance come in, so the stories and the numbers stay current without you having to rebuild your model.\nFor example, one bullish AMD Narrative on the platform assumes rapid AI data center adoption and arrives at a fair value near $362 per share, while a more cautious Narrative, focused on export controls and margin pressure, lands closer to $137, showing how the same company can justify very different decisions depending on the story you believe.\n\nFor Advanced Micro Devices however we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Advanced Micro Devices Narratives:\n🐂 Advanced Micro Devices Bull Case\nFair value estimate: $283.57 per share\nImplied undervaluation vs current price: 23.9%\nAssumed annual revenue growth: 34.73%\nFrames AMD as a long term AI and data center winner, with multiyear accelerator and CPU ramps driving sustained double digit revenue and margin expansion.\nBuilds in rising profitability, with margins moving above 20% as AI, data center, and adaptive computing scale, while operating leverage improves over time.\nSees recent AI supercomputer and hyperscaler agreements as catalysts that justify a premium multiple and a fair value well above the current share price.\n\n🐻 Advanced Micro Devices Bear Case\nFair value estimate: $193.68 per share\nImplied overvaluation vs current price: 11.0%\nAssumed annual revenue growth: 18.84%\nHighlights intense competition from Nvidia, Intel, ARM based designs, and custom silicon, which could limit AMD AI share gains and pressure pricing.\nStresses execution, supply chain, and geopolitical risks, including reliance on TSMC and export restrictions, as potential brakes on growth and margins.\nArgues that while AMD has strong long term AI and data center potential, today’s valuation already prices in much of that upside, leaving less room for error.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Advanced Micro Devices?

      "Content": "Nvidia makes its biggest purchase ever\n\nTobi Opeyemi Amure\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:07 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nAccording to CNBC , Nvidia has agreed to pay about $20 billion in cash for Groq, a specialist in AI accelerator chips used to power inference—the stage where trained AI models actually answer questions, generate text, or drive real-time applications. Alex Davis, CEO of investment firm Disruptive, which led Groq’s latest financing round, told CNBC that the deal came together quickly, months after Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of roughly $6.9 billion.\n\nDisruptive has invested more than $500 million in Groq since its founding in 2016, and Groq is now expected to notify investors of the Nvidia acquisition as details are finalized. The acquisition reportedly includes Groq’s core chip design and related assets, while excluding the company’s early-stage Groq Cloud business, which has been offering developers API-based access to its hardware.\nFrom Nvidia’s side, the financial capacity is clear. The chip giant ended October with around $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up sharply from roughly $13.3 billion at the start of 2023, powered by an explosion in demand for its AI GPUs. An all-cash structure means no dilution for existing shareholders, but it also telegraphs Nvidia’s conviction that securing Groq’s technology will pay off over the long term, even at a steep premium.\n\nWhy this is Nvidia’s biggest acquisition ever This Groq deal instantly becomes Nvidia’s largest acquisition by total value, surpassing its $6.9 billion purchase of Israeli networking company Mellanox in 2019. Mellanox gave Nvidia high-speed networking and interconnect technology that became crucial to building out large AI clusters, effectively turning Nvidia from a GPU vendor into a full-stack data center platform provider.\nNvidia has tried to go even bigger before. In 2020, it announced plans to buy British chip designer Arm from SoftBank for a combination of cash and stock worth up to $40 billion, a move that would have reshaped the global semiconductor landscape. That deal collapsed under regulatory pressure in 2022, after authorities in the U.K., European Union, and U.S. raised concerns that Nvidia could gain too much influence over licensing of Arm’s CPU designs.\n\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nThe Groq acquisition is smaller in dollar terms than the failed Arm attempt but is still huge for a single-technology target. By spending nearly three times Groq’s last valuation, Nvidia is signaling that inference hardware is not just a side business but a core pillar of where it wants AI revenue to grow next.\n\nStory Continues\nThe AI inference race heats up The AI chip market has two big buckets: training and inference. Training is where massive models are built, often using thousands of Nvidia GPUs in data centers run by companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. Inference is where those models are actually used for search, chatbots, copilots, AI video, and any application that needs fast, repeated responses at scale.​\n\nGroq has positioned itself as a pure-play inference specialist. Analyst-focused coverage from outlets like AInvest says Groq’s hardware can deliver extremely low-latency performance, with some marketing pointing to speeds up to twice that of rival systems on select workloads while maintaining accuracy. That performance promise, along with a simplified programming model, made Groq an attractive option for developers who wanted something faster and more predictable than general-purpose GPUs for production workloads.\nRelated: Controversial Nvidia rival may finally IPO\nRegulatory scrutiny and antitrust risks Because Nvidia already sits at the center of the AI hardware world, any major deal it does is going to raise eyebrows in Washington, Brussels, London, and Beijing. Reuters notes that regulators have closely watched Nvidia’s expanding role in AI compute, and the Groq deal is expected to face antitrust review in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nThe key questions will likely center on whether acquiring Groq significantly reduces competition in AI inference hardware and whether Nvidia could use control over Groq’s chips to disadvantage rivals or foreclose alternatives for cloud providers and enterprises. Nvidia has argued in past transactions that integrating acquired technologies into its stack benefits customers by improving performance and innovation, but regulators have become more sensitive to vertical consolidation in critical digital infrastructure.\nFor investors, the risk is not only that regulators could block the transaction (as happened with Arm) but also that they might impose remedies. Those could include requirements around licensing, interoperability, or access to Groq’s technology for third parties at fair terms, which might reduce some of the strategic upside Nvidia is paying for.\n\nWhat it means for investors and everyday savers If you own Nvidia, this acquisition tells you a few important things about where the company sees the puck going.\nFirst, Nvidia expects AI demand to shift from a build-out phase, where companies scramble to train models, into a deployment phase where inference workloads explode across industries and devices. Owning specialized inference technology becomes a way to capture that second wave of spending and to keep customers from defecting to rivals that pitch cheaper or more efficient hardware for production use.\n\nSecond, Nvidia is leaning into an ecosystem strategy rather than a product-only strategy. By combining GPUs, networking (from Mellanox), software (CUDA and related libraries), and specialized accelerators (Groq’s chips), Nvidia can offer end-to-end solutions that are harder for competitors like AMD , Intel, or cloud providers’ custom chips to displace. For the average investor, that looks like a moat—but it also concentrates risk in one company.\nThird, consolidation at the chip level can eventually show up in your wallet. If Nvidia can use Groq’s technology to make inference cheaper and more efficient, that could lower the cost for startups and enterprises to deliver AI services, which in turn could mean more competition and better tools for consumers and small investors. But if fewer independent chip options lead to higher prices or stricter vendor lock-in, cloud and software providers may pass on higher infrastructure costs, and some innovation could get squeezed out at the edges.\n\nFor long-term savers, the practical takeaway is that AI infrastructure is becoming a core part of the market story, not just a tech side plot. Nvidia’s willingness to spend $20 billion in cash on Groq reinforces the idea that controlling compute is like owning the toll road on the AI superhighway.\nRelated: Nvidia’s $4 trillion moment came with a quiet warning sign\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 25, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI\n\nOihyun Kim\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:53 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nBLK\n\nSSNLF\n\nNVIDIA has agreed to pay approximately $20 billion to acquire assets from artificial intelligence chip startup Groq, marking the company's largest transaction on record and continuing its strategy of absorbing potential competitors before they can challenge its market dominance.\nThe chipmaker's latest licensing deal mirrors a similar transaction just three months ago, reinforcing the narrative that decentralized AI infrastructure may offer the only alternative to Nvidia's growing dominance.\n\nThreefold Premium in Three Months with Trump Jr. Connection The deal closed just three months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation—a round that included BlackRock, Samsung, Cisco, and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. serves as a partner. Nvidia is acquiring all of the company's assets substantially, except its cloud computing business, though Groq framed the transaction as a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"\n\nGroq CEO Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who helped create the search giant's Tensor Processing Unit, will join Nvidia along with president Sunny Madra and other senior executives. The startup will continue operating independently under CFO Simon Edwards as its new chief executive.\nA Repeating Playbook The Groq transaction follows a pattern Nvidia established just three months earlier. In September, the company paid over $900 million to hire Enfabrica's CEO and employees while licensing the startup's technology. Both deals use licensing structures rather than outright acquisitions, potentially avoiding the antitrust scrutiny that blocked Nvidia's $40 billion bid for Arm Holdings in 2022.\nThe Kobeissi Letter summarized Nvidia's approach bluntly: \"We will buy you before you can compete with us.\"\n\nTechnical Edge and Competitive Pressure Groq's Language Processing Unit uses on-chip SRAM rather than external DRAM, enabling what the company claims is up to 10x better energy efficiency. This architecture excels at real-time inference but limits model size—a tradeoff Nvidia can now explore within its broader ecosystem.\nThe timing is notable. Google recently unveiled its seventh-generation TPU, codenamed Ironwood, and released Gemini 3, trained entirely on TPUs, to top benchmark rankings. Nvidia responded on X: \"We're delighted by Google's success... NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry—it's the only platform that runs every AI model.\" When incumbents start issuing such reassurance statements, competitive pressure is clearly mounting.\n\nStory Continues\nImplications for Decentralized AI While the deal has no direct impact on cryptocurrency markets, it reinforces the narrative driving decentralized AI computing projects. Platforms like io.net position themselves as alternatives to centralized AI infrastructure.\n\"People can put their own supply onto a network, whether that's data centers or yourself with your laptop, contributing your available GPU power, and getting fairly compensated for it using tokenomics,\" Jack Collier, io.net's Chief Growth Officer, told BeInCrypto. The platform claims enterprise clients, including Leonardo.ai and UC Berkeley, have achieved significant cost savings.\n\nHowever, the gap between narrative and reality remains wide. Nvidia's acquisition of Groq's low-latency technology further extends its technical lead, making it harder for any alternative to offer competitive performance.\nThe transaction also raises questions about independent AI chip development. Cerebras Systems, another Nvidia competitor preparing an IPO, may eventually face similar pressure. Whether it can remain independent or succumb to Nvidia's financial gravity remains to be seen.\nRead original story Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI by Oihyun Kim at beincrypto.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This Dividend-Yielding Tech Stock Looks a ‘Compelling Buy’ for 2026 After 2 Years of Underperformance\n\nMohit Oberoi\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:30 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nWith year-to-date (YTD) gains of just about 15%, Microsoft (MSFT) is underperforming both the broad-based S&P 500 Index ($SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX). The Satya Nadella-led company underperformed last year as well, and its gains of 12% in 2024 paled in comparison to its tech peers as well as the broader markets.\nIncidentally, the “Magnificent 7,” which led the market rally from the front in 2023 and 2024, did not have the best of years, and none of them made it to the list of top 20 gainers in the S&P 500 Index in 2025. The group’s collective price action has been below par, and only Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are outperforming their average S&P 500 Index peer by a noticeable margin. Meanwhile, after the 2025 underperformance, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities—a known perma tech bull—sees MSFT stock rising to $625 next year and termed it a “compelling buy.” Notably, while tech stocks aren’t really known for their dividends and many don’t pay one in the first place, Microsoft’s dividend yield of 0.75% is the highest among Magnificent 7 stocks. It is on the verge of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nThis Dividend Stock Just Scored an FDA Win. Should You Buy Shares Now?\nThis Blue-Chip Stock Topped the Dow Jones in 2025. Should You Buy Its Shares Here?\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWhy Did Microsoft Underperform in 2025? Microsoft’s 2025 underperformance has largely been due to concerns over its burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) capex. The company, which previously said that its capex growth would fall in the fiscal year 2026, now sees it going up instead. The Windows parent splurged almost $35 billion towards capex in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, which ended in September, a record for the company.\n\nTo be sure, rising AI capex is not a Microsoft thing, and Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet have also bumped up spending amid the AI arms race. Barring Alphabet, which entered 2025 with tepid expectations and ended up impressing with its financial performance, the other three are underperforming this year. I find an Alphabet connection to Microsoft’s underperformance. While Gemini gaining ground at OpenAI’s cost helped propel GOOG stock higher, it put pressure on Microsoft, which is OpenAI’s biggest investor and a proxy play on the world’s most valuable unlisted startup.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft Stock's 2026 Forecast Despite the 2025 underperformance, the analyst community is not giving up on Microsoft, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 48 analysts polled by Barchart . MSFT stock trades even below the Street-low target price of $490, while the mean target price of $629.23 is almost 30% higher than current price levels.\n\nNotably, Ives’ target price of $625 is similar to the consensus price target and the same as Wolfe Research, which lowered MSFT’s target price by $50 earlier this month. Looking at the recent action, DA Davidson and Jefferies maintained their bullish bets on Microsoft this month while maintaining their respective target prices of $675 and $650.\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy for 2026? I remain constructive on MSFT stock heading into 2026. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30.6x, which I find balanced. The P/E-to-growth (PEG) multiples do look a bit ugly at 1.82x, but that’s got to do with AI capex hitting the company’s profits in the form of higher capex. “Big Short” Michael Burry’s controversial views on tech companies’ inflating the useful life of AI chips notwithstanding, companies like Microsoft are set to face higher depreciation expenses over the next couple of years.\n\nThere is a lot to like about Microsoft at these levels, though. The stock is a defensive play with a well-diversified business. The company’s Windows and Office business would continue to benefit from the uptick in PC sales, led by an aging base of installed devices and the advent of AI PCs. The ending of Windows 10 support would also help keep that segment buoyed, as more users would feel urged to upgrade to Windows 11.\nMoreover, AI is fueling demand for subscriptions, which would add to Microsoft’s topline. The cloud business is particularly growing at a brisk pace, and Microsoft is closing the gap with market leader Amazon. Specifically, during their recent earnings call, Microsoft said that its commercial cloud remaining performance obligations (RPO) soared 50% to $400 billion at the end of September, with a weighted average duration of just two years.\nOverall, while I haven’t been a permabull on MSFT, I have used the dips to add to my positions, something I repeated this time around as well. At these levels, I find MSFT stock a decent buy and see it delivering double-digit returns next year.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: MSFT, GOOG, NVDA, AMZN, META.

      "Content": "Nvidia’s $4 trillion moment came with a quiet warning sign\n\nFaizan Farooque\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:07 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTCEHY\n\n3905.T\n\nNvidia is hurtling towards the end of 2025, after a very successful year, during which it redefined what it means to be a chip giant during the AI boom. Much of the reason for its success this year is its much-vaunted hardware.\nBut the next set of headlines isn't just about chips that are faster. It's about where the chips go and whether Nvidia can change the direction of the software world it rules.\n\nThe Nvidia chips China wasn’t supposed to touch just showed up anyway U.S. export restrictions were designed to keep Nvidia’s most advanced AI hardware out of China.\nInstead, they've changed demand into a new shape that's harder to control, easier to grow, and already full of cash.\nA Financial Times report says Tencent is acquiring Nvidia's advanced Blackwell chips through a data center outside of Osaka, run by Datasection, a Japanese company that switched from marketing to AI data centers.\n\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nTencent will gain access to a large number of Datasection's 15,000 Nvidia Blackwell processors without the chips ever being sent to China, per people privy to the matter.\nThe \"neocloud\" model suggests you shouldn't buy GPUs, but instead rent them.\nAnd the demand is clear, as Datasection CEO Norihiko Ishihara notes.\nA $272 million check says the business isn’t a side hustle The numbers in the FT reporting are the kind that transcend “interesting” and start looking “systemic.”\nDatasection agreed to pay $272 million for 5,000 Nvidia B200 chips for its Osaka facility, according to the FT. This was backed by a $406 million, three-year contract linked to a major customer relationship.\n\nThen came the next swing: an $800 million, three-year deal for a Sydney data center that will hold tens of thousands of Nvidia's newer B300 chips. Datasection says the first 10,000 B300s will cost $521 million.\nThis is not the move of a company that believes demand is at its peak.\nRather, if you think demand is just starting to pick up and you want to be the toll booth, this is how you build a workaround.\nWashington’s rulebook changed, and the timing is the whole story The Financial Times also said that laws from the Biden administration were going to remove the loophole that made this offshore leasing arrangement possible, but President Donald Trump canceled those plans in May. The FT stated that Datasection promptly finished its Osaka agreement after that.\n\nStory Continues\nPresident Trump's stance on AI has already affected Nvidia in other ways.\nRelated: A $1 trillion IPO looms, and Amazon may have just locked in early\nAn AI action plan from late July lifted limits on Nvidia's H200 processors and made it easier for AI data centers to obtain permits. It also said Nvidia temporarily became the first firm to have a market capitalization of $4 trillion on July 9.\n\nAll of that means investors need to face the fact that Nvidia's policy risk isn't a one-way street. It can get tighter, looser, or turn, and new business models will fill in the gaps.\nNow comes the move that hits Nvidia where it actually lives The following narrative is about why Nvidia hardware is the default in the first place, whereas the \"neocloud\" tale is about where Nvidia hardware can be used.\nAnd this is where Nvidia's problems will worsen in the long run.\nGoogle is working on a project called TorchTPU that will make it easier for Google's TPUs to run PyTorch, Reuters reports. The idea is to make users less dependent on Nvidia's CUDA environment.\n\nRelated: Oracle just made a power move Wall Street can’t ignore\nGoogle can make hardware all day long. The developer experience is what really sets it apart.\nThat's why one sentence from Reuters is important not as a demand indicator, but as a positioning signal: “We are seeing massive, accelerating demand for both our TPU and GPU infrastructure,” a Google Cloud spokesperson told the news agency.\nThat's not a business giving up on the market; it's a corporation telling customers, \"You have choices, and we're going to make them easy for you.\"\nWhy Meta’s involvement should make Nvidia nervous The Reuters article also indicated that Google is working with Meta, the company that runs PyTorch, to speed up the TorchTPU project.\nThat's a major matter, since it goes after Nvidia's edge from the inside.\nDevelopers don't want to have to rewrite stacks. They want the easiest way to go.\nIf PyTorch works well with TPUs, the \"switching cost\" penalty that keeps Nvidia's profits safe becomes smaller — not in a day, but enough that procurement teams start to ask tougher questions, and enough that the top customers can get better prices when they negotiate.\n\nFinancial impact: The numbers show this battlefield's huge scale This is when \"official records\" come in handy: They tie the hype to real money.\nNvidia is making a lot of money from data centers Nvidia's financial report for the third quarter said the firm made a record $57.0 billion in sales. This included a record $51.2 billion in Data Center revenue.\nThat's the engine room that makes the whole AI trade work.\nRelated: US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding\nAnd Nvidia's papers reveal that China is still a big part of the story. In its annual report for fiscal year 2025, Nvidia noted that its Data Center revenue in China rose, but was still \"well below\" pre-export-control levels as a share of overall Data Center revenue.\n\nWhen overseas companies step in to meet Chinese demand, it's not just politics; it's also a straight channel to Nvidia's most crucial development area.\nGoogle Cloud is stacking backlog like a war chest Alphabet’s official 10-Q for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2025, and it reported $157.7 billion in remaining performance obligations (revenue backlog), “primarily related to Google Cloud,” with just over 55% expected to be recognized over the next 24 months.\nThat's the kind of backlog that pays for long fights, like making TPUs more appealing to PyTorch devs.\n\nMeta’s spending tells you this isn’t theory Meta is projected to spend between $70 billion and $72 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, which includes payments on finance leases.\nMeta doesn't want to be stuck with one vendor forever; thus, they don't spend too much money. If TorchTPU makes things easier, Meta has every reason to keep pushing the ecosystem away from relying on one supplier.\n\nThe market doesn’t need Nvidia to “lose” for this to matter This is the portion that investors often miss: If Nvidia can maintain making money, it could still have trouble with margins if:\nHuge buyers have real choices.\nThe costs of switching software go down.\nOffshore demand channels become more responsive to political changes.\nThat's how you get rid of dominance, not destroy it.\n\nWhat to watch next for Nvidia Here's what to watch to determine whether something Nvidia-related is just noise.\nDoes the \"neocloud\" paradigm go beyond Japan and Australia to other places where big data centers are being built?\nDoes TorchTPU come with a true developer experience (documentation, tools, and performance that are the same as other projects), or is it still a project?\nAre the leading AI consumers beginning to discuss multi-stack publicly, even though Nvidia remains their primary supplier?\n\nThe AI economy still depends on Nvidia.\nBut when China can rent Nvidia computers from other countries and Google can make \"not-Nvidia\" easier to use in PyTorch, the next chapter is no longer just a story about demand.\nIt turns into a leverage narrative. And those are always more of a mess.\nRelated: Box office is booming in 2025 but Netflix’s $82.7 billion surprise raises alarms\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 24, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Nvidia, joining Big Tech deal spree, to license Groq technology, hire executives\n\nStephen Nellis\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GROQ.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nCESY.PVT\n\nBy Stephen Nellis\nDec 24 (Reuters) - Nvidia has agreed to license chip technology from startup Groq and hire away its CEO, a veteran of Alphabet's Google, Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday.\nThe deal follows a familiar pattern ​in recent years where the world's biggest technology firms pay large sums in deals with promising startups to take their ‌technology and talent but stop short of formally acquiring the target.\n\nGroq specializes in what is known as inference, where artificial intelligence models that have already been trained respond ‌to requests from users. While Nvidia dominates the market for training AI models, it faces much more competition in inference, where traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices have aimed to challenge it as well as startups such as Groq and Cerebras Systems.\nNvidia has agreed to a \"non-exclusive\" license to Groq's technology, Groq said. It said its founder Jonathan Ross, who helped Google start its AI chip program, as well as Groq ⁠President Sunny Madra and other members of its ‌engineering team, will join Nvidia.\nA person close to Nvidia confirmed the licensing agreement.\nGroq did not disclose financial details of the deal. CNBC reported that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Groq for $20 billion in cash, but neither ‍Nvidia nor Groq commented on the report. Groq said in its blog post that it will continue to operate as an independent company with Simon Edwards as CEO and that its cloud business will continue operating.\n\nIn similar recent deals, Microsoft 's top AI executive came through a $650 million deal with a startup that ​was billed as a licensing fee, and Meta spent $15 billion to hire Scale AI's CEO without acquiring the entire firm. Amazon ‌hired away founders from Adept AI, and Nvidia did a similar deal this year. The deals have faced scrutiny by regulators, though none has yet been unwound.\n\"Antitrust would seem to be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive (even as Groq’s leadership and, we would presume, technical talent move over to Nvidia),\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday after Groq's announcement. And Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's \"relationship with the Trump administration appears among the strongest of ⁠the key US tech companies.\"\n\nGroq more than doubled its valuation to $6.9 billion from $2.8 ​billion in August last year, following a $750 million funding round in September.\nGroq is ​one of a number of upstarts that do not use external high-bandwidth memory chips, freeing them from the memory crunch affecting the global chip industry. The approach, which uses a form of on-chip memory called SRAM, helps ‍speed up interactions with chatbots and ⁠other AI models but also limits the size of the model that can be served.\n\nStory Continues\nGroq's primary rival in the approach is Cerebras Systems, which Reuters this month reported plans to go public as soon as next year. Groq and Cerebras have ⁠signed large deals in the Middle East.\nNvidia's Huang spent much of his biggest keynote speech of 2025 arguing that Nvidia would be able to maintain its lead as ‌AI markets shift from training to inference.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese ‌in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, Matthew Lewis and William Mallard)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia to license Groq technology, hire executives\n\nStephen Nellis\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:06 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GROQ.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMD\n\nCESY.PVT\n\nBy Stephen Nellis\nDec 24 (Reuters) - Nvidia has agreed to license chip technology from startup Groq and hire away its CEO, a veteran of Alphabet's Google, Groq said ​in a blog post on Wednesday.\nGroq specializes in what is known as inference, ‌where artificial intelligence models that have already been trained respond to requests from users. While Nvidia dominates the market for ‌training AI models, it faces much more competition in inference, where traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices have aimed to challenge it as well as startups such as Groq and Cerebras Systems.\n\nGroq said that Nvidia had agreed to a \"non-exclusive\" license to Groq's technology. Groq said that its founder ⁠Jonathan Ross, who helped Google ‌start its AI chip program, as well as Groq President Sunny Madra and other members of its engineering team will join Nvidia.\nA person close to ‍Nvidia confirmed the licensing agreement.\nGroq did not disclose financial details of the deal. CNBC earlier reported that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Groq for $20 billion in cash, but neither Nvidia nor Groq commented on the ​report. Groq said in its blog post that it will continue to operate as an ‌independent company with Simon Edwards as CEO and that its cloud business will continue operating.\nGroq more than doubled its valuation to $6.9 billion, from $2.8 billion in August last year, following a $750 million funding round in September.\n\nGroq is one of a number of upstarts that do not use external high-bandwidth memory chips, which free them from the memory crunch affecting the global chip industry. The approach, ⁠which uses a form of on-chip memory called SRAM, ​helps speed up interactions with chatbots and other AI ​models but also limits the size of the model that can be served.\nGroq's primary rival in the approach is Cerebras Systems, which Reuters earlier this month ‍reported plans to go ⁠public as soon as next year. Both Groq and Cerebras have signed large deals in the Middle East.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang spent much of his biggest keynote speech of ⁠2025 arguing that Nvidia would be able to maintain its lead as AI markets shift from training to inference.\n(Reporting ‌by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in ‌Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Matthew Lewis)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "A Big China Catalyst Could Be Coming for AMD Stock in 2026. Should You Buy Shares Now?\n\nPathikrit Bose\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 11:42 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nBABA\n\nNVDA\n\nIt looks like after Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is next in line to rehash a deal to resume the sales of its chips to China. After CEO Lisa Su had a meeting with China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao in Beijing last week, reports have emerged that the country's tech giant Alibaba (BABA) is mulling ordering some of AMD's MI308 GPUs. According to this report, Alibaba could order between 40,000 and 50,000 of these GPUs. This could imply a revenue windfall in the range of $600 million to $1.25 billion for AMD.\n\nBut, before one jumps the gun over here, there are some unpleasant facts that one must consider. Firstly, though the U.S. has approved the sale of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, the Chinese regulators have not yet given their approval. So, the chances of AMD getting approval are also low at this point. Secondly, Alibaba is itself a chipmaker, although its chips are more of the ASIC kind rather than AMD's general-purpose chips. This means the latter has broader use cases than Alibaba's chips, which are optimized for its native cloud ecosystems and inference workloads.\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\n$800 for Tesla Stock Could Be Reality in 2026.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\n\nHowever, amid this development, where does AMD stand as an investment option now? It should be pretty high. Let's find out why.\nAMD's Robust Financials With a market cap of about $350 billion, AMD seems like a minnow in front of its larger peer, Nvidia. However, on the basis of share price performance, the AMD stock, with a rally of nearly 78%, has outperformed Nvidia's uptick of 37.1% this year by a considerable margin. But AMD is not just a short-term phenomenon; the company has been growing its revenue and earnings at a healthy clip for a while now.\nAMD has strung together a good five-year run, pushing revenue and earnings higher at compound rates of 29.94% and 28.93%. Notably, the most recent quarter fit right into that pattern, coming in stronger than Wall Street figures.\nQ3 sales hit $9.25 billion, 36% above the year-earlier mark. The core data center segment reported sales of $4.3 billion, implying a 22% growth from last year. Client and gaming put up the biggest jump, however, rising 73% on an annual basis to $4 billion.\nMeanwhile, EPS moved up by 30% in the same period to $1.20, outpacing the $1.17 consensus and stretching the company's run of beats to four quarters straight.\n\nStory Continues\nCash flow stood out as well. Operating cash flow shot up to $1.8 billion, almost three times the $628 million posted in the same quarter last year. Overall, AMD wrapped up September with $4.81 billion in cash, easily topping the $873 million in short-term debt and $2.35 billion in longer-term debt.\nHowever, AMD continues to trade at heady valuations when compared to the industry averages. Its forward P/E, P/S, and P/CF of 54.21, 10.30, and 54.12 are all higher than the sector medians of 24.37, 3.40, and 20.36, respectively.\n\nOptimism Abounds Since my previous analysis on AMD, previewing the company's Financial Analyst Day event on Nov. 11, the company's stock is down 10.3%. However, the case for investing in it may have only gotten stronger amid all the ambitious targets the management aims to hit in the coming years. First up is CEO Lisa Su's assertion that the data center market is set to reach a trillion dollars by 2030, an increase from her earlier projection of a $500 billion market by 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, on a company-specific basis, AMD has targeted a revenue CAGR of >35%, operating margins of >35%, and an annual EPS of $20 in the next 3-5 years, with data center AI revenue exceeding 80% CAGR in the same period. The targets may seem a bit steep, but Lisa Su has walked the walk on many occasions for more than a decade now, with the share price jumping by more than 80 times in her tenure, creating enormous wealth for shareholders.\nMoreover, AMD's GPUs aren't the only thing picking up speed; the full stack around them is growing fast, heading toward complete rack-level setups like Helios, MI400, and MI450. Software is keeping pace, too, with ROCm 7 making it easier to move workloads between systems. Notably, the MI500 lineup is already slated for 2027, so the roadmap looks loaded for years.\n\nOutside pure accelerators, the upcoming “Venice” CPUs and AMD's networking gear open up fresh growth lanes inside data centers.\nIn the bigger picture, what really matters is how AMD has spread its bets across platforms. CPUs, GPUs, adaptive chips, and networking all connect like parts of one machine, where nothing stands alone. That setup cuts the risk from any single trend swinging and lets the company shift gears quickly as AI designs change.\nAnalyst Opinion on AMD Stock Thus, analysts have deemed the stock to be a consensus “Moderate Buy,” with a mean target price of $288.87. This indicates an upside potential of about 34.2% from current levels. Out of 43 analysts covering the stock, 28 have a “Strong Buy” rating, three have a “Moderate Buy” rating, and 12 have a “Hold” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

If it doesn't, you know, the market's going to come off its wheels. But having said that, I mean, recently, you can look at, you know, some poster childs of the AI trade. You know, I think of an AI heavy name like an Nvidia. It's well off its 52-week high, Joseph, but this market has continued to grind higher. I'm just curious what you make of that.\n00:23 Joseph\nWell, I think that it it it bolsters the the thesis that the 493 certainly have legs. And I think that I think more broadly, the economy is stronger than people thought it would be when we started the year. Uh, rates are probably lower than uh, lower today than where where we thought they would be. Inflation is probably a tick lower uh, than we thought it would be. So the underlying conditions are somewhat better for the broad market and the broad market has been able to weather as you talked about, the bumps in the road that are inevitable uh uh with regard to the Mag 7 and and the AI trade. So, I think it's positive for the index as we enter 2026 that we've seen some level of broadening. And obviously, we see opportunities uh in the defense sector, uh in in healthcare and selectively in technology as well as as this rally continues to broaden.\n01:21 Speaker A\nYeah, let's get to some of those specific names and picks, Joseph. Uh you like Broadcom here for example. How come? What do you like about C.O. Hock Tan's company specifically? Is it the business model, margins, his AI story?\n01:40 Joseph\nWell, you know, our strategy is to invest in recurring revenue businesses and Broadcom has one of the great uh technology recurring revenue businesses. When you think about how they're positioned with regard to AI, they're really very, very well positioned uh in a category where the product, the GPU is 90% of the cost of the solution. And Broadcom with their XPUs is dramatically reducing the cost of effectuating the outcome that AI provides. And so we think that they'll continue to take market share among the hyperscalers, which is going to drive fantastic revenue growth in the AI business. We see the AI business doubling uh in 2026 for Broadcom and we see it growing very, very rapidly uh after 2026. So long-term, they're very, very well positioned with a product that is that is highly efficient for their customers.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "LIVE\n\nStock market today: Dow, S&P 500 notch records, Nasdaq gains as Wall Street flies high into Christmas holiday\n\nBrett LoGiurato · Front Page Editor\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 10:05 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\nINTC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nGC=F\n\nUS stocks set more records on Wednesday, as Wall Street rode into the Christmas holiday on a high note.\nThe blue chip-focused Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) led the way up, gaining 0.6%, or nearly 300 points, to close at a fresh record high. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) picked up 0.3% to notch its second consecutive record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained a bit under 0.2%.\n\nMarkets closed early on Wednesday for Christmas Eve and are off Thursday for the holiday. Wall Street's bid for a \"Santa Claus\" rally is looking hopeful after the major indexes gained for the fifth consecutive day.\nWall Street's advance over the past several sessions has come despite new economic data that only served to dampen bets for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the near term. US GDP growth stood at 4.3% in the third quarter , according to a first estimate from the government, much higher than forecast as consumer spending held up over the summer.\n\nBut the GDP data led investors to trim bets on a January rate cut from the Fed — just more than 13% now expect that outcome.

It's according to Reuters. Nvidia recently tested the so-called 18A process. This highlights a pain point for Intel amid its struggling manufacturing business. Nvidia, remember, earlier this year invested $5 billion in Intel, but did not commit to using its chip manufacturing services.\n00:36 Speaker A\nUp next, take a look at Tesla as the company faces a new investigation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is launching a probe into the EV Maker's Model 3 compact sedans. This comes amid concerns that emergency door release controls may not be easily accessible or clearly identifiable. The focus of this investigation is on model year 2022 electric vehicles. The US auto safety regulator has also been looking into Tesla's advanced driver assistance system over alleged violations of traffic safety laws.\n01:17 Speaker A\nAnd lastly, let's check a check here on crypto. Bitcoin continues to slip missing out on the broader seasonal optimism. The world's largest cryptocurrency stalling here between 85,000 to 90,000 range.

Let's start there, explain that. I mean, is that is that valuation, Joseph, is it is it earnings growth, positioning, explain it.\n00:27 Joseph\nI think that there have been a number of businesses in the magnificent 493 that are perceived as being uh hurt or uh compromised by the growth of AI. Valuations have gone significantly lower for a number of those companies and businesses that are just not participants in in uh the opportunity of AI have also not performed particularly well uh in that bucket of the magnificent 493. And I think in 2026, what we're going to find is that many of these companies are harnessing AI to get better, to lower their costs, to improve the velocity of introducing new products, um, and those businesses will begin to get the benefits of that uh as people recognize it. It hasn't happened uh in the last couple of years, but I think we're going to notice that in the next couple of years.\n01:29 Speaker A\nWell, what does that suggest Joseph about what do you think I do with the Mag 7 though in 2026? You know, am I avoiding those names? Am I trimming exposure? You know, do I have to be more discerning? Maybe next year, Joseph, it's more like, you know, the mag three or four.\n01:46 Joseph\nI think so. I think the Mag 7 it's tough to paint them with a broad brush because each one of them has a specific story associated with them. But I think just from a valuation perspective and the fact that they've performed so well for such a long period of time, I think that some of them will take a break, some of them will perform well, but really the opportunities for outsized returns next year are going to be outside of those seven businesses.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Uh-Oh! Did Nvidia Just Signal Problems with Intel’s Comeback?\n\nRich Duprey\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nTSM\n\nQuick Read Intel ( INTC ) secured $8.9B from the U.S. government and $5B from Nvidia ( NVDA ) to revive its foundry business.\nNvidia halted testing of Intel’s 18A chip manufacturing process and stopped moving forward with production plans.\nIntel’s foundry turnaround depends on 18A attracting major customers beyond smaller deals with Microsoft and Amazon .\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIntel ( NASDAQ: INTC ) has experienced a dramatic shift in fortunes over the past year. Once viewed as a failing chipmaker losing ground to competitors like Broadcom ( NASDAQ: AVGO ), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( NYSE: TSM ), and Nvidia ( NASDAQ: NVDA ), Intel faced speculation that rivals were circling its foundry business and other assets.\nBy the middle of the year, however, Intel regained momentum through significant backing from the Trump administration, which converted CHIPS Act grants into an equity stake worth approximately $8.9 billion, or 10% of the company, making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. This was followed by a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, giving it roughly a 4% stake, as well as partnerships aimed at joint product development in data centers and PCs.\n\nThese moves indicated renewed confidence, positioning Intel as a key player in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing once again. Yet, a Reuters report today suggests a big potential setback, raising questions about whether Intel's revival is beginning to falter.\nA Promising Rebound Built on Execution Intel's recent progress has been notable, driven by strategic investments and a focus on revitalizing its core businesses. The Trump administration's equity stake provided essential capital and aligned Intel with national priorities for domestic chip production.\nWeeks later, Nvidia's $5 billion commitment further supported Intel's turnaround, with the two firms agreeing to collaborate on custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms and integrated system-on-chips for PCs. An Intel spokesperson emphasized that 18A technologies are \"progressing well.\"\n\nDespite these positive developments, the rebound has always hinged on Intel's ability to execute, particularly in its foundry business. The 18A process node has been central to its plans for regaining manufacturing leadership, as it is intended to enable high-volume production of advanced chips and attract customers.\nNvidia's Decision Raises Questions About 18A According to the Reuters article, Nvidia recently evaluated whether to manufacture its next-generation chips using Intel's 18A process but halted the testing and stopped moving forward. Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed this to Reuters, though Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nStory Continues\nThis development comes despite Nvidia's earlier investment and ongoing product collaborations, which explicitly did not include commitments to use Intel's foundry. Intel has previously noted strong interest in 18A, and the company continues to highlight progress on the node, with products like Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest ramping up toward production.\n\nThe reasons for Nvidia's decision remain unclear, but earlier reports indicated both Nvidia and Broadcom conducted tests on 18A. While testing is a standard step, not all evaluations lead to production commitments.\nIf technical or yield issues contributed to the halt, it could signal challenges for Intel in convincing major designers to shift volume from established leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel's foundry has faced scrutiny over quality and scalability before, though the company maintains that 18A is on track and sees interest shifting to the subsequent 14A node for even more advanced applications.\nBroader Implications for Intel's Foundry Strategy Winning high-profile customers has been a key goal for Intel Foundry, which has invested heavily to compete as a contract manufacturer. Deals with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) for custom chips on 18A have been announced, and Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) might go with Intel for its entry-level M-series chips in 2027, but volumes from such clients are relatively small compared to demands from AI leaders like Nvidia.\n\nNvidia halting the testing -- while not a definitive rejection -- underscores the high bar set for advanced nodes. Competitors continue to dominate high-end production, and Intel must demonstrate reliable yields and performance to secure larger commitments.\nKey Takeaway Investors should not read too much into Nvidia's decision to pause 18A testing at this stage, as qualification processes are lengthy and multifaceted. However, greater caution is warranted moving forward.\nMuch of Intel's turnaround depends on the success of the 18A process in delivering competitive manufacturing capabilities. If the node falls short of expectations in attracting major business from customers, it could complicate the company's path to foundry profitability and an overall recovery.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nASML\n\nKey Points Nvidia’s chips are still the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush.\nTSMC manufactures Nvidia’s chips with its best-in-breed foundries.\nASML’s lithography systems enable TSMC to produce those chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe artificial intelligence ( AI ) market has expanded rapidly over the past decade as more powerful chips and generative AI platforms have entered the market. Those AI services became practical tools that could quickly crunch, analyze, and predict trends for businesses and mainstream users.\n\nThe AI market could grow at a CAGR of 30.6% from 2026 to 2033, according to Grand View Research, as more organizations use AI to automate, accelerate, and optimize their operations. To capitalize on this expansion, investors should consider buying and holding these three top tech stocks for the next decade and beyond: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , TSMC (NYSE: TSM) , and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) .\nNvidia Nvidia is the world's top producer of discrete GPUs for data centers, which are used to process complex AI tasks. Most of the top AI companies -- including OpenAI, Meta , and Microsoft -- use its GPUs. It also locks in those clients with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a proprietary programming platform for its own chips.\n\nAs the producer of the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, Nvidia still has plenty of room to grow. It might face tougher competition from AMD 's cheaper GPUs, first-party AI chips from some of its top customers, and other types of AI accelerators -- but its first-mover edge, best-in-breed reputation, and sticky ecosystem will fuel its long-term growth. Tighter export curbs could throttle its shipments to China over the next few years, but it can offset that pressure with its growth in the U.S., Europe, and other Asian markets.\nFrom fiscal 2025 (which ended in January) to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share ( EPS ) to grow at a CAGR of 46% and 29%, respectively. Even though its stock has already soared nearly 23,000% over the past decade, it still looks reasonably valued at 25 times next year's earnings. Therefore, Nvidia should remain one of the simplest ways to profit from the AI boom over the next decade.\n\nTSMC Nvidia outsources the production of its top-tier GPUs to TSMC, the world's largest and most advanced contract chipmaker. TSMC is the only foundry capable of manufacturing Nvidia's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.\nTSMC also produces chips for other leading fabless chipmakers like AMD, Apple , and Qualcomm . It manufactures its most advanced chips in Taiwan, which is exposed to potential trade and military conflicts with China; however, it has been mitigating this risk by building more plants in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.\n\nStory Continues\nIn its latest quarter, TSMC generated 57% of its revenue from the high-performance computing (HPC) market, which includes Nvidia's data center GPUs. That segment is driving its near-term growth and reducing its dependence on the cyclical PC, smartphone, and automotive markets.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect TSMC's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 24% and 27%, respectively, as the AI market expands and its more cyclical markets stabilize. Those are strong growth rates for a stock that trades at 19 times next year's earnings, and it will remain a linchpin of the expanding semiconductor sector for the foreseeable future.\n\nASML TSMC couldn't manufacture its chips without the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML. ASML is the world's leading producer of lithography systems, which optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which produce the smallest and most densely packed chips.\n\nASML perfected its EUV technology over the past two decades, and the high costs of producing those massive systems prevented its potential competitors from gaining any ground. Its EUV systems currently cost $200-$400 million, require multiple planes and trucks to ship, and must be reassembled at the foundries by its own teams.\nASML's monopolization of that market makes it another linchpin of the semiconductor sector, and the world's most advanced AI chips couldn't exist without its cutting-edge technology. The export curbs against China (where it's barred from selling its higher-end systems) are throttling its near-term sales, but its growth across other regions should offset that pressure.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 18%, respectively, as it ramps up its shipments of its latest \"high-NA\" EUV systems for manufacturing even smaller and denser chips. Its stock isn't a bargain at 35 times next year's earnings, but its scale, guaranteed long-term growth, and pricing power justify that higher valuation.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "TSX futures edge lower as liquidity thins ahead of Christmas break\n\nLuke Juricic\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:42 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPTSE\n\nDX\n\nDX-PC\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nInvesting.com -- Canadian equity futures are drifting slightly lower on Wednesday morning as market participants head to the sidelines for a holiday-shortened session. The subtle retreat follows a historic milestone for the S&P/TSX Composite, which reached a record closing high on Tuesday, fueled by a meteoric rise in the metals and mining sectors.\n\nAs of 9:05 ET, S&P/TSX 60 Futures Index Standard Futures were down 2.4 points or 0.13%, mirroring a cautious tone in global markets. Trading volumes are expected to remain exceptionally thin today, as the Toronto Stock Exchange prepares to close early at 1:00 PM ET for Christmas Eve. Analysts warn that low liquidity could amplify price swings, though many investors appear content to lock in profits after a banner year for Canadian equities.\nRecord Territory: Tuesday Recap The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index finished Tuesday’s session up 58.63 points, or 0.18%, to settle at a new record of 32,058.73. The advance marked the fourth consecutive winning day for the index, which has now surged nearly 30% year-to-date.\nTuesday’s gains were driven almost exclusively by commodities:\n\nGold and Silver Miners: Outsized gains in the sub-indexes (up over 100% this year) continued as precious metals hit fresh peaks.\nEnergy: Resilience in crude prices provided a secondary floor for the index, even as domestic economic data surprised to the downside.\nThe bullish momentum successfully offset a disappointing report from Statistics Canada , which revealed that real GDP contracted 0.3% in October . The decline was wider than the 0.2% drop economists had anticipated, hampered by a 1.5% slump in manufacturing and a series of high-profile labor stoppages, including a nation-wide postal strike and teacher strikes in Alberta.\nGold Shatters $4,500 Barrier In a historic move on Wednesday, Gold Futures broke past the $4,500 per ounce resistance level. The yellow metal reached a peak of $4,554/oz in trade, extending a rally that has seen prices climb roughly 70% in 2025. Gold Futures now sit at $4,515.25/oz, a 0.2% gain.\nThe \"flight to safety\" is being propelled by a cocktail of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors:\n\nUS-Venezuela Tensions: Renewed friction between Washington and Caracas over oil shipments has heightened regional supply risks.\nFed Expectations: Despite robust US GDP data, investors remain firm in their belief that the Federal Reserve will pivot toward further rate cuts in 2026.\nCurrency Weakness: The US Dollar Index is hovering near 12-week lows, making dollar-denominated bullion more attractive to international buyers.\n\nStory continues\nEnergy & Commodities Watch\nOil prices remained relatively stable on Wednesday morning. Brent Oil Futures edged up 0.14% to $62.46 per barrel, while Crude Oil WTI Futures gained 0.3% to trade at $58.55.\nSupply risks remain the primary catalyst, as the Trump administration intensifies enforcement actions against vessels linked to Venezuelan crude. While Venezuela accounts for a small fraction of global supply, the potential for wider maritime interdiction has re-introduced a significant risk premium into energy markets.\n\nTech Spotlight: Intel Slumps on Nvidia Snub In corporate news, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) saw its shares tumble 3.3% in premarket trading. The move comes following reporting from Reuters saying that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has halted testing of Intel’s \"18A\" advanced manufacturing process.\nThe 18A node is considered the linchpin of Intel’s turnaround strategy to become a premier foundry for third-party chip designers. While an Intel spokesperson maintained that the technology is \"progressing well,\" the decision by Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, to step away from testing dealt a heavy blow to investor sentiment.\n\nLooking Ahead U.S. markets are also expected to see light activity today, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 Futures trading near flat after their own record-setting sessions on Tuesday. The New York Stock Exchange will join the TSX in an early 1:00 PM ET close today, and both will remain shuttered on Thursday for Christmas Day.\nRelated articles\nTSX futures edge lower as liquidity thins ahead of Christmas break\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Micron Technology and BigBear.ai\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:42 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nBBAI\n\nMU\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 24, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Intel Corp. INTC, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nForget NVIDIA: 2 AI Stocks Crushing It in 2025 with More Upside Ahead Shares of the most sought-after tech stock on Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp. , have surged 36.6% this year amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ongoing demand for NVIDIA's CUDA software platform, along with its competitive advantage in the AI hardware market, fueled growth. Demand for NVIDIA's Blackwell chips remains strong, and the company plans to ship H200 AI chips to China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nHowever, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions remain a risk and could pose a meaningful threat to NVIDIA's future growth trajectory. NVIDIA also faces intensifying competition from rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . and Intel Corp. , as data center capital expenditures continue to rise.\nTherefore, investors may look beyond NVIDIA at stocks that have outperformed it this year and still offer upside as the AI boom continues. Notable among them are Micron Technology, Inc . and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc . whose shares have gained 228.8% and 43.6%, respectively, this year. Let's take a closer look at why these stocks are compelling buys.\nReasons to Be Bullish on Micron Strong demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips is expected to help the company deliver strong quarterly results. These chips have the inherent capacity to reduce power consumption and process large volumes of data. With AI infrastructure rapidly expanding, demand for HBM chips has accelerated.\n\nBanking on rising AI-led demand for HBM chips, Micron expects its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $13.64 billion for the fiscal first quarter, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Analysts had projected revenues of around $12.88 billion.\nMicron expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter, with its cloud memory business unit expected to perform particularly well. Micron's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a solid 23.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nReasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai BigBear.ai's shares were adversely impacted at the beginning of the year due to the Trump administration's move to curb federal spending. Reduced funding may have affected BigBear.ai's sales, but its top-line performance is expected to improve going forward, supported by the definitive $250 million agreement to acquire Ask Sage.\n\nAsk Sage is a fast-growing generative AI platform that has seen broad adoption, with users including the U.S. Space Force and the Defense Health Agency. It is designed for secure AI deployment in restricted fields such as defense and national security, according to ir.bigbear.ai. Ask Sage serves 100,000 users across 16,000 government teams, and with its acquisition, BigBear.ai expects full-year sales to reach $125 million to $140 million.\nMoreover, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" could drive future growth for BigBear.ai, while the company's robust cash position provides ample resources to support its expansion. The company reached a significant milestone toward profitability in the third quarter, and its expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a stellar 73.1%.\n\nWhile BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

NVDA recently overtook the 50-day moving average, and this suggests a short-term bullish trend.\nThe 50-day simple moving average is a widely used technical indicator that helps determine support or resistance levels for different types of securities. It's one of three major moving averages, but takes precedent because it's the first sign of an up or down trend.\n\nShares of NVDA have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 6.4%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, suggesting that NVDA could be poised for a continued surge.\nThe bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account NVDA's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 15 higher compared to none lower for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nInvestors may want to watch NVDA for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is planning roughly $23 billion in AI-related capital spending in 2026, betting heavily on computing power to fuel its next phase of growth.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nMost of that money will go toward the infrastructure behind Doubao, ByteDance's fast-growing AI assistant, along with tools that power advertising and content recommendations. A key part of the plan is a trial of about 20,000 Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) H200 chips, a roughly $400 million investment that would give ByteDance access to top-tier AI hardware at a time when such supply is tightly controlled. Reports suggest more than half of the budget could be dedicated just to AI processors.\nThat spending still trails U.S. giants like Meta ( NASDAQ:META ) and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOG ), but ByteDance's private status gives it flexibility to play the long game. Doubao's rapid rise in China shows why the company is leaning in.\nWhy it matters: ByteDance is signaling that AI is now core to its business, not an experiment, and it is willing to spend aggressively to stay ahead.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia and Bath & Body Works have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:34 AM PST 10 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSTR\n\nMARA\n\nBBWI\n\nRIOT\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 24, 2025 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Nvidia NVDA as the Bull of the Day and Bath & Body Works, Inc. BBWI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Strategy Inc. MSTR, MARA Holdings MARA and Riot Platforms RIOT.\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day : I run screens and conduct research every day, looking for high-quality companies with strong growth profiles and reasonable valuations, and Nvidia consistently stands out. Few companies sit as squarely at the center of today's most important secular trend.\nDemand for Nvidia's GPUs appears either secular or, if cyclical, still early enough that a downturn is not yet a concern. Roughly half a trillion dollars is expected to flow into AI-related capital spending next year, and Nvidia's chips are estimated to account for roughly 20% of that investment. That scale underscores both the company's dominance and the durability of its demand backdrop.\n\nAfter several months of consolidation, Nvidia shares have begun to reaccelerate, recently breaking out from a well-defined technical pattern. At the same time, analysts have continued to raise earnings estimates, earning the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) . Improving clarity around US&ndash;China semiconductor trade policies has also removed a near-term overhang, reopening a source of demand that had previously been constrained.\nBelow, we outline the outlook for the world's largest publicly traded company and explain why Nvidia remains well positioned to continue leading the market going forward.\nNvidia Shares Bolstered by Strong Growth Forecasts Growth expectations for Nvidia remain exceptional. Sales are projected to rise roughly 63% next year and another 43% in 2027, reflecting an incredible $100 billion jump from one year to the next. On the bottom line, earnings are expected to climb 55.5% next year and 53% the following year, underscoring the company's powerful operating leverage.\n\nWhat also makes this growth profile compelling is valuation. Despite its dominance and momentum, Nvidia trades at about 39.5x forward earnings. With consensus estimates calling for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, the stock carries a PEG ratio of roughly 0.85, a level typically associated with undervalued growth stocks, not the world's most important AI supplier.\nIn other words, investors are not paying a premium commensurate with Nvidia's growth trajectory. If current forecasts hold, valuation support alone provides a cushion, while continued execution on revenue, margins, and ecosystem expansion offers meaningful upside.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia Stock Breaks Out Nvidia shares staged a decisive breakout this week, resolving higher from a well-defined descending bullish wedge, a pattern that typically signals trend continuation. After several months of consolidation, the stock has clearly regained momentum, suggesting selling pressure has been absorbed and buyers are regaining control.\n\nWith the breakout now confirmed, the technical setup points to a renewed push higher, and a retest of record highs in the near term would not be surprising. Importantly, this move is occurring alongside rising earnings estimates and improving fundamental visibility, reinforcing the signal and increasing the likelihood that the breakout proves durable.\nCan Investors Buy Shares in NVDA? Given the combination of accelerating earnings growth, reasonable valuation relative to its growth profile, and a confirmed technical breakout, Nvidia remains an attractive buy for investors with a medium- to long-term horizon. The stock has spent several months consolidating prior gains, allowing fundamentals to catch up to price, and that process now appears complete.\n\nWhile near-term volatility is always possible, particularly in a stock that has already delivered outsized returns, the underlying setup argues that pullbacks are more likely to be opportunities rather than warning signs. With earnings estimates still moving higher, demand visibility extending well into next year, and technical momentum turning decisively positive, Nvidia continues to justify its leadership position in the market and remains the core holding in the AI theme.\nBear of the Day: Bath & Body Works, Inc. appears to be facing a structural decline as sales, earnings power, brand relevance, and analyst expectations continue to trend lower. What was once a productive specialty retail model is increasingly under pressure in a more competitive, digitally driven landscape.\nStore traffic remains muted, and the company has struggled to resonate with younger consumers, leading to ongoing market share losses to competitors with stronger product innovation and more effective digital engagement. At the same time, margin visibility is deteriorating. Elevated promotional activity, persistent tariff exposure, and rising operating costs are compressing profitability, with few clear offsets in sight.\n\nManagement's revised outlook points to a longer and more challenging recovery. Softer top-line expectations, combined with continued SG&A deleverage, suggest earnings will remain constrained even if demand stabilizes. With promotional intensity likely to remain elevated, execution risk appears skewed to the downside over the next several quarters.\nReflecting these challenges, analysts have continued to downgrade the stock. Shares have been in a persistent downtrend for roughly four years, underscoring the market's lack of confidence in a near-term turnaround.\nBBWI Stock Drops Along with Earnings Estimates The earnings revision trend for Bath & Body Works has deteriorated meaningfully again over the past 60 days, pushing the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) . Analyst confidence has weakened sharply, with next quarter earnings estimates cut by 42% and next year estimates reduced by 31.5%, reflecting rising concerns around demand, margins, and execution.\n\nThe top line outlook offers little support. Sales are expected to decline 2.3% next year and a further 3% in 2027, signaling ongoing pressure on traffic. On the bottom line, earnings are forecast to fall 11.6% this year and 11.5% next year, suggesting that cost pressures and promotional intensity are overwhelming management's ability to protect profitability.\nThis combination, falling revenue, shrinking margins, and accelerating estimate cuts is particularly concerning. Sustained negative revisions tend to weigh heavily on stock performance, and without a clear catalyst to stabilize earnings expectations, BBWI remains fundamentally challenged in the near to intermediate term.\nShould Investors Avoid BBWI Stock? Given the ongoing deterioration in fundamentals, BBWI remains a stock to avoid. Earnings estimates continue to move sharply lower, revenue trends are negative, and margin pressure shows little sign of abating. In retail, sustained negative revisions are rarely a short-term issue, and BBWI's estimate trajectory suggests deeper structural challenges rather than a temporary slowdown.\n\nUntil the company can demonstrate a clear inflection in traffic, brand relevance, and profitability, and until earnings revisions stabilize, the risk-reward profile remains unattractive. With shares entrenched in a multi-year downtrend and analyst sentiment firmly negative, BBWI lacks the catalysts needed to justify new capital at this stage.\nAdditional content: Strategy's Bitcoin Accretion Continues: Is It Durable? Strategy Inc. continues to deepen its identity as the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 2025 marking a decisive acceleration in Bitcoin accretion. In 2025, the company has meaningfully stepped up its accumulation pace, expanding holdings to roughly 671,000 BTC, including a recent 10,645 BTC purchase in mid-December. With its Bitcoin ownership exceeding 3% of the global supply, Strategy's accumulation has evolved into an ongoing process rather than opportunistic trades.\n\nThat momentum is clearly reflected in key operating metrics. BTC Yield reached 26% year to date, while BTC Gain climbed to 116,555 BTC, marking a sharp rise from earlier quarters. Importantly, Bitcoin per share continued to rise even as new equity was issued, indicating that capital raises remain adding value on a per-share basis. These metrics suggest that Bitcoin accumulation is being executed with discipline.\nThe durability of this momentum is further supported by recent structural tailwinds. Regulatory clarity following IRS guidance on fair-value taxation reduces uncertainty for long-term Bitcoin holders, while the company's new S&P B- credit rating expands access to global high-yield capital markets. At the same time, growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin via ETFs and derivatives has improved liquidity and reduced volatility, creating a more supportive macro backdrop for treasury adoption.\n\nLooking ahead, management reaffirmed its target of a 30% BTC yield and $20 billion in BTC dollar profits for 2025, indicating confidence in maintaining this trajectory. While Bitcoin remains volatile, the company's expanded access to capital supports more sustainable compound growth.\nMSTR Faces Growing Pressure from Crypto Rivals MARA Holdings challenges MSTR with a fundamentally different crypto strategy. MARA Holdings blends Bitcoin production and accumulation, leveraging large-scale mining alongside strategic purchases. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, MARA Holdings held 52,850 BTC, supported by an energized hash rate of 60.4 EH/s, indicating scalable, long-term competitive pressure.\n\nRiot Platforms presents a growing threat to MSTR by monetizing Bitcoin through large-scale mining operations. RIOT strengths include cost efficiency and strategic expansion, and digital infrastructure supporting the Bitcoin network directly. At the end of the third quarter of 2025, RIOT held 19,287 BTC, produced 1,406 BTC and deployed a 36.5 EH/s hash rate. With $180.2 million in revenues and $104.5 million in net income, RIOT highlights growing competitive pressure on MSTR.\nMSTR's Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates MSTR has significantly underperformed both its sector and key competitors. Shares of Strategy have plunged 54.1% over the past year against a 15.7% gain in the Zacks Finance sector. Riot Platforms rose 23.4% during the same period, while MARA Holdings declined 49.7%.\nMSTR has a Value Score of F. It is currently trading at a Price/Book ratio of 0.9X compared to the sector's 4.28X.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSTR's 2025 earnings is pegged at $78.04 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The estimate also indicates a strong year-over-year recovery from a loss of $6.72 per share.\nMSTR stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Intel Shares Fall on Report Nvidia Halts Production Test\n\nJake Rudnitsky\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:14 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. shares fell in premarket trading Wednesday after a report said that Nvidia Corp. halted a test to use Intel’s production process to make advanced chips.\nNvidia recently tested the so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, Reuters reported, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nSpokespeople for Nvidia and Intel didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies are “progressing well.”\nIntel’s shares fell about 2.3% in early trading before markets opened in New York.\nIntel recently opened a new factory at its Ocotillo site in Arizona known as Fab 52 that’s the first to go into mass production with the 18A technique. The company says it’s the most cutting edge production technology developed and deployed in the US. Intel’s push to make advanced chips domestically is an attempt to challenge the global leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and reassert American leadership in the industry.\n\nNvidia agreed to invest $5 billion into Intel in September, following the US government’s decision to take a roughly 10% stake in the company. The investment by the world’s most valuable company and a key designer of chips for the artificial intelligence boom was seen as a boost for Intel, which has struggled to stem losses and catch competitors that have surpassed it in recent years. However, the deal didn’t include a commitment for Intel to make Nvidia chips.\n18A is a bid to return to making Intel’s best offerings in-house. The technology contains two new features that Intel says are breakthroughs for the industry.\nThe first relates to transistors, the microscopic switches that give semiconductors their function. Modern chips cram tens of billions of transistors into a small area. In order to make chips more efficient and use less energy, the ability to switch these transistors on and off becomes critical.\n\nThe 18A products will be the first to have transistors made with so-called gate-all-around technology, a technique that allows finer control over this process, Intel said. That will allow for chips with more transistors — and the ability to handle growing amounts of data — that consume less power.\nThe second innovation pertains to how the chips are powered. The ultimate promise is that chips can have more transistors and be more efficient.\n\nStory Continues\n(Updates with more detail on 18A process.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "These 6 stocks will lead the $1 trillion chip surge in 2026, BofA says\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAVGO\n\n^GSPC\n\nLRCX\n\nKLAC\n\nThe artificial intelligence boom isn't cooling off — it's getting bigger, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya contends.\nWhile AI skeptics have pointed to eye-popping valuations as a reason to run, Arya said the industry is only at the \"midpoint\" of a decade-long transformation, and it's being led by Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Broadcom ( AVGO ).\n\nIn a report titled \"2026 Year Ahead: choppy, still cheerful,\" Arya forecast a 30% year-over-year surge in global semiconductor sales that will finally push the sector past a historic $1 trillion annual sales milestone in 2026.\nArya noted a strong belief in companies with \"moats that are quantified by their margin structure.\" In addition to Nvidia and Broadcom, he highlighted four other large-cap semiconductor companies — Lam Research ( LRCX ), KLA ( KLAC ), Analog Devices ( ADI ), and Cadence Design Systems ( CDNS ) — as his top picks for 2026.\n\"I often say that investing in semis is very simple,\" Arya told reporters on a Dec. 19 call. \"You don't need any sell-side analyst to do that. Just take all your companies, sort them by gross margins, and buy the top five, and you're not going to be that wrong.\"\nBofA estimates that the total addressable market for AI data center systems will reach over $1.2 trillion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion opportunity.\nDespite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious because AI data centers are expensive. A typical 1 gigawatt facility requires upwards of $60 billion in capital expenditures, with roughly half of that going directly to hardware, per Bank of America.\n\nThat raises the question: Will the return on investment ever materialize?",

      "Content": "The 20-Year Signal: Preparing for the Predicted Reversal of AI-Fueled Stock Market Gains\n\nDavid Beren\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:45 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nThere is no question that artificial intelligence has transformed the stock market as we know it over the past three years, all but single-handedly driving the S&P 500 to record after record. Companies that are sitting at the forefront of this technology, like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), have delivered returns that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The Shiller CAPE ratio sits above 35, a level seen only twice before: the Great Depression and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\nThe S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022. The Mag 7 tech stocks now represent 30% of total S&P 500 market value.\nAfter the 2000 peak at similar CAPE levels, the S&P 500 fell 49% over 2.5 years and took 7 years to recover.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMost importantly, the AI technology is real, and so far, the enthusiasm for this technology has been mostly justified, all while the long-term potential (and dangers) seems incredible. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolios have grown in a massive way over the last 36 months. But, and there is always a but, beneath this celebratory growth, there is a warning signal that has emerged.\nThis indicator, which looks at the close relationships between stock prices and underlying economics, hasn't flashed at current levels in over 20 years, not since the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. The last time this signal appeared, it was followed by a multi-year bear market that erased roughly half of the market's overall value. While history doesn't always repeat itself, it does at least suggest that we need to look at these readings and consider, as investors, what the next smart move really is.\n\nAI Mania Drives Stocks to Historic, Record Highs The artificial intelligence revolution has, without question, captivated investors in a way that almost no other technology has. The belief that AI is going to and has already started to automate work, revolutionize manufacturing, and create entirely new industries is just scratching the surface of what investors are thinking about.\n\nFor companies that are in the AI world, all of this speculation and promise has led to explosive revenue growth. For example, NVIDIA's data center business has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in corporate America, and Microsoft's AI integration across basically its entire product lineup is driving enterprise adoption. In other words, this technology is actually driving real revenue.\n\nStory Continues\nThis technological transformation has driven stock prices to levels that would have seemed absurd three years ago. The S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022, and NVIDIA has seen its market cap grow by trillions. The Mag 7's technology stocks represent a whopping 30% of the entire S&P 500 market value, a level not seen since the 1990s. Valuations have also exploded as the forward P/E of the S&P 500 now hovers around 21 to 22, 40% above historical averages.\n\nThe optimism that is driving these valuation numbers is assuming that AI will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for years to come. More importantly, it also assumes that AI adoption won't have any obstacles to adoption in the coming years and that companies building AI infrastructure will continue generating returns to justify their current high stock prices and valuations.\nThis pattern of pricing in future success isn't new, as the late 1990s boom also seemed a trajectory where investors were basically paying today for profits they expected companies to deliver in the next five years. However, as the world knows, the technology of the internet boom from the 1990s succeeded, it's how you're reading this today, but many of the stocks crashed because valuations got too far ahead of any financial reality.\n\nA Rare Signal Not Seen in Two Decades: What the Indicator Means The warning signal that is flashing today is the Shiller CAPE ratio, a number that is an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio that measures stock prices relative to average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This metric attempts to smooth out short-term earnings volatility and give a longer-lens look at valuation extremes. As of December 2025, the Shiller CAPE sits above 35, a level that has only been seen twice in modern history: the Great Depression market crash and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\n\nThe last time the US saw the CAPE ratio reach these current levels was in early 2000, right before the stock-market crash. At that peak, investors were paying extreme premiums for stocks based on the expectation (think hope) that internet companies would continue to just deliver on their unprecedented growth. History reminds us that the reality of what took place was that these companies did not enjoy unstoppable growth and that the market declined 49% over a 2.5-year period, the NASDAQ fell 78%, and it took 7 years to recover.\nThe CAPE ratio's predictive power comes from understanding long-term perspectives, and unlike traditional P/E ratios that can be distorted by temporary earnings spikes or collapses, the CAPE ratio looks with a wide lens at a full decade of earnings. When this ratio does hit 30, it can be a historical signal that stocks are priced for perfection and have almost no room for disappointment.\n\nWhat makes the current signal particularly troubling is that it isn't just existing in a silo. Instead, it's appearing alongside three other late-cycle indicators like three consecutive years of double-digit S&P 500 gains, forward P/E ratios at 40-year highs, extreme concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks, and retail investor enthusiasm that feels eerily like the dot-com bubble. While no single indicator is going to be definitive, the combination of all three suggests that a major reversal could be on the horizon, and an entire generation of investors has never experienced what happens when valuations are this stretched.\nHistory's Verdict: A Reversal is Coming - How Smart Investors Respond History is pretty unambiguous about what can happen when an extreme CAPE reading is taking place. For one, you might be in a position that creates a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. At the 1929 stock peak, stocks fell 89% over three years, and again in 2000, you had the 49% S&P 500 drop over 2.5 years. What a drop might look like in the near future is unknown, but the pattern that occurred during these two previous instances of extreme valuations resolving through major corrections seems to be all too familiar to what we're going through now with AI.\n\nFor investors, this could be the strategic opportunity they have been waiting for rather than a situation full of panic. The mistake during previous bubbles wasn't recognizing that stocks were not expensive, but it was remaining fully invested at those prices and then panic-selling at the bottom. The smart approach today is about recognizing that current valuations create a situation where the downside potential far exceeds any upside of staying fully invested.\nBuilding a cash reserve now so investors can \"buy the dip,\" as the saying goes, is arguably the best move, to the tune of upward of 30% of a portfolio being liquidated for cash or put into short-term bonds. If the market does decline by 40-50% from current levels, this cash can be invested into companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA at valuations these companies haven't experienced in years. This could give investors a chance to double their position size.\n\nThe key here is going to be the right amount of discipline, as history shows that bear market pain isn't the actual decline itself, it's the psychology of trying to understand how to buy at the bottom. If the market falls 30%, there might be a voice going on that says it's going to 50% and if it falls 50%, total economic collapse might be the voice on the news. In other words, investors should have capital reserved for buying during these panics so they can ignore the noise and acquire quality companies at steep discounts and prepare for the next decade's best returns.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Talks reportedly broke down with Blue Owl Capital over plans to build a $10 billion data center in Michigan. The Larry Ellison-owned tech giant signed a huge deal with OpenAI this year. Oracle has borrowed heavily to build its AI infrastructure but its rising debt has concerned some investors. Nvidia aims to start shipping its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February. That's what three sources told Reuters, who added the firm said it plans to add new production capacity for the semiconductors. The Trump administration allowed sales of Nvidia's H200 chips to China this month. Although Beijing has yet to approve any purchases of it. SoftBank is reportedly racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by the end of the year. Sources said the Japanese investor has explored cash-raising schemes, including a sale of some investments. The company has already sold all of its $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia. Softbank agreed a deal to invest $300 billion in OpenAI this year in one of the biggest bets yet made by CEO Masayoshi Son. UPS-owned company Happy Returns is using AI to spot fakes in holiday boxless returns. The firm says nearly one in every 10 retail items returned for a refund in the U.S. is fraudulent. Its AI tool helps to find fraudulent returns by flagging suspicious packages, analyzing their contents, and sending them for final audit by humans. David Sobie is CEO of Happy Returns. “Retailers are under a tremendous amount of pressure, pressure from a cost perspective and pressure from a return fraud perspective. And so those are two areas that we're really trying to help them alleviate.\" And around 25,000 people have shown interest in joining the Trump administration's so-called Tech Force. That's according to a U.S. government official - Reuters couldn't independently verify the figure. Washington wants to hire staff with AI expertise in federal roles. The candidates will compete for 1,000 spots in the first Tech Force cohort. Recruits will spend two years working on tech projects inside federal agencies.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Finance and YCharts. P/E = price-to-earnings ratio . EPS = earnings per share. Data as of Dec. 23, 2025.\nNvidia: The dominant maker of AI chips and related tech Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), its flagship semiconductors, are considered the gold standard for training artificial intelligence (AI) models and deploying AI applications.\nThe company's data center platform had been performing well for quite some time. But demand began skyrocketing for its AI-enabling products -- its GPUs and high-performance networking products -- soon after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. This event demonstrated to company leaders and the general public the phenomenal capabilities of generative AI.\n\nIn late October at the company's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, D.C., CEO Jensen Huang said that management has \"visibility\" into $500 billion of demand for its key data center technology over the next five quarters . This demand of $100 billion per quarter, on average, is truly mind-blowing. As context, in its fiscal third quarter (ended late October), Nvidia's total revenue was $57.0 billion, of which $51.2 billion was from the data center platform.\nBroadcom: The leading maker of custom AI chips Broadcom develops semiconductors for various end markets and also develops infrastructure software.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's robust growth is being drven by strong demand for its custom AI-enabling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and Ethernet networking products, both for data centers. Its acquisition of software maker VMware in late 2023 is proving to be a shrewd move, as this business is also growing nicely.\n\nBroadcom is the top partner for big tech companies seeking custom ASICs. As the name suggests, these chips are designed for specific applications. These include internal uses and, in some cases, for availability in their cloud computing services. By contrast, Nvidia's GPUs can be considered more general-purpose AI chips. There is a need for both GPUs and ASICs, so investors shouldn't be concerned that one of these types of chips will fully win out over the other.\nTSM: The world's largest chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world's largest chip foundry. That means it produces chips of various types for companies that contract out all or some of the manufacturing of chips they design.\nTSM is the largest producer of AI chips worldwide, which has led to significant financial growth in recent years, driven by surging demand for these chips.\n\nTSM's customers include nearly every major chip company, such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which is Nvidia's main rival in the AI-enabling GPU market. Moreover, it also manufactures chips, including AI chips, for major tech companies that have designed their own chips. This includes Apple , widely considered the company's largest customer, though some Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to soon overtake Apple as TSM's top customer.\nAn added benefit for some investors is that TSM pays a decent dividend for a tech company. The dividend yield was 1.13%, as of the close of the market on Dec. 23.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\n\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\n\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory Continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE\nBefore heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms -- Walden International and Walden Catalyst -- did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO\nBorn in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\n\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\n\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\n\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\n\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL\nSo far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\n\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Nvidia Stock Is Up 31% in 2025, But Here's Another Super Semiconductor Stock to Buy in 2026, According to Wall Street\n\nAnthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 2:38 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nWSFX.BO\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Nvidia continues to experience incredible demand for its data center chips.\nMicron Technology supplies high-bandwidth memory for data centers, which Nvidia has integrated into its GPUs.\nMicron stock has tripled in 2025, but it still looks cheap.\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which are the main chips used to develop artificial intelligence (AI). The company is seeing more demand for its products than it can possibly supply, which is fueling a huge surge in its revenue and earnings.\n\nWith just one week left in 2025, Nvidia stock is sitting on a return of nearly 37%. But it has been trounced by another AI semiconductor stock, which is up by an eye-popping 229% this year: Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) . This company supplies memory and storage chips that are critical for AI workloads in data centers, computers, and even smartphones.\nThe Wall Street Journal tracks 43 analysts who cover Micron stock, and the overwhelming majority think it's a buy heading into 2026. In fact, not a single analyst recommends selling. Here's why it could be a great addition to any portfolio for the new year.\nNvidia is one of Micron's many AI customers High-bandwidth memory (HBM) is needed to unlock the best performance from every data center GPU because it stores information in a ready state, which accelerates processing speeds. A low memory capacity can cause bottlenecks by forcing the GPU to pause its computations while it waits to receive more data, whereas a high capacity keeps data flowing constantly. This is especially important in data-intensive AI workloads.\n\nMicron's HBM3E data center solution offers 50% more capacity than the competition, while consuming 30% less energy. This is a winning combination for AI developers that want the best performance at the lowest cost, which is why Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are using it in their latest GPUs.\nMicron is now preparing to ramp up production of its new HBM4E solution, which could offer up to 60% more capacity with a further 20% improvement in energy efficiency. The company says that its entire supply is already sold out for the calendar year 2026. But this opportunity is only just starting to heat up. Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra expects the market for data center HBM to almost triple in value by 2028, reaching $100 billion annually.\nWhile data centers are certainly Micron's biggest opportunity right now, many top manufacturers of personal computers and smartphones are integrating AI capabilities into their latest devices. This is fueling more demand for high-capacity memory in those markets, too.\n\nStory Continues\nDuring Micron's fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended Nov. 27, 2025), 59% of its customers' flagship smartphones needed at least 12 gigabytes of memory. That percentage more than doubled from the year-ago period.\nMicron's data center revenue is soaring Micron generated a record $13.6 billion in revenue during its fiscal 2026 first quarter, which was up 56% year over year. But the real growth story was beneath the surface of the headline number, because revenue from the company's cloud memory segment (where it accounts for data center HBM sales) doubled to $5.3 billion.\n\nSince Micron is experiencing so much demand for its chips, it had incredible pricing power during Q1, which led to improved profit margins across its entire business. As a result, the company generated earnings of $4.60 per share, which was a whopping 175% jump from the year-ago period.\nMicron's momentum is still picking up steam. According to its latest guidance, the company expects to generate $18.7 billion in revenue during the current fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ends Feb. 28, 2026), representing an increase of 132% year over year. In other words, Micron's top-line growth rate is poised to more than double from Q1.\nThe company also anticipates a blockbuster bottom-line result in Q2, with earnings of $8.19 per share potentially in the cards. That would be a mind-blowing 480% increase year over year.\n\nMicron stock looks cheap compared to Nvidia stock Out of the 43 analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal , 30 have given Micron stock a buy rating. Nine others are in the overweight (bullish) camp, while three recommend holding. Although one analyst has given the stock an underweight (bearish) rating, none recommend outright selling.\nThe analysts have an average price target of $308.11, suggesting that the stock could climb by 16% over the next 12 to 18 months. However, the Street-high target of $500 implies an even bigger potential return of 88%.\n\nI think both of those targets are realistic because Micron stock looks like a bargain right now, despite tripling in value so far in 2025. Based on the company's trailing 12-month earnings of $10.52 per share, its stock is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 25.2. That means it's significantly cheaper than Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/E ratio of 44.8 as I write this.\nAs I highlighted earlier, Nvidia uses Micron's data center HBM solutions in its latest GPUs, so if you expect Nvidia to continue selling truckloads of chips (which is likely), then it's only logical to be extremely bullish on Micron's business as well.\nI wouldn't recommend selling Nvidia stock , because it also looks attractive right now. But Micron stock could be an even better way for investors to play the AI boom in 2026 from a value perspective.\n\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now?

      "Content": "Bull of the Day: Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nEthan Feller\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:30 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nI run screens and conduct research every day, looking for high-quality companies with strong growth profiles and reasonable valuations, and Nvidia ( NVDA ) consistently stands out. Few companies sit as squarely at the center of today’s most important secular trend.\nDemand for Nvidia’s GPUs appears either secular or, if cyclical, still early enough that a downturn is not yet a concern. Roughly half a trillion dollars is expected to flow into AI-related capital spending next year, and Nvidia’s chips are estimated to account for roughly 20% of that investment. That scale underscores both the company’s dominance and the durability of its demand backdrop.\n\nAfter several months of consolidation, Nvidia shares have begun to reaccelerate, recently breaking out from a well-defined technical pattern. At the same time, analysts have continued to raise earnings estimates, earning the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) . Improving clarity around US–China semiconductor trade policies has also removed a near-term overhang, reopening a source of demand that had previously been constrained.\nBelow, we outline the outlook for the world’s largest publicly traded company and explain why Nvidia remains well positioned to continue leading the market going forward.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia Shares Bolstered by Strong Growth Forecasts Growth expectations for Nvidia remain exceptional. Sales are projected to rise roughly 63% next year and another 43% in 2027, reflecting an incredible $100 billion jump from one year to the next. On the bottom line, earnings are expected to climb 55.5% next year and 53% the following year, underscoring the company’s powerful operating leverage.\n\nWhat also makes this growth profile compelling is valuation. Despite its dominance and momentum, Nvidia trades at about 39.5x forward earnings. With consensus estimates calling for 46.3% annual EPS growth over the next three to five years, the stock carries a PEG ratio of roughly 0.85, a level typically associated with undervalued growth stocks, not the world’s most important AI supplier.\nIn other words, investors are not paying a premium commensurate with Nvidia’s growth trajectory. If current forecasts hold, valuation support alone provides a cushion, while continued execution on revenue, margins, and ecosystem expansion offers meaningful upside.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNvidia Stock Breaks Out Nvidia shares staged a decisive breakout this week, resolving higher from a well-defined descending bullish wedge, a pattern that typically signals trend continuation. After several months of consolidation, the stock has clearly regained momentum, suggesting selling pressure has been absorbed and buyers are regaining control.\n\nStory continues\nWith the breakout now confirmed, the technical setup points to a renewed push higher, and a retest of record highs in the near term would not be surprising. Importantly, this move is occurring alongside rising earnings estimates and improving fundamental visibility, reinforcing the signal and increasing the likelihood that the breakout proves durable.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nCan Investors Buy Shares in NVDA? Given the combination of accelerating earnings growth, reasonable valuation relative to its growth profile, and a confirmed technical breakout, Nvidia remains an attractive buy for investors with a medium- to long-term horizon. The stock has spent several months consolidating prior gains, allowing fundamentals to catch up to price, and that process now appears complete.\n\nWhile near-term volatility is always possible, particularly in a stock that has already delivered outsized returns, the underlying setup argues that pullbacks are more likely to be opportunities rather than warning signs. With earnings estimates still moving higher, demand visibility extending well into next year, and technical momentum turning decisively positive, Nvidia continues to justify its leadership position in the market and remains the core holding in the AI theme.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Sold Nvidia and Palantir and Piled Into One of Wall Street's Hottest Drug Stocks Ahead of 2026\n\nSean Williams, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 1:11 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Quarterly-filed Form 13Fs allow investors to track which stocks Wall Street's savviest money managers are buying and selling.\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller dumped his fund's stakes in AI darlings Nvidia and Palantir -- and profit-taking may not explain the entire story.\nMeanwhile, Duquesne's investment chief has scooped up shares of an inexpensive drugmaker for five consecutive quarters.\n10 stocks we like better than Teva Pharmaceutical Industries ›\n\nFor the better part of the last three years, no trend has garnered more attention on Wall Street than artificial intelligence (AI) . Empowering software and systems with the tools to make split-second decisions, all without the need for human oversight, is a technological advancement that can benefit most industries around the globe -- and the stock market's savviest money managers know it.\nNo later than 45 calendar days following the end of a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F details which stocks Wall Street's brightest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter.\nAs you can imagine, the stock market's AI darlings, graphics processing unit (GPU) titan Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) giant Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) , have been top-tier holdings for several fund managers. But this optimism isn't universal.\nDuquesne Family Office's billionaire boss, Stanley Druckenmiller, exited his fund's positions in Nvidia and Palantir well in advance of 2026 . Instead of focusing on AI, Druckenmiller has been busy piling into one of Wall Street's hottest drug stocks for five consecutive quarters.\n\nBillionaire Stanley Druckenmiller showed Nvidia and Palantir to the door Since the beginning of 2023, Nvidia and Palantir have made their patient shareholders considerably richer. Nvidia became the first public company to reach the $5 trillion market cap plateau earlier this year, while shares of Palantir have climbed by more than 2,900%!\nThese near-parabolic ascents reflect the seemingly sustainable moats that both companies hold dear. Nvidia's Hopper, Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra GPUs have been superior, on a compute basis, to external competition. With AI infrastructure demand outpacing supply, and CEO Jensen Huang intent on bringing a new GPU to market annually, Nvidia hasn't had any trouble charging a premium price for its hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, Palantir's AI-driven Gotham and Foundry SaaS platforms lack one-for-one replacements at scale. Gotham assists the U.S. government and its allies in planning and overseeing military missions, as well as in collecting and analyzing data. The multiyear contracts Palantir has signed with the U.S. government ensure predictable double-digit sales growth and abundant operating cash flow.\n\nLa historia continúa\nDespite these sustainable moats, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller parted ways with both stocks. He jettisoned his fund's remaining stake of 214,060 shares of Nvidia during the September-ended quarter of 2024. As for Palantir, 769,965 shares were shown to the door in a nine-month stretch between July 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025.\n\nDruckenmiller dumping the faces of the AI revolution may represent nothing more than simple profit-taking. According to 13F aggregator WhaleWisdom.com, the average hold time for every security in Duquesne Family Office's fund, as of Sept. 30, was less than seven months. This demonstrates the willingness of its investment chief to take profits when the opportunity presents itself.\nThe concern is that there may be more to this selling activity than just a desire to cash in his chips.\nFor example, history tells us that every game-changing technological advancement over the last three decades, including the internet, genome decoding, nanotechnology, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and the metaverse, has navigated an early stage bubble-bursting event. Although it's impossible to forecast when the music will stop, the common theme has been an overestimation by investors of the adoption rate and/or optimization of a new technology.\n\nWhile Nvidia's and Palantir's sales growth point to robust demand for their respective products and services, most businesses that are aggressively spending on AI have yet to optimize their solutions. In other words, companies deploying AI haven't figured out how to get the highest return out of their investment. It takes time for all technologies to mature and evolve. If an AI bubble forms and subsequently bursts, Nvidia and Palantir stocks would be in trouble.\nFurthermore, the valuations for Wall Street's favorite AI duo are suspect. Historically, price-to-sales (P/S) ratios above 30 for companies at the forefront of next-big-thing innovations have been unsustainable over the long run. Though Nvidia, briefly, topped a P/S ratio of 30 in early November, it's Palantir's P/S ratio of 127, as of the closing bell on Dec. 19, which stands out like a sore thumb.\nDuquesne's billionaire boss has loaded up on shares of this drug stock ahead of 2026 At the other end of the spectrum, Duquesne Family Office's lead investor has continued to scoop up shares of brand-name and generic-drug developer Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE: TEVA) . Shares of Teva have soared by 191% since the beginning of 2024.\nDruckenmiller began loading up on shares of this drug stock during the second half of 2024 and simply hasn't stopped. Between July 1, 2024, and Sept. 30, 2025, 13Fs show:\n\nQ3 2024 : 1,427,950 shares purchased\nQ4 2024 : 7,569,450 shares purchased\nQ1 2025 : 5,882,350 shares purchased\nQ2 2025 : 1,089,189 shares purchased\nQ3 2025 : 625,000 shares purchased (16,593,935 total shares held)\nIn 15 months, Teva has become the third-largest holding by market value in the nearly $4.1 billion fund Druckenmiller oversees.\nOne reason for this optimism likely has to do with Teva working through a series of legal overhangs. In particular, the company resolved litigation in early 2023 with 48 states regarding its role in the opioid crisis. Quantifying this settlement and spreading it out over 13 years alleviated the company's financial concerns, allowing investors to refocus on Teva's innovative capabilities.\nSpeaking of innovation, CEO Richard Francis has made waves by shifting his company's focus toward novel drug development. While Teva continues to be a key player in the global generic drug market, the pricing power of generics hasn't been great for years. Developing brand-name therapies affords Teva improved pricing power and considerably higher margins. For instance, in 2025, tardive dyskinesia drug Austedo is expected to bring in more than $2 billion in global sales.\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical has also vastly improved its balance sheet over the last nine years.\nFollowing the buyout of generic drug company Actavis in August 2016, Teva's net debt surpassed $35 billion. But under the leadership of turnaround specialist CEO Kare Schultz, who preceded Richard Francis, the company lowered its annual operating expenses, sold off non-core assets, and significantly reduced its net debt. As of the end of the third quarter of 2025, Teva's net debt has been more than halved to $14.6 billion.\nLastly, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller was likely drawn to Teva's valuation amid a historically expensive stock market. Though it's trading at a still-reasonable 11 times forward-year earnings per share, as of this writing, Duquesne's billionaire boss began scooping up shares with Teva trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio as low as 5.\n\nShould you buy stock in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries right now?

On December 22, Reuters reported that Nvidia has told its Chinese clients that it aims to start shipping its H200 AI chips to China before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February.\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, the AI chipmaker will fulfil initial orders from existing stock, with shipments anticipated to total 5,000 to 10,000 chip modules.

      "Content": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 10 Years?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's business model has become extremely overexposed to the generative AI hardware market.\nCan new tech trends like autonomous driving, robotics, and quantum computing boost diversification?\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe most resilient businesses constantly reinvent themselves, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is an excellent example of this phenomenon. Its ability to quickly dominate new technology opportunities is a big reason why it has soared to become the largest company in the world with a market cap of $4.4 trillion. And even though generative artificial intelligence (AI) is behind most of the recent expansion, the boom might not last forever. Let's explore what might come next for this legendary chipmaker.\n\nNvidia has a track record of reinventing itself Since its founding in 1993, Nvidia has reliably banked on new use cases for the graphics processing unit (GPU) -- a technology that it named and pioneered for its proficiency in parallel processing, which involves breaking down large tasks into smaller parts and working on them simultaneously. Parallel processing turned out to be extremely useful for rendering video game graphics. And in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Nvidia became a major player in the industry, supplying consumer GPU chips for PCs and even Microsoft 's early Xbox gaming consoles.\n\nNvidia boomed again in the 2010s when people realized that its GPUs were also extremely good at cryptocurrency mining . Cryptocurrency miners relied on the same PC-focused GPUs as gaming, and both growth drivers were included in the company's gaming segment, which was historically the bulk of revenue. However, things have changed.\nWith the growth of generative AI, Nvidia's once-vital gaming segment has become an afterthought, representing a measly 7.5% of the company's $57 billion in third-quarter revenue. The company is now massively dependent on its data center segment, where it sells large enterprise-focused GPU systems to help clients run and train AI large language models (LLMs). This business represented around 90% of Q3 revenue, which suggests Nvidia lacks diversification and is extremely overexposed to a potential slowdown in this particular market.\n\nThe generative AI boom might not last forever While AI-related demand continues to soar year over year, some cracks are forming in the foundation of this opportunity. For starters, many of Nvidia's customers are burning through mountains of cash -- the best example is OpenAI. The ChatGPT creator is estimated to have lost $11.5 billion in its most recent quarter alone. And analysts at Deutsche Bank think the situation could worsen with combined losses totaling $140 billion between 2024 and 2029. It's reasonable to assume that other LLM companies like Anthropic could be experiencing similar cash burn.\n\nStory Continues\nAs a hardware provider, Nvidia operates on the picks and shovels side of the AI equation, shielding it from the challenges faced by some of its clients. That said, over the long term, this will eventually become Nvidia's problem, too. If the LLM clients continue burning money, they could run out of the funds needed to continue buying Nvidia hardware.\nCompared to pure plays like OpenAI, Nvidia's hyperscaler clients like Amazon , Google , and Microsoft are in a better position to absorb AI losses because of their diversified business models. However, over time, their shareholders could push back at their current levels of GPU spending. Furthermore, these companies are turning into major rivals for Nvidia because of their investments in custom chip design.\n\nThis month, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI signed a deal with Amazon to use its chips for training AI workloads. This development follows a similar agreement with Google.\nWhat comes next for Nvidia? Nvidia's challenges seem to be reflected in its rock-bottom forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23. This valuation is low considering the company's strong growth, and it suggests the market is nervous about the sustainability of Nvidia's current business model. Over the next ten years, the company might have to reinvent itself yet again. The good news is that there are some compelling options.\n\nIn Q3, revenue in Nvidia's automotive and robotics segment grew 32% to $592 million. While this is a drop in the bucket compared to its total business, this could become a key growth driver if self-driving cars and humanoid robots become an important part of daily life.\nThe company is also working on quantum computing chips called quantum processing units (QPUs), which could help with things like materials science and drug discovery. That said, this all remains quite speculative, and investors may want to wait for more signs that Nvidia is diversifying its business model before considering a position in the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

It was already a star stock before AI transformed the world as we know it, but it was relatively obscure outside the investing community.\n\nThat focus put it into an excellent position to support the growth of generative AI, which requires the kind of power that Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) provide, although there are many competitors today, including other kinds of chips like Alphabet 's Tensor Processing Units (TPU) and Broadcom 's application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC). However, it's a lot more than GPUs these days, and it continues to stay ahead of the curve and launch new products and systems. Its clients are reliant on its CUDA (compute unified device architecture) software and vertically integrated program that creates a robust economic moat; users are already invested in its systems.\nThis ecosystem is Nvidia's edge, and this is where the company is investing. It has incredible opportunities in data centers, which are huge AI factories using a suite of Nvidia services. These generate the compute and inference power necessary to process the huge data loads that make AI happen.\n\nIt recently rolled out a line of quantum computing hardware, including supercomputers that harness the power of quantum processing units (QPU). These kinds of integrated and hybrid solutions, in which it excels and has an unparalleled program, are fast becoming Nvidia's niche.\nDespite new competition, it still can't keep up with consumer demand. Sales increased 62% year over year in the 2026 fiscal third quarter (ended Oct. 26), and management is expecting sales to increase 65% in the fourth quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nThat's why it continues to report incredible growth, quarter after quarter. And because it has such a lead in its space, it can price its products at a high gross margin, which translates into a healthy and growing bottom line; gross margin was 73.6% in the third quarter, and earnings per share (EPS) were up from $0.81 to $1.30.\n\nCan Nvidia keep up its growth? Turning $10,000 into $1 million implies growing it a hundredfold, or 10,000%. Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world today, worth $4.3 trillion. It doesn't seem possible for it to gain 10,000% at its stage today, even very far off into the future.\nStock gains typically follow percentage growth, and although Nvidia is still reporting impressive growth, it's hard to imagine it being able to sustain that momentum in percentage terms, even if it keeps increasing in dollar terms. For example, it has $187 billion in trailing-12-month revenue. At a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of even 30% over the next 10 years, which is well below where it's holding today, sales would surpass $2.5 trillion, which doesn't seem like a likely outcome; at some point, the growth rate must decline. As growth slows down, stock gains are going to as well.\n\nEven this year, Nvidia stock is up 35%. While that's still about double the stock market's gain, it's a steep deceleration from the past two years.\nI don't envision a $10,000 investment in Nvidia stock turning into $1 million at this stage, but it could still deliver market-beating results for the growth-oriented investor.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "SoundHound AI vs. GitLab: Which Stock Is the Better 2026 Rebound Candidate?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:26 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SOUN\n\nGTLB\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points SoundHound AI and GitLab both saw their stocks underperform in 2025.\nSoundHound has a big opportunity with voice-powered artificial intelligence (AI) agents.\nInvestors are overestimating the potential negative impact of AI on GitLab and underestimating its opportunity.\n10 stocks we like better than SoundHound AI ›\n\nThe stocks of SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) and GitLab (NASDAQ: GTLB) have both had a rough go in 2025. The former trades down more than 40% on the year, as of this writing, while the latter has lost more than 30% of its value.\nHowever, both stocks could be poised to rebound in 2026. Let's take a close look to see which one has the better opportunity to outperform next year.\nThe case for SoundHoundAI SoundHound's underperformance in 2025 has more to do with investors learning that Nvidia exited the position it took in the stock in Q4 2024 than it does with the company's actual performance. SoundHound has been growing its revenue rapidly, with it more than doubling through the first nine months of the year.\n\nThe company has established itself as a leader in voice artificial intelligence (AI) , as its \"speech-to-meaning\" and \"deep meaning understanding\" technology can understand someone's intent even before they are finished talking, allowing it to interact with people in a more natural and flowing way. This helped it gain strong traction in the automobile industry, where vehicle makers were looking for better AI voice assistants, as well as the restaurant industry.\nHowever, as we enter 2026, the company's biggest opportunity is with voice-powered AI agents. The company acquired a company called Amelia, which was strong in virtual agents, and has since combined the two companies' technologies to make a push with AI voice-powered agents. Amelia also brought with it a solid customer base in different verticals, such as retail, financial services, and healthcare.\n\nSoundHound is now pushing its AI agent technology with the rollout of its Amelia 7 platform. Amelia has some low- gross-margin customers, so this new platform is also an opportunity to improve the margins at Amelia's legacy customers.\nThe case for GitLab Like SoundHound, GitLab's stock performance in 2025 wasn't really reflective of its operating results. The company has grown its revenue by between 25% to 35% for each of the last nine quarters, showing its strong consistency.\nHowever, the company has been subject to the narrative that it will be an AI loser, with the notion that AI agents will replace coders. For those unfamiliar with GitLab, it runs a DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) platform, which is a secure environment for organizations to create software. The bearish argument is that with AI, organizations will reduce their number of programmers, which will hurt GitLab and its seat-based subscription model.\n\nStory Continues\nThus far, that hasn't been the case, with the company continuing to both add new customers and see strong growth with existing customers, as reflected in its 119% dollar-based net retention over the past 12 months. Any number above 100% reflects growth from customers who have been with the company for a year or more, after any churn.\n\nIronically, the bulk of this growth has come from seat expansions, which is exactly what bears are betting will start to deteriorate. It hasn't, but the stock nonetheless hasn't been able to shake the bearish case.\nHowever, the company has also been taking steps to protect itself if such a scenario unfolds. It recently introduced a hybrid seat-plus-usage-based model, which should also help drive growth. The company's solution has become more valuable with the introduction of its own AI tools, such as Duo Agent, and it is now much more of a comprehensive end-to-end software development life cycle (SDLC) platform that saves coders time and customers money.\nMeanwhile, the stock is very attractively valued, trading at a price-to-sales multiple of just 5.7 times fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027) analyst estimates for a company with high 80% gross margins and strong mid-20% revenue growth.\n\nThe verdict I think that SoundHound and GitLab can both nicely rebound in 2026. However, my pick to outperform is GitLab.\nI think the market is overestimating the potential negative impact of AI on GitLab and underestimating its opportunity. I think the platform is sticky (as evidenced by its net dollar retention), and that the new pricing model could be a nice growth driver, as will continued Duo Agent adoption, which nicely expands ARPU (average revenue per user).\n\nMeanwhile, there aren't going to be all these AI agents running around unchecked, as they too will need to be managed and audited within the confines of a centralized platform like the one offered by GitLab. The stock is too cheap, and I think the bear case fades away with another year of strong revenue growth.\nShould you buy stock in SoundHound AI right now?

Stocking stuffers tend to range from gift cards and gadgets to corny holiday-themed sweaters. But just imagine if you’d unwrapped $10,000 worth of Nvidia (NVDA) stock last December instead of a nice pair of socks.\nThat wouldn’t just be a lovely gift. It would be a gift that keeps on giving.\n\nMore News from Barchart Will Tesla Stock Lose Its ‘Elon Musk Premium’ After the SpaceX IPO? And You Should Sell TSLA Here?\n‘Top Pick’ Amazon Had a Dismal Year: What’s AMZN Stock’s Forecast for 2026?\nApple Just Released a New AI Model. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Here?\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nNvidia is riding high on the back of the global artificial intelligence boom, and the company’s value has maintained a steady and impressive upward trajectory throughout the year.\nSo, how much would that gift be worth today? And more importantly, what does Nvidia’s performance in 2025 tell us about investor expectations moving into 2026?\nThe Math: What $10,000 of Nvidia at Christmas 2024 Would Be Worth Now Before we look at why this year was a watershed for Nvidia (and the entire semiconductor market), let’s crunch the numbers.\nNvidia’s shares were trading in the neighborhood of $140 each last Christmas. That means an initial $10,000 investment would have bagged you about 71.4 shares.\nNow, fast-forward to December 2025. Nvidia’s rally hasn’t slowed down. The company continues to beat earnings forecasts and remains dominant in the AI sector. The market is loving it.\n\nOn Monday morning, Nvidia’s shares were trading at $180.99. That would make your 71.4 shares from last year worth just over $12,922. You’re looking at a 29% gain.\nOK: That’s nothing like the rally Nvidia saw in 2024, and it doesn’t compare with the run we’ve seen from fellow AI wunderkind Palantir (PLTR) this year. But 29% is still nothing to scoff at, right?\nThe truth is Nvidia’s 2025 rally hasn’t been a smooth journey.\nWhat Has 2025 Looked Like for Nvidia? This has generally been a good year for Nvidia investors. But 2025 wasn’t without its ups and downs.\nIn 2024, the company executed a split that made its shares a lot more accessible to retail investors. But that liquidity didn’t just boost accessibility. It also expanded Nvidia’s investor base and created extra demand for shares. That meant less free float and more upward pressure on its share prices.\n\nNvidia’s sales teams were also dealing with high demand.\nEvery corporation wants a taste of AI right now. It’s become embedded in the infrastructure of enterprise computing, cloud services, and generative models everywhere. Over the past couple of years, Nvidia’s GPUs have emerged as the default hardware for a lot of large-scale models and inference workloads.\n\nStory Continues\nThat’s why its revenues from data center sales eclipsed every other business segment in 2025, driving consecutive earnings beats and pushing Nvidia to become the world’s most valuable company (for a little while, anyway).\nIt seems like a lot of investors just treated Nvidia shares as a proxy for AI exposure in 2025. And that confidence was only increased when management initiated a buyback program.\n\nBut Nvidia’s been a victim of market volatility this year. That has more to do with speculation surrounding a broader AI bubble rather than the company’s fundamentals.\nIn November, price action saw some big pullbacks. Michael Burry bought almost $200 million in put options against Nvidia, and he’s not the only one betting against the company’s value. That’s why 2026 may be a make-or-break year for shareholders.\nWhat’s on the Horizon for Nvidia in 2026? Now that 2025 is nearly in the rearview mirror, market chatter has already started for 2026. The key issue for Nvidia is the balance between AI adoption and saturation.\nEverybody agrees that AI adoption is real. But many investors like Burry are now debating its breadth and pace. To maintain its value and sustain sales, Nvidia needs industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services to accelerate their GPU deployments. If growth shifts to software layers over hardware, Nvidia is likely to be hurt.\n\nThen there’s competition dynamics. AI chip makers aren’t sitting still. If competitors generate meaningful gains, it’ll force Nvidia to accelerate its own R&D (or defend its pricing). The problem? Its margins are already under pressure.\nHigh-growth companies tend to see expanding margins as they scale up. But sustained investment pushes costs higher, too. There’s a good chance retail investors will get tired of Nvidia’s steep run, and then the narrative could shift to profit-taking instead of accumulation.\nThat wouldn’t necessarily be a bearish signal, but it would be a significant rotation dynamic leading to more price volatility.\nAt the end of the day, a $10,000 Christmas gift of Nvidia stock in 2024 would have generated good tidings in the here and now. Nvidia wasn’t just hype in 2025, and the company delivered measurable growth over the last 12 months.\n\nBut looking ahead into the New Year, the picture is a little bit fuzzier. The sentiment for 2026 is one of cautious optimism because AI isn’t slowing down. But the competition in this space is huge, and a lot of big-time investors are already pricing Nvidia’s next chapter. They’re actively betting against Nvidia and the wider AI boom.\nOnly time will tell if those bets pay off, because right now Nvidia is still looking like the Christmas gift that keeps on giving.\nOn the date of publication, Nash Riggins did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Apple spent 2025 setting itself up for the future — and its biggest moves weren't about AI\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nSSNLF\n\nIt’s been quite a year for Apple ( AAPL ). The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ).\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta ( META ) Reality Labs' new design studio .\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times , Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\nCook is steering a $4 trillion behemoth Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nStory Continues\nCook's decisions drove Apple's stock price ever higher. As a result, the company's market cap has increased from $1 trillion in 2018 to a whopping $4 trillion in 2025.\nRevenue has also continued its steady upward pace, with Apple reporting $416 billion in total sales for its fiscal 2025, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nApple is also reportedly preparing some of the biggest changes in years to its iPhone lineup in 2026. According to Gurman , the company will roll out a foldable iPhone, a first for Apple, in the latter half of the year.\n\nThat could help further goose already record iPhone sales. Apple is also reportedly preparing a new low-cost MacBook model, which would open up the company to a broader customer segment.\nAnd while it may not have the same margins as a high-powered MacBook Pro, a lower-cost MacBook could still help draw more customers to Apple's services, driving increased revenue over the long run.\n\nNew challenges ahead If Ternus is chosen to succeed Cook, he'll inherit an Apple at the peak of its power. While smartphone sales have slowed over time, the company is reaping the benefits of its massive install base, which still upgrades devices every few years and increasingly subscribes to Apple's various services.\n\nBut he'll also have to navigate his share of headaches. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting some kind of movement on Apple's AI strategy. And though the company is making progress on its AI rollout, it still needs to showcase its next-generation version of Siri.\nHe'll also have to prepare to take on the likes of Meta, Google, and Samsung ( 005930.KS ) in the smart glasses space. Meta already has two smart glasses on the market, and Google and Samsung are each working on their own intelligent eyewear.\nFor now, though, Cook is still Apple's CEO. We'll just have to see if that changes in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Which Tech Titan Will Win the Quantum Race (and Net You 100% Returns)?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:43 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points You can pick small quantum computing stocks if you want high-risk, high-reward plays.\nBut tech giants are safer plays, and Nvidia's AI chips are pivotal for the quantum build-out.\nNvidia's NVentures is buying stakes in various quantum companies as part of its strategy.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nBig tech's scramble to win the artificial intelligence (AI) race has taken some of the focus off quantum computing stocks and a potential upcoming boom. Last year, the Boston Consulting Group projected that quantum computing can create up to $850 billion of economic value by 2040. Tech giants have invested heavily in the space, with Google's Willow Chip being able to reduce errors exponentially.\nIt's unknown when quantum computing will have mainstream applications, but if this technology is perfected, it will be able to perform complex calculations and solve major problems that current computing can't. Quantum computing could result in major drug discoveries, encrypted codes getting solved, and business optimizations.\nQuantum computing means new chips and data centers. AI chips and data centers that handle AI workloads are not suitable for a quantum computing boom. That means many of the AI winners could also turn into quantum computing winners.\nSo, investing in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might be the best way to ride the quantum boom. Even with its current successes, Nvidia can still double from current levels if it gets quantum computing right. Let's see why.\nNvidia is already working on quantum Nvidia won't get caught behind other chipmakers in the upcoming quantum race. The company has established a reputation as the best AI chipmaker , and it's already set on becoming a leader in the quantum industry.\nNvidia recently announced NVQLink, which bridges the gap from AI chips to quantum computers. The company has already partnered with 17 quantum builders and nine scientific labs for this project. It's developing the software and digital infrastructure that will be necessary for a quantum boom.\n\nWhile Nvidia isn't developing a quantum chip right now, that may change as quantum computing gets closer to mainstream use. AI chips are already necessary for quantum infrastructure, but quantum chips are more advanced and are also needed. Quantum data centers will need both types of chips. Nvidia is already the clear winner on the AI side, and it has more money than its competitors to invest into research and development for quantum chips.\nNvidia is also investing in quantum computing companies Nvidia isn't just advancing its own quantum computing technology, but it is also buying stakes in quantum computing companies through NVentures. The company's venture capital arm invested in three quantum computing companies in the first half of 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nEven if Nvidia doesn't capitalize on quantum computing as much as expected, its investments can still pay off. Nvidia can also provide those companies with some of the resources they need to achieve higher returns.\nQuantum computing stocks like IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum show how much quantum computing investments can soar in a short time. All three of these growth stocks have rallied by more than 1,000% over the past three years. Those types of gains make it more plausible for Nvidia to double in value as quantum computing becomes a mainstream resource.\n\nNvidia wins regardless of which quantum computing companies win Nvidia isn't trying to create an innovative business that revolves around quantum computing. It's just selling picks and shovels in the middle of a gold rush. Nvidia produces the digital infrastructure and chips for companies that want to build out business models involving quantum computing.\n\nIf Nvidia wants to make quantum chips and additional tools for the industry, it can tap into a strong balance sheet and growing revenue. Nvidia generated $57 billion of revenue in its fiscal 2026's third quarter, up by 62% year over year. Net income came in at $31.8 billion, which represents a 59% increase. Nvidia makes more profits per quarter than the market caps of pure-play quantum computing stocks like IonQ.\nNvidia also closed out the quarter with $116.5 billion in total current assets. The AI chipmaker already has a lead in quantum since it has the best AI chips. However, it has plenty of capital ready to go if it wants to make a bigger push into quantum computing.\nSmaller quantum computing stocks may outperform Nvidia, but the latter already has a proven business model that brings in cold, hard cash.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $502,783 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,126,057 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 975 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

Could the Stock Surge Next?\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: APLD\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Applied Digital is in the right place at the right time as AI spending ramps up.\nIts ability to achieve projects on time and on budget may help it win over the trust of big tech companies.\nA single deal could add billions of dollars to Applied Digital's balance sheet, and the company is in a position to sign several big deals.\n10 stocks we like better than Applied Digital ›\n\nArtificial intelligence is revolutionizing the world. AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT quickly became mainstream, with autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots on the way. All of these innovations require AI chips, which is why investors have been loading up on semiconductor stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom .\nThese AI chips work, but there's one big problem. They all require significant power to operate. AI models and innovations require gigawatts to operate, and traditional data centers aren't cutting it. Those buildings aren't optimized for AI workloads, and that's where AI data center providers like Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) come in.\nApplied Digital has roughly 4 gigawatts worth of data center capacity at the moment, and that could translate into billions of dollars in annual recurring revenue once it's all set up and deals have been established. Applied Digital has already entered three lease agreements with CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) , with the total revenue coming to approximately $11 billion over 15 years.\nThe leases cover 400 megawatts, and Applied Digital's 4 gigawatt pipeline suggests the company could support nine additional deals like the CoreWeave contract. Here's why Applied Digital could expand beyond CoreWeave and continue to win over tech giants.\nThe AI race is intense The key players in the AI race have all committed to spending more money on this technology. Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon , and Meta Platforms are some of the top players in the industry. These companies generate billions of dollars in quarterly profits and view AI as the next internet boom.\nAI models, autonomous vehicles , and humanoid robots have the potential to change how people shop and interact with the world. Companies know the potential of AI and have already thrown a lot of money at Nvidia. Now, they are increasingly looking at the energy bottleneck that companies like Applied Digital solve.\n\nRight now, Applied Digital makes almost all of its AI revenue from CoreWeave. Other AI data center providers like Iren (NASDAQ: IREN) and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ: CIFR) have made deals with Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and other tech companies. It's fair to assume Applied Digital will land deals like that in the future, especially since it has proven to be a trustworthy option for CoreWeave.\n\nStory Continues\nApplied Digital is a leading data center builder Timelines are critical for maintaining a lead in the AI race, and Applied Digital is doing its part. The AI data center provider told investors that its 100 MW building at Polaris Forge 1 is nearing completion while remaining on time and on budget.\nFulfilling project benchmarks will help Applied Digital build more trust with tech giants. Applied Digital Chairman and CEO Wes Cummins also views it that way.\n\n\"We feel this third lease validates our platform and execution, positioning Applied Digital as a trusted strategic partner to the world's largest technology companies,\" Cummins said in the Q3 press release. \"With hyperscalers expected to invest approximately $350 billion into AI deployment this year, we believe we are in a prime position to serve as the modern-day picks and shovels of the intelligence era.\"\nApplied Digital's 4-gigawatt pipeline also puts it ahead of most AI data center stocks. Iren has approximately 3 gigawatts in its pipeline, while Cipher Mining has 3.2 gigawatts in its pipeline. Applied Digital has the lead, which will come in handy once data centers are built and tech companies scramble to sign big deals.\n\nNew deals can happen quickly and suddenly change the long-term view Applied Digital has a 15-year contract with CoreWeave for $11 billion that covers 400 megawatts. It's a big contract, but it's not the only one in the industry. Iren signed a five-year, $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft for 200 megawatts. Cipher Mining also signed a 15-year deal with Amazon Web Services for $5.5 billion, and that contract covers 300 megawatts.\n\nA single deal adds billions of dollars to an AI data center provider's revenue. These are long-term agreements that result in steady recurring revenue. When Applied Digital has all 4 gigawatts ready to go, it can support enough deals to make billions of dollars each year. The company may have only made $64 million in Q1 FY26, but revenue growth should compound quickly based on the CoreWeave leases and future deals. That development sets the stage for Applied Digital stock to continue its rally.\nShould you buy stock in Applied Digital right now?

      "Content": "What Is One of the Best Chip Stocks to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nDavid Moadel\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 11:26 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nBABAF\n\nBABA\n\nNVDA\n\nQuick Read Alibaba (BABA) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) MI308 AI accelerators.\nAMD stock looks compelling as Advanced Micro Devices recently demonstrated 35.6% year-over-year revenue growth and 61.2% income growth.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nOver the next decade, you'll surely want to own at least one artificial intelligence (AI) chip stock. You might assume that all you need is NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) stock and nothing else. However, even though NVIDIA is the market's darling, your best pick could actually be Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ) stock.\nEven though it's a giant company, Advanced Micro Devices is an underdog in some respects. Unlike NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices isn't a member of the Magnificent Seven group of highly favored U.S. mega-cap stocks.\nThis isn't to suggest that buying and holding AMD stock for 10 years is a risk-free investment. Right now, we'll tackle the red flags that must be acknowledged for long-term Advanced Micro Devices shareholders. In the end, though, you may be open to a buy-and-hold share position as Advanced Micro Devices is a chipmaking challenger with hyper-scaling potential.\n\nIssues With AMD Stock One possible deal-breaker for income investors is that AMD stock doesn't pay a dividend. Consequently, you'll need the share price to rise in order to make a profit.\nMeanwhile, value investors might take issue with Advanced Micro Devices' valuation. Specifically, the company has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 113x .\n\nIn addition, AMD stock is already up 135% over the past five years. Given the triple-digit P/E ratio and the stock's price action, some value investors may not be willing to take a chance on Advanced Micro Devices.\nThose are valid objections, but to be fair, Advanced Micro Devices stock just pulled back nearly 20% from $167. Since the stock has a good track record of recovering from drawdowns, there appears to be a dip-buying opportunity here.\nBesides, if Advanced Micro Devices is a robust revenue and earnings grower, then the high P/E ratio don't have to be a deal-breaker. With that in mind, let's perform a thorough checkup on Advanced Micro Devices' financial health.\nBooming Sales, Zooming Profits Advanced Micro Devices' high P/E ratio and lack of a dividend are legitimate reasons to reduce your position size in AMD stock. Nevertheless, you'll probably leave a lot of money on the table if you don't own some shares of Advanced Micro Devices during the next 10 years.\n\nStory Continues\nAll in all, Advanced Micro Devices is an undeniable sales and income grower. To prove this point, we can observe the company's results from the quarter ended September 27, 2025.\nImpressively, Advanced Micro Devices' net revenue grew 35.6% year over year, from $6.819 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $9.246 billion. Nearly half of that revenue stemmed from Advanced Micro Devices' Data Center segment; this suggests that the company continues to benefit from AI-associated sales.\n\nTurning to the bottom-line results, Advanced Micro Devices' net income surged 61.2%, from $771 in the year-earlier quarter to $1.243 billion. Also during that time frame, the company's cash and cash equivalents increased 27%, from $3.787 billion to $4.808 billion. So evidently, Advanced Micro Devices remains a cash-rich chipmaker that's on a powerful growth trajectory.\nMaking Headway in China While U.S. chip sales are crucial to Advanced Micro Devices' business model, it definitely appears that the company is making headway in China's chip market. To be more specific, Alibaba ( NASDAQ:BABA ) is considering purchasing 40,000 to 50,000 of Advanced Micro Devices' MI308 AI accelerators.\n\nThis is important because investors need to think globally, not just locally, over the next 10 years. China is a major chip market, and Advanced Micro Devices has a long-term growth opportunity there.\nAdvanced Micro Devices made a savvy move in designing its MI308 chips to be compatible with export restrictions. Furthermore, the company has secured export licenses for these chips and is prepared to pay a 15% fee to the U.S. on approved sales in China.\nAlso, it's a positive sign that Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su recently met with Chinese Commerce ​Minister Wang ‌Wentao in Beijing. They \"exchanged views on the company's business ⁠development in ​China and ​strengthening cooperation with China,\" according to the ‍ministry.\n\nSure, NVIDIA is also making headway into China's chip market. At the same time, however, NVDA stock may have already priced in the company's progress in this region.\nIn contrast, Advanced Micro Devices' growth story in China is still developing and the market needs time to recognize this. Give it a few years, and you should see AMD stock reflect strong chip sales in both the U.S. and China.\nGive AMD Stock a Chance In the final analysis, there's no need to overload your portfolio with AMD stock. Just holding a moderately sized share position for 10 years will, most likely, put you in a profitable position without undue risk.\nWhile Advanced Micro Devices doesn't pay a dividend and appears overvalued at first glance, I still encourage you to give the company a chance. If AI chip sales remain strong and Advanced Micro Devices keeps on growing its sales and profits, there's an attractive reward-to-risk profile here for buy-and-hold investors.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

Nowadays, many investors find themselves having that thought about Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- me included. And when you look at its performance over the past decade, it's very easy to see why.\nIn the past 10 years, Nvidia's stock is up an eye-popping 22,420%, meaning a $1,000 investment made a decade ago would be worth over $225,000. Talk about a return on investment.\nNvidia has been on the stock market since January 1999, but the bulk of its gains since then have come in the past few years, thanks to the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. For a while, Nvidia's main business was supplying graphics cards for video games. However, the company realized that the same technology was useful for processing massive amounts of data, and it's now arguably the most important supplier of computing power.\n\nIf you're interested in investing in Nvidia, it's not too late. However, I wouldn't expect its gains over the next decade to compare with those from this past decade. It still has long-term market-beating potential, but expecting the gains to replicate is asking a lot.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Google is less than $200B away from surpassing Apple as the world’s second-largest company.\nGoogle holds four of the top 10 AI models on LLMArena. OpenAI’s best model ranks eighth.\nMeta is negotiating billions in purchases of Google’s TPUs. Anthropic already bought 1 million TPUs from Google instead of buying from Nvidia (NVDA).\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) as the world's second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street.\nThere are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI \"replacing\" the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals.\n\nLet's take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026.\nGoogle is firing on all cylinders Google was supposed to \"die\" after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can.\nThen, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI \"Bard\" rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in \"code red\" mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards.\n\nIf you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI's sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each.\nIf you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI's GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn't spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) have gone into net debt.\nWhy Google's search business will never be replaced If Google's rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated.\nAs for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with.\n\nIn contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it.\nNvidia's AI GPUs at risk? Software isn't Alphabet's only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia's near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient.\nMeta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth \"billions of dollars,\" with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia's coffers instead.\n\nThe threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google's AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating.\nCould Google become the biggest company in 2026? I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world's largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030.\n\nNvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Applied Digital vs. CoreWeave: Better Stock to Own in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 9:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CRWV\n\nAPLD\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points CoreWeave and Applied Digital both had strong performances in 2025.\nDemand for CoreWeave's AI cloud services is through the roof.\nApplied Digital, meanwhile, is providing the specialized buildings and access to power for neocloud providers.\n10 stocks we like better than Applied Digital ›\nWhile Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) and CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) both saw their stocks go on roller-coaster rides in 2025, they were also two of the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) stock winners this year. The two companies also have close ties, as CoreWeave is a big customer of Applied Digital.\nLet's examine which stock could be set to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for CoreWeave CoreWeave is a next-generation neocloud company. Neocloud operators differ from traditional cloud computing companies in that they are specialized to handle large language model (LLM) training and running AI inference. CoreWeave has a close relationship with Nvidia that gives it access to its newest high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Its main business is essentially renting out GPUs as a service, but it also provides storage, high-speed networking, and managed services.\n\nCurrently, cloud computing demand for AI services is through the roof, and CoreWeave is spending aggressively to try to keep up with demand. It plans to more than double its capital expenditures (capex) next year. The company is currently using an 80/20 joint venture model to grow rapidly while having control over its spending. However, demand is so high that the company has reportedly had to turn away business, including an estimated $40 billion to $50 billion from Microsoft .\nAs long as CoreWeave's data center projects remain on schedule, the company should see hypergrowth in 2026. Citigroup has recently said its checks indicate that the company's capacity is already sold out for 2026, and it's already in discussions with customers for booking out early 2027.\n\nWhile the stock has had a strong run after its initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year, it is still more than 50% off its all-time high hit in the spring. That suggests the stock has plenty of opportunity to run.\nThe case for Applied Digital While CoreWeave operates next-generation data centers, Applied Digital helps build and manage them. It's essentially the builder and landlord. Notably, these are specialized buildings designed to handle the intense heat and power requirements of AI data centers.\nApplied Digital not only handles building the physical shell, but it also designs the cooling systems and provides the power. One of the biggest bottlenecks with building out AI infrastructure is the lack of power; however, that is where Applied Digital shines. The company was previously a Bitcoin miner, so it already had campuses with access to cheap, stable power. Meanwhile, it has said that companies with access to power but without its high-end data center building expertise are increasingly turning to it to team up.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's primary business is colocation, where companies like CoreWeave lease out space and gain access to power at its facilities using their own hardware. In fact, it has an $11 billion contract with CoreWeave for such services. However, it will also rent out GPUs to companies that prefer not to own their own servers.\n\nApplied Digital has close ties to Macquarie , which is helping fund its campus expansion. The company completed phase 1 of the first building at its Polaris Forge 1 campus in North Dakota in late October and its second phase in November, giving CoreWeave access to the first 100 megawatts of power of its 400 megawatt deployment. It also recently signed a $5 billion lease with a customer for its future Polaris 2 campus.\nThe verdict Both CoreWeave and Applied Digital are set to see hypergrowth in 2026 and beyond. Meanwhile, the two companies are pretty intertwined at the moment. That makes it a tough call as to which will outperform next year, but I give the edge to Applied Digital, as access to cheap power is such a valuable resource in today's environment.\n\nShould you buy stock in Applied Digital right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia's H200 AI Chips Get Trump's Nod for China Sales. Will Political Hurdles Derail the Plan?\n\nKara Greenberg\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 8:57 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Takeaways Nvidia reportedly hopes to sell its H200 AI chips in China as soon as February, after winning President Donald Trump's approval in exchange for a 25% revenue-sharing agreement.\nHowever, the chip's export to China could still face challenges in the U.S., as well as in China, injecting uncertainty into expectations around sales.\n\nNvidia finally won President Donald Trump's approval to sell its H200 AI chips in China, but will it be able to seal the deal?\nThe company looks to sell the chip in China as soon as February, Reuters reported Monday, after President Trump greenlighted the chip earlier this month in exchange for a 25% revenue-sharing agreement. But uncertainty over whether U.S. lawmakers or China's government will allow the sales has weighed on investor confidence that the sales will happen.\nThe H200 chip, which is a generation behind Nvidia's Blackwell line , had been banned for sale to China on national security concerns, and its export to the country still faces vocal bipartisan opposition in the U.S., along with potential challenges in China.\n\nWhy This Matters for Investors Caught in the crosshairs of U.S.-China relations, exports of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China remain restricted. The chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom has argued that limiting China's access could hurt America’s competitiveness by driving Chinese firms to develop stronger products.\n\nSince Trump announced the H200 deal in early December, U.S. lawmakers ‌from both parties have pushed back with demands for more oversight and bills that could block sales. On Friday, House Republicans introduced a bill that would allow Congress to block advanced AI chip exports, a day after House Democrats proposed a bill that would prohibit sales of America's most advanced chips to China and other countries of concern.\nChinese officials also have yet to approve H200 sales in the country, with analysts warning China's government could discourage firms from buying the chips, as it has with the H20 , a weaker chip that Trump approved for export earlier this year.\nIn a note to clients Monday, analysts at Jefferies voiced some skepticism about whether the chip would be allowed, and that if it is, whether it could come with additional requirements for Chinese firms or a limited quota system.\n\"We do expect there is considerable opportunity for [Nvidia] if they are permitted to re-enter the market, but at this point it still seems unlikely to happen,\" Jefferies said following the announcement earlier this month.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia shares were up 2% in late-morning trading Tuesday. The stock has gained 40% in 2025, handily outpacing the performance of major stock indexes, but has lost 12% of its value since hitting an all-time high in late October.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "An X-Ray View of the Magnificent Seven\n\nJohn Dorfman\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:38 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBy John Dorfman December 22, 2025 (Maple Hill Syndicate)\nFor the past three years, a huge share of the stock market's action has been in the Magnificent Seven , a small group of super-successful, super-popular stocks.\nThere are signs of fatigue in this leadership group. But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

Now, I I'm sure you saw the photos of Waymo getting stuck in San Francisco with the power outage. And my first thought was, I this is everything that could go wrong with a Tesla Robo-taxi.\n00:27 Dan\nLook, my view is 2026 is going to be probably the most important year, I'd say maybe in its history for Musk and Tesla. Because look, the autonomous chapter now comes to Tesla.\n00:46 Dan\n30 cities where we see robo-taxis, you know, ultimately in the United States. Are there going to be issues? Are there going to be speed bumps? Could there be delays here and there? Yeah, I mean, obviously you saw the blackout in terms of Waymo and San Francisco. But look, I think next three to four years, 20% of vehicles are going to be autonomous. And I think that ultimately is where it's heading. And that's why I think when it comes to physical AI plays, the best physical AI plays in the world are Nvidia and Tesla.\n01:31 Speaker A\nHow much value, Dan, are you assigning to Tesla's robotics initiatives?\n01:41 Dan\nA trillion is what conservatively we view. I mean look, if you, S, if you own Tesla here, you're not owning it for what deliveries look like on Jan 2nd, right? I mean, you're owning it for autonomous Robo-taxis. and we talk about bull case 3 trillion, base case 2 trillion. Now look, if I showed you a year ago where numbers were going to go for Tesla this year, you would have thought the stocks 200, 250 bucks. The reality is that investors are looking through deliveries and near-term numbers to understand what the autonomous chapter is going to ultimately bring. because I could argue numbers could be up 4 or 5X when you look out over the next four, five, six years.

Right present, insiders don't seem very confident in either stock.Even if the transactions went through, analysts still believe both companies are attractive investments. They claim this is because there is still a lot of need for chips for AI and data centers. Shares of Nvidia and Broadcom have gone up by 4.3% and 1.9% in the last week, respectively.As 2026 approaches closer, investors will keep a watch on whether more insiders selling implies the sector is beginning to slow down.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is SoundHound AI Stock a Buy Now?\n\nChris Neiger, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 6:53 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: SOUN\n\nCMG\n\nNVDA\n\n005380.KS\n\nKey Points SoundHound is unprofitable, and some of its core expenses are rising quickly.\nThe company is burning through cash as it tries to carve out a niche in conversational AI.\nSoundHound's stock is expensive, and investors are probably better off avoiding it for right now.\n10 stocks we like better than SoundHound AI ›\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) has captured the attention of artificial intelligence (AI) investors over the past few years because of the company's impressive conversational AI technology. The company has attracted an impressive customer list, including Chipotle and Hyundai, and an initial investment from Nvidia gave the company even more credibility in a sea of other AI stocks .\nBut recently, SoundHound stock has lost its luster. Nvidia sold its stake, and some investors grew concerned about the company's lack of profits, resulting in SoundHound's share price tumbling 43% over the past year. While the recent pullback may seem like a good buying opportunity, here's why investors shouldn't bet on SoundHound AI stock just yet.\n1. The company is unprofitable and expenses are rising SoundHound recently reported its third-quarter results, with the company's revenue rising 68% to $42 million. That was more than the $40 million in revenue that Wall Street had estimated for the quarter, which gave investors some assurance the company was on the right track.\nBut one glaring problem is that SoundHound is still significantly unprofitable and costs are rising. The company reported a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.03 in the quarter, a slight improvement from its loss of $0.04 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nHowever, even with this improvement, it's important to note that SoundHound's expenses are still rising. If we look at SoundHound's third-quarter non-GAAP expenses, which don't include a $66 million non-cash change in liabilities related to acquisitions, there are still considerable rising costs:\nSpending Category\nQ3 2024\nQ3 2025\nYear-Over-Year Increase\nResearch and development\n$19.5 million\n$22.8 million\n17%\nSales and marketing\n$8.4 million\n$16.4 million\n95%\nGeneral and administrative\n$17 million\n$24.3 million\n43%\n\nSource: SoundHound AI.\nWith SoundHound's costs rising so quickly, the company's increasing sales become less impressive, and it's clear the company likely isn't close to being profitable any time soon.\n2. It's burning through cash SoundHound AI is in a highly competitive market, and it's burning through cash to be there. In the first nine months of 2025, SoundHound's free cash flow was negative $78.7 million, which was worse than its negative free cash flow of $76.3 million in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's concerning that, despite SoundHound's rising sales, the company's free cash flow is moving in the wrong direction. The company is failing to achieve operational leverage, as each new dollar it earns costs roughly the same as it did before.\nIt's unclear how long SoundHound will be able to sustain its massive spending to grow the company before it either has to cut back on spending, substantially increase revenue, or raise additional capital. While SoundHound has $269 million in cash and no debt, continued aggressive spending will eventually hurt the company if its losses don't narrow.\n\n3. SoundHound AI's stock is too expensive If all of that weren't enough of a red flag for buying SoundHound AI, its stock is also overpriced. The company's shares have a price-to-sales ratio of about 30 right now, which is very expensive considering the average P/S ratio in the technology sector is about 9.\nAn overpriced AI stock isn't exactly a rarity these days, but plenty of other technology companies are betting big on AI right now and are also profitable. I think it's challenging to justify SoundHound AI's overpriced shares, given its continued spending, increasing expenses, and the company's prolonged path to profitability.\n\nShould you buy stock in SoundHound AI right now?

COR.\n4 Stocks Trading Near 52-Week Highs with More Upside Potential Investors generally consider a stock's 52-week high a good criterion for an entry or exit point. Stocks touching new 52-week highs are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.\nMoreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculation is not absolutely baseless, not all stocks hitting a 52-week high are necessarily overpriced.\n\nInvestors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.\nStocks such as NVIDIA , Ralph Lauren , Expedia and Cencora, Inc. are expected to maintain their momentum and keep scaling new highs. More information on a stock is necessary to determine whether there is scope for further upside.\nHere, we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The technique borrows from the basics of momentum investing and bets on \"buy high, sell higher.\"\n52-Week High: A Good Indicator Many times, stocks that hit a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.\nOvervaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay the premium) has helped them reach this level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions, which encouraged investors to bet on these stocks, could keep them motivated if there are no tangible negatives. In other words, the momentum might continue.\n\nAlso, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their underreaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.\nHere are our four picks out of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen:\nNVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of AI and high-performance accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphics processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA's Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues. This Zacks Rank #1 company's networking business, including NVLink and Spectrum-X, is also contributing to growth by enabling faster and more efficient data movement within AI clusters. These add-ons make NVIDIA's full-stack approach more appealing to enterprises and governments building AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nThe continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with more than 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicle space. We expect NVIDIA's revenues to witness a CAGR of 31% through fiscal 2026-2028.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #1 stock has returned 25.5% in the past six-month period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.77%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA's fiscal 2026 earnings has moved north by 4% to $4.64 per share over the past 60 days.\nRalph Lauren continues to benefit from its iconic brand portfolio, constant product innovations and disciplined execution of its Next Great Chapter strategy. The company is accelerating its digital transformation by enhancing personalization, strengthening data-driven decision-making and delivering seamless omnichannel experiences.\nRalph Lauren is optimizing distribution, strengthening wholesale partnerships and enhancing its retail network to reinforce its premium positioning. The company has been experiencing significant growth in its digital channels across key regions. Leveraging advanced analytics, RL customizes product recommendations, optimizes pricing and sharpens its regional marketing strategies to drive stronger consumer engagement and profitability.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 stock has returned 34% in the past six-month period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.82%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RL's fiscal 2026 earnings has moved north by 3% to $15.41 per share over the past 60 days.\nExpedia 's strong brand portfolio, comprising Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, Travelocity, ebookers and Wotif Group, to name a few, offers a full range of travel and advertising services to travelers, suppliers and business partners. The company benefits from a strong platform model that enhances customer insights, strengthens supplier ties and helps grow revenues.\nExpedia looks like a compelling buy for 2026 following strong third-quarter 2025 results. The company's $7.57 adjusted EPS beat estimates, and gross bookings grew 12%. The company raised its full-year 2025 guidance to 7% bookings growth and doubled EBITDA margin expansion projections to 200 basis points, demonstrating operational excellence.\n\nExpedia's December 2025 acquisition of Tiqets strengthens its B2B segment, which delivered its 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth at 26%. With AI integration enhancing efficiency, hotel bookings surging 15%, and room nights growing 11%, this Zacks Rank #1 company's diversified platform positions it to capitalize on robust travel demand and expanding profit margins throughout 2026.\nThis stock has surged 74.4% in the past six-month period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.53%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EXPE's 2025 earnings has moved north by 6.8% to $15.09 per share over the past 60 days.\nCencora is navigating a pivotal growth phase, balancing robust revenue expansion with structural margin challenges. Specialty expansion, notably through RCA and OneOncology, strengthens its clinical and distribution footprint and boosts higher-margin opportunities. The company recently agreed to acquire a majority of the remaining equity interests in OneOncology — a physician-led national platform that supports independent oncology practices — from TPG and other shareholders for $3.6 billion.\n\nCOR issued its fiscal 2026 adjusted EPS outlook to be in the $17.45-$17.75 range, implying 9-11% growth. Ongoing investments in digital infrastructure, analytics, productivity programs, and strategic growth areas such as specialty distribution and MSO platforms are expected to enhance operational efficiency, deepen customer integration and sustain long-term competitive advantage.\nThis Zacks Rank #2 stock has returned 16.3% in the past six-month period. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.36%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for COR's fiscal 2026 earnings has moved north by 1.4% to $17.62 per share over the past 60 days.\nGet the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

      "Content": "The S&P 500’s Rare 40-Year Valuation Warning: Economic Slowdown Is Confirmed by Federal Reserve\n\nDavid Beren\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:55 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered what can only be described as a strong year to date, extending a rally that has rewarded investors for staying the course through inflation, rate hikes, and geopolitical uncertainty. On the surface, by all accounts, the market looks healthy as stocks continue climbing and corporate earnings remain strong. Similarly, optimism around artificial intelligence and an easier monetary policy has kept an appetite for the stock market intact.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 now trades at 22.4x forward earnings. This valuation has only occurred twice in the past 40 years.\nFederal Reserve research shows tariff policies will reduce annual GDP growth by 0.3% to 0.5% over the next two years.\nProfit margins are near historical highs with limited expansion room while earnings forecasts for 2026 remain modest.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnderneath all of this performance, however, there is something of a growing concern as the same market producing double-digit gains is now trading at approximately 22.4 times forward earnings, a valuation number the country has only seen twice in the last 40 years. At the same time, you have new Federal Reserve research indicating that tariff policies will slow economic growth in a fairly substantial way over the next two years.\nWhen these extremes collide, it's cause for concern, but when combined with weakening fundamentals, history suggests that investors need to pay closer attention, even if the market appears to be mostly calm.\nThe Market Paradox: High Gains Amidst Tariff Uncertainty As you look at the 16% S&P 500 gain year to date, it not only reflects a level of continued optimism but also highlights that there are several key areas worth watching. At the top of any list has to be artificial intelligence, which continues to drive a ton of enthusiasm for technology stocks, particularly for names like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ).\n\nAdditionally, you have the Federal Reserve and its efforts to shift from rate hikes to rate cuts, which is helping to improve the situation for equity investments by making future earnings more valuable and reducing the competition from stocks and bonds, where people shifted money when interest rates were high.\nIf you have invested in the market, so far, so good, as you have been able to enjoy the financial benefits of a 16% market increase. The market has, as it often does, rewarded those who go full force ahead, all while punishing those who were too cautious and missed out on these returns.\n\nStory Continues\nStill, you can't ignore that the Federal Reserve's recent indicators around the impact of tariffs are going to give a whole lot of investors a reality check in the not-too-distant future. The Fed's analysis indicates that tariff policies could reduce annual GDP growth from anywhere between 0.3% and 0.5% over the next two years. On paper, this might sound small, but the resulting loss in growth is substantial. What's worse is that this isn't a speculative conclusion. It's based entirely on comprehensive economic modeling according to the Fed, so it's going to happen, it's just a matter of when.\n\nOnly Seen Twice: The 22.4x Forward Earnings Warning Unsurprisingly, the S&P 500's current forward P/E ratio of 22.4 as a red flag puts the market in the uncomfortable spot of being among the most expensive valuations in the last four decades. Considering that the historical average sits between 15 and 16, this current number is 40% higher, which leads to investors having to pay more for the same dollar of earnings than they have in the past.\n\nMore notable is that this scenario has only played out twice in the last 40 years, during the late 1990s tech boom and the 2021 pandemic stimulus period. If you are a student of financial history, you know that neither instance ended well for investors who bought at peak valuations, as the tech bubble crashed 49% between 2000 and 2002, while the 2021 pandemic peak was followed by a 25% decrease.\nWhile there is cause for concern, it's also necessary to highlight that high valuations do not automatically mean that economic conditions are not strong. If earnings are growing rapidly, which they are, and business conditions are improving, investors can make a justification for paying a premium for future growth. The flag here is that none of these conditions exist right now, including profit margins expanding, so earnings forecasts for 2026 are pretty modest. Profit margins, in particular, are close to historical highs, so there isn't a lot of room for expansion, and according to the Fed, business conditions are about to get worse.\n\nThe 22.4 forward P/E reflects an optimism for investors that doesn't really align with any reality the Fed is describing. It assumes continued strong earnings growth and stable margins, and when those assumptions break or uncertainty increases, valuations are going to reset lower as investors decide they no longer want to pay premiums for companies that have falling fundamentals.\nTariff Impact: Fed Study Predicts Slowed Growth and Market Headwinds The Fed's research on tariff impacts is likely to be the clearest warning sign about what could potentially happen next year with the economy. From its study, we learned that both the direct and indirect effects of tariffs across multiple sectors are going to slow US economic growth in a measurable and meaningful way in the next 24 months.\n\nAs data and detail-heavy as this all is, the math is pretty clear as tariffs increase input costs for manufacturers and force companies to either absorb the cost, impacting margins, or pass the expense onto consumers, which reduces overall demand. It won't surprise anyone to consider that both scenarios likely result in economic compression. If there is a higher input cost, there is less capital for companies to expand, hire, etc., and higher consumer prices reduce overall purchasing power, especially for middle and lower-income households that spend a lot of money on the exact kinds of goods that tariffs will hit hardest.\nThe research also highlighted the uncertainty that is going to impact overall business planning, even before tariffs have been fully implemented. Companies are undoubtedly going to keep delaying capital expenditures if there is even a hint of concern over clarity as to what trade rules could look like in six months. What's worse is that supply chain managers can't commit to long-term contracts when tariff policy shifts weekly. All of this comes together as slowed investment for companies as hiring plans are put on hold and any expansion projects get delayed, perhaps indefinitely.\n\nFor the stock market, any instance of slower economic growth is going to translate into weaker earnings. Corporate revenue is tied directly to economic activity, and even if GDP growth falls from 2% to 1.5%, which may not sound like a lot, it has a big impact. When sales fall, so too do profits, and when profits start to disappoint, stock prices are going to directly reflect investor concerns. Arguably, the biggest takeaway for investors is that the Fed's research all but confirms that the economics surrounding stock prices is about to weaken, perhaps significantly. This is going to translate to the kind of headwind that even the momentum of a few large-cap names can't overcome.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "What is the China upside potential for Nvidia and AMD?\n\nVahid Karaahmetovic\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 3:16 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nInvesting.com -- Recent reports around a potential resumption of GPU sales to China have reopened the debate over how much upside U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD could see if export approvals materialize.\nAccording to Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold, assessing the exact outcome is challenging as several moving parts remain. But in an optimistic scenario, Leopold estimates AMD could generate roughly $500 million to $800 million in incremental revenue, translating into about $0.10 to $0.20 of non-GAAP EPS upside.\n\nFor Nvidia, the potential is materially larger, with an estimated $7 billion to $12.5 billion in additional revenue, or about $0.15 to $0.30 of non-GAAP EPS upside in 2026.\n“Questions remain regarding whether the Chinese government will allow or discourage its cloud operators from purchasing advanced GPUs, as well as how the U.S. government’s export license fee will be accounted for,” Leopold wrote.\nFor AMD, market speculation has centered on China-compliant accelerator orders tied to Alibaba, with reports pointing to 40,000 to 50,000 MI308 units. At the midpoint, Leopold notes that “a $15,000 chip could equate to $675M in sales,” likely spread across multiple quarters.\nHowever, uncertainty remains around approval timing, ramp linearity and whether China enforces restrictions on American AI semiconductors.\n\nThe required 15% payment to the U.S. government introduces accounting complexity around pricing and accounting.\nWhile modest relative to AMD’s total revenue base, momentum could build as roadmap execution continues and China-compliant offerings gain traction, Leopold said.\nNvidia faces a similar dynamic, with speculation focused on a limited resumption of H200 GPU shipments to large Chinese hyperscalers and internet companies.\nEven modest volumes could be meaningful, as “tens of thousands of units” at estimated average selling prices (ASPs) of $20,000 to $25,000, and up to roughly 350,000 to 500,000 units over time, could drive billions of dollars in incremental revenue.\nLeopold stresses that China remains a relatively small part of Nvidia’s overall data center business, with growth primarily driven by U.S. hyperscalers, sovereign AI and enterprise customers as newer platforms ramp through 2026.\n\n“We continue to view AI infrastructure as a multi-trilliondollar opportunity over the next decade, with Nvidia well positioned to sustain industry-leading growth, margins, and dominant share in data center accelerators, and we reiterate our Strong Buy rating,” he wrote.\nRelated articles\nWhat is the China upside potential for Nvidia and AMD?\n\nStory Continues\n3 Dependable Non-Tech Stocks Poised for Steady Gains in Uncertain Times\nNasdaq 100 Setup Turns Cautious as Insiders Sell and Technicals Flash Fatigue\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Investors viewed the luxury electric vehicle (EV) maker as a potentially bold new challenger to Tesla , poised to ride the wave of EV adoption. The company's ambitious vision, cutting-edge technology, and sleek designs had captured attention.\nHowever, things haven't gone as planned. After an initial surge in 2021 that saw the stock reach impressive heights, momentum has faded, and Lucid's stock is now down 98% from its all-time high. The optimism that once surrounded the company has waned as investors focus on execution, competition, and evolving EV adoption rates.\nAs Lucid Group looks to regain its footing and get back on track, here's what investors should know about it before buying.\nLucid's growing vehicle lineup Lucid Group manufactures luxury EVs, targeting an affluent customer base. The company aims to establish itself as a premium brand in the competitive automotive industry by committing to delivering a high-quality driving experience.\nIts top-selling vehicle is the Lucid Air Sedan, the best-selling EV sedan in the U.S., outpacing the Tesla Model S. The automaker also offers the Lucid Gravity, an electric SUV with seating for up to seven adults and an EPA-estimated driving range of 450 miles.\n\nFurthermore, management confirmed that the high-volume Midsize Platform, which aims to compete with popular models like the Tesla Model 3, remains on track to begin production in late 2026. This is Lucid's mass-market product and is a crucial step in enabling Lucid to scale production and improve gross margins.\nLucid is making moves in the robotaxi space In other news, Lucid announced an initiative to accelerate its path to full autonomy in a collaboration with Nvidia . This partnership positions Lucid to deliver one of the world's first privately owned passenger vehicles with Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, powered by the NVIDIA DRIVE AV platform.\n\nAlso, Uber Technologies announced a $300 million investment in Lucid Group. This investment is part of Uber's plan to launch driverless rides in the San Francisco Bay Area late next year, using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro's self-driving technology. This move puts Lucid's vehicles in direct competition with other robotaxi services. Uber plans to put 20,000 or more Lucid's self-driving SUVs on the road over six years.\n\nLa historia continúa\nHere's what Lucid investors need to watch While this news is positive for Lucid Group, the company continues to burn cash as it scales up. The good news is that revenue is up 45% from last year. The bad news is that it continues to lose significant money. Through Sept. 30, the EV maker has an operating loss of $2.4 billion, up slightly from the prior year. This was against a total revenue of $834 million.\nNot only that, but the current regulatory environment isn't favorable to EV manufacturers, either. The Trump administration is resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards to levels achievable by conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles. This action reverses what the Trump administration said was the Biden administration's \"unrealistic fuel economy targets that effectively resulted in an electric vehicle mandate,\" potentially reducing the regulatory push to shift consumers to EVs.\n\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Lucid Group to Underweight from Equal Weight and sharply cut its price target. This decision was based on a more cautious industry outlook, with the analyst stating that the electric vehicle \"winter\" will remain through 2026.\nMore progress is needed Lucid Group is making progress on its large-scale EV product and autonomous driving capabilities. However, the company continues to burn cash and could face headwinds in the near future. Changing regulations and shifting consumer preferences could lead to an \"EV winter\" according to Morgan Stanley, which would weigh on Lucid over the next year or so.\n\nLucid has earned praise for its vehicles, thanks to their industry-leading range, luxury design, and technology. That said, the company is still losing money, which should make investors hesitant. I'd like to see improvements in its efficiency and bottom line before purchasing the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lucid Group right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia vs Alphabet: Which Stock Will Outperform in 2026?\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 2:55 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Nvidia and Alphabet are set to be the top-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks in 2025.\nNvidia is expected to continue seeing strong growth in 2026 as AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up.\nThe network effect of Apple's vertical AI model should really start to shine through next year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe two top-performing \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks in 2025 were Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . As of this writing, Nvidia's stock is up around 30%, while Alphabet has turned in a 60% gain.\nLet's see which stock is poised to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Nvidia Where artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending heads, Nvidia's stock is likely to follow. The company is the dominant player in the space with its graphics processing units (GPUs), and while competition has increased, no one is close to unseating the king. It still has a wide moat with its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code has been written, while its recent acquisition of SchedMD will only help widen its software moat.\nMeanwhile, its NVLink interconnect system helps prevent vendor mixing and matching because it's a proprietary system that lets its GPUs quickly pass along data and pool memory, allowing an AI cluster to act as a single powerful unit.\nMeanwhile, the setup for the company looks attractive heading into 2026. All the major cloud computing companies have discussed ramping up data center capex spending next year, which bodes well for it. At the same time, the U.S. just gave it the green light to start selling its H200 chip to commercial Chinese customers, reopening a big market for it. In addition, large customer OpenAI is close to closing $100 billion in new funding, which should help it with its aggressive AI data center buildout.\n\nOn top of that, Nvidia's stock is attractively valued, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 23 times 2026 analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 0.7 times. Positive PEGs below 1 are generally viewed as undervalued.\nThe case for Alphabet Alphabet's biggest advantage is that it is the one major hyperscaler (owner of large data centers) that isn't largely reliant on Nvidia. The company developed its own custom AI chips over a decade ago, and today most of its internal workloads are run on its tensor processing units (TPUs). That has given the company both a cost advantage with its cloud computing business, as well as with training its Gemini large language model (LLM) and running AI inference.\n\nStory Continues\nGoogle Cloud has been a huge growth driver for Alphabet, and that should only continue in 2026 as the unit has been capacity-constrained. Alphabet has been spending aggressively, which should result in Google Cloud's growth accelerating. Alphabet also made an under-the-radar move the past couple of years with its chips that could lead to big growth.\n\nTPUs were originally designed for Google Cloud's TensorFlow framework, but Alphabet shifted its chips to be more framework agnostic, including supporting the popular PyTorch framework. This move allows it to rent out its TPUs to other companies. Anthropic is one of the first companies to jump on this opportunity, agreeing to deploy $21 billion in TPUs. Morgan Stanley has estimated that for every 500,000 TPUs deployed, Alphabet will generate around $13 billion in annual revenue. It's currently projecting the company will rent out 5 million TPUs in 2027 and 7 million in 2028.\nAt the same time, Alphabet has trained its top-tier Gemini model on its TPUs, while it also runs inference with them. This gives it a significant cost advantage over competitors like OpenAI, allowing it to continue investing more money in its model and further improve it.\n\nIt also has the advantage of being able to integrate Gemini throughout its products, making them better. It essentially has what can be referred to as a \"surface advantage,\" bringing AI to the places where people already are, rather than relying on stand-alone apps and third-party integrations. These advantages should just continue to grow and drive revenue in 2026 and beyond.\nThe verdict I think Nvidia and Alphabet should both have strong years in 2026. Both stocks are attractively valued with forward P/Es of 23 times and 27 times, respectively, and both should produce strong revenue growth.\nHowever, of the two, I think Alphabet's stock will once again outperform in 2026. It has a more durable business (it's less cyclical and doesn't rely on heavy customer capex spending), and I think the network effects of its model will really start to shine through next year, powering the stock higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Wall Street generally remains positive in the last two truncated trading weeks of any year with muted volumes. This year, market participants&rsquo; confidence has received a boost from renewed momentum in the artificial intelligence (AI) trade. All three major stock indexes ended in positive territory.\n\nHow Did the Benchmarks Perform? The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) advanced 0.5% or 227.79 points to close at 48,362.68 Notably, 20 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while 10 finished in negative territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 23,428.83, rising 0.5% or 121.21 points on the strong performance of AI bigwigs.\n\nThe S&P 500 gained 0.6% points to finish at 6,878.49. Six out of 11 broad-sectors of the broad-market index ended in positive territory while four ended in negative territory and one remained unchanged. The technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) rose 2.2%. On the other hand, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) fell 1.3%.\n\nThe fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 5.6% to 14.08, marking its lowest closing since Dec. 13, 2024. A total of 14.57 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 16.9 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.15-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.61-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.\n\nAI Trade Continues to Thrive The AI saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\n\nGoldman Sachs and Bank of America projected that AI infrastructure capex spending will cross $1 trillion in 2028. JP Moran and Citigroup forecast this figure to total $5 trillion cumulative in 2030. Research firm McKinsey & Co. estimated that global AI-powered data center infrastructure capex will reach around $7 trillion by 2030.\n\nFour of the &ldquo;magnificent 7&rdquo; stocks have decided to invest a massive $380 billion in 2025 as capital expenditure for AI-infrastructure development. This marks a significant 54% year-over-year increase in capital spending on the AI ecosystem. Moreover, these companies have also said that AI capex is likely to increase handsomely in 2026.\n\nLatest Developments on AI Space The Trump administration has decided to allow the generative AI chipset behemoth NVIDIA Corp. NVDA to sell its high-end H200 AI chips to some &ldquo;approved customers&rdquo; in China. Reuters reported that NVIDIA is considering shipment of H200 chips to China from mid-February 2026. The H200 chip is two generations behind NVDA&rsquo;s current Blackwell Ultra processors.\n\nReuters reported that the initial shipment will consist of around 40,000 to 80,000 H200 chips. Several investment banks have estimated that the resumption of sales in China could bring back around $10 to $20 billion in revenues per calendar year for the company.\n\nAlphabet Inc. GOOGL has decided to acquire data center and energy infrastructure company, Intersect, for a consideration of $4.75 billion in cash. In addition, Alphabet will assume the debts of Intersect. Alphabet expects the deal to bring more data center and generation capacity online faster.\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said, &ldquo;Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive U.S. innovation and leadership.&rdquo;\n\nThe stock prices of NVIDIA and Alphabet rose 1.6% and 0.9%, respectively. NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

United States Steel became the first $1 billion enterprise on the planet in 1901, and 117 years later, in 2018, iPhone maker Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion milestone.\nEight other U.S. companies have since joined Apple in the trillion-dollar club, including Nvidia , Alphabet , Amazon , and Tesla . It looked as though Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) was set to join them back in September as its market capitalization peaked at $940 billion, but following a 41% decline in its stock price since then, the company is now valued at just $550 billion.\nRecent stock price performance aside, artificial intelligence (AI) developers are lining up to rent access to Oracle's data center infrastructure, which is fueling a surge in the company's revenues. Could it be only a matter of time before this tech titan charts a path back toward $1 trillion?\nA leader in AI infrastructure Most AI development happens inside large, centralized data centers fitted with tens of thousands of advanced parallel processors -- many of them graphics processing units ( GPUs ) supplied by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . It can cost billions of dollars to build a single data center, and since most businesses don't have that kind of money to dedicate to such endeavors, they rent computing capacity from specialized operators like Oracle instead.\n\nOracle's data center infrastructure is among the best in the industry. It uses proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology that moves data between chips and devices more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since most AI developers pay for computing capacity by the minute, even minor increases in processing speed can result in major cost savings over time.\nOracle's data centers also offer significant scale, enabling developers to tap into clusters of over 131,000 GPUs, which is enough to handle even the most advanced AI workloads.\nMoreover, it's bringing capacity online at a rapid pace. As of the conclusion of its fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ended Nov. 30), Oracle had 147 data center regions up and running with 64 more in the pipeline. OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are just a few of the tech juggernauts using Oracle's infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nOracle's cloud infrastructure revenue is soaring Oracle generated $16.1 billion in total revenue during its fiscal 2026 second quarter, which was a modest 14% increase from the prior-year period. But revenue from its cloud infrastructure segment, specifically, soared by 66% to a record $4.1 billion.\nThe cloud infrastructure unit could be growing its sales even faster, but Oracle simply can't build data centers fast enough to meet demand. That's why the company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) rocketed by a whopping 438% year over year to $523 billion during the quarter. RPO is like an order backlog, because it reflects the value of signed contracts with customers for services that haven't been delivered yet.\n\nAround $300 billion of Oracle's RPO is reportedly from one customer, OpenAI, which creates concentration risk. OpenAI is still a fairly young company, and it doesn't have anywhere close to $300 billion in cash on hand. Unless it becomes a raging financial success, this enormous commitment might never convert into revenue for Oracle.\nSkepticism about this deal is part of the reason Oracle stock has plummeted in the past few months. The company has around $108 billion in debt, and it's taking on even more to fund the construction of more data centers. The possibility that one of its top customers might never have the money to rent all of the capacity it has requested is spooking investors.\nWill Oracle join the $1 trillion club? Oracle generated earnings of $5.32 per share over the last four quarters on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, which gives its stock a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.1. That is a premium to the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so even though Oracle stock has tumbled, it still isn't cheap.\nFrom its market cap of about $550 billion today, Oracle's stock would have to soar by 82% for the company to join the $1 trillion club. If we assume Oracle's P/E ratio remains exactly where it is right now, the company would have to nearly double its earnings per share to justify that type of share price gain. If its P/E ratio declines further, it will have an even steeper mountain to climb.\n\nOracle's AI business is growing at a lightning-fast pace right now, so there's a good chance the company will join the $1 trillion club at some point, but it probably won't be the next member inducted. Several other U.S. companies are much closer to the mark: Walmart has a market cap of $911 billion, and JPMorgan Chase is also in range at $872 billion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now? Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

The artificial intelligence (AI) industry has been a major source of stock market returns this year, and anyone who hasn't owned a slice of key players like Nvidia and Palantir Technologies probably underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 .\nBut there's a simple solution for those investors as we head into 2026. Two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest exclusively in the booming AI sector are the Roundhill Generative AI and Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) and the iShares Future AI and Tech ETF (NYSEMKT: ARTY) . They take the guesswork out of picking winners and losers, so here's why they could be great additions to any diversified portfolio for the new year.\nThe case for the Roundhill Generative AI and Technology ETF The Roundhill ETF invests exclusively in companies developing the infrastructure, platforms, and software behind the AI revolution. The fund is actively managed, meaning Roundhill's team regularly adjusts its portfolio to produce the best returns.\nThe ETF currently holds just 49 stocks, and its top five positions alone account for 26.7% of the value of its entire portfolio. Although such a high degree of concentration can lead to volatility, those five stocks are among the leaders in the AI race:\nStock\nRoundhill ETF Portfolio Weighting\n1. Alphabet\n7.53%\n2. Nvidia\n6.11%\n3. Microsoft\n5.13%\n4. Meta Platforms\n4.28%\n5. Palantir Technologies\n3.67%\n\nData source: Roundhill. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Dec. 21, 2025, and are subject to change.\nThose five stocks have delivered an average return of 56% in 2025, so they helped propel the Roundhill ETF to a year-to-date gain of 47%. For some perspective, the S&P 500 is up just 17%:\nAlphabet is coming off two straight quarters of accelerating revenue growth in its Google Search business, almost entirely thanks to new AI-powered features like AI Overviews. Revenue growth in its Google Cloud segment is also accelerating, as the platform works to fill a staggering $155 billion order backlog from customers waiting for more of its AI data centers to come on line.\n\nStory Continues\nMany of those data centers are powered by Nvidia's chips, which are the gold standard for developing AI models. But Alphabet isn't the only company lining up to buy them -- Microsoft and Meta Platforms are also two of the chipmaker's top customers. Meta uses them to advance its open-source Llama AI models; Microsoft uses them to deploy its Copilot AI assistant, and it also sells computing capacity to businesses through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nActively managed funds typically come with high costs. The Roundhill ETF has an expense ratio of 0.75%, whereas many of the passive index funds issued by Vanguard, for example, offer expense ratios as low as 0.03%. Fortunately, investors have been well compensated for those costs so far thanks to the Roundhill ETF's blistering returns since its inception in 2023.\nThe case for the iShares Future AI and Tech ETF The iShares ETF invests in AI companies from the U.S. and around the world. It gives investors exposure to the entire AI value chain, including infrastructure, software, and services. The ETF holds 51 stocks, and below are its top five positions, which represent 23% of the value of its portfolio:\nStock\niShares ETF Portfolio Weighting\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n5.48%\n2. Vertiv Holdings\n5.25%\n3. Nvidia\n4.28%\n4. Advantest Corp\n4.06%\n5. Broadcom\n3.96%\n\nData source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of Dec. 18, 2025, and are subject to change.\nDespite having a similar focus to the Roundhill ETF, the composition of the top five holdings in the iShares ETF is quite different. It places a heavier emphasis on suppliers of data center infrastructure and chips, which have been central to the AI boom over the last few years.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is one of Nvidia's biggest competitors in the market for AI data center chips. The company is preparing to launch a new lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs) in 2026 called the MI400 series, which could lead the industry in terms of performance.\nBroadcom is another major player in this space. It supplies an alternative to GPUs called AI accelerators, which are popular among hyperscale customers because they are fully customizable. Broadcom is also a top supplier of networking equipment, which helps regulate how fast data travels among chips and devices in AI workloads.\nThen there is Vertiv, which is a crucial service provider for data center operators. It offers cooling, power management, and networking solutions, and its stock has soared more than tenfold since the AI boom started gathering momentum in early 2023.\n\nThe iShares ETF has an expense ratio of 0.47%, but with a return of 28% this year, it's crushing the S&P 500 even after accounting for fees. AI is likely to remain a key driver of stock market returns in 2026, and investors can get all the exposure they need to this booming industry by adding the iShares and Roundhill ETFs to their diversified portfolios.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tidal Trust II - Roundhill Generative Ai & Technology ETF right now?

      "Content": "BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 IBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\n\nAmin Ayan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nIBIT\n\nBLK\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nBlackRock has placed its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund among its three biggest investment themes for 2025, ranking the product alongside Treasury bills and US mega-cap technology stocks.\nKey Takeaways:\nBlackRock named its spot Bitcoin ETF a top 2025 investment theme alongside Treasurys and big tech.\nIBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\nThe fund now leads rivals by a wide margin, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios.\n\nThe world’s largest asset manager said its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) together with an ETF tracking short-term Treasurys and another linked to the so-called “Magnificent 7” group of US tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla.\nBlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Pulls $25B in Inflows Despite Bitcoin’s 2025 Pullback IBIT has drawn more than $25 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to market data, ranking sixth among all ETFs by inflows despite posting a negative return in 2025.\nThe performance comes as Bitcoin has slid roughly 30% from its October peak, a drawdown that has not deterred investor demand.\n\nNate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said BlackRock’s decision to spotlight IBIT shows the firm remains comfortable backing Bitcoin through market cycles.\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed that view, noting that if the fund can attract $25 billion in a weaker year, the upside during a stronger market could be significantly larger.\nThe latest inflows add to the roughly $37 billion IBIT attracted in 2024, bringing total net inflows since launch to about $62.5 billion, according to Farside Investors.\nThat figure puts IBIT well ahead of competitors, with flows more than five times larger than those of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, its closest rival.\nBlackRock has continued to build out its crypto-linked ETF lineup beyond spot Bitcoin exposure. In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In the last decade, the hardware giant has evolved from a company best known for gaming GPUs into a trillion-dollar club member that's leading the AI infrastructure buildout.\nConsidering that 10 years ago, Nvidia had a roughly $17 billion market cap, you'd probably expect a $10,000 investment made in it then to be worth a small fortune today.\nBut just how much it would be worth might make you do a double-take.\nA gain of over 22,000% If you had invested $10,000 in Nvidia 10 years ago and held on through all the flat, rocky, and exhilarating years that followed, your current investment would be worth well over $2.2 million.\nTo put that into perspective, if you had invested the same amount in any of the other six Magnificent Seven stocks -- Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , and Tesla -- your returns would have been impressive, but nowhere close to what the chipmaker delivered.\nNvidia has earned its crown. For investors who believe AI spending will continue to climb, the stock remains a top pick to consider buying.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ: NBIS ) is one of the Stocks That Will Go To The Moon in 2026 . On December 17, Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS) announced the launch of Nebius AI Cloud 3.1, thereby enhancing the company’s full-stack AI cloud performance.\nManagement noted that Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 focuses on next-gen NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra compute, operational transparency, developer tools, and strengthened security. Version 3.1 builds upon the foundations of Nebius AI Cloud “Aether”. Moreover, the company is also deploying NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra infrastructure internationally. Thereby making it Europe’s first cloud with production deployments of NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 and NVIDIA HGX B300 systems. These systems run on an 800 Gbps NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand interconnect that has the potential to double throughput for distributed workloads.\nIn addition, the release also features new management tools, including Capacity Blocks and a real-time Capacity Dashboard. Management noted that these upgrades allow customers to view GPU availability across data center regions. Management expects the latest version to lower barriers for AI developers, which will help Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS) expand its appeal in the biotech and SaaS AI applications.\n\nNebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ:NBIS) builds full-stack AI infrastructure, including GPU clusters, cloud platforms like Nebius AI Cloud, and developer tools to support global AI workloads from training to inference.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NBIS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "1 Stock I'd Buy Before Tesla in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Tesla is hovering around an all-time high despite its core automotive business posting poor results.\nNvidia’s high margins enable it to invest aggressively in research and development without draining its cash flows.\nNvidia is a far better value than Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been on a tear -- hitting an all-time high on Dec. 15 . Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

At one point in October, that same holdings would have been worth well over $200,000.\nWith a 280% gain on the year, Oklo may seem like old news. And yet if you believe in the future of artificial intelligence (AI), this stock's incredible run may only be the beginning.\nCan Oklo turn $1,000 into $100,000? Oklo isn't your average nuclear company.\nThe Sam Altman-backed start-up is designing a microreactor (\"Aurora powerhouse\") that can supply on-site power to remote areas.\nUnlike traditional nuclear power plants, which are expensive and can take a decade to finish building, Oklo's Auroras are factory-built and can be deployed faster than large reactors. That makes them ideal for data center operators, who often build in rural areas where grid power would be severely strained by their electricity needs.\n\nBut here's something to consider: If Oklo turns $1,000 into $100,000, it would join the trillion-dollar club. That's a pretty tall order for any start-up, let alone one that will operate in the utilities sector.\nWhile a one-hundred-fold gain isn't impossible, it would likely take years, if not decades, to happen. Meanwhile, the utilities sector is expected to grow only about 5% annually. Even if Oklo can turn on its first plants, it would need to scale beyond that utility sector growth.\nAt this point, I'd size an Oklo position small; if its reactors work, it could matter over the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oklo right now?

Large companies , such as Nvidia and Alphabet, are enjoying strong gains, while companies like Palantir Technologies and CoreWeave are attracting investor attention and gaining at even faster rates.\nIt remains to be seen whether this trend will continue in 2026, but it appears likely. If you have $1,000 available to invest and are looking for a top AI stock to buy right now, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is a no-brainer.\nThe foundation of all AI What sets Taiwan Semi apart from almost any other AI stock is that it manufactures the chips designed by other companies. It's the manufacturer for the brand names, the foundation of their development. It's not the only game in town, but it developed the industry, and it's the biggest: It's been responsible for around 85% of semiconductor start-up product prototypes, and it has a 34% market share in the foundry business, which enables the fabrication of semiconductors.\n\nIt has contracts with nearly all the chip designers that are changing the world through AI. These are names like Nvidia, Alphabet, and Advanced Micro Devices . These companies are continually developing more powerful chips, and their trusted partner, Taiwan Semiconductor, is experiencing strong growth as a result.\nAs hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft pour billions of dollars into data centers and AI development, they require more chips. Regardless of which chipmaker they're working with, they're likely to count on TSMC as a partner at some point.\nThe company has expanded its operations and now has a U.S. presence in Arizona. The very first chip that came off the line was an Nvidia Blackwell chip in October, marking a significant win for both companies. It's already investing $165 billion in Arizona alone, and it's looking to expand into new U.S. facilities over the next few years, setting itself up for many years of growth. This is an important development, not only because it expands the company's capabilities, but it also allows it to get around the tariffs that have been so challenging for many companies doing business in the U.S. recently.\n\nStory Continues\nMore than AI Aside from its client diversification, which is an excellent feature, it's also diversified by industry. It's benefiting from the tailwinds of AI growth, but it has been around a lot longer than the recent AI craze. It manufactures chips for various types of technology, including smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and AI. It works with 500 companies, and its semiconductors power 12,000 different products.\n\nHowever, AI is definitely giving the company a big boost. High-performance computing, which includes AI products, accounted for 57% of total revenue in the third quarter. Total revenue has increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% since going public in 1994. That is an outstanding performance, and it has accelerated recently; revenue was up 40.8% year over year in the third quarter. However, its highest-growing industries are Internet of Things (IoT) and smartphones.\nA stock price that's ready to jump A great stock is one that you can buy any time; the earlier the better. Taiwan Semiconductor has tremendous growth drivers and opportunities, making it a no-brainer choice for long-term growth.\nHowever, December appears to be an auspicious time to buy shares, as the stock has remained relatively stable over the past few months and is up 46% year to date. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings in January, and the stock is likely to jump on positive results, giving you the chance to buy in before the next rise.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Could AMD Finally Close the Gap on Nvidia AI Dominance?\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market.\nExisting infrastructure and software reinforce Nvidia's dominance.\nDespite competitive challenges, AMD has earned business from key clients.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nThroughout its history, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has developed a reputation for closing or at least reducing the competitive gap with rivals. This was true when it challenged Intel 's supremacy in prior decades and, more recently, its clashes with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\n\nThis includes its rivalry with Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, and its upcoming releases have captured the attention of industry analysts. The question for investors is whether it is on the verge of catching up to Nvidia and ending its dominance. The more likely outcome is that AMD will narrow but not close the gap, and here's why.\nThe state of the AI accelerator market Indeed, the semiconductor industry appeared caught off guard when it became clear that Nvidia's AI accelerators powered OpenAI's game-changing GPT-4 AI platform in 2023. Nvidia was so far ahead of rivals that even now, Nvidia holds an estimated 80% of this market, according to a Susquehanna analyst.\n\nMoreover, closing the gap hinges on more than just processing power. Nvidia has its CUDA software platform, which has an army of loyal developers. That makes switching away from that architecture difficult.\nAdditionally, Nvidia offers rack-scale solutions that integrate with both its accelerators and CUDA. That presents an additional challenge to prospective competitors.\nNvidia is also growing faster. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2026, Nvidia reported 62% revenue growth. Its data center segment, which designs the accelerators and constitutes 89% of Nvidia's revenue, increased revenue by 65% during the same period.\nAMD's overall growth is also impressive, but not as rapid in either respect. In the first nine months of 2025, AMD's revenue rose by 36% year over year. Also, its data center segment makes up 46% of overall revenue, and during the period, the segment's revenue rose by 29%, slower than the overall gain.\n\nAMD's efforts to strike back Nonetheless, as bleak as that sounds, AMD bulls should remember that that is only one quarter, and data center segment growth is likely to improve along with its technology.\nDespite lagging behind, AMD has made headway in this market. The company has built strategic partnerships with OpenAI and Meta Platforms , and its accelerators support clouds for Microsoft 's Azure and Oracle 's Oracle Cloud. Moreover, Dell , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , and others have built servers with AMD's technology.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking forward, investors have focused on AMD's upcoming MI450 accelerator. The company has also claimed that the MI450 will surpass the performance of Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin accelerator.\nAdditionally, AMD relies on open-source software and can work with other tech ecosystems. That could wear away at Nvidia's software-driven competitive advantage as the industry grows.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia has struggled to keep up with demand, and AMD has traditionally sold its competing product at a lower cost. This gives companies all the more reason to consider AMD over Nvidia. Hence, if the MI450 can match or surpass the Vera Rubin, AMD could make significant competitive inroads.\nWill AMD close the gap with Nvidia? In the foreseeable future, investors should expect AMD to reduce but not completely close the competitive gap with Nvidia.\nIndeed, AMD has made significant efforts to catch up and has won business from several high-profile customers. If the MI450 matches or exceeds expectations, it could threaten AMD's dominance.\n\nUnfortunately for AMD, Nvidia is the established player in the AI accelerator market, and most companies are tied into its ecosystem. That means if AMD becomes the superior product, many of Nvidia's customers would likely be unable to switch to AMD without a tremendous disruption.\nUltimately, such conditions could be enough to stoke more rapid stock price increases for Advanced Micro Devices stock than Nvidia as the smaller company plays catch-up. However, investors should expect Nvidia to remain the leader in the AI accelerator industry for some time to come.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: 2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia by the End of 2026\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:25 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock is at risk in 2026 if revenue growth slows down.\nAlphabet is gaining market share back in artificial intelligence (AI) and should keep growing its earnings next year.\nAmazon has a chance to grow its operating leverage if it can stay disciplined with its cost base.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIs 2026 the year Nvidia finally underperforms versus the broad market? I think it might be.\nThe leader in artificial intelligence ( AI ) computer chips is unlikely to give up all its gains from the last few years, but it is facing increasing competition, a high starting valuation, and the potential of near-term overspending to build out AI infrastructure. That makes the stock risky for 2026.\nThat doesn't mean you should dump your entire position. However, if you are thinking of buying AI stocks in 2026, there are two companies I believe will finish the year with larger market caps than Nvidia: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) . Here's why both are better buys than Nvidia today.\nAlphabet's AI comeback Alphabet is the conglomerate that owns Google, YouTube, Android, Waymo, and other technology properties. It is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, with billions of users across multiple product lines.\nThe stock was deemed a potential AI loser after ChatGPT came out and rapidly began taking market share of search and AI queries, with Alphabet falling flat-footed after the launch. Now, with the launch of updated Gemini AI models for text, images, and video creation (among other things), Alphabet is steadily gaining market share back from OpenAI and ChatGPT.\n\nIts stock has begun to perform because of it. Alphabet stock is up 60% year to date (YTD), which is more than double the returns of Nvidia. It is growing revenue at 15% year over year in constant currency, and with expanding profit margins. The durability of Google Search and YouTube, fast growth at Google Cloud, and long-term plays with Gemini and Waymo's self-driving cars should help Alphabet keep compounding its earnings power for years to come.\nAmazon's dual engines Alphabet's growth path in 2026 is clear. Amazon's will be determined by management's ability to wrangle costs that spiraled out of control during the pandemic years, which is a headwind still impacting the business.\nAmazon's cloud computing division -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- grew revenue 20% year over year last quarter, with a fat 36% operating margin over the last 12 months. Cloud computing is benefiting from the AI infrastructure expansion, with Amazon specifically helped by the likes of its partner Anthropic, a start-up growing incredibly quickly that Amazon is also an investor in. OpenAI is in talks with Amazon about a $10 billion investment that would likely flow back through to AWS cloud computing spending.\n\nStory Continues\nYou have a 36% operating margin at AWS. In retail, Amazon is still growing strongly, with double-digit growth in the last few years in North America and internationally. Advertising, third-party seller services, and subscription revenue now generate $279 billion in trailing revenue, or 40% of Amazon's total revenue. These segments have high profit margins and have been growing faster than the overall Amazon retail business.\n\nAnd yet Amazon's retail operations in North America only have a 6.6% operating margin. This could be looked at as a failure or a future path to profit expansion. Amazon has been trimming its ranks through layoffs, which should help margins expand throughout 2026 and beyond. If retail can keep up this operating leverage, along with the fast growth at AWS, then Amazon's profitability will explode in 2026.\nThe math: Why Amazon and Alphabet will be worth more than Nvidia Today, Alphabet generates $128 billion in operating income, Nvidia $110 billion, and Amazon $80 billion. Nvidia's revenue is currently growing much faster than both of these businesses, but that could come to a grinding halt if the AI infrastructure buildout slows down in 2026.\nNvidia's revenue growth doesn't have to go negative in order for earnings to fall, as it is currently implementing huge price increases for its products that are generating incredibly high profit margins. Plus, its stock trades at a more expensive earnings ratio than both Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nIf Nvidia's revenue growth slows down in 2026 while Alphabet and Amazon keep chugging along, then Nvidia's earnings will likely fall along with its high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. That could lead both stocks to finish 2026 with market caps larger than Nvidia.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

Technology shares continued their rebound from late last week, with Nvidia, up 1.5%, providing the biggest lift to the S&P 500. Reuters reported the company has told Chinese clients it aims to start shipping its second-most powerful AI chips to China before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February. Among other sectors, financials, materials and energy also posted strong gains. Sam Stovall is chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. \"We've just finished up the mid-December low when investors tend to unload their unprofitable trades, therefore being able to do some tax loss harvesting. And now they're putting their money back to work in areas that they feel have some potential for at least the near term.\" Among other stock moves, shares of Micron Technology rose 4%, extending gains from last week when the chipmaker's strong forecasts re-ignited optimism around AI-related shares. Shares of Tesla gained 1.5% and touched an intraday record high after CEO Elon Musk's 2018 pay package was restored late Friday by the Delaware Supreme Court. The ruling made Musk the first person to be worth about $700 billion, and came two years after a lower court struck down the compensation deal as \"unfathomable.\" And shares of Warner Bros Discovery rose 3.5% after Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said he'd personally guarantee more than $40 billion of equity financing for Paramount Skydance's offer to acquire the company. Paramount's stock rose more than 4%, while shares of Netflix, a rival bidder for Warner Bros, fell more than 1%.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Futures strength carried into the session, and the market held its gains as muted volatility kept investors focused on staying positioned rather than pressing new bets.\n\nLeadership remains concentrated in AI and semiconductors, which continue to drive the Nasdaq Composite. Strength in names such as Nvidia, Micron, and Oracle helped the index regain ground from its early-December pullback, reinforcing the market’s reliance on a narrow group of growth leaders to sustain momentum.\n\nBuyers stayed active even as the calendar turned toward year-end. Coinbase’s move into prediction markets and the $7.4 billion buyout of Janus Henderson showed that capital is still being deployed late in the year. That activity helped support sentiment as liquidity thins and market leadership remains concentrated. Investors will be watching upcoming economic releases and year-end liquidity closely for signs that AI-driven leadership can sustain the rally into the final stretch of the year.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "The Case for Nvidia Stock Hitting $275 in 2026\n\nSristi Suman Jayaswal\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:57 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNVIDIA Corporation’s (NVDA) rise has been extraordinary. Once a small graphics chip maker, it now powers data centers, artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and next-gen vehicles, becoming one of Wall Street’s most influential technology leaders. But the AI chip stock’s story has felt like a rocket ride with a few sharp air pockets along the way.\n\nNot long ago, NVDA briefly touched the rarefied $5 trillion market-cap club, powered by blistering revenue growth and near-total dominance of the AI chip market. Then came the pullback. The stock cooled as whispers of an AI bubble grew louder, and investors questioned how long this breakneck infrastructure spending could last. For a company this big, even perfection can feel priced in.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nWill Tesla Stock Lose Its ‘Elon Musk Premium’ After the SpaceX IPO? And You Should Sell TSLA Here?\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nBut as 2026 approaches, analyst Dan Ives and his team foresee a tech world – and its investors – caught between excitement and anxiety. The AI revolution hints at a once-in-a-generation leap forward, yet the trillions required to fuel it naturally raise questions. Still, that scale of investment also signals a fourth industrial revolution taking shape, with the U.S. firmly setting the pace.\nThe analyst believes this crossroads makes 2026 an inflection year. With tech stocks projected to rise by over 20%, Nvidia’s dominance, expanding demand drivers, and potential China access underpin a bullish $275 case. With that setup, let’s get into the details.\nAbout NVIDIA Stock Santa Clara-based Nvidia hardly needs an introduction. Once celebrated as the king of gaming graphics, it quietly reinvented itself as the backbone of modern computing. Its GPUs now power data centers, AI, robotics, and immersive digital worlds. The CUDA software platform locked developers into a powerful ecosystem, turning Nvidia into an industry standard rather than a supplier. With a market capitalization of nearly $4.4 trillion, Jensen Huang’s company has become the engine of the AI economy.\n\nThat dominance has translated into a turbulent but rewarding stock journey. Shares of the AI chip maker have surged throughout the year, pausing only to catch breath. Despite a recent pullback, the stock remains up strongly, reflecting investors balancing long-term confidence with short-term caution. After rising to the high of $212.19 on Oct. 29, NVDA retreated about 15.5%, yet it still commands a powerful uptrend across longer horizons, up 36.8% year-to-date (YTD) and soaring 27.7% over the past six months alone.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart shows momentum cooling, not collapsing. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which pushed beyond the overheated 80 zone during October’s euphoric high, has eased back to around 52. That reset signals excess optimism being worked off, allowing the stock to stabilize rather than unravel. Volume has normalized alongside price, reinforcing the sense of consolidation rather than distribution.\n\nThe MACD oscillator remains bullish. The MACD line remains above its signal line, confirming that the broader trend still favors buyers. Although the histogram has narrowed, suggesting slower acceleration, downside pressure remains contained. In practical terms, the bulls are still in control, even if they have eased off the throttle.\nNvidia’s valuation may look expensive at first glance, with the stock trading around 41.09 times forward adjusted earnings, well above most peers. Still, it sits below its own historical average, which adds some perspective. For a company delivering strong double-digit earnings growth and holding enviable margins, that premium feels more justified.\n\nImportantly, Nvidia’s forward PEG ratio of about 1.03x is below both the sector average and its long-term median, suggesting the valuation, while elevated, is still supported by real growth rather than hype.\nNvidia Beats Q3 Projections Nvidia’s third-quarter update felt more like another chapter in its AI-driven ascent. On Nov. 19, the stock climbed nearly 3% as the company delivered results that comfortably cleared Wall Street’s bar and paired them with upbeat guidance. Revenue surged 62.5% year-over-year (YOY) to $57.01 billion, outpacing expectations, while adjusted earnings climbed 60.5% to $1.30 a share, reminding investors that scale has not slowed Nvidia’s momentum.\n\nAt the heart of the story was the data center business, still the company’s growth engine. Sales there jumped 66% annually to $51.2 billion, powered by insatiable AI demand. Networking added its own spark, with revenue soaring 162% to $8.2 billion as NVLink, InfiniBand, and Spectrum-X Ethernet gained traction. Gaming remained steady, posting 30% growth, while automotive quietly advanced with a 32% annual rise.\nManagement’s tone was just as confident. CFO Colette Kress cited Blackwell Ultra as the top-selling chip, while CEO Jensen Huang noted cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. Addressing concerns about an AI bubble, CEO Huang struck a confident tone on the earnings call. He emphasized that Nvidia is not just another accelerator vendor, but a full-stack platform spanning pre-training, post-training, and inference. Backed by over two decades of investment in CUDA-X, the company also leads in scientific computing, engineering simulations, computer graphics, and advanced data processing, giving Nvidia a breadth few competitors can match. With the management guiding Q4 revenue to about $65 billion, +/-2%, Nvidia’s growth narrative looks firmly intact.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts tracking Nvidia forecast its Q4 fiscal 2026 revenue to be $65.6 billion, and EPS is anticipated to grow 69.4% YOY to $1.44. For the full fiscal 2026, the bottom line is projected to increase 50.5% annually to $4.41 per share before rising by another 54% to $6.79 in fiscal 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock? Dan Ives views the technology sector as entering a decisive phase ahead of 2026. In Wedbush’s top technology outlook, he expects the sector to rise more than 20% as AI investments move deeper across software, semiconductors, and infrastructure. Strategic developments, including a potential AI partnership between Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) reinforce the scale of this transition. For Nvidia, Ives remains particularly confident.\n\nHe sees Nvidia as the world’s leading AI chip provider, with demand drivers still underappreciated by the market and added upside from improving access to China. In Wedbush’s view, 2026 represents an inflection point for the AI buildout, and Nvidia stands out as a primary beneficiary. Ives’ $275 price target suggests NVDA could rally by as much as 51.9%.\nOverall, analysts are bullish about NVDA’s growth prospects, giving the stock a consensus rating of “Strong Buy.” Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, 44 advise a “Strong Buy,” while two suggest “Moderate Buy,” one advises a “Hold,” and only one suggests a “Strong Sell.”\nThe average analyst price target for NVDA is $255.56, indicating potential upside of 39.13%. Evercore ISI’s Street-high target price of $352 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 91.63% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Stock Bulls Drive S&P 500 to the Brink of Record: Markets Wrap\n\nRita Nazareth\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:38 PM PST 12 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nGC=F\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- The holiday-shortened week started with gains in stocks amid a broad advance that saw a continuation of the bullish momentum on Wall Street. Oil and gold rallied as the dollar fell.\nEquities erased their December losses, with the S&P 500 set for an eighth straight up month - the longest winning run since 2018. Almost 400 of its shares rose Monday as the benchmark approached a record. Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. led megacaps higher. A gauge of smaller firms climbed 1.2%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nNYC’s Adams Challenges Mamdani Rent Freeze With Board Picks\nDespite bouts of volatility and concerns about the AI trade, tech has led the market to the upside this year, and it will probably be the difference between a positive and negative December, said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.\n“If a Santa Claus rally does kick in this year, St. Nick’s gift bag will likely need to be full of positive tech sentiment,” he noted.\n\nIt’s been a strong year for stocks and the big question is whether investors will carry that positive mood into 2026.\nPositioning in equities is rising and fund managers are maintaining record low levels of cash. Their expectations of a further rally are outweighing concerns over rich valuations. The Federal Reserve path is also being closely watched, with two rate cuts priced for next year.\nFed Governor Stephen Miran told Bloomberg Television the central bank risks sparking a recession unless it continues lowering rates next year.\nThe S&P 500 climbed to around 6,880. The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose two basis points to 4.16%. The dollar halted a three-day advance.\nOil rallied while gold and silver jumped to all-time highs amid geopolitical tensions.\n“Everything is shaping up for a festive end to the year,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “This week is being driven by technical tailwinds, a bit of stimulus optimism, and self-fulfilling prophecy, all of which are setting up a strong year-end and a solid start to next year.”\nHackett noted that the last two weeks of the year are typically the best on the calendar since 1950.\nThe so-called Santa Claus rally, which includes the last five trading days of December and the first two of January, has been positive roughly 80% of the time, by an average of 1.6% since 1928, he added.\n\nStory Continues\n“When this pattern is heavily discussed, it can become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Hackett said. “An important caveat, however, is the consistent theme of the past five years that historical patterns have provided little direction, with last year delivering a negative return.”\nYet Hackett said that market action is encouraging, including healthy breadth, shifting leadership, and greater discernment by investors around valuations.\n“The trend is our friend, 2026 looks to have a strong start, and a potential Santa Claus rally is back on the table, which would leave us ending the year at new highs,” said Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates.\nBuoyed by tech, the long-term valuation ratio of the S&P 500 is now at an all-time high. This metric has exceeded previous peaks that preceded major drawdowns, such as in the summer of 2000 before the dotcom crash, or in January 2022 when the market started to price a surge in interest rates.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\n\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets on a bottom sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from rate cuts until there’s a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\nEquity investor sentiment was bullish for a third straight week, although the gap over more pessimistic views has narrowed slightly, according to Deutsche Bank AG strategists.\nThe team including Parag Thatte said aggregate equity positioning declined last week, but remains modestly overweight.\nMeantime, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Ben Snider noted the bank’s baseline macro outlook is “supportive for small-cap upside in early 2026.”\n“We do not believe markets are fully pricing the likely strength of the US economy next year, and small-caps typically outperform during cyclical rallies,” they wrote.\n\nSell-side strategists across major firms have issued year-end targets for the S&P 500 that are clustered the tightest in almost a decade. With the highest forecast from Oppenheimer & Co. at 8,100 and the lowest from Stifel Nicolaus & Co. at 7,000, the gap in their annual outlook is just 16%.\nSuch lockstep views are generally considered a contrarian signal — when everyone’s leaning the same way, the imbalance often rights itself. They also come at a time when market risks are visible. Still, strategists on average see more gains for stocks in 2026, even after three straight years of double-digit returns.\nThe not insignificant amount of good news already priced in includes: an accommodative Fed that will cut rates at least once, if not twice; S&P 500 earnings to grow by about 14%; and a fiscal bump from the recently passed tax law, noted Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers.\n“It seems like folly to think that these would not benefit stocks,” he said. “One must consider whether simply meeting those expectations will be sufficient. If not, then we could see disappointment even amidst a good investment climate.”\nBofA’s Moynihan Says AI’s Economic Benefit Is ‘Kicking In More’\n“Can the market hold up if AI enthusiasm and a dovish Fed aren’t helping it?” said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report. “The answer is yes, but only as long as economic growth stays solid.”\nEssaye noted that there was a data deluge last week, and the net result was that economic data and inflation remain “Goldilocks enough to help support stocks.”\n\nAn S&P 500 valuation metric that adds in consumer sentiment suggests stocks are better positioned for gains next year than a more conventional price-earning multiple measure might indicate, according to veteran investment strategist Jim Paulsen.\nHe says that both price-earnings ratios and consumer confidence are “abnormal,” with today’s S&P 500 price-earnings multiple higher than 94% of the time since 1960, while consumer sentiment is at its first percentile since then.\nThe unusually-high PE multiple might be alarming if it weren’t for the accompanying exceptionally low sentiment, he says, writing that “until the Emotion-Adjusted PE rises to a concerning level, investors may be best served by remaining bullish.”\nUS PREVIEW: Third-Quarter GDP to Prove Resilient Despite Tariffs\n“Economic data will start to hit the wires tomorrow, but for now, traders are taking their cue from the general sense amongst participants that there’s little standing in the way for a Santa Claus rally to manifest,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn the run-up to Tuesday’s reading on the economy, Bloomberg Economics estimates the US likely grew more than 3% in the third quarter, supported by robust consumer spending and modest investment gains — defying headwinds from tariff-related uncertainty.\nWhile the upcoming datapoints will provide a relevant contribution to investors’ understanding of the trajectory of the real economy, they don’t necessarily hold the needed weight to recast the outlook for 2026, according to said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets.\n“As the final trading days of 2025 arrive, the US rates market remains decidedly range-bound with little on the immediate horizon to suggest that will change before the next payrolls report,” he said. Those figures are due to be released on Jan. 9.\nThe past week featured two influential economic releases for Fed policy: employment and inflation, noted Magdalena Ocampo at Principal Asset Management.\n“Taken together, the latest economic readings are likely to give doves in the Fed the upper hand, though uncertainty remains with one more inflation and employment report due before the Fed’s next meeting in January 2026,” she said.\nFor now, she expects two rate cuts next year, likely in the first half, and, provided unemployment doesn’t spiral, Ocampo says a resilient economy, cooling inflation and easier policy should be supportive for risk assets in the year ahead.\nCorporate Highlights:\nAlphabet Inc. has agreed to buy clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash, plus existing debt, marking one of the largest deals by the tech giant to dramatically expand its data center footprint for AI.\nNvidia Corp. has told Chinese clients it aims to ship its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nMeta Platforms Inc.’s Threads will launch podcast previews, or the ability to upload snippets of shows that play directly in user feeds, as part of a broader effort to encourage podcasters and their fans to spend more time on the social network, according to a person familiar with the plans.\nTarget Corp., Whole Foods Market and Walmart Inc. will be added as defendants in lawsuits against baby formula maker ByHeart for selling a product potentially contaminated with spores that cause infant botulism.\nNetflix Inc. refinanced part of a $59 billion bridge loan with cheaper and longer-term debt, bolstering the financial package underpinning its bid for Warner Bros.

      "Content": "3 Reasons I'm Not Buying Nvidia Stock Headed Into 2026\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:26 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points The stock has risen about 35% year to date.\nCompetition is still far behind, but that doesn't mean some hyperscalers aren't finding workarounds to reduce their dependence on Nvidia.\nSome other tech stocks with AI exposure may be better buys.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nAfter a transformational 2024 for Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business and its stock, momentum has persisted as the AI (artificial intelligence) boom accelerated. The year has confirmed Nvidia's leadership position in AI chips as its data center segment has grown to represent the majority of its business, and demand for its most powerful products continues to exceed supply.\n\nThere's a lot to like about the tech company , which designs graphics processing units (GPUs) and related systems that power AI computing. In fact, Nvidia has seen its growth reaccelerate in its most recent quarter.\n\nBut has the stock soared too high, making shares unattractive even though the business is firing on all cylinders?\nI think so.\nHere are three reasons I'm not interested in buying Nvidia at its current price.\nCustomer concentration risk Highlighting the explosive demand for its products, Nvidia's revenue grew 62% year over year in its third quarter of fiscal 2026 (the quarter ending Oct. 26, 2025) after 56% year over year growth in fiscal Q2.\nThat kind of growth, however, depends heavily on a small group of customers. In its quarterly report for fiscal Q3, Nvidia said one direct customer accounted for 22% of total revenue, another represented 15%, and two more customers each exceeded 10%. Even more, this concentration risk has been rising; for the year-ago quarter, the company disclosed its three biggest customers at 12% apiece.\n\nAnd Nvidia warned in its fiscal third-quarter update that it also generates a substantial portion of its sales from a limited number of indirect customers, or customers who primarily purchase Nvidia's products through distributors and system integrators.\n\"We generate a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of indirect customers,\" Nvidia explained in its fiscal third-quarter 10-Q filing, \"some individually representing 10% or more of our revenue.\"\nCompetition is intensifying Additionally, while Nvidia is still a clear leader across essentially every high-value technology behind AI, including related CPUs, GPUs, networking, and even some critical software used to run this hardware, it's not stopping some of Nvidia's biggest customers from looking for workarounds for some aspects of their AI businesses.\n\nStory Continues\nAlongside its use of Nvidia GPUs, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has used Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) internally for years. And the generative AI company Anthropic is betting on these Alphabet TPUs, too.\n\"We are investing in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners,\" said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai in the company's third-quarter earnings call, \"and we are excited that Anthropic recently shared plans to access up to 1 million TPUs.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has pushed its Trainium line along a similar path. In fact, Anthropic is also a Tranium customer.\n\nThis Amazon AI chip business is seeing explosive growth.\n\n\"Trainium2 continues to see strong adoption, is fully subscribed, and is now a multibillion-dollar business that grew 150% quarter-over-quarter,\" said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in the company's most recent earnings call. \"Today, Trainium is being used by a small number of very large customers, but we expect to accommodate more customers starting with Trainium3.\"\nThe valuation is steep The final reason I'm not buying Nvidia shares headed into 2026 is valuation. Shares of a price-to-earnings ratio of about 45 as of this writing. This is well above the valuations of more diversified tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft -- all of which have significant exposure to AI alongside their proven core businesses that have grown at robust rates for years. The price-to-earnings ratios of these three tech companies currently stand at 30, 32, and 34, respectively. I'd rather put my money on these less cyclical tech giants entering 2026 than on Nvidia, which has an uncomfortable level of customer concentration and is facing rising competition from deep-pocketed tech giants.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "Why One Fund Added $4.2 Million to Park Hotels Even Though the Stock Has Slid 27%\n\nJonathan Ponciano, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:21 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PK\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Pennsylvania-based Matthew 25 Management reported its PK position increased by 373,500 shares in the third quarter.\nThe position was up $4.22 million in value compared to the previous quarter.\nAs of September 30, Matthew 25 reported holding 475,000 PK shares valued at $5.26 million.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nPennsylvania-based Matthew 25 Management disclosed a purchase of 373,500 additional shares of Park Hotels & Resorts (PK) for approximately $4.22 million during the quarter ended September 30, according to a filing published November 12.\nWhat Happened According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission dated November 12, Matthew 25 Management Corp increased its holdings in Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:PK) by 373,500 shares during the most recent quarter. The total position reached 475,000 shares with a reported market value of $5.26 million at quarter-end.\n\nWhat Else to Know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: NVDA: $81.72 million (25.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AMZN: $31.56 million (9.7% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: MELI: $30.38 million (9.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: TSM: $19.13 million (5.9% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: TSLA: $16.32 million (5% of AUM)\nAs of Monday, shares were priced at $10.80, down 27% over the past year and well underperforming the S&P 500, which is up about 16% in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of Monday)\n$10.80\nMarket capitalization\n$2.16 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$2.54 billion\nDividend yield\n9%\n\nCompany Snapshot Park Hotels & Resorts operates 40 premium-branded hotels and resorts, generating revenue primarily from lodging, hospitality services, and ancillary real estate activities.\nThe business model centers on owning and managing a geographically diverse portfolio of hotel properties, with income streams from room bookings, event hosting, and related services.\nIt targets business and leisure travelers in prime city center and resort destinations, focusing on high-traffic, premium locations.\n\nPark Hotels & Resorts Inc. is one of the largest publicly traded lodging REITs in the United States, with a portfolio exceeding 24,000 rooms across major urban and resort markets. Its scale and focus on premium locations provide a competitive edge in the hospitality sector.\nFoolish Take Park Hotels sits at an interesting intersection right now: RevPAR is sliding, margins are compressing, and reported results show a net loss. But the underlying asset base hasn’t disappeared, and the company is leaning hard into liquidity and capital flexibility to ride out the downturn.\n\nIn the third quarter, Park reported adjusted EBITDA of $130 million, down from last year, as comparable RevPAR fell 6.1% year over year. Management was blunt about softer leisure and government demand, but also flagged a projected 12% increase in fourth-quarter group revenue pace. That forward visibility matters for a REIT whose cash flow is highly sensitive to occupancy and pricing swings. The company also expanded its revolver to $1 billion and secured up to $800 million in delayed-draw term loans, lifting total liquidity to roughly $2.1 billion.\n\nThis also matters with context. This fund’s largest holdings are growth-heavy names like Nvidia, Amazon, MercadoLibre, and Tesla. Park Hotels looks nothing like those positions. Instead, it functions as a cyclical ballast, offering asset-backed optionality and a roughly 9% dividend yield at recent prices. The risk is obvious, but so is the asymmetry if travel stabilizes faster than expected.\n\nStory Continues\nGlossary 13F: A quarterly report filed by institutional investment managers disclosing their equity holdings to the SEC.\nAssets Under Management (AUM): The total market value of investments managed on behalf of clients by a fund or firm.\nNet buy: When the total purchases of a security exceed total sales during a period, increasing the holding.\nDividend yield: Annual dividends paid by a company divided by its share price, expressed as a percentage.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\nREIT: Real Estate Investment Trust; a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate.\nMarket capitalization: The total value of a company's outstanding shares, calculated as share price times shares outstanding.\nPremium-branded: Refers to properties or products associated with higher quality, reputation, and pricing within their sector.\nStake: The ownership interest or amount of shares held in a company by an investor or fund.\nFiling: An official document submitted to a regulatory body, such as the SEC, containing required financial or operational information.\nQuarter-end: The last day of a fiscal quarter, used as a reference point for financial reporting.\nAncillary real estate activities: Additional business operations related to property, such as event hosting or related services, beyond core lodging.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The fund’s remaining position stands at 225,000 shares valued at $6.51 million at quarter end.\nWhat Else to Know Top holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: NVDA: $81.72 million (25.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AMZN: $31.56 million (9.7% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: MELI: $30.38 million (9.4% of AUM)\nNYSE: TSM: $19.13 million (5.9% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: TSLA: $16.32 million (5% of AUM)\nAs of Monday, shares of Interface were priced at $27.98, up 14% over the past year and slightly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 16% in the same period.\n\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nMarket Capitalization\n$1.63 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.37 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$113.47 million\nPrice (as of Monday)\n$27.98\n\nCompany Snapshot Interface produces modular carpet tiles, resilient flooring, rubber flooring, and luxury vinyl tile products, with additional offerings in antimicrobial compounds and installation systems.\nThe company generates revenue through direct sales to end-users and indirect distribution channels, complemented by project management and maintenance services.\nIt serves commercial, institutional, and residential clients globally, with a focus on offices, healthcare, education, hospitality, and retail sectors.\n\nInterface is a global leader in modular flooring, leveraging a diversified product portfolio and broad geographic reach to serve commercial and institutional markets. The company’s strategy emphasizes innovation in sustainable flooring solutions and value-added services, reinforcing its competitive position. Scale, brand recognition, and a multi-channel distribution model underpin Interface’s ability to capture demand across key end markets.\nFoolish Take What makes this move worth watching is not the sale itself but the timing. Interface just delivered one of its strongest quarters in years, with third-quarter revenue up nearly 6% to $364.5 million and GAAP earnings per share jumping 63% year over year to $0.78. Margins expanded meaningfully too, with adjusted gross margin climbing more than 230 basis points, and management raised full-year guidance. On the surface, this looks like exactly the kind of setup that would keep long-term holders comfortable.\n\nBut portfolio management is about opportunity cost. Interface shares have rallied off prior lows and are now up roughly 14% over the past year, even as broader demand indicators in commercial construction remain uneven. For a fund whose top positions include mega-cap growth names like Nvidia, Amazon, and MercadoLibre, trimming a smaller, more cyclical holding after a solid run can be less about doubt and more about discipline.\n\nInterface still has a compelling story around pricing power, sustainability leadership, and balance sheet improvement, with net leverage now well under one times EBITDA. The takeaway for long-term investors is simple: Strong execution does not guarantee linear upside. At this stage, Interface looks more like a well-run compounder than a deep value rebound, which means returns may increasingly hinge on patience rather than momentum.\n\nStory Continues\nGlossary Stake: The ownership interest or investment a fund or individual holds in a company.\n13F reportable assets: Securities that institutional investment managers must disclose quarterly to the SEC on Form 13F.\nAssets Under Management (AUM): The total market value of investments managed on behalf of clients by a fund or firm.\nTop holdings: The largest investments in a fund's portfolio, usually ranked by market value or percentage of AUM.\nDistribution channels: The various ways a company sells its products, such as direct sales or through third-party distributors.\nEnd markets: The industries or customer segments that ultimately purchase and use a company's products or services.\nModular carpet tiles: Carpet flooring products made in square or rectangular sections, allowing flexible installation and replacement.\nProject management services: Assistance provided by a company to oversee and coordinate the installation or implementation of its products.\nValue-added services: Additional services offered beyond basic products to enhance customer experience or product effectiveness.\nMulti-channel distribution: A sales strategy using multiple methods or platforms to reach customers, such as direct and indirect sales.\nAntimicrobial compounds: Chemical additives used in products to inhibit the growth of bacteria, mold, or other microbes.\nTTM: The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

In its amended offer, Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, will personally guarantee more than 40 billion in equity financing for that deal. He also agreed not to revoke the Ellison family trust and Paramount raised the termination fee of the deal to 5.8 billion, matching the number from Netflix, but Paramount did not raise the offer price from $30 a share.\n01:21 Speaker A\nThe move is enough to have some predictions change on who will close the Warner Brothers acquisition.

Shares of cloud security and performance company Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) jumped 2.6% in the afternoon session after investor enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence sector regained momentum, fueled by gains in industry leaders like Nvidia and Micron.\nThis \"AI-boost\" acted as a primary catalyst, helping the S&P 500 approach the historic 7,000 level during the shortened holiday week. This upward trend built upon Cloudflare’s robust fundamental performance. In its most recent quarter, the company reported $562.03 million in revenue, a 30.7% year-over-year increase, with earnings per share rising to $0.27.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $201.76, up 3.1% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Cloudflare? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Cloudflare’s shares are quite volatile and have had 19 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 20 days ago when the stock gained 4.2% on the news that Barclays initiated coverage on the company with an Overweight rating and a $235 price target.\n\nThe new rating suggested strong confidence in the cloud security company's future. Analysts at the firm highlighted Cloudflare's vast network, which supported a significant portion of the internet, as a major strength. They projected that the company's revenue was positioned to grow between 27% and 30% annually through 2028. This growth was expected to be fueled by a diverse range of products and an expanding share of the market. The price target of $235 represented a notable premium over the stock's previous closing price.\nCloudflare is up 79.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $201.76 per share, it is still trading 20.3% below its 52-week high of $253.30 from October 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Cloudflare’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,331.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend.

Plus, get a 1% bonus if you transfer your investments and keep them there until December 31, 2025.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) traded significantly lower over the past month as the former high-flying AI server maker faces intense scrutiny regarding its accounting practices and delayed financial filings. The company is fighting to regain investor trust after a tumultuous period that saw its valuation severely reset amid fears of a potential delisting.\nAgainst that backdrop, we ran Super Micro Computer through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI’s GPT. The goal was not to chase a sensational long-term target, but to see how a data-driven model handicaps the next 60 days for a stock that has become shorthand for the entire AI trade.\nWhat the AI model is actually predicting The agent was asked to generate a near-term outlook for Super Micro Computer, using recent price action and a focused set of technical indicators. At the time of the run, SMCI traded at $30.13. For the period from Dec. 17 through Dec 31, the model’s base-case projection came out to:\nAverage predicted price: $30.75\nImplied move: slightly lower over the next month\nSignal snapshot: The technical indicators (MACD and RSI) both skewed negative\n\nThe model is saying that, given current momentum and volatility, the most likely path is a modest grind lower from current levels rather than a dramatic reset. Still, broader AI price prediction says that Super Micro Computer could hit $176 by 2030, which illustrates the massive long-term upside baked into the current valuation if it continues its AI server dominance.\nThe key driver behind the AI model’s bearish short-term view is the recent cooling in the AI infrastructure trade, often triggered by tempered outlooks from key players like Oracle and Broadcom. Super Micro Computer is a critical supplier of specialized, high-performance servers, particularly those optimized for NVIDIA’s latest GPUs.\nWhile demand remains massive, the company has a record order backlog, the market has recently focused on short-term challenges. Namely, a temporary dip in revenue growth and significant gross margin compression were reported in the recent quarter, which has intensified concerns about pricing power amid rising competition.\n\nStory Continues\nThe single biggest factor weighing on the stock is the shrinking gross margin, which recently went down. This signals the high cost of scaling production rapidly and the intensifying competition from larger, established server makers and rising Asian rivals. The model’s negative forecast for the next 14 days is a technical reflection of this fundamental pressure. The market is effectively demanding proof that Super Micro can maintain its design advantage and market share in specialized server and liquid cooling solutions without continually sacrificing profitability. Until management can demonstrate a clearer path to margin recovery, the stock is likely to remain under pressure.\n\nThe negative skew in both the MACD and RSI confirms the short-term downward bias. A declining MACD suggests the selling momentum is strengthening, with the short-term average falling below the long-term one.\nThe RSI, currently near the low 30s, is approaching “oversold” territory, which suggests the stock is suffering from strong selling pressure. This dual negative signal implies that the stock’s recent four-day losing streak could continue into the new year, aligning with the model’s predicted decline.\nDespite the near-term technical weakness, Super Micro's long-term bullish case rests on its deep strategic integration with NVIDIA and its leadership in advanced thermal management, particularly Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC). AI data centers generate immense heat, and SMCI’s liquid cooling solutions are critical for managing the power and thermal demands of next-generation chips like the NVIDIA Blackwell.\n\nBy selling full, rack-scale solutions, its Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) strategy, rather than just individual servers, Super Micro aims to capture more value per customer, a strategy that is expected to drive margin recovery as production scales.\nWall Street, for now, is still leaning into that growth. Across major platforms, analysts maintain a Hold consensus with 12-month price targets clustering in the mid-$40s to mid-$50s. Some of the more aggressive firms see upside into the low-$60s if Super Micro Computer maintains its dominant share in AI rack-scale and liquid-cooled servers. Even the median targets imply a 45% to 55% upside from current levels, a bullish outlook that starkly contrasts with the AI model’s cautious 14-day prediction.\nThe AI forecast can be viewed as a short-term temperature check on how quickly the market might be willing to reopen the multiple after a shakeout, not a verdict on whether Super Micro Computer's run is over.\nImage: Shutterstock\nThis article ChatGPT Super Micro Computer Stock Will Close At This Price In The Next 60 Days originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose two basis points to 4.17%. The dollar halted a three-day advance. Bitcoin rose to around $89,000.\nOil rallied while gold and silver jumped to all-time highs amid geopolitical tensions.\n“Everything is shaping up for a festive end to the year,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “This week is being driven by technical tailwinds, a bit of stimulus optimism, and self-fulfilling prophecy, all of which are setting up a strong year-end and a solid start to next year.”\nHackett noted that the last two weeks of the year are typically the best on the calendar since 1950.\nThe so-called Santa Claus rally, which includes the last five trading days of December and the first two of January, has been positive roughly 80% of the time, by an average of 1.6% since 1928, he added.\n\nStory Continues\n“When this pattern is heavily discussed, it can become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Hackett said. “An important caveat, however, is the consistent theme of the past five years that historical patterns have provided little direction, with last year delivering a negative return.”\nYet Hackett said that market action is encouraging, including healthy breadth, shifting leadership, and greater discernment by investors around valuations.\n“The trend is our friend, 2026 looks to have a strong start, and a potential Santa Claus rally is back on the table, which would leave us ending the year at new highs,” said Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates.\nBuoyed by tech, the long-term valuation ratio of the S&P 500 is now at an all-time high. This metric has exceeded previous peaks that preceded major drawdowns, such as in the summer of 2000 before the dotcom crash, or in January 2022 when the market started to price a surge in interest rates.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\n\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets on a bottom sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from rate cuts until there’s a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\nEquity investor sentiment was bullish for a third straight week, although the gap over more pessimistic views has narrowed slightly, according to Deutsche Bank AG strategists.\nThe team including Parag Thatte said aggregate equity positioning declined last week, but remains modestly overweight.\nMeantime, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Ben Snider noted the bank’s baseline macro outlook is “supportive for small-cap upside in early 2026.”\n“We do not believe markets are fully pricing the likely strength of the US economy next year, and small-caps typically outperform during cyclical rallies,” they wrote.\n\nSell-side strategists have issued year-end targets for the S&P 500 that are clustered the tightest in almost a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With the highest forecast from Oppenheimer & Co. at 8,100 and the lowest from Stifel Nicolaus & Co. at 7,000, the gap in their annual outlook is just 16%.\nSuch lockstep views are generally considered a contrarian signal — when everyone’s leaning the same way, the imbalance often rights itself. They also come at a time when market risks are visible. Still, strategists on average see more gains for stocks in 2026, even after three straight years of double-digit returns.\n“Can the market hold up if AI enthusiasm and a dovish Fed aren’t helping it?” said Tom Essaye at The Sevens Report. “The answer is yes, but only as long as economic growth stays solid.”\nEssaye noted that there was a data deluge last week, and the net result was that economic data and inflation remain “Goldilocks enough to help support stocks.”\n\nAn S&P 500 valuation metric that adds in consumer sentiment suggests stocks are better positioned for gains next year than a more conventional price-earning multiple measure might indicate, according to veteran investment strategist Jim Paulsen.\nHe says that both price-earnings ratios and consumer confidence are “abnormal,” with today’s S&P 500 price-earnings multiple higher than 94% of the time since 1960, while consumer sentiment is at its first percentile since then. The unusually-high PE multiple might be alarming if it weren’t for the accompanying exceptionally low sentiment, he says, writing that “until the Emotion-Adjusted PE rises to a concerning level, investors may be best served by remaining bullish.”\nUS PREVIEW: Third-Quarter GDP to Prove Resilient Despite Tariffs\n“Economic data will start to hit the wires tomorrow, but for now, traders are taking their cue from the general sense amongst participants that there’s little standing in the way for a Santa Claus rally to manifest,” said Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers.\n\nIn the run-up to Tuesday’s reading on the economy, Bloomberg Economics estimates the US likely grew more than 3% in the third quarter, supported by robust consumer spending and modest investment gains — defying headwinds from tariff-related uncertainty.\n“The incoming economic data is second-tier at best, a fact that further reinforces the notion that rates will stay in an all-too-familiar territory as 2026 quickly approaches,” said Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets.\nCorporate Highlights:\nAlphabet Inc. has agreed to buy clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash, plus existing debt, marking one of the largest deals by the tech giant to dramatically expand its data center footprint for AI.\nNvidia Corp. has told Chinese clients it aims to ship its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nMeta Platforms Inc.’s Threads will launch podcast previews, or the ability to upload snippets of shows that play directly in user feeds, as part of a broader effort to encourage podcasters and their fans to spend more time on the social network, according to a person familiar with the plans.\nOpenAI has squeezed better margins out of its paid products this year, as it races to maintain its pole position in artificial intelligence, according to a report in The Information.\nTarget Corp., Whole Foods Market and Walmart Inc. will be added as defendants in lawsuits against baby formula maker ByHeart for selling a product potentially contaminated with spores that cause infant botulism.\nNetflix Inc. refinanced part of a $59 billion bridge loan with cheaper and longer-term debt, bolstering the financial package underpinning its bid for Warner Bros.

      "Content": "Will More Circular Deal-Making Be in the Cards for Nvidia in 2026?\n\nJoey Frenette\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:40 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Circular dealmaking among tech firms, like Nvidia, is expected to continue through 2025.\nEnterprise AI adoption may accelerate if evidence of strong ROI emerges in the future.\nAmazon is reportedly considering a $10B investment in OpenAI.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe circular nature of the deals and partnerships we've seen across the AI space may make some skeptics and those worried about a looming AI bubble burst a bit woozy. Undoubtedly, it seems like a new deal is coming in every couple of weeks. And if each new announcement or rumor has you on pause, you're definitely not alone.\nAnd while adding more dominoes to the row might make for a more spectacular implosion at some point down the road, investors might wish to take a step back and reconsider what every new deal means and whether it really is a sign that we're headed for a repeat of the events that unfolded in the late-1990s.\nAll these deals seem to fuel the AI bubble fears With Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) most recently reported to be considering a big $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the web of deals across big tech titans seems to be getting bigger and more interlinked. Does that mean the risks are higher?\nPossibly. But adding more dominoes to the row might not be all too big of a deal if there's nobody who nudges one of them anytime soon. As always, timing is such a hard thing to get right. If you don't get the timing right, you may as well be wrong about the bubble situation.\n\nAnd while AI bubble talks are probably going to be the talk of the town in 2026, I think investors might be better off sticking with individual value names rather than dismissing all stocks until that big crash comes. Indeed, timing the market, even when valuations are on the higher end, might not be all too beneficial.\nSo, in my view, the question of whether we're in a bubble or not might matter a whole lot less if you're diversified and ready to ride through a storm.\nCould the circular AI deals keep happening, even as investors give a thumbs down? Whether it's OpenAI or Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) that keeps its foot to the deal-making pedal, I don't think investors should hit the panic button just yet, especially as many others are already acting as though AI has run into a brick wall. While increased collaborations between tech titans and innovative startups could make it harder to track systemic risk, I do think that such circularity stands to accelerate efforts while reducing waste.\n\nStory Continues\nUndoubtedly, raising the bar on risk isn't exactly what retail investors want from the big tech titans they hold shares in. But the more elevated risk profile, I believe, also accompanies greater potential rewards if things go right. In essence, the bear case gets more bearish while the bull case might get that much more bullish. At the end of the day, large-scale AI and ambitious goals (think reaching artificial general intelligence, or AGI) are profound challenges that require group effort.\n\nAs a builder of the most powerful GPUs out there, Nvidia stands out as a firm that should keep making deals where possible to keep advancing the technology. So, should investors expect more circular dealmaking in the new year?\nTime will tell, but I'd say it's probable, especially as enterprise adoption of AI looks to pick up, should more evidence of monetization arise.\nRight now, it's unclear if the return on investment will be there. And while we might not know what the ROIs will be in the near future, I do think that there's a chance that if evidence of a decent ROI suddenly comes flowing in, an AI adoption floodgate might just open, unlocking another wave of growth for the firms across the AI stack.\nThe bottom line Of course, we can only speculate for now, but it seems like many analysts see more circular deals in the new year. And as the king of AI chips, Nvidia is likelier than not to be involved, as too are leading model makers like OpenAI. So, in short, expect more of the same in the AI scene.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "This Nvidia Rival is More Expensive Than Nvidia. Is it Worth the Price?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 10:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia is the top maker of AI chips, and this business has driven billion-dollar revenue growth.\nThe company faces a competitor that’s made great progress in recent years.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nAs the artificial intelligence (AI) story unfolds, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has so far been the leading character. This is because the company makes the key tool that's spurred all of the action: AI chips. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) fuel critical tasks like the training of AI models so that they later can go on to work for us.\n\nNvidia's leadership in the AI chip market and its development of an entire suite of related products and services have helped the company generate record revenue in recent years, with its latest annual sales figure coming in at $130 billion, and the stock price has soared. Over the past three years, Nvidia shares have climbed more than 900%.\nBut Nvidia isn't alone in the AI chip market, and a certain rival has made significant progress in recent years. I'm talking about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) . The company has put the focus on serving AI, and like Nvidia, has seen its revenue and stock price take off. In fact, right now, AMD actually is more expensive than Nvidia as it trades at a higher valuation. Is it worth the price? Let's find out.\nFirst to market Nvidia was first to market with its GPUs for AI , and that has helped it build leadership. But in recent years, AMD has prioritized the development of accelerators for AI, and its work is bearing fruit. The company introduced its Instinct GPUs for data centers in late 2016 and has since added to this collection.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are known as the fastest around, and the company's extensive menu of compatible products makes it easy for a Nvidia customer to stick with the company year after year. The market leader has remained a step ahead when it comes to performance, particularly in the area of inferencing, or the powering of AI models as they go through the \"thinking\" process to solve problems.\nBut AMD's GPUs have delivered growth because they also are very powerful and pricing is competitive. And this has helped supercharge revenue growth. In the recent quarter, revenue climbed 36% to a high of $9.2 billion, thanks to demand for AI processors and accelerators. And the pace of quarterly earnings gains over the past three years offers us reason to be optimistic about AMD's growth.\nBenefiting from infrastructure spending AMD doesn't have to unseat Nvidia to succeed in the AI market -- considering Nvidia's prediction for $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the coming five years, there's room for more than one player to win. Data centers often order material from a variety of players, even if they favor Nvidia's platforms.\n\nStory Continues\nAll of this is great news for AMD. But the one element that I've looked at with concern in recent months is the stock's valuation -- particularly in relation to that of Nvidia. Today, trading for more than 50x forward earnings estimates, it's priced at a premium compared to its bigger rival. As shown in the chart below, Nvidia trades for 37x forward earnings estimates.\nNvidia's growth vs AMD's growth Meanwhile, Nvidia's growth has been consistently higher than that of AMD. For example, in the third quarter, Nvidia's revenue jumped 62% to a record $57 billion. And this showed an acceleration of growth, since Nvidia's revenue rose 56% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, Nvidia's plan to update its GPUs on an annual basis should keep growth going -- the company spoke of enormous demand for both its Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra platforms, each released over the past year. Next year, the plan is to launch the Rubin system, and that may be a catalyst for revenue and share price gains.\n\nAMD also continues to innovate, but it may be extremely difficult for the company to step ahead of Nvidia. As I mentioned earlier, the positive point is that the chip designer doesn't have to beat Nvidia to succeed in this market. And AMD's revenue trends over the past few years and recent results are fantastic. But I wouldn't pay more for the company today than I would for Nvidia -- so I would put AMD on my watch list for now and look for opportunities to eventually buy on the dip.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

To assemble the capital, SoftBank has already exited its entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and reduced its holding in T-Mobile US by $4.8 billion, while significantly slowing activity at the Vision Fund. Sources said most new investments above $50 million now require Son's direct approval, underscoring how central the OpenAI deal has become to SoftBank's strategy.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SOBKY.\nIs SOBKY fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe group is also lining up additional funding levers that could support the commitment. SoftBank is preparing the IPO of PayPay, now expected in the first quarter of next year after delays tied to the U.S. government shutdown, with sources indicating the listing could raise more than $20 billion. At the same time, the company is exploring sales of part of its stake in Didi Global ahead of the ride-hailing firm's planned Hong Kong listing. As of Sept. 30, SoftBank reported parent-level cash of 4.2 trillion yen and retained a roughly 4% stake in T-Mobile US, providing flexibility alongside potential margin loans backed by its Arm Holdings stake.\n\nThe funding is seen as important for OpenAI as it ramps up spending on model training and infrastructure amid intensifying competition from Alphabet. SoftBank agreed in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, with the bulk of the funds contingent on the startup's transition to a for-profit structure, completed in October, and OpenAI expects the remaining capital to arrive by the end of 2025 under the contract terms. Both companies are also investors in Stargate, a $500 billion AI data-center initiative, as tech groups including Meta Platforms commit unprecedented sums to computing capacityan environment that could offer long-term opportunity, while also raising investor questions about returns across the AI buildout cycle.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The policy shift marks a reversal from prior limits under the Biden administration, which had barred advanced chip sales citing national security risks.\nNvidia has informed Chinese clients that it will open new production capacity for H200 orders in the second quarter of 2026, though the plan still requires Chinese regulatory approval. The H200, part of Nvidia's Hopper line, remains widely used across AI data centers despite being succeeded by the company's newer Blackwell chips.\nThe company's move comes as Chinese technology firms, including Alibaba Group and ByteDance, seek access to high performance processors amid a domestic shortage.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radars.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares haven’t performed well lately. They are up by 30.9% year-to-date, but since October end, the stock is down by 12.6% amidst worries about an AI bubble and competition in the AI chip industry. However, the weakness hasn’t stopped analysts from expressing optimism about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares. One such example came on December 19th when Tigress Financial kept a Strong Buy rating and raised the share price target to $350. As part of its rationale, the financial firm pointed out that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top investment choice in AI and enjoys a comfortable position across the data center stack. It added that the firm was also making inroads into other markets, such as autonomous driving. Tigress’ optimism followed Bernstein’s coverage on December 15th when the firm reiterated an Outperform rating and a $275 share price target for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock. Cramer’s been highly enthusiastic about the firm throughout 2025, but in this appearance, he advised caution:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "3 Soaring Stocks to Hold for the Next 20 Years\n\nRick Munarriz, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBABA\n\n^GSPC\n\nNU\n\nKey Points Shares of Nvidia, Alibaba Group, and Nu Holdings have more than doubled the S&P 500's 16% return in 2025.\nDespite their recent gains, all three stocks are positioned to continue beating the market.\nNvidia may have the world's largest market cap, but ceilings can sometimes be retractable roofs.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nStocks are rallying this year, and naturally, some names are faring better than others. It may be tempting to pass on some of the top stocks of 2025 as big gainers in 2026 and beyond, but that could be a huge mistake. Winners keep winning.\nThe market is up 16% this year. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) , and Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) have at least doubled the S&P 500 's year-to-date gain. I think these are three soaring stocks that could serve you well over the next two decades. Let's take a short look a their long-term potential.\n1. Nvidia: Up 35% in 2025 They say that the bigger they are, the harder they fall. Owner of the country's largest market cap for most of the time since the summer of last year, Nvidia certainly fits the bill as the biggest U.S. exchange-listed stock. If I can revisit the old adage, I would say that the bigger they are, the harder they enthrall.\n\nNvidia became the first company to ever cross a market cap of $5 trillion two months ago. It has since retreated to $4.4 trillion, but don't get caught up in how high a market price tag can go. Focus on Nvidia's growth potential, its forward valuation, and how this generational wealth builder might be cheaper than you think.\nThe Nvidia story has been told often and better than I could ever tell it. In a nutshell, it's a chipmaker that made breakthroughs with graphics cards, initially appealing to video gamers. Nvidia would introduce the first single-chip graphics processing unit (GPU) 26 years ago. Flash forward to now, and GPUs and other high-performance chips are at the heart of crypto mining and more importantly, cranking out artificial intelligence (AI) results.\n\nGrowth has been spectacular as the world clamors for its AI chips to fuel data centers. After back-to-back years of triple-digit revenue growth, Nvidia's top line is still expected to increase at a healthy 63% pace for the current fiscal year that ends next month. Business is expected to continue decelerating in the year ahead, rising at a still-impressive 49%. The bottom line is expected to rise even higher, increasing by 60% next year.\nDespite the stock's stellar run -- it's a 13-bagger over the past five years -- the shares are surprisingly cheap. You can buy Nvidia for just 24 times forward earnings. Bears will argue that today's growth isn't sustainable, but it's not as if the company is operating at full strength. It's currently dealing with revenue- and margin-gnawing trade restrictions in China that have been holding back its true potential.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Alibaba Group: Up 78% Nvidia's challenges in China could be an opportunity for one of the world's largest e-commerce companies. Alibaba is in a great place. It operates China's leading business-to-consumer platform and consumer-to-consumer marketplace. The two businesses account for 45% of Alibaba's consolidated revenue, but generated 113% of its consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in fiscal 2025.\n\nAlibaba is using those two cash cows to bankroll investments, including international e-commerce and the development of AI chips. Throw in a cash-rich balance sheet, and Alibaba is able to self-fund some exciting long-term bets and still be able to aggressively participate in share buybacks.\nHow cheap is Alibaba? You can buy it for 20 times trailing earnings and 16 times what it's expected to earn in the new fiscal year starting in April. It's not growing at a very exciting pace, but it has a deep bench of future growth catalysts that deserves a strong premium to the market.\n3. Nu Holdings: Up 58% Let's keep globetrotting with the parent company of Brazil's Nubank. Nu Holdings has emerged as one of the world's fastest-growing fintechs and providers of digital banking services. It launched just 11 years ago, but more than 60% of Brazil's adult population already has either a Nubank credit card or an active account with the company.\n\nRevenue and adjusted net income rose 39% and 38%, respectively, in its latest quarter. Nu has also expanded into Mexico and Colombia, giving it two markets still early in their growth trajectories. Like Nvidia and Alibaba, you can buy this very profitable hot stock at a discount to its growth. Nu Holdings stock is trading for a reasonable 19 times forward earnings.\nSure, you could've bought Nvidia, Alibaba, and Nu at a much lower price earlier this year. The stories have only gotten better, and these should continue to be market beaters in the coming years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Oil and gold rallied as the dollar fell.\nEquities erased their December losses, with the S&P 500 set for an eighth straight up month - the longest winning run since 2018. Over 400 of its shares rose as the gauge approached a record. Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp. led megacaps higher. A gauge of smaller firms climbed 1.5%.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working.

Their expectations of a further rally are outweighing concerns over rich valuations. The Federal Reserve path is also being closely watched, with two rate cuts priced for next year.\nFed Governor Stephen Miran told Bloomberg Television the central bank risks sparking a recession unless it continues lowering rates next year.\nThe S&P 500 hovered near 6,875. The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose two basis points to 4.17%. The dollar halted a three-day advance. Bitcoin climbed to around $90,000.\nOil rallied while gold and silver jumped to all-time highs amid geopolitical tensions.\nBuoyed by tech, the long-term valuation ratio of the S&P 500 is now at an all-time high. This metric has exceeded previous peaks that preceded major drawdowns, such as in the summer of 2000 before the dotcom crash, or in January 2022 when the market started to price a surge in interest rates.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets on a bottom sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from rate cuts until there’s a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\nEquity investor sentiment was bullish for a third straight week, although the gap over more pessimistic views has narrowed slightly, according to Deutsche Bank AG strategists.\nThe team including Parag Thatte said aggregate equity positioning declined last week, but remains modestly overweight.\nMeantime, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Ben Snider noted the bank’s baseline macro outlook is “supportive for small-cap upside in early 2026.”\n“We do not believe markets are fully pricing the likely strength of the US economy next year, and small-caps typically outperform during cyclical rallies,” they wrote.\n\nSell-side strategists have issued year-end targets for the S&P 500 that are clustered the tightest in almost a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

That's according to three people familiar with the matter speaking to Reuters. Nvidia has reportedly also told Chinese clients that it plans to add new production capacity for the chip. Although significant uncertainty remains. Beijing has yet to approve any H200 purchases. And the sources added that the timeline could shift depending on government decisions. Nvidia and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The planned shipments would mark the first deliveries of H200 chips to China after Donald Trump said this month that Washington would allow such sales with a 25% fee. It comes as China pushes to develop its domestic AI chip industry. Local firms have yet to match the H200's performance, raising concerns that allowing imports could slow domestic progress. Reuters reported this month that Chinese officials held emergency meetings to discuss the matter and are weighing whether to allow shipments.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia dominated the headlines in 2025 — these were its 15 biggest events of the year\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 8:01 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nSSNLF\n\n005380.KS\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nIt’s difficult to think of any single company that had a bigger impact on Wall Street and the AI trade in 2025 than Nvidia ( NVDA ).\nInvestors scrutinized CEO Jensen Huang’s every move, whether that was his meetings with President Trump or a night out with the heads of Samsung and Hyundai for fried chicken and beer.\n\nNvidia’s revenue soared in 2025, bringing in $187.1 billion, and its market capitalization continued to climb, briefly eclipsing the $5 trillion mark, before settling back in the $4 trillion range.\nThere were plenty of major highs and deep lows throughout the year, but these 15 were among the biggest moments of Nvidia’s 2025.\nJan. 6: CES 2025 Nvidia rang in the new year with a series of product announcements ranging from a new pint-sized AI chip to more powerful gaming cards at CES 2025. Huang’s keynote touched on an array of topics, including physical AI, otherwise known as robots; desktop-based AI systems; and a litany of AI software updates that set the stage for the company’s 2025.\n\nJan. 27: The DeepSeek moment Nvidia had an incredible year by seemingly every measure, but it started out with a shock. In January, DeepSeek released its R-1 model, which the company claimed it trained using less than state-of-the-art processors. That sent the AI trade into a meltdown, with the company shedding nearly $600 billion from its market cap in a single day.\nDespite the initial blowup, fears that AI companies would no longer need high-powered chips seem to have been overblown. That’s because training AI models and running them are two different operations, and according to Nvidia, running models with more powerful chips improves overall performance.\nMarkets eventually settled down as more companies agreed with the assumption, but Nvidia’s stock price didn’t return to pre-DeepSeek levels until June.\n\nMarch 18: Nvidia reveals Blackwell Ultra chips at GTC Nvidia’s annual GTC event, held in San Jose, used to be a moderately sized tech conference. But this year’s GTC was far different . Huang’s keynote filled the SAP Center, home of the San Jose Sharks hockey team, and Nvidia took over a large swath of downtown San Jose, which included an enormous collection of food tents and stalls that covered the 2.3-acre Plaza de César Chávez.\nDuring his speech, Huang debuted Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra chip, the successor to its Blackwell GPU, and the GB300 superchip, which combined two Blackwell GPUs and one of Nvidia’s Grace CPUs.\nThe CEO said the offerings were built for the age of “AI reasoning” and said models like DeepSeek’s R-1 would run far better on Nvidia’s latest and greatest.\n\nStory Continues\nApril 2: 'Liberation Day' Trump’s decision to implement a series of tariffs on countries and goods on April 2, which he called “Liberation Day,” sent the stock market into such a nosedive that the president had no choice but to walk some of them back just a week later.\nNvidia wasn’t immune to the drop. The company saw its stock price decline from $110 on April 2 to $94.31 on April 4. Shares returned to pre-\"Liberation Day\" numbers by April 9, but continued to waffle until breaking out of their slump on April 25.\nApril 15: H20 effectively banned Nvidia’s April didn’t get much better when the Trump administration implemented new chip restrictions that called for Nvidia to receive a license to ship the H20 chip to China , effectively banning sales of the processor to the country.\nNvidia designed the GPU to meet restrictions set up during President Joe Biden’s administration. Trump, however, blocked the China-specific chip on security grounds. The company ended up writing down $4.5 billion in charges related to the H20 in Q1 and took an additional $4 billion in Q2.\n\nJuly 9: Nvidia hits $4 trillion Despite taking a hit from the DeepSeek meltdown and Trump’s China ban, Nvidia stock continued to perform, and in July the company became the first to see its market capitalization pass the $4 trillion mark .\nNvidia topped $1 trillion in 2023 and took just three years to add another $3 trillion, thanks to its leadership position in the AI chip market.\nJuly 14: Nvidia can sell H20 in China again In July, the on-again-off-again relationship between Washington and China was back on, with Nvidia announcing that the Trump administration had assured the company that it would allow sales of H20 chips to China .\nHuang successfully made the case that America would benefit from selling its technologies to China and risked falling behind if it completely cut itself off from the market, convincing Trump to allow Nvidia to sell to the country again.\n\nAug. 11: Nvidia to pay 15% cut on China sales Although the White House assured Nvidia it would approve the sale of its chips to China, the administration later announced that it would take a 15% cut of the sales . The same rule applied to Nvidia rival AMD ( AMD ).\nDespite the potential revenue haircut, investors on Wall Street weren’t too bothered by the announcement, figuring that 85% of the revenue from sales to the country was better than the 0% Nvidia was bringing in before.\n\nSept. 22: Nvidia says it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI In September, Nvidia announced it would invest upward of $100 billion in ChatGPT developer OpenAI . The partnership would let OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) build out 10 gigawatts or more of data center capacity, allowing it to train and run its GPT models.\nNvidia’s deals have raised eyebrows among analysts who warn that such circular investments, where a company (Nvidia) invests in a customer (OpenAI) and uses that cash to purchase chips from the investor (Nvidia), artificially boost AI spending.\nNvidia has faced criticism for a similar deal with CoreWeave ( CRWV ). Nvidia invested in the company, which then turned around and bought Nvidia chips. Such deals have driven at least part of the discussion around an AI bubble.\n\nOct. 17: Nvidia’s first Blackwell chip built in US The Trump administration, like the Biden administration before it, has made reshoring chip manufacturing a national imperative. And while Nvidia doesn’t build its own chips — it outsources that to TSMC — it did celebrate that company’s completion of the first Blackwell chip built in the US in October .\n\nOct. 29: Nvidia hits $5 trillion Nvidia’s market capitalization hit $5 trillion in late October , just a few months after crossing the $4 trillion mark.\nThe exuberance came as the company announced a number of new deals with companies like Uber at its first GTC event in Washington, D.C. It also followed word that Huang would meet with Trump in South Korea ahead of the president’s meeting with Xi Jinping to discuss a trade deal.\nThe hope was that Trump and Xi would reach an agreement to allow Nvidia to sell its chips in the country, but a deal never materialized.\n\nOct. 30: Viral fried chicken photo with leaders of Samsung and Hyundai Huang’s star exploded throughout 2025, so much so that in October, reporters and onlookers swarmed a South Korean fried chicken restaurant to catch a glimpse of him dining with the heads of Samsung and Hyundai. An image of the trio subsequently went viral .\nNov. 19: Nvidia to ship chips to the Middle East Nvidia received authorization to ship the equivalent of more than 60,000 Blackwell chips to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in November as the company continued to vie for the opportunity to sell its processors to a wider array of countries.\nThe company has pushed the concept of sovereign AI throughout 2025, saying that it allows countries around the world to get access to their own AI data centers without having to rely on other nations.\nBut China hawks said the move could give the US adversary access to Nvidia chips, due to that country’s close relationship with the UAE.\n\nNov. 25: Nvidia’s Google tweet Nvidia has faced threats from its own customers, including Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Amazon ( AMZN ), building their own chips to power their AI platforms, but in November, a report that Google could provide Meta ( META ) with its own tensor processing units (TPUs) for the social media giant’s data centers seemed to spook Nvidia.\n\nThe company sent out a viral tweet in response to the story, congratulating Google on its chips’ performance, but pointed out that its own GPUs were a generation ahead of Google’s and noted that it’s the only chip that can run all AI models .\nDec. 9.: Nvidia H200 approved for China After a year of will he, won’t he, Trump wrote in a post on the Truth Social platform that he was greenlighting the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China . The H200 is two generations behind Nvidia’s current Blackwell Ultra processors.\nTrump said that Xi responded positively to the deal, which, if fully approved by the countries, could provide a boost to Nvidia’s bottom line.\nStill, there’s no guarantee that the arrangement won’t fall apart. Nvidia has become a negotiating chip for the two countries, just as Apple was before, and could see its chips banned again.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) to $91 from $82 and kept an Overweight rating on the stock. The firm said the AI trade widened beyond semiconductor stocks in 2025, giving a boost to infrastructure companies. Optical networking has been a clear beneficiary. The analyst expects that trend to carry into the first half of 2026. However, looking further out, the analyst noted that investors will “need to get more selective for full year returns given multiples.”\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)’s long-standing strength in networking is becoming more relevant in the age of artificial intelligence, especially as agentic AI gains traction. Products like Nexus HyperFabric bring together Cisco’s networking capabilities with Nvidia’s computing and AI software, allowing companies to build infrastructure tailored for AI workloads. Cisco is also pushing into security, describing its Hypershield platform as a fully distributed, AI-native cybersecurity solution.\nThose efforts are showing up in the numbers. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) posted 5% year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2025, with sales reaching $56.7 billion for the year ended July 26. Growth picked up in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, ending October 25, when revenue rose 8% to $14.9 billion.\n\nManagement expects that momentum to continue. For fiscal 2026, Cisco is forecasting revenue between $60.2 billion and $61 billion.\nCisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) develops and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and a range of technology services used by enterprises, service providers, and governments worldwide.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The renewed momentum follows two standout Shanghai debuts earlier this month, where Moore Threads Technology Co. advanced 425% on its first trading day and MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai Co. rose 693%, signaling strong domestic demand for companies positioned as future national champions. Some investors suggest that, over time, these firms could evolve into credible competitors to established global players such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), particularly as China accelerates efforts to build a self-sufficient AI hardware ecosystem.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAttention is now shifting to the next wave of listings, especially in Hong Kong, which may serve as a broader test of international investor confidence. Shanghai Biren Technology Co., viewed as one of China's more promising GPU developers, has filed for a Hong Kong IPO after receiving approval to issue up to 372.5 million new shares and is expected to begin sounding out investors this month for a deal of about $600 million, despite its inclusion on Washington's entity list in 2023.

Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.\n\nOpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro , Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet , and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.\n\nOpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4 , an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog . It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.\nOpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported , citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.\nOpenAI has updated ChatGPT to use information from your previous conversations OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\nOpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”\n\nOpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May . The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.\n\nChatGPT users have generated over 700M images so far More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap . The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.\n\nOpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.\n\nOpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays In a series of posts on X , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote.\n\nMarch 2025 OpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.\n\nOpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images . The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.\n\nOpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said .\n\nOpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.\n\nOpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported , citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.\n\nChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.\n\nOpenAI announces leadership updates Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products , according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.\n\nOpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels . The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch .\n\nOpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information . One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\n\nOpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”\n\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs : a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1 OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X , that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing . He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nOpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product . The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API , which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’ OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information . One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nChatGPT can directly edit your code The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools , including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025 . ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.\n\nFebruary 2025 OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X , Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’ OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nJanuary 2025 OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”\nChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders . For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’ OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.\n\nFAQs: What is ChatGPT? How does it work? ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI .

He added that, given current levels, we would be buyers here.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nRasgon noted Nvidia stock is up roughly 30% year to date but has stalled since July. That pause pushed forward valuation down to just under 25 times earnings, after a roughly 27% multiple contraction this year. By one measure, the stock sits in the bottom 11% of its historical valuation range.\nThe analyst pointed out Nvidia now trades at about a 13% discount to the broader semiconductor index, a rare relative cheapness that has appeared only a handful of days over the past decade.\nRasgon acknowledged investor worries about a slowdown in AI spending, longer-term capex plans and competition from custom chips. He said those concerns may be overstated and that demand for GPUs remains healthy.\nUpcoming product catalysts such as Rubin and the longer-term Blackwell opportunity could refocus attention, Rasgon added. Events like CES and GTC may also help reset expectations for Nvidia's roadmap and address questions around China sales.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI Chips Are Driving a Foundry Boom. Why TSMC Is Winning the Most\n\nNauman Khan\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:33 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nGlobal semiconductor foundry revenue rose about 17% year over year to roughly $84.8 billion in the third quarter of 2025, supported by strong demand for artificial intelligence chips built on advanced manufacturing nodes, according to a research note from Counterpoint Research.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( NYSE:TSM ) widened its lead, with market share edging up to about 72%. The gains followed higher output of its 3-nanometer process and solid utilization of 4- and 5-nanometer capacity, used heavily by AI accelerator customers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), and Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ).\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with INTC.\nIs INTC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTSMC's foundry revenue grew more than 40% from a year earlier, outpacing the broader market. Counterpoint said most rival foundries posted slower growth, with non-TSMC players collectively expanding revenue by about 6%, reflecting softer orders after earlier tariff-related demand but some support from China's subsidy programs.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts said capacity limits at advanced nodes and constraints in advanced chip packaging, known as CoWoS, may cap sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Full-year 2025 foundry revenue growth is estimated at around 15%.\nCounterpoint expects the pure-play foundry segment to grow at a faster pace, helped by continued shipments of AI GPUs and custom AI chips. Texas Instruments ( NASDAQ:TXN ), Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ), Infineon (IFNNY), and Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) maintained mid-single-digit market shares.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Discovery ( WBD ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Clearwater Analytics ( CWAN ). Watch the video above to hear the headlines driving interest in these stocks.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:04 Speaker A\nWelcome back to Morning Brief presented by Robin Hood. Now, time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Warner Brothers Discovery, Nvidia, and Clearwater Analytics.\n00:13 Speaker A\nFirst up is WBD and Paramount Skydance, the takeover battle ratcheting up yet again this morning as Paramount Skydance amended its offer. Here are the key updates.\n00:23 Speaker A\nLarry Ellison, of course, the father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison will personally guarantee more than $40 billion in equity financing for the deal.\n00:33 Speaker A\nHe also agreed not to revoke the Ellison Family Trust, and Paramount raised the termination fee on the deal to $5.8 billion. That matches the number from Netflix.\n00:43 Speaker A\nWhat do these moves do? They basically resolve some concerns that WBD's board had had regarding Paramount's original offer, but Paramount did not raise the overall offer price from $30 a share.\n00:53 Speaker A\nNext up, Nvidia. The stock is higher ahead of the opening bell as the company is reportedly gearing up for shipments of its chips into China next year.\n01:01 Speaker A\nReuters is reporting that the chip giants in talks with clients to start shipping out its H200 chips by mid-February. Despite these plans, there's still of course plenty of uncertainty. Beijing has not approved any purchases yet.\n01:14 Speaker A\nAnd finally, Clearwater Analytics. It's a merger Monday on Wall Street. Shares of the software company Clearwater, they are going private, soaring on news that they're going private.\n01:23 Speaker A\nPrivate equity firms, Premiera and Warburg Pincus are leading the group in the deal. It's valued at $8.7 billion.\n01:31 Speaker A\nAnd Clearwater shareholders will get $24.55 a share in cash. That's a 47% premium from its share price on November 10th. That's the last trading day before the first reports of deal talks.\n01:43 Speaker A\nThe deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Oil and gold climbed as the dollar fell.\nEquities erased their December losses, with the S&P 500 set for an eighth straight up month - the longest winning run since 2018. Nvidia Corp. rose as Reuters reported the firm has told Chinese clients it aims to ship its second-most powerful AI chips to China by mid-February.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working.

Their expectations of a further rally are outweighing concerns over rich AI valuations. The Federal Reserve path is also being closely watched, with two US cuts priced for next year.\n“While 2025 was a volatile year with April’s tariff-driven correction, we don’t think we’re out of the woods when it comes to volatility for 2026,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth.\nWhile Bellin expects the tech sector to continue its corrective phase, he bets a bottom will be achieved sometime in the next few months. He also sees the Fed refraining from any more rate cuts until there is a new chair mid-year, but says stocks can move higher during this time even without additional rate cuts.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.5%. The yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced one basis point to 4.16%. The dollar halted a three-day advance.

Discovery Inc.\nParamount Skydance Corp. amended its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., including by offering a personal financial guarantee by Oracle Corp.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( YM=F ) also added around 0.5%, with the major US gauges eyeing a third straight day of gains.\n\nTech stocks are continuing to recover from a volatile streak, which came as investors wavered between dueling pressures: worries about AI bubble versus fear of missing out on an AI boom. But faith in the AI trade surged again late last week, thanks largely to positive developments for Oracle ( ORCL ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ).\n\nInvestors are now looking for tech to maintain the momentum, as they gauge the prospects for a Santa Claus rally . Stocks are entering the final stretch of 2025 trading within striking distance their record highs, after a surprise drop in inflation and lukewarm labor market data left bets on 2026 interest-rate cuts mostly intact.\nElsewhere, geopolitical tensions helped lift gold ( GC=F ) and silver ( SI=F ) to fresh record highs , while crude oil ( CL=F , BZ=F ) futures also gained as the US ramped up its blockade of Venezuela. The Coast Guard chased a third oil tanker off the country's coast, after seizing a second carrier on Sunday.\nLooking ahead, this week brings the release of piecemeal economic data delayed by the US shutdown. Most land on Tuesday, with the highlights a first look at third quarter GDP and updates on the PCE price index for July, August, and September.\nUS stock markets will shut early on Wednesday for the Christmas Eve start of holidays, and will be closed all of Thursday for Christmas Day.\nLIVE 10 updates\n\n35 mins ago Grace O'Donnell\n\nStocks rise to begin holiday-shortened week Stocks rose to kick off the holiday-shortened week as investors looked to move past a shaky start to December in hopes that a seasonal Santa Claus rally might materialize.\nThe Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) rose 0.6% while the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) climbed 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) opened 0.4% higher as the major indexes looked to extend their win streak to a third day.\n\nGold ( GC=F ) and silver ( SI=F ) gained 1.7% and 2.2%, respectively, adding to monthly gains.\nCrude oil prices also increased after the US intercepted a third Venezuelan oil tanker. West Texas Intermediate ( CL=F ), the US benchmark, gained 2.25% to trade around $57 a barrel, and Brent ( BZ=F ), the global benchmark, rose 2.2% to around $61 per barrel.\n\nToday at 2:04 PM UTC Jake Conley\n\nCintas launches second takeover bid for UniFirst Workplace services giant Cintas Corporation ( CTAS ) has launched a second takeover bid for rival UniFirst ( UNF ) with an acquisition offering at $275 per share.\nShares in Unifirst soared by more than 27% in premarket trading following news of the $3.96 billion offer. Cintas slipped by roughly 1.3%.\n\nCintas' offer, at $275 per share, comes roughly 11 months after the company ended talks with UniFirst on an acquisition offer at an identical per-share price. Cintas said at the time that it was unable to engage in \"substantive\" conversations with UniFirst's board.\nCintas' January offer had been valued at roughly $5.2 billion, but shares in UniFirst have plunged by more than 20% through the year after Cintas pulled its original acquisition offer.\n\nToday at 1:46 PM UTC Jake Conley\n\nLarry Ellison plans to personally guarantee $40B for Paramount offer for WBD Larry Ellison, the centibillionaire founder and chairman of Oracle ( ORCL ), has agreed to personally backstop $40.4 billion in equity financing for Paramount Skydance's ( PSKY ) proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery ( WBD ).\nParamount shares spiked by more than 3% in premarket trading, while WBD rose around 3.8%.\n\nIn a securities filing Monday morning, Paramount Skydance — led by Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison — said the elder Ellison had agreed to backstop the financing to assuage fears from WBD that Paramount is too undercapitalized to be able to get an acquisition across the finish line.\nParamount has proposed a $30 per share, all-cash acquisition of both Warner Brothers' studios and streaming division and its linear network division, in a deal valued at $108.4 billion.\nParamount's Monday announcement said the Ellison family trust owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock, and that Larry Ellison had agreed not to revoke the trust or transfer assets while negotiations remain open.\nWBD has in recent weeks become the target of a multi-round bidding war between Paramount and Netflix ( NFLX ) for the storied film studio and collection of broadcast networks.\nPrior to Paramount's announcement on Monday, WBD had rejected the company's acquisition offer, appearing to tip the scales in favor of Netflix's proposal that would see the streaming giant absorb WBD's streaming and studios division.\nWBD's broadcast and linear TV division would continue with plans to be spun off into a separate public company, under the terms of the Netflix offer.\n\nToday at 1:15 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nRocket Lab stock continues to gain on $816 million contract, Electron launch Rocket Lab ( RKLB ) stock extended a nearly 18% gain on Friday, rising another 4% in premarket trading, after securing a $816 million contract to build satellites for the US Space Force and successfully launching its Electron rocket for the 21st time this year.\nThe latest contract with the US Space Development Agency (SDA), announced last Friday, marked Rocket Lab's largest single contract to date and brings its total contract value with the SDA to $1.3 billion.\nAnd the launch of its Electron rocket on Sunday for a Japan-based Earth imaging company called iQPS set a record for the number of successful launches in a year for the company.\nThe twin developments boosted the stock to all-time highs. Over the past five days, Rocket Lab's stock is up about 15%, putting its year-to-date gains at 176%.\n\nToday at 12:41 PM UTC Jenny McCall\n\nGood morning. Here's what's happening today.

The US Coast Guard boarded the Centuries tanker in the Caribbean on Saturday, which was laden with about 2 million barrels of Venezuelan crude. It was also in pursuit of the Bella 1, which was en route to the Latin American nation.\n\nWashington has been stepping up pressure on Nicolás Maduro’s government, with Trump aiming to choke off its key revenue stream. The US has designated the regime as a foreign terrorist organization, accusing it of involvement in drug trafficking. Venezuela still has the world’s largest crude reserves, but its exports, most of which go to China, now account for less than 1% of global demand.\nThere were also heightened risks to supplies from another member of the OPEC+ producer group, after Ukraine hit an oil tanker from Russia’s shadow fleet in the Mediterranean Sea with drones for the first time. That followed strikes on Lukoil PJSC facilities in the Caspian Sea.\nThe geopolitical situation has helped put a floor under oil prices, which have dropped by about a fifth this year. The declines have been driven by an oversupply as both OPEC+ and the group’s competitors raised production will demand growth slowed.",

      "Content": "Nvidia Plans H200 AI Chip Shipments to China Ahead of Lunar New Year\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:18 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nNvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) has told Chinese clients it is aiming to begin shipping its second-most powerful AI chips to China before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, according to people familiar with the discussions. The company plans to fulfill early demand from existing inventory, with initial shipments potentially totaling between 5,000 and 10,000 chip modules, equivalent to roughly 40,000 to 80,000 H200 AI chips. Nvidia has also indicated that it intends to add new production capacity for these chips, with orders for that capacity expected to open in the second quarter of 2026, suggesting a longer-term effort to support demand if approvals are granted.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe proposed shipments remain contingent on regulatory decisions, as Beijing has not yet approved any H200 purchases and timelines could still shift. The discussions follow a policy change after US President Donald Trump said Washington would allow H200 sales to China with a 25% fee, prompting an inter-agency review of export license applications. This approach represents a shift from the previous US stance that barred advanced AI chip sales to China on national security grounds. Reuters has reported that Chinese officials have held emergency meetings to assess whether to permit the imports, including proposals that could require each H200 purchase to be paired with a set ratio of domestic chips.\n\nThe H200, part of Nvidia's Hopper architecture, remains widely used in AI workloads despite being overtaken by the company's newer Blackwell platform, and supply has been constrained as Nvidia prioritizes other product lines. For Chinese technology groups such as Alibaba and ByteDance, access to H200 chips could provide processors estimated to be about six times more powerful than the H20 models Nvidia previously designed for China. At the same time, Chinese policymakers appear to be weighing whether allowing these imports could slow domestic AI chip development, leaving the outcome dependent on government decisions rather than market demand alone.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Only Seen Twice in 153 Years: History’s Clear Warning for the Stock Market in 2026\n\nDavid Beren\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nIt should go without saying that the S&P 500 has been riding high over the last few years and has delivered one of the most impressive runs in market history. Over the past three years, the index has surged a whopping 80%, driven in part by artificial intelligence, falling interest rates, and ongoing corporate earnings growth. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolio balances have reached levels that might have seemed all but impossible to achieve a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 surged 80% over three years. This has occurred only twice before in 153 years.\nPrevious instances (1920s and 1990s) both preceded market crashes of 49% to 89%.\nThe S&P 500 forward P/E sits around 21 to 22. This is roughly 40% above historical averages.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnfortunately, any exceptional performance like this in the market comes with something of a warning label. A three-year gain of this kind of magnitude with the S&P 500 has only occurred twice in the last 153 years of stock market performance. The first, the 1920s bull market, and the late 1990s tech boom both ended in devastating fashion with the Great Depression and the dot-com bust.\nThankfully, history doesn't always guarantee repetition, but it does signal that a pattern could be forming in the sense that markets performing this well for this long could be a giant warning sign for investors. As 2026 gets closer, understanding what happened in the last two instances now just feels like understanding basic risk management.\nThe S&P 500's Ultra-Rare 3-Year Surge: What History Predicts If you look closely, the 80% gain over the last three years roughly translates to anywhere between a 21% and 27% annualized return, which is more than double the S&P 500's long-term average of approximately 10% in gains. The rarity of this occurrence cannot be overstated, considering it has only happened twice in the 153 years, with the 1927-1929 bull market rising 95% and the tech boom between 1995 and 1998 increased 85%.\n\nIf you're seeing giant warning signs today, it's because you know that what is taking place in the market today, performance-wise, is eerily familiar to what has happened before. In the 1920s, you had a market that boomed because of cars becoming more readily available, on top of electrification taking place across cities and non-cities alike. It was the promise of a new era, and the 1990s boom was driven by something similar, as the internet was being heralded as something that was going to transform everything we knew about technology, communication, and just about everything in between.\n\nStory Continues\nThe 80% surge between 2023 and 2025 is following the same pattern, and this is what is causing warning bells to go off. Unsurprisingly, AI is being heralded as the transforming technology, and valuations have expanded significantly as a result. This all feels very much like 1999, and AI is being labeled as the kind of technology that will change everything, just as the internet was heralded as something transforming, and electricity absolutely did transform everything. This all comes together with a clear message in that when the stock market delivers this kind of three-year performance, it precedes major reversals.\n\nAnalyzing the Historical Precedents for 2026 During the 1927 to 1929 surge, the market continued to climb well into September before it all came crashing down in October. The initial 48% decline happened between October and November, but the real impact was felt from the end of 1929 all the way toward the end of 1932, when the total market collapse took place, dropping the market by around 89% in total. Crazily enough, it would take 25 years before the market would return to its 1929 highs.\n\nFast forward to the 1995-1998 surge, the market continued to climb higher and higher through 1999 before it peaked in March 2020. The rest, as they say, is well-known history, as the dot com crash erased 49% of the S&P 500's value in just 2.5 years. The Nasdaq fell 78% and its overall recovery would take another seven years before returning to its starting levels.\nThe takeaway here is that there is a consistent pattern that was followed in both of these cases, in that the market didn't crash immediately after a three-year surge. The market rally actually, and surprisingly, as you look back, continued for an extra year, delivering even more gains before a severe decline. In 2026, the cautionary tale is that history suggests either the market delivers this year as one full of gains or one that shows indicators of a reversal. Suffice it to say, neither scenario paints a pretty picture, as even if investors get one more year of gains, the crash starts and wipes all the gains out.\n\nIs an AI Bubble Forming? The Biggest Risk Heading into 2026 If you have been watching the current level of AI enthusiasm, and who hasn't been, the parallels between today and previous tech bubbles are almost impossible to ignore. We are already seeing just how transformative AI can be, something that echoes what the country saw during the electrification of the 1920s and the internet in the 1990s. Sadly, real technology, no matter how transformative, doesn't always prevent bubbles. If anything, it actually enables a bubble to take place by trying to justify massive corporate valuations.\n\nThe biggest takeaway right now is that the signs of a bubble transformation are present, and they are present across multiple indicators. Valuations for AI-centric stocks are assuming nearly flawless execution and sustained growth continuing for years into the future. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) are all investing billions, tens of billions into AI infrastructure without a clear signal of what the return could be. As a result, the S&P 500's forward P/E is sitting around 21 to 22, approximately 40% above historical averages.\nIf you are a retail investor, and many of us are, this is something to be very aware of, as is options trading, which has seen its volume surge in AI stocks. Reddit, in particular, has come alive with discussion, especially on places like r/WallStreetBets, in a way that feels almost too familiar if you were on message boards during the dot-com era in 1999. On top of social media conversation, you also have companies adding \"AI\" anywhere they can in their core descriptions or even their company names to try and boost valuations. This closely mirrors when companies added \".com\" to their company names in the late 1990s to try to jump on a similar trend.\n\nThe bottom line is that any catalyst for a stock reversal could come from slower-than-anticipated AI adoption or even disappointing returns from AI investments. Add to all of these concerns over an economic slowdown resulting from tariffs, or even inflationary concerns, depending on how the Fed handles interest rates. This all comes together in what could be a perfect storm for either a massive buying shift or a major selling rally, and any instance of the latter is going to feed on itself as panic selling grabs hold until the bottom falls out.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

On December 17, reports emerged indicating NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is planning a $1.5 billion investment to establish the largest server farm in Israel. The company is reportedly in advanced talks with real estate firm Mega Or DC to lease a data center currently under construction in the Mevo Carmel industrial zone.\nThe new server farm is to be located close to another Nvidia farm built in partnership with Shoval Paz and will house the Blackwell Processors. The proposed server farm will span about 30,000 square feet and consume about 64 megawatts of power. NVIDIA is to install a more advanced supercomputer at the site, exceeding the capabilities of Israel-1\n\nThe massive server farm will become Nvidia’s largest research center outside the US. It will also rank among the largest in the Middle East. It will be dedicated to the company’s most advanced technologies, including Blackwell-based systems and integrated Grace Blackwell platforms.\nOn December 11, Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities reiterated that Nvidia is a Buy and stuck with a $275 price target. According to the analyst, the company boasts a competitive edge and growth potential, as its generational GPUs are considered well ahead of competitors’. Likewise, strong partnerships with Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic also provide substantial visibility into demand and supply.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and sells high-performance Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and System-on-a-Chip (SoC) units, evolving from a gaming graphics leader to a powerhouse in Artificial Intelligence (AI), data centers, professional visualization, and automotive tech, providing essential hardware (like GPUs) and software (like CUDA) for complex computing, AI training, and accelerated workloads across many industries.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be the World's Largest Company by Year-End 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:21 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet has a comprehensive AI stack, owning nearly every component of the AI ecosystem.\nIts impressive growth has a long runway to continue as AI adoption spreads.\nThe stock's very reasonable valuation leaves plenty of room to overtake Nvidia's valuation in time.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) investment cycle, where companies are investing billions of dollars in data centers and other infrastructure, has propelled AI chip leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to its position as the world's largest company by market capitalization .\nIt's a remarkable feat, and it took the stock price rising nearly 1,000% in just three years to accomplish it. But it's difficult to stay atop the mountain, and a formidable challenger is looming. Initially, investors thought artificial intelligence would threaten tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nHowever, Google's parent company has seized the opportunity and become arguably the most complete AI stock on the market today.\nSo, this Fool is calling it now: Alphabet, not Nvidia, will be the world's largest company in 2026. I state my case below.\nEnvious competitive positioning as the full-stack AI player The AI landscape is still in its early chapters. A lot will happen over the next decade or two, so it's not easy to make many predictions with much confidence. That said, Alphabet could have the strongest argument for a leading role in AI's future.\nIt wouldn't be a stretch to call Alphabet the world's most prominent internet company. It's known for its dominant Google search engine, but in reality, Alphabet's empire casts a far longer shadow. Its chief assets include:\n\nYouTube, the largest streaming platform.\nGoogle Chrome, a leading web browser.\nAndroid, a leading smartphone operating software.\nGoogle Workspace, a collection of internet apps with over 3 billion users.\nThese assets provide Alphabet with key insights and data on most of the world's web users, a crucial resource for developing and training its AI models. Additionally, Alphabet's Google Cloud is the world's third-largest cloud computing services platform, and the company has created custom AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), for its data centers.\nIn other words, Alphabet owns a comprehensive AI ecosystem that gives it a significant competitive advantage over most other AI companies, which typically own only pieces of an ecosystem.\n\nPlenty of growth still to come Some AI hyperscalers have had to take on substantial debt to fund their data center investments. Not Alphabet, which has primarily funded its investments with profits thanks to its various established businesses that generate cash flow like few companies on the planet can.\n\nStory Continues\nFurthermore, Alphabet's core businesses continue to thrive. Revenue from digital advertising through Google and YouTube grew by roughly 15% year over year in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Google Cloud revenue increased by 34% as AI usage drives cloud demand.\nAssuming AI adoption continues to spread throughout society, especially among consumers using AI apps, that growth doesn't seem likely to slow down anytime soon. That's before considering Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary, which continues to expand into new markets and is now seeking funding to accelerate its growth efforts.\n\nAll in all, Wall Street analysts estimate Alphabet will grow its earnings at an annualized rate of 16% over the next three to five years.\nThe stock's valuation is reasonable and has room to run Nvidia certainly has strong growth prospects as well, but some of its customers, such as OpenAI and Oracle , are facing scrutiny for how they will fund their massive AI commitments. In other words, it appears that Nvidia's growth is more fragile because it relies on a small number of customers. For Alphabet, AI adds additional upside to its established cloud and digital ads businesses.\n\nCurrently, Nvidia's market cap of $4.3 trillion is just 16% higher than Alphabet's. Alphabet currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, using full-year earnings estimates, a reasonable price tag for high-teens annualized earnings growth, especially for a world-class company with multiple highly profitable businesses.\nThat leaves room for the stock to continue higher through 2026 if Alphabet's businesses continue to perform well. If confidence in Nvidia's growth dips, I could see Alphabet overtaking it.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "These AI Stocks Could Still Deliver Big Upside in December and Beyond\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Nvidia still can't keep up with demand for its data center GPUs.\nAfter a tepid stock performance in 2025, Amazon is looking to bounce back in 2026.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerator chips are growing in popularity with hyperscalers.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nAlthough we're nearly at the end of a year during which the S&P 500 gained a strong 16%, there are still plenty of stocks that look like top-tier buys. Some of the biggest names in the market have retreated from their recent highs, and I think investors should consider scooping them up before 2026 arrives. At the top of my last-minute shopping list are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) .\nNvidia Nvidia has been the poster child for the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout since it began. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the computing power for the vast majority of AI workloads today, but investors are worried about two things.\nFirst, they are concerned that there is a general bubble in the AI space. However, with all of the hyperscalers having announced that 2026 will be another year of record-setting capital expenditures, I don't see that thesis as valid. Second, some are worried that Nvidia's dominance in the AI accelerator chip niche is slipping. While there have been several promising product launches from its competitors, Nvidia's GPUs are still the top option. In its earnings release for its fiscal 2026 third quarter, which ended Oct. 26, CEO Jensen Huang stated that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs.\n\nThis is a company that brought in $57 billion in revenue during Q3, and it's clear that it could have made more if it had more chips to sell, so it's hard to say Nvidia's dominance is slipping with a straight face.\nWith Nvidia's stock price down nearly 20% from its all-time high and Wall Street analysts expecting the chipmaker's revenue to grow by 48% next year, I can think of few better buys heading into 2026.\nAmazon Amazon stock is essentially flat for the year. However, some recent events have me bullish about it as we prepare to enter 2026.\nFirst, its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, delivered 20% revenue growth rate in Q3 -- its best rate in years -- showing that it's resurging as the go-to place to bring workloads online. Second, growth in Amazon's advertising service business is also reaccelerating. This segment has become a major part of the company's business over the past few years.\nI think Amazon's stock will come roaring back in 2026, and it will be on the backs of these two important business units.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom Broadcom is up by an incredible 40% or so year to date. However, it was previously even higher: The stock sold off heavily after a poorly received earnings report.\nIn its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ended Nov. 2, revenues grew by 28% as diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose 37%. Its AI semiconductor business was a bright spot, with revenue rising 74% year over year. Management expects this trend to continue into Q1, forecasting that its AI semiconductor revenue will more than double. That all sounds impressive, but the stock sold off in part due to revenue timing.\n\nBroadcom told investors that some of its customers wouldn't be purchasing some of their custom AI chips until 2027 and beyond. That was a letdown for investors, and many headed for the exit. As a result, Broadcom's stock is down by more than 20% from its all-time high.\nFollowing the sell-off, Broadcom's stock now trades for about 32 times expected forward earnings.\nConsidering the monster AI-related growth the company expects over the next few years, I think this is a great price to pay for Broadcom's stock. Its AI semiconductor revenue will continue to rise throughout 2026, which will eventually get the market excited about the stock again. But until it does, the stock looks like a great value.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Nvidia and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe planned shipments would mark the first deliveries of H200 chips to China after U.S. President Donald Trump said this month that Washington ​would allow such sales with a 25% fee.\n\nReuters reported last week that the Trump administration had launched ‌an inter-agency review of license applications for H200 chip sales to China, making good on his pledge to allow the sales.\nThe move represents a major policy shift from the Biden administration, which banned advanced AI chip sales to China citing national security concerns.\nThe H200, part of Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper line, remains widely used in AI despite being superseded by the firm's newer Blackwell chips. Nvidia has focused production on Blackwell and ⁠its upcoming Rubin line, making H200 supply scarce.\nTrump's decision comes ​as China pushes to develop its domestic AI chip industry. ​Local firms have yet to match the H200's performance, raising concerns that allowing imports could slow domestic progress.\n\nChinese officials held emergency meetings earlier this month to discuss the matter ‍and are weighing whether to ⁠allow shipments, Reuters reported this month. One proposal would require each H200 purchase to be bundled with a set ratio of domestic chips, according to the report.\nFor Chinese technology giants such as ⁠Alibaba Group and ByteDance, which have expressed interest in buying H200 chips, the potential shipments would provide access to processors roughly ‌six times more powerful than the H20, a downgraded chip Nvidia designed for China.\n(Reporting by ‌Reuters newsroom.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Stock Price by the End of 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's GPUs are still the best computing option available.\nThe company has delivered incredible growth in 2025.\nThe stock price is reasonable for Nvidia's valuation.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have had an excellent run in 2025, rising just shy of 30%. However, the stock has pulled back in recent weeks due to concerns of a potential artificial intelligence (AI) bubble. This weakness could be a great buying opportunity, as the AI buildout still looks like it's going full steam ahead, despite what the market wants.\n\nTo estimate what kind of returns we can get by buying Nvidia's stock now, we need to come up with a price target for Nvidia's stock for the end of 2026. Let's do some analysis on its growth and valuation. If Nvidia hits the growth laid out, it's going to be a great stock to own in 2026.\nNvidia's computing units offer advantages over other offerings Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , accelerated computing units that can perform multiple tasks in parallel. This makes them great for heavy workloads, like processing gaming graphics, engineering simulations, drug discovery, and mining cryptocurrency.\nHowever, its biggest use case by far is artificial intelligence . AI requires unprecedented levels of computing power, and companies are scrambling to build out as many data centers as possible and fill them with computing units to train and run AI models.\n\nNvidia's GPUs have been the most popular computing unit option by far since the AI arms race began in 2023. The reason for its success is tied to both the power of its GPUs and the technology stack that supports them. Its chief rival, AMD , may have had competing GPUs, but the supporting technology wasn't as good, so it fell behind.\nAnother rising competitor is the AI hyperscalers themselves. Many are tired of paying a premium price for Nvidia's GPUs, so they are partnering with companies like Broadcom to design a custom AI chip in-house. These can be worthy competitors to Nvidia's GPUs when the workload is properly configured, but if it isn't, the GPU is a far better option.\nNvidia's GPUs are still the overall best broad-use computing unit in the AI realm. The GPUs are so popular that Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang stated in the Q3 earnings release that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. In Q3 FY 2026 (ended Oct, 26), it sold $51.2 billion in data center products, which mostly encompass cloud GPUs. For a company to sell more than $50 billion worth of products and still run out of product is incredible.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Nvidia is pushing for more production capacity, which will drive growth throughout 2026. But how much can investors expect?\nNvidia's success relies on the spending habits of others The biggest factor in Nvidia's success isn't its own products; it's how much AI hyperscalers are willing to spend. They spent a record amount on data center capital expenditures in 2025, and all have informed investors to expect more growth in 2026.\nThis bodes well for 2026, but it's only the beginning. Nvidia sees the AI buildout growing for multiple years beyond next, with annual data center capital expenditures expected to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's a 38% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) at the low end of that projection, and that coincides with Wall Street's projections as well.\n\nNext year, Wall Street analysts expect revenue growth of 48%. Considering that Nvidia trades for 36 times forward earnings right now, I'd say it's fairly valued for the incredible growth it's putting up. As a result, I think it's reasonable for Nvidia to grow at about the same pace as its revenue.\nTo be a bit conservative, I'll price in 30% growth, that way Nvidia's valuation continues to moderate as well. If it can deliver 30% returns, the stock will be priced at about $221. That's a strong gain for one year, making Nvidia an excellent stock to buy now and hold throughout 2026 and beyond.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer discussed recently. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a California-based electric vehicle company. The firm’s shares saw quite a bit of action last week after Goldman Sachs increased its share price target on December 12th. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s shares closed 12% the day of Goldman’s coverage. After Goldman Sachs, Evercore ISI joined in and reiterated an Outperform rating and an $18 share price target on December 15th. Evercore explained that Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) appears to be heading in the right direction with its autonomous driving platform. The investment bank added that the firm’s decision to build its in-house chip could accelerate autonomous driving and reduce long-term costs, particularly due to a lower reliance on NVIDIA’s products. The latest analyst coverage for Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) came after Baird raised the share price target to $25 from $14 and bumped the rating to Outperform from Neutral. As per Baird, the R2 upgrade cycle, coupled with custom chips, paints an optimistic picture for the firm. However, Cramer disagrees with the analysts as he briefly commented:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RIVN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

According to sources, it's through an array of cash-raising schemes, including a sale of some investments. They added it could tap its undrawn margin loans borrowed against its valuable ownership in chip firm Arm Holdings. The bet on OpenAI is among the biggest yet by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son. The Japanese billionaire wants to improve his firm's position in the race for artificial intelligence. To come up with the money, Son has already sold SoftBank's entire $5.8 billion stake in AI chip leader Nvidia. As well as offloading $4.8 billion of its T-Mobile stake, and slashing staff. Son has slowed other dealmaking at SoftBank's Vision Fund to a crawl. And two of the sources speaking to Reuters said any deal above $50 million now requires his explicit approval. SoftBank's push to marshal funds offers a window into the strain faced even by the world's biggest dealmakers. They're scrambling to finance ambitious AI data center projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars. SoftBank declined to comment. It secured a deal to invest in OpenAI at a $300 billion valuation in April. Since then, the valuation of OpenAI has risen dramatically. And the company is in talks to raise additional funding from investors, including Amazon.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

He said those concerns may be overstated and that demand for GPUs remains healthy.\nUpcoming product catalysts such as Rubin and the longer-term Blackwell opportunity could refocus attention, Rasgon added.

Given that so many themes are disruptive, it is easy to be blindsided by industry outsiders invading your sector.\n\nTo help our clients gain a competitive advantage, The analyst has developed its Strategic Intelligence Solution, a single, integrated global research platform that provides an easy-to-use framework for tracking all strategic issues-or themes-impacting all companies across all industries. Reading this report is the first step towards making better business decisions in 2026.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nThe global AI market will reach $642 billion in 2029, up from $131 billion in 2024, supported by a growing ecosystem of integrators, start-ups, and tech giants. To accelerate enterprise integration, pre-packaged AI agents have been developed for a wide range of applications, such as earnings analyzers, video script generators, and customer profile builders. In 2026, dozens of companies will enter the market to provide industry-specific agentic AI solutions. Despite this momentum, enterprise adoption in the coming year will continue to be held back by uncertainty about whether these tools can add demonstrable business value. Agentic AI is capable of delivering far more value than existing generative AI (GenAI) tools due to its greater autonomy and methodical approach to reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. The next step is crafting these agents for high-value use cases that merit substantial long-term investment.\nIn 2026, quantum computing will make tangible inroads in finance and pharmaceuticals. Longstanding collaborations between quantum vendors and companies in these sectors will begin to produce operational benefits. In pharma, quantum-accelerated molecular simulations will increasingly be used to improve precision modeling, accelerate targeted and personalized drug discovery, and cut time and cost from development. Evidence of this trend includes the results of the partnership between AstraZeneca, IonQ, Nvidia, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), which showed a 20x speedup in hybrid quantum-classical simulations of chemical transformations. In finance, quantum computing will be deployed more broadly in risk modeling, options pricing, algorithmic bond trading, and optimization tasks. Real-world pilots will shift toward production use, encouraged by pioneering success stories such as HSBC's work with IBM to apply quantum computing to real-world bond trading. 2026 will be the year quantum moves from experimental promise to early commercial impact in finance and pharmaceuticals.\nNvidia has a nearly 90% market share in AI chip design. Despite successfully riding the Gen AI tidal wave thus far, Nvidia faces growing threats from competitors. OpenAI, which has almost wholly depended on Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) until now, has diversified its supply, making multibillion-dollar deals with Broadcom and AMD. OpenAI is purchasing 10 gigawatts (GW) of custom AI accelerators from Broadcom and 6GW of GPU capacity from AMD. Diversifying its chip supply is an astute move by OpenAI, driving market competition that will ultimately lower chip prices and incentivize new, more competitive chip designs. Nvidia's market share will slip in 2026 as its competitors gain ground.\n\nStory continues\nReport Scope\nThis report identifies the top 20 tech-related themes that will impact every industry in 2026.

      "Content": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering NVIDIA Corp's Intrinsic Value\n\nGuruFocus News\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2025-12-22, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $125.00. It's currently trading at a price of $180.99. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -44.79%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$4\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 47.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\n\nCalculation Growth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n262.67\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n491.67\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n125.00\n\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow . Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $98.31. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -84.1%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page .\n\nStory Continues\nThe Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies , focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The value that neocloud companies offer to major AI players\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: AVGO\n\nCRWV\n\nMU\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMicron Technology ( MU ) stock continues to pop after boasting strong fiscal first quarter earnings results driven by demand around high-bandwidth memory chips for AI data centers. As more companies invest into large-scale AI infrastructure buildouts, what does this all mean for the broadening AI trade and even neocloud operators?\n\nFreedom Capital Markets Managing Director Paul Meeks talks about the three chip companies he still has at the top of his list and the upside that neocloud companies like CoreWeave ( CRWV ) could offer some of the bigger players, such as Nvidia ( NVDA ).\nAlso catch Paul Meeks explain how much higher he sees Micron's stock going.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Julie\nHow does this sort of change the dynamics in the memory market? I mean, as you mentioned, it's an oligopoly, there are two other players. We've seen memory prices go crazy, not even the high bandwidth kind, the overall kind that goes into all kinds of devices. So what are some of the sort of knock-on effects in the industry that you're watching and other names that you're watching?\n00:24 Paul\nSo I continue to like the people that are benefiting from the uh spend. I recently initiated coverage with Coreweave, which is one of the neo clouds with a $100 price target. But believe it or not, I think there's upside in Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi, some of these companies that when I get push back, what people will say, how can you possibly recommend Nvidia after it's done so well for all these years. Well, it's because I see even more greatness ahead of them. And you know, some of these stocks, Julie, have come down quite a bit in the last couple of weeks. I think it's a good buying opportunity for several of the names.\n01:21 Julie\nUm I'm curious about the the neo clouds in particular Paul, because there have been some questions about that business model, right? That if you were, you know, renting space from someone else, if you're trying to go out to the smaller providers, um as your clients, that maybe you're a little more vulnerable if there are chinks in the armor of this whole um AI thesis. What do you think about that?\n02:02 Paul\nanother excellent question. The way I look at it is you have to look at these contracts that they are signing very carefully. In the case of Core Weve, we have five and six-year deals with well-funded folks like Microsoft and Meta. and they are paying 15 to 25% of total contract value upfront. So there's some initial cash flow. And so I think that even though some of these companies are levered and Cory mind you is highly levered, that they have a nice runway and I think that over the next couple of years their plans are set and they're funded by the most well-funded companies almost on planet Earth.\n03:00 Paul\nAnd the other thing that's interesting about Core Weve, it has an interesting deal with Nvidia, which is also a 6% shareholder in which if Core Weve has any surplus capacity between now and April of 2032, it'll be socked up by Nvidia. So, some people will say that's a quote-unquote circular deal, but I actually like that deal a lot. And so I do think there's upside. Yes, it's speculative, yes, they're highly levered, but I think that this is all under control as long as the spending from the big boys continues. And I think all these companies when they announce their results in January or February, will confirm at least the 2026 capital expenditure spend.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia and Palantir Stock: One Is Set to Rise and the Other to Fall in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's hardware has been widely used in the AI buildout.\nPalantir's software has commercial and government clients.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) have been two of the faces of the artificial intelligence (AI) investment trend since it began in 2023. Each has delivered incredible shareholder returns, rising more than 2,600% (Palantir) and nearly 1,100% (Nvidia) since 2023. Each company has also had a phenomenal 2025, with Palantir and Nvidia rising 134% and 27%, respectively.\nAfter those great runs, it wouldn't be a surprise if both of these stocks take a break. However, I think one of them is poised to deliver phenomenal returns in 2026, while the other is set to fall.\nEach is tackling a different part of the AI realm Palantir and Nvidia aren't competitors, as they are in completely different parts of the AI world. In fact, they recently teamed up to offer prebuilt models on Nvidia's hardware technologies. Nvidia's contributions to the AI buildout have been its cutting-edge graphics processing units (GPUs) . These devices have been the preferred computing unit for nearly every AI hyperscaler due to their incredible power and flexibility. Although other companies are starting to catch up to Nvidia, it's still the leader in AI computing hardware.\n\nPalantir is a software play. Its AI-powered data analytics software platform has delivered valuable insights to clients. Its biggest advancement in the past few years is its AIP platform, which allows clients to make use of generative AI. By deploying AI agents, a company can automate tasks to improve efficiency. This popular product has found adoption by both government and commercial clients.\nPalantir's year-over-year commercial growth for the third quarter was 73%, while the growth of its government division was 55%. Although it grew more slowly, the government division generated $633 million in revenue while the commercial division came in at $548 million. Combined, they delivered 63% growth. That's an impressive quarter for Palantir, but there's a monstrous size difference between it and Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's Q3 for its fiscal year 2026 (ended Oct. 26) saw similar growth. Its revenue rose 62% year over year, but Nvidia's revenue stream is more than 50 times larger at $57 billion. There's a clear massive demand for AI computing power, and Nvidia is thriving on that. In fact, the company believes that global data center capital expenditures will rise to between $3 trillion and $4 trillion by 2030, up from $600 billion in 2025. The AI buildout is far from over, and both Nvidia and Palantir are slated to deliver further growth.\n\nLeer más\nWith both companies growing at incredible rates, it's hard to determine which is doing better. However, there's another part of the analysis investors must consider.\nOne company's stock is incredibly overvalued Finding excellent companies is one part of investing; the other is not overpaying for them. When you compare the valuations of these stocks, it's clear that one is priced far higher.\nAt nearly 250 times forward earnings, Palantir's stock is nearly 7 times more expensive than Nvidia's. That's a huge problem, as the stock has baked in a ton of growth that must occur over the next few years. Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock may not be cheap by any measure, but if the company can keep up its growth rate, it can easily justify a price tag of 36 times forward earnings.\n\nThe reality is that Palantir's stock is likely overvalued and due for a hefty pullback soon. Nvidia's stock has already pulled back from recent highs, and it could be primed to rise in 2026. I think Nvidia is the far better buy here.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "What Is One of the Best AI Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2026 and Beyond?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Alphabet's core business is thriving.\nIt may consider selling its custom chips to outside clients.\nThe company has emerged as a leader in generative AI.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nIdentifying which artificial intelligence (AI) stock has the most potential in 2026 and beyond is no simple task. If your time frame after 2026 is only a few years, then an AI infrastructure company like Nvidia may be the best option. If your time frame runs for a decade after 2026, you may be better off with a software company like Palantir .\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a combination of these two options, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is one of the best AI stocks to buy and hold.\nAlphabet has had a stellar year, rising around 60% so far in 2025. I don't expect that performance to repeat in 2026, but I still think it has market-beating potential.\nIts core business is thriving Alphabet's primary business is the Google Search engine. At the start of 2025, a large majority of investors assumed that generative AI technologies would replace Google. However, Alphabet saw the writing on the wall and made swift changes.\nThe biggest innovation was the integration of AI-powered Overviews in Google Search. These provide nearly every search result with a generative-AI summary at the top of the page, giving the user a hybrid experience.\n\nFor many, these will be the most AI capabilities that they need. For others, Google's generative AI model, Gemini, has emerged as a top option in the space.\nIn one year, Gemini has risen from the laughingstock of the AI world to one of the best. Its improvements were so impressive that they forced OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, to declare a \"code red\" at the company. That's a long way from where Gemini was viewed entering 2025, and the change in fortunes for both the Google Search business and the progress of Alphabet's generative AI model can be thanked for its stock performance.\nAnother area that boosted Alphabet's stock was the performance of its cloud computing division, Google Cloud, which is building out excess computing capacity to rent to those who cannot build their own data centers. Within Google Cloud, Alphabet provides access to its custom tensor processing units (TPUs), which can outperform graphics processing units (GPUs) when the workload is properly configured.\nThese computing units have been Alphabet's secret weapons in training its cutting-edge generative AI models, and locking access to them behind one of its other business units is genius. However, management may be exploring alternative territory.\n\nStory Continues\nReportedly, the company is considering selling its TPUs to Meta Platforms outright instead of requiring it to rent access to them via Google Cloud. That's a step in a different direction and could result in a new revenue stream that investors haven't accounted for. The AI computing market is huge, and if Alphabet can secure a sliver, it could provide serious growth.\n\nTime will tell if this business venture pans out, but Alphabet is doing incredibly well as a company. It's also spending responsibly, which is something that not every company can say.\nAlphabet has plenty of cash to fund its build-outs One of the growing concerns in the AI realm is a potential bubble forming around building AI computing capacity. There are questions about how AI hyperscalers will fund it, which is a perfectly acceptable question to ask of a company like OpenAI. However, Alphabet has plenty of cash flow to continue building data centers as it pleases.\n\nThe two metrics that inventors in this realm should familiarize themselves with are operating cash flow and free cash flow. Operating cash flow is all of the cash that a business produces, which can be used to fund capital expenditures (capex). Free cash flow subtracts capex, which shows the remaining cash a business has to repurchase shares, pay down debt, or fund dividends.\nAlphabet has plenty of cash to continue spending on AI data centers if it chooses, which is a great position to be in. While it is spending a lot of its cash on build-outs, it has plenty left before it risks dropping into negative figures. That's a huge advantage the company has over nearly any other competitor in the AI race, and it's the primary reason I think Alphabet is one of the best AI stocks to buy in 2026 and hold for several years after.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Should You Worry About an AI Bubble in 2026? Evidence is Piling Up, and Here's What it Shows.\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:30 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Investors see AI as the next game-changing technology, and this has helped many AI stocks soar.\nBut in recent weeks, some investors have started to worry about the possibility of an AI bubble forming.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nInvestors always are on the lookout for the next big thing. And over the past few years, this has been artificial intelligence (AI). The technology has promised to transform processes and operations as well as spark game-changing discoveries -- and the idea is that all of this could lead to massive earnings growth across the corporate world. Some companies, such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon , already are generating billions of dollars in revenue thanks to AI.\n\nAnd that's why investors have piled into these players, driving the S&P 500 to what soon may be three straight double-digit annual gains. But in recent times, some investors have worried about the enormous spending levels at certain AI companies, as well as the high valuations of stocks. This has led to a pullback among AI stocks and other growth companies.\nNow, as you think of what's ahead in 2026, should you worry about an AI bubble? The evidence is piling up, and here's what it shows.\nThe AI boom so far First, let's consider what's unfolded so far in this AI boom . Companies have understood that by applying AI to their operations, they may gain in efficiency or set themselves up to make new discoveries. This has prompted them to turn to sellers of AI products and services for the tools they need to harness the power of AI. Players like Nvidia sell the world's top chips, and cloud businesses from Amazon Web Services to Microsoft 's Azure offer these and other systems to customers.\n\nCompanies aiming to use AI also might turn to software players with platforms that allow them to apply the technology to their businesses -- Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), offering software that aggregates and analyzes data, is a perfect example of this. And then you'll find others, such as SoundHound AI , that specialize in developing one particular area of AI -- in this case, it's voice AI that can be used to take orders at a restaurant or for communications with your car.\nAll of these companies, selling AI products and services, have seen explosive revenue growth, but they've also had to heavily invest to keep up with demand and continue innovating.\nInvestors' big concern As mentioned, AI players across the board have seen their share prices soar in recent years due to optimism about AI-driven growth. But investors have started to worry that, in some cases, future earnings won't justify the spending and stock prices we're seeing today.\n\nStory Continues\nThe S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio, a measure of stock prices in relation to earnings over a 10-year period, has climbed to a high it's only reached once before throughout its history. And that other time was before the dot-com bubble burst.\nSo, stocks clearly have become expensive, and this is something that happens before a bubble deflates. But before declaring that a bubble is here, it's important to consider additional clues. An important one is that companies driving the AI revolution aren't small or new players, as was the case during the dot-com boom. Today, companies with the financial strength to invest, such as Nvidia or Meta Platforms , are leading the charge. Meta has the resources to invest in growth and continue paying a dividend to shareholders. And cloud giants like Amazon and Microsoft have been profitable for years.\nAnother element to consider is that major players have been growing revenue and net income quarter after quarter, and demand for their AI services has been extremely strong. Palantir is a great example of this.\nOf course, there still is the risk that AI won't take off to the extent that analysts expect, and that certain companies will have spent too much considering the actual revenue opportunity.\nAn AI bubble? So, what does all of this evidence suggest about the possibility of an AI bubble in 2026? It shows us a few things. First, the fact that this boom is led by market-powerhouses with long track records of profitability makes it less fragile than the dot-com boom. Second, the earnings growth and level of demand for AI remain positive signs for the future. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang recently said today's situation doesn't look like a bubble.\n\nOne risk is that certain companies may overspend, though I would expect a tech giant to carefully pace spending and monitor demand so that any overspend wouldn't be catastrophic. And, as I said above, it's true that valuations have reached high levels -- some companies may grow into their valuations, while some may not.\nAll of this suggests that, in 2026, we might not see an actual AI bubble bursting -- but we could start to see the emergence of AI winners and losers. And while even the strongest AI players may experience turbulence here and there, they should go on to deliver growth over time.\nFor you as an investor, to win in such an environment, it's key to buy quality players that have the financial strength to develop and grow, pick them up for good prices, and hold on for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Chinese Chipmakers Race to IPO After Back-to-Back Listings Surge\n\nBloomberg News\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 5:47 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Chinese chipmakers are rushing to the IPO market, raising funds that are key to the nation’s goal of technological self-reliance and winning the global race on artificial intelligence.\nThe surge in listings is coming on the back of two blockbuster trading debuts that signaled insatiable demand for future national champions that analysts say could one day even rival the likes of Nvidia Corp. While some of these firms are already domestic industry leaders, they remain an obscurity to many international investors, making their share sales in Hong Kong a crucial test of confidence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nNYC’s Adams Challenges Mamdani Rent Freeze With Board Picks\nAirbnb’s NYC Comeback Dashed After Bill Easing Restrictions Dies\nEarlier this month, AI chipmaker Moore Threads Technology Co. saw its stock jump 425% on the first day of trading in Shanghai, followed by the 693% gain for MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai Co.’s listing.\n“China is catching up very quickly in the chip war. It wouldn’t surprise me if in 2026 or 2027 we have a DeepSeek moment for chips where a low-cost competitive chip is being produced by China,” said Matt Toms, head of cash equity execution for Asia-Pacific at Barclays. “This would be disruptive for Nvidia and their supply chain.”\n\nToms was referring to the Chinese startup that upended the AI industry earlier this year with low-cost models that offered comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots. Republican lawmakers on a US House committee have recently asked the Pentagon to list a group of firms including DeepSeek as Chinese military companies.\nHere is a list of Chinese AI chip firms seeking stock listings:\nBiren Technology\nFounded in 2019, Shanghai Biren Technology Co. focuses on areas such as graphics processing units and cloud computing, and is considered one of the most promising domestic contenders to Nvidia.\nBiren filed its listing documents with Hong Kong’s stock exchange earlier this month, after receiving the Chinese securities regulator’s approval to issue up to 372.5 million new shares there. The AI chipmaker is slated to start gauging investor interest this month for an initial public offering worth around $600 million.\nBiren was added to Washington’s so-called entity list in 2023, which prohibits the sale of US technology without a special license.\nKunlunxin\nAlso in the pipeline is internet giant Baidu Inc.’s AI chip division known as Kunlunxin, which is considering a listing in Hong Kong.\n\nStory Continues\nKunlunxin, which makes chips that power servers in data centers, is valued at least $3 billion. It was created in part to sate Baidu’s enormous appetite for computing power to run its online businesses.\nIluvatar CoreX\nShanghai Iluvatar CoreX Semiconductor Co. is another potential Chinese competitor for Nvidia. The Centurium Capital-backed firm also has filed listing documents to seek a Hong Kong listing.\nThe firm is considering an IPO that could raise $300 million to $400 million, Bloomberg News reported in August.\n\nFounded in 2015, the company raised 1.2 billion yuan ($170 million) in a funding round in 2021 led by Centurium and Cedarlake Capital. Another round in 2022 included Beijing Financial Street Capital and Hopu and raised 1 billion yuan.\nEnflame Technology\nShanghai Enflame Technology Co., which is seeking an onshore IPO, was founded by former Advanced Micro Devices Inc. employees in 2018.

      "Content": "Meet the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Pays More Dividends Than Any Other S&P 500 Company. Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

      "Content": "2 Monster Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBROS\n\nKey Points Nvidia has created a wide moat and is poised to continue to be one of the biggest AI winners over the next five years.\nDutch Bros is one of the best growth stories in the consumer space.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nAs 2025 continues to wind down, the market is on track for another strong performance. Growth stocks once again led the way, which has been the case for much of the past decade. Meanwhile, there is no reason to think that this trend will not continue.\nLet's look at two growth stocks to buy and hold for the next five years.\n1. Nvidia When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) remains one of the best stocks to continue to hold. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, given their parallel processing power, but it is the ecosystem it's built around these chips that will help drive its growth in the coming years.\n\nThe company's moat starts with its CUDA software platform, which it created nearly two decades ago to allow developers to easily program its chips. The company smartly gave it away for free and pushed it into universities and research labs that were doing early work on AI. Today, most foundational AI code is written on CUDA, and a generation of developers has been trained on its platform.\nMeanwhile, the company's recent acquisition of SchedMD should only increase its software moat, as it provides it with an AI orchestration layer called Slurm that helps coordinate which GPUs perform which tasks and when. While Slurm is open-source, by having control of this layer, Nvidia will be able to more tightly integrate it with its ecosystem to optimize the performance of its chips.\n\nThe company also has a networking moat with its NVLink interconnect system, which lets its GPUs pool memory and transfer data directly between each other, letting its chip clusters essentially act as one powerful unit. It also made a sneaky good investment in Intel , where the two companies are also partnering to bring Intel's central processing units (CPUs) into its NVLink framework, which could help freeze out rival Advanced Micro Devices , which is the leader in data center CPUs and the No. 2 GPU player.\nAs AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia's moat continues to put it in a position to be the biggest winner.\n2. Dutch Bros AI and tech are not the only areas to find intriguing growth stocks. The consumer space is another great place to look, and on that end, Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) is one of the best growth stories over the next few years.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Oregon-based coffee shop operator has been hitting on all cylinders, nicely growing same-store sales while expanding into new markets. Last quarter, in a difficult consumer environment, the company posted a 5.7% jump in comparable-restaurant sales, as transactions grew 4.7%. Company-owned shops performed even better, with same-store sales up 7.4%. The growth is being powered by menu innovation, brand marketing, and mobile order-ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has a big opportunity to further drive growth through the introduction of hot food items. The company has been getting less than 2% of its sales from food, compared to around 20% for rival Starbucks . This has hurt its morning daypart sales, as many customers don't want to make two stops.\nHowever, Dutch Bros will roll out hot food items to three-quarters of its locations that can support the offerings after a successful test, with shops that piloted the food items seeing a 4% sales lift. And once these items are more widely available and the company puts more marketing behind them, it wouldn't be surprising if the impact becomes even bigger.\nMeanwhile, Dutch Bros is still in the early innings of expansion, with under 1,100 stores. It plans to have more than 2,000 locations by 2029, and sees the opportunity to eventually support around 7,000 stores in the U.S. Its shops are small and cheap to build out, so it also gets a quick payback on its investment.\n\nBetween store expansion and same-store sales growth, Dutch Bros is a stock to own for the next five years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Arya added that the price target is based on the assumption that we are potentially in a memory upcycle.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat do other analysts think about MU stock?

      "Content": "Is Micron Technology a Millionaire-Maker Stock?\n\nWill Ebiefung, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 12:17 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Generative AI has led to a spike in demand for computer memory hardware.\nThis is creating shortages, enabling Micron to increase growth and margins.\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology ›\nThe generative artificial intelligence (AI) megatrend has allowed many older technology companies to rise from relative obscurity. And with its shares up by a whopping 170% year to date, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is an excellent example. Like the industry leader Nvidia , it serves the pick-and-shovel side of AI, supplying hardware that other companies will need to create consumer-facing software and services.\n\nLet's dig deeper to see if it still has millionaire-maker potential.\nWhy is Micron booming? While the AI hardware narrative tends to focus on graphics processing units (GPUs), which do the brunt of the work of running and training large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, there are other computer components that make the technology possible. Micron's high-bandwidth memory devices, such as DRAM and NAND flash, play a crucial role.\n\nThe vast libraries of AI training data need to be stored somewhere. Furthermore, these algorithms rely on powerful working memory to access data in real time and answer users' questions. Micron is America's largest computer memory specialist, so it was only a matter of time before investor capital began flowing in. And the stock's growth isn't just based on hype. Operational results are also showing significant progress.\nFiscal fourth-quarter revenue surged 49% year over year to $37.38, driven by an explosion of demand from data center clients, which tend to focus on AI-related workloads. Micron is also seeing a sustained rise in gross margins (which are up from 35.3% to 44.7% year over year) as its product mix shifts toward higher-end memory products, which can command better pricing. There is still potential for continued improvements.\n\nCan Micron's boom continue in 2026? Historically, computer memory has been a highly cyclical industry prone to boom-and-bust cycles. This trend occurs because the products are generally commoditized and poorly differentiated from each other while having high fixed production costs and slow manufacturing lead times. When demand is high, producers invest in expanding their production capacity, leading to a glut when supply outstrips demand and pricing strategies become a race to the bottom.\nThese are fundamental characteristics of the industry. And unfortunately for Micron, there is no reason to believe that things will change anytime soon. That said, generative AI is already sparking a massive boom cycle for memory hardware that is very likely to continue in 2026 and beyond.\n\nStory Continues\nReuters reports that the ravenous generative AI demand is leading to shortages all across the computer memory industry as producers shift production capacity to higher-demand products. This trend means Micron may be able to command higher prices across its product line (which includes memory for devices ranging from smartphones to automobiles) as demand begins to outstrip supply.\n\nFurthermore, analysts at Wells Fargo believe DRAM industry revenue could double in 2026, setting the company up for a huge amount of profit it can return to shareholders.\nIs Micron a millionaire-maker stock? With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 14, Micron stock is still remarkably cheap, despite its legendary rally in 2025. And memory hardware shortages could help the company maintain its outstanding momentum. While Micron probably won't make you a millionaire (because the current memory boom probably won't last forever), it looks poised for continued market-beating performance in 2026 and beyond.\n\nThe company will likely return a large portion of its growing profits to shareholders through its buyback program, which it resumed last year. While buybacks can feel less tangible than cash dividends, they are a better way to reward shareholders because they come with tax advantages. Dividends are taxed as ordinary income, while stock price appreciation is not taxed until you sell.\nFurthermore, a buyback strategy could help smooth out the inherent cyclicality of Micron's business model by reducing the number of shares outstanding relative to future earnings.\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now?

On December 18, Tigress Financial lifted the price target on the company’s stock to $350 from $280, while maintaining a “Strong Buy” rating on the company’s stock, as reported by The Fly. The firm tagged NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s position as the premier AI investment, possessing dominant full-stack data center leadership as well as accelerating adoption throughout autonomous driving, healthcare, and other high-growth verticals.\nFurthermore, the firm specifically highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s healthcare franchise and cited this as a powerful and underappreciated growth driver, which reinforces the appeal as a long-duration AI infrastructure investment. The firm also hinted at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s healthy balance sheet and cash flow that continue to support the company’s balanced capital allocation strategy.\n\nIn a different update, on December 15, the company announced the NVIDIA Nemotron™ 3 family of open models, data, and libraries that are designed to power transparent, efficient, and specialized agentic AI development throughout industries. The Nemotron 3 family of open models, in Nano, Super, and Ultra sizes, introduces the most efficient family of open models possessing leading accuracy for building agentic AI applications.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) highlighted that Nemotron 3 Nano is capable of delivering 4x higher throughput than Nemotron 2 Nano. Also, it delivers the most tokens per second for multi-agent systems at scale through the breakthrough hybrid mixture-of-experts architecture.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

You need a 'strong stomach': Dan Ives' strategy\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: PLTR\n\nCRWV\n\nAMD\n\nIVES\n\nMETA\n\nIn the AI trade, you \"can't just bet on one company,\" Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research, Dan Ives, tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting the importance of diversification for AI investors.\nWatch the video above to hear more about Ives' AI thesis and the 30 stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF ( IVES ).\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThere's another stock I want to ask you about, and that is CoreWeave, which as you know, has sold off pretty sharply. Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Palantir vs. Nvidia\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 10:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Palantir and Nvidia have each seen earnings soar in recent quarters thanks to their AI strengths.\nTheir stocks have advanced more than 2,000% and 900%, respectively, in three years.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have helped investors take major steps along the path to wealth in recent years. Investors placed bets on the potential for this hot technology to revamp the way many things are done -- and as a result, supercharge the growth of companies.\n\nTwo players in particular have attracted investors' attention, and they are Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) . The former is a software company that's helping its customers harness the power of AI, and the latter is the world's leading AI chip designer. Both of these companies have seen earnings soar in recent years, and the stock prices have followed. Over the past three years, Palantir stock has jumped 2,400% and Nvidia has advanced more than 900%.\nBoth of these tech companies are well-positioned to benefit as this AI story continues to unfold, making them great stocks to own. But which one is the best AI stock to buy now? Let's find out.\nThe case for Palantir Palantir has been around for more than 20 years, but the AI boom represented a real turning point. The company, throughout most of its history, relied on government contracts for steady growth, but in recent times, demand from commercial customers has taken off. This is thanks to Palantir's focus on AI . The company launched its AI-driven product, Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), two years ago, offering customers a way to immediately apply AI to their needs.\n\nAIP helps customers aggregate their data and use it in various ways -- this could involve making decisions, developing new ways of operating, and more. Demand has been high among both government and commercial customers, leading to revenue growth in the double digits for each business. Commercial customer count, contract value, and overall profit also have been on the rise -- and the company has continued to increase full-year guidance.\nThe AI market is forecast to reach into the trillions of dollars in a few years, and Palantir is well-positioned to benefit -- that's because this company makes it easy for customers to get in on AI while barely lifting a finger.\nThe case for Nvidia When you think of AI, you probably immediately think of Nvidia. That's because this company has built an AI fortress over the past few years -- it's not only the leading AI chip designer , but it also offers a wide range of related products and services for every AI need.\n\nStory Continues\nAll of this has helped Nvidia generate double- and triple-digit earnings growth in recent quarters and years -- with revenue and net income reaching record levels. In the latest full year, Nvidia's revenue soared in the triple digits to more than $130 billion.\nThe company has committed to updating its famous chips, or graphics processing units (GPUs), on an annual basis, a move that should keep it ahead of rivals. And demand for its latest releases has been spectacular -- we saw this with the release of the Blackwell architecture about a year ago and the launch of update Blackwell Ultra a few months ago.\n\nNvidia predicts that AI infrastructure spending could reach as much as $4 trillion by the end of the decade. The company could be a big winner in such a story because, as data centers build out, they need high-powered chips.\nPalantir or Nvidia? Before we answer the question, let's take a look at valuation. In the case of Palantir, it's been extremely high for quite some time, but it's important to remember that the company is in the early days of its growth story -- and this metric only considers earnings estimates a year from now and not farther down the road.\nIn Nvidia's case, we can more easily look at valuation and see that there is a window of opportunity here. The stock is trading for 36x forward earnings estimates, down from as much as 50x a year ago.\nMeanwhile, as mentioned, Nvidia is particularly well placed to benefit from AI infrastructure spending.\n\nSo, right now, Palantir is a solid stock to buy and own -- but Nvidia, for the dip in valuation and the upcoming AI infrastructure opportunity, is the best stock to buy now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?

      "Content": "Controversial Nvidia rival may finally IPO\n\nMoz Farooque\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 10:19 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: CESY.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) rival Cerebras Systems is eyeing another shot at going public, and this time, the timing seems deliberate.\nAccording to Reuters , the AI chip startup is set to refile for a U.S. IPO as early as next week, with a target debut in Q2 2026 .\nWhat’s interesting is that the eye-opening move comes months after Cerebras pulled its previous filing. The decision was based on a national security review linked to a foreign investor, along with growing scrutiny on where U.S. AI technology ends up.\n\nTo be fair, this isn’t a story that’s unfamiliar in any way.\nYou have another fast-growing AI semiconductor business that’s looking to capitalize on surging demand. However, with Cerebras, the picture gets slightly more complicated.\nThe financials we’ve seen are dated, and the company’s growth appears to be heavily concentrated in a single customer, with a regulatory backdrop that remains unclear.\nSo, this IPO hinges less on clever chip design and more on whether public-market investors are comfortable with the risks that come with it.\nCerebras isn’t just another GPU company Cerebras takes a more novel approach than Nvidia does with its GPUs.\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nInstead of linking thousands of chips, it develops a single, wafer-scale processor , which is essentially one massive chip, that’s about the size of an dinner plate.\nIn doing so, its latest WSE-3 packs quite the punch, with nearly 4 trillion transistors and 900,000 cores onto a single piece of silicon.\nThat gives Cerebras a significant edge, especially in handling massive AI models that can be trained on a single system or spread seamlessly across multiple GPUs, thereby reducing complexity and bottlenecks.\nThat design prioritizes less versatility and more robust performance.\nCerebras’ IPO is coming back with a bigger price tag Cerebras Systems is apparently getting ready to test the public markets again.\nRelated: Cathie Wood trims $11.2 million in longtime favorite stock\nAccording to Reuters , the AI chip startup is targeting a Q2 2026 debut , as it looks to ride the red-hot demand for specialized AI silicon.\nIt’s important to note that this is a comeback attempt.\nCerebras withdrew its previous IPO filing in late 2025 , following a whopping $1+ billion funding round with U.S. national-security reviews linked to Abu Dhabi’s G42 .\n\nStory Continues\nNow it's coming back with a bang and targeting a much higher price. Cerebras was valued at a massive $8 billion in 2024 , and reports suggest that the valuation has “nearly doubled” since , with IPO discussion moving into the tens of billions .\nWhat investors will be weighing:\nWhether the G42 review is behind the company.\nIf “ tens of billions ” is a justified price tag for an unproven niche AI hardware player.\nWhat the IPO signals about AI investing, even if Nvidia’s lead remains intact.\n\nThe complication behind Cerebras’ IPO plans Cerebras’ planned IPO hasn’t been without its controversies.\nRelated: Bank of America sets AI stocks to buy list for 2026\nFront and center is its connection to the G42 , with the Abu Dhabi–based AI firm investing a massive $335 million , leading to a U.S. national-security review.\nThe concerns were primarily due to the use of non-U.S. intermediaries to route advanced American AI technology toward China.\n\nReuters specifically pointed to concerns over G42’s links with Huawei in the past, and the review played a critical role in delaying Cerebras’ IPO plans.\nAlso, G42 was Cerebras’ primary customer.\nIn the first half of 2024, Cerebras reported $136.4 million in sales , skyrocketing 1,474% year over year.\nHowever, nearly $119.1 million, or 87% , came from G42. Moreover, the company disclosed that discounts linked to G42’s high-volume orders weighed down gross margin to 41.1% from 50.5% .\nSince then, though, Cerebras has obtained CFIUS clearance , and G42 is no longer listed as an investor, a change that should prove critical when we have the latest financials.\nNvidia still leads despite growing competition Nvidia still dominates the AI accelerator market, with an estimated 80–90% share .\nRelated: Eli Lilly’s pill solves the biggest problem with weight loss\nHowever, the size of the opportunity continues to draw challengers from virtually every corner of the tech space.\nEstablished chipmakers and cloud giants continue to seek alternatives as customers seek greater diversification in terms of supply and cost.\n\nAMD is clearly the most credible near-term rival, led by its potent MI300 and upcoming MI400 accelerators, supercharged by deals from OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.\nIntel is looking to re-enter the race and make its mark with Gaudi2, along with its future Falcon Shores platform.\nQualcomm is also planning to launch data-center AI accelerators in 2026–27 , while hyperscalers like Google , Amazon , and Meta are also building in-house chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia.\nOn top of that, China has mounted a response too, on the back of tariffs and other export controls. Startups, including Moore Threads , Biren Technology , and Cambricon Technologies, are all looking to replace Nvidia domestically, while Huawei , Baidu , and Alibaba are manufacturing custom silicon.\nEurope’s cautionary tale is Graphcore , which was once valued at a whopping $2.8 billion before being acquired by SoftBank for nearly £400 million back in 2024.\nRelated: Wall Street manager sends blunt message on economy in 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Technology section.

      "Content": "Mark Cuban Says He Keeps a Large Part of His Portfolio in Cash — Here’s Why\n\nPeter Burns\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 8:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIf you regularly tune in to the blogs, podcasts and videos of popular personal finance influencers, you’ll hear a lot of advice that they all seem to agree upon. One area of overlap is that you should invest a certain portion of your income. While this is solid financial advice, some finance experts, like entrepreneur Mark Cuban, think a large portion of your portfolio should be in cash.\n\nHere are some of the reasons for keeping cash on hand .\nFinancial Opportunities When it comes to investing, few can match the accomplishments of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett . Over the years, Buffett has made a name for himself as a top investor who preaches patience and holding for the long term. However, Buffett doesn’t just invest; he also holds a lot of cash.\nToward the end of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway’s cash reserves reached $325 billion, doubling the amount of cash it had at the end of 2023. Having cash on hand gives Buffett the upper hand in terms of flexibility. When a stock’s price dips and he determines it’s undervalued, other companies might not have the liquidity to buy it up on the spot. However, Buffett’s cash reserve allows him to jump at the chance and maximize his profits.\n\nNot everyone runs a multinational conglomerate like Berkshire Hathaway, but holding cash can still give you the chance to take advantage of opportunities that may later arise. Whether it’s an undervalued stock, a property or a rare watch, if you have enough cash on hand, you won’t need to rush to sell any other investments to acquire it.\nLearn More: I Got Rich Investing — These Lessons for Beginners Could Lead To $1 Million Net Worth\nFor You: 6 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nMarket Volatility Buying low and selling high may be the most common investing advice out there. However, market volatility isn’t always great . Cuban, a successful entrepreneur, investor and TV personality, always keeps a large portion of his portfolio in cash because, whether it be political unpredictability, a global event or a new innovation, he isn’t a fan of losing money and doesn’t want to take big risks.\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2025, Nvidia’s stock dropped 17%, dropping its market cap by almost $600 billion — the largest plunge for a U.S. company in history. While the company quickly rebounded, Cuban didn’t feel right about buying in as he thought there was still too much uncertainty. Other market-shaking events, such as President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements, have also kept Cuban from investing. By keeping his money in cash, he’s been unaffected by the market swings and can stay confident about preserving his wealth .\n\nStory Continues\nEmergencies There are also reasons to keep a lump sum of cash available that don’t involve investing, such as building up an emergency fund .\nRachel Cruze, a personal finance expert and co-host of the popular “Ramsey Show,” is a big proponent of saving enough to cover three to six months’ worth of expenses in case something terrible happens. If you get laid off, face a medical emergency or have your car break down, you’ll be happy you built up that emergency fund.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nNearly 1 in 3 Americans Hit by a Costly Holiday Scam, Norton Survey Shows -- How To Avoid This\nHere's What the Average Social Security Payment Will Be in Winter 2025\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\nThe Easiest Way to Score $250 for Things You Already Do\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Mark Cuban Says He Keeps a Large Part of His Portfolio in Cash — Here’s Why\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean.

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock To Buy in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Alphabet is finally getting some recognition from investors for its AI accomplishments.\nThe search-engine giant has ample opportunities to benefit from increased AI spending.\nWhile the stock has gotten a bit expensive, it looks poised to fly higher in the long-run.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has served as an unprecedented bellwether for technology stocks over the last three years. In particular, semiconductor stocks including Nvidia , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , and Broadcom were all ushered into the trillion-dollar club thanks to the AI revolution.\nAs investment in AI infrastructure continues to unfold, I think it's likely that chip stocks will remain sound investment choices. But as 2026 approaches, I see a different tech titan taking center stage: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nLet's dig into how Alphabet has built an AI fortress poised to dominate the future. From there, I'll explore the company's valuation trends and make the case for why now is a great time to buy Alphabet stock hand over fist.\nIt's been a quiet three years for Alphabet...until now The AI revolution kicked off almost exactly three years ago when OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT. ChatGPT quickly captured the imaginations of people all over the world with its ability to answer virtually any question instantly.\nThe dramatic rise in popularity among large language models (LLMs) caused some on Wall Street to pose the idea that traditional search tools like Google were headed for doom. Think of the business stakes at hand here: Why would advertisers continue paying a premium on platforms like Google and YouTube when everyone's attention was flocking to chatbots?\n\nWhile Alphabet's advertising business did show some signs of stalling, the company's cash cow remained somewhat resilient. For a couple of years, revenue from Google and YouTube wasn't as robust as it once was, but it also wasn't plummeting at an alarming rate.\nWhat many investors were overlooking, however, was Alphabet's other ventures. At the beginning of the AI revolution, Google Cloud was operating at an annual revenue run rate of about $29 billion. Meanwhile, this segment of Alphabet's business was unprofitable.\nFast forward to today, and Google Cloud is now on pace for more than $50 billion of annual sales while boasting positive operating income. What's even more interesting is that Google Cloud has won major deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic -- the two LLMs that were once seen as the ultimate existential threat to Google's relevancy.\n\nStory Continues\nBesides the success of its cloud division, Alphabet has also successfully launched its own LLM -- called Gemini. According to management, Gemini has over 650 million monthly active users (MAUs) while search queries are increasing threefold quarter over quarter.\nWhy 2026 could be epic for Gemini For most of the AI revolution, I think the consensus view around Alphabet was one of uncertainty. While not everyone bought into the extinction of Google narrative, it's fair to say that it took some time for Alphabet to prove its AI ambitions were bearing fruit.\nOne of the biggest catalysts the company has going into next year is an extension of Google Cloud through commercializing custom hardware. Specifically, Alphabet's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), known as tensor processing units (TPUs), have seen some early traction with Apple and Anthropic.\n\nWhile TPUs aren't going to dethrone Nvidia's GPU business anytime soon, I think Alphabet is on the cusp of unlocking a new wave of growth in the cloud infrastructure market that's currently dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\nAlphabet stock could soar to new highs next year As of this writing, Alphabet's forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio is hovering around 28 -- its highest level during the AI boom.\nNormally, I tend to stay away from momentum stocks. More times than not, by the time a company reaches a record high, it's dicey to buy the premium and expect shares to move materially higher.\nThis is a rare instance where I think the opposite is true. Alphabet's current price increase reflects two factors: An appreciation for the company's current operating performance and a bullish outlook that Alphabet will keep up its strong performance.\n\nAlphabet's ecosystem -- from search, cloud computing, consumer electronics, custom hardware, and more -- is a major differentiator compared to its mega cap peers. The company has a unique flexibility stitched into its DNA -- benefiting from AI across its various assets and subsidiaries during any market cycle. These dynamics position Alphabet as a particularly durable business for the long run.\nAs investments in AI infrastructure are expected to continue rising going into next year, I expect Alphabet to benefit from these tailwinds more so than any one singular chip designer or software developer.\nWith this in mind, I think Alphabet will continue to show signs of accelerating revenue and profit margin expansion across its entire business next year -- which should lead to even more buying from shareholders. Against this backdrop, I see Alphabet as the best opportunity in the AI landscape as 2026 approaches.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

President Trump announced the news in the Oval Office in January, flanked by the respective companies’ leaders, including Oracle chair Larry Ellison — a move that sent the stock soaring .\n\nAI optimism continued to push Oracle shares higher following its quarterly earnings reports in June and September , with AI-driven deals set to push cloud segment revenue to $166 billion in 2030. The stock’s surge in September briefly made Ellison the world’s wealthiest person .\nBut AI euphoria quickly gave way to doubt. Investors became increasingly concerned over the rising use of debt to fund tech firms’ AI spending, just as the payoff of that spending remains hotly debated. Those concerns are evidenced in the budding demand for Big Tech credit default swaps (CDS) — financial contracts that act as insurance by letting investors bet on the likelihood that a company will default on its debt.",

Management noted that they have released Nemotron 3 Nano, which is the smallest of the three models, with the other two larger versions expected to be released in the first half of 2026. Although NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is known for making and providing chips to other companies that make AI models. However, with China’s DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and Alibaba Group Holdings open-source models taking over the market, the company has started to release its open-source models too.\nMoreover, the report also noted that Meta platforms is said to be shifting towards closed source models, which will leave NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as one of the biggest players in the said offerings.\nThat said, Wall Street remains bullish on the tech giant.

      "Content": "Intel stock soared in 2025. But the chipmaker still has a long road ahead.\n\nLaura Bratton\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBY\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nFor Intel ( INTC ), 2025 was an eventful year, but not one that necessarily changed its narrative .\nThe storied American chipmaker got a new CEO and won massive investments from the US government , Nvidia ( NVDA ), and SoftBank ( SFTBY ). Those developments helped push the stock up 86% for the year, ahead of gains for the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks and Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). At the same time, Intel's crucial manufacturing segment still lacks a major external customer — something it needs to make the cash-bleeding business viable.\n\n\"Intel's exiting the year with some optimism that they will be a relevant chip manufacturer in the US at some point in time ... and that was definitely an uncertain statement at the start of the year,\" MorningStar analyst Brian Colello told Yahoo Finance.\nAt the same time, he noted, \"There wasn't the massive sort of deal that really establishes Intel, either, in manufacturing.\"\n\nThe company's technology is largely responsible for the digital revolution and Silicon Valley's reputation as a global innovation hub: Intel invented the world's first microprocessors, or computer chips, and the x86 architecture, a critical blueprint for designing computer chips. Its co-founder Gordon Moore created Moore's Law, a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. The company has continued to make its own computer chips, even as the rest of the industry has gone \"fabless\" — outsourcing manufacturing to firms like Taiwan's TSMC ( TSM ).\n\nBut years of missteps and poor investment decisions put Intel's manufacturing segment behind TSMC, which in turn caused its products to lose their edge to competitors. As its chips — CPUs for servers, laptops, and desktops — have lost market share to rivals AMD and Arm ( ARM ), its manufacturing business has been stripped of the scale it needs to remain viable.\nFour years of an aggressive turnaround effort by former CEO Pat Gelsinger to revive Intel's manufacturing arm by opening it to outside customers sent investors fleeing. The massive amount of spending required to reboot the foundry, along with its uncertain success, spooked Wall Street.\nThe arrival of Lip-Bu Tan , who was named chief executive in March following the board's ousting of Gelsinger in late 2024, began to renew faith in the company's potential turnaround. While Intel's strategy remains mostly unchanged under Tan, analysts explained, investors have applauded his sober tone, cost-cutting measures, and wide-ranging industry connections.\n\nStory Continues\nThat tepid faith transformed into confidence when the US government made a rare $9 billion investment in the company — albeit funds Intel was supposed to get anyway from the Biden-era CHIPS Act — following Tan's tiff with President Trump over the CEO's business ties to China.\nOnshoring semiconductor manufacturing has been a focus of the US government since the pandemic highlighted the risk of a tech supply chain reliant on Taiwan. Escalating tensions with China, including the threat of a Taiwan invasion, have further intensified the sense of urgency.\n\n\"Semiconductors are not only economically important, they're actually important from a national security perspective,\" Technalysis analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \"Intel has by far the largest infrastructure in place as a true, real American company.\"\nMany critics believe the broader US turn toward state capitalism under Trump, exemplified by the Intel investment, raises questions about national security and the government's conflicting interests. But analysts say the US government's 10% stake in Intel could lead to various positive outcomes for the company, such as Intel having a say in trade policy that affects semiconductors. More importantly, the US could step in to incentivize or force a major company like Apple to use the chipmaker's foundry.\n\nA $2 billion investment from SoftBank and $5 billion from Nvidia further boosted investor sentiment on Intel stock. The cash infusion helped stem the company's steep losses as it figures out a path forward. Notably, though, the Nvidia deal didn't include an agreement for Intel's foundry business to manufacture the AI giant's chips.\n'Everything hinges on 14A' Intel's biggest potential customers for its foundry business — Nvidia, Apple ( AAPL ), and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) — are also, to some degree, competitors of its products arm and have longstanding relationships with TSMC. Not to mention, TSMC is building $165 billion worth of manufacturing capacity in the US, diminishing the geopolitical argument for those companies to use Intel to produce their chips.\nTo win those customers, Intel will need to prove that its latest generation manufacturing processes are up to snuff. The chipmaker's 18A process, a massive technological feat initially marketed to outside customers, is now being used primarily to make Intel's own products. Whether those products — Intel's upcoming Panther Lake chips for PCs and Clearwater Forest chips for data centers — succeed could help convince companies to use its next-generation processes called 18AP and 14A, analysts said.\n\nAlready, rumors have circulated that Apple could use Intel's manufacturing, specifically its 18AP process, for its lowest-end computer chips.\nIntel has 12 to 18 months to secure a big external customer for 14A in order for that process to continue as planned, BNB Paribas analyst David O'Connor estimated.\nHe called the process \"the crux of Intel being successful on the foundry business or not, or potentially even exiting manufacturing long term.\"\n\"Everything hinges on 14A and the success of that,\" O'Connor said.\nOther analysts gave longer timelines for when Intel would see a turnaround.\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said, \"It took 10 years to break it. Why would it take less than 10 years to fix it?\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Bluesky @laurabratton.bsky.social.

This has investors searching for the next Broadcom, as who wouldn't want those incredible one-year returns?\n\nThe secret to Broadcom's rise is tied to the custom artificial intelligence (AI) chips it's developing. These compete directly against Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are incredibly costly due to their impressive performance and flexibility. Broadcom's custom AI chips can outperform Nvidia's GPUs at a lower price point when the workload is set up properly, giving them a huge advantage at the cost of flexibility.\nDesigning custom AI computing units is going to become more popular, as Nvidia's chips are far too expensive not to explore this avenue. While many companies are choosing to partner with Broadcom, others are opting to do it themselves. One of these companies is hiding in plain sight, and its recent release is incredibly promising.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has dived into designing its own AI chip, and the results have been phenomenal. This innovation could provide Amazon with the growth it needs to be a monster stock pick over the next few years, making it an excellent investment today.\nAmazon's new device provides incredible performance Amazon's new computing chip is known as Trainium3. It is built on cutting-edge 3nm (nanometer) chip architecture and delivers impressive performance at a lower price point. Compared to previous generation Trainum2 servers, they offer 4 times the computing performance while improving energy efficiency by 4 times as well. That helps reduce operating costs and run time, which allowed several generative AI clients to reduce training and inference costs by up to 50%, including Anthropic.\n\nThose are huge boosts for Amazon, and it could attract new clients to its servers. One of those is OpenAI, which is reportedly considering using Amazon's Trainium3 chips in exchange for a $10 billion investment. This could be the first of many companies flocking to Amazon's training servers, as cost is starting to become a large bottleneck in the artificial intelligence investing realm.\n\nStory Continues\nInvestors want to see real innovation in exchange for their dollars, and companies may need to stretch their funding to achieve better results. Switching from GPUs to alternative computing units like Amazon's is one way to do that, and it could grow in popularity in 2026.\nDepending on how popular this product is, Amazon could become the next Broadcom. We'll see success tied to Amazon's cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), if it has any boost in 2026. Fortunately for Amazon and its investors, it's already looking up.\n\nAWS is critical to Amazon's success Despite AWS accounting for only 18% of Amazon's total revenue, it represents 66% of its operating profits. That's because AWS' margins are far better than the base e-commerce business, so as AWS goes, so will Amazon.\nIn Q3, AWS posted its best growth rate in multiple years, rising at a 20% pace. This indicates that more workloads are coming online at AWS, which is an excellent sign for 2026. If Amazon can continue this momentum in 2026, combined with the rise of Trainium3 workloads, Amazon's stock could dramatically rise in 2026.\n\nWhile I doubt it can duplicate Broadcom's 50% rise this year, I think Amazon is prepped to be a market-beating stock, especially after its underperformance this year. Amazon is well-positioned to take advantage of the growing AI workload, and with the rest of its business also producing strong results (advertising in particular), I think Amazon has what it takes to be a top stock pick in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Stocks enter final stretch of 2025 just off record highs: What to watch this week\n\nJake Conley · Breaking Business News Reporter\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:41 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nORCL\n\n^GSPC\n\nMU\n\nStocks rallied on Friday to cap a mixed week for the major averages in what served as the final full trading week of 2025.\nFor the week, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) rose about 0.4%, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) fell about 0.7% and the benchmark S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) closed little changed.\n\nAll three major indexes will enter the final seven trading sessions of 2025 within 3% of their record highs.\nIn the week ahead, those investors still around during the holidays will turn their attention to the prospects of a \" Santa Claus rally ,\" while a few pieces of economic data out on Tuesday will clean up some of the lagging data delayed as a result of the government shutdown.\nTuesday morning's read on consumer confidence from the Conference Board should be the key focus, with one of 2025's defining narratives centering on the K-shaped economy that has emerged among American shoppers.\nMarkets in the US will be open for half a day on Wednesday and closed on Thursday for Christmas. Many international markets will remain closed on Friday as well.\n\n'Consumers will likely still feel saltier' American consumers are heading into the holidays with a bit less joy than last year.\nWhile data from the University of Michigan released Friday showed a moderate uptick in consumer sentiment in December versus November, at 52.9 the index is 28.5% below last December's reading.\nSimilarly, housing sales ticked up for the third month in a row in November, but 2025 sales are looking likely to finish the year at a 25-year low, according to data from the National Association of Realtors.\n\n\"Consumers are loud and clear that they believe that the outlook for the economy has soured quite a bit since the beginning of the year,\" said Joanne Hsu, the director of the survey of consumers for the University of Michigan.\nWhile consumer spending has by and large held up throughout the back half of the year, according to Bank of America, US households in the upper third of incomes are driving more than half of that spending; around a quarter of households are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\"The ‘K-shaped’ economy makes for a fragmented consumer,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. \"The affluent are fine, if not thriving, while lower-income households struggle with high rent payments, rising delinquencies, and job uncertainty.\"\n\nPerhaps another reason why Thursday's inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics arrived as such a surprise.\nAt a 2.7% headline increase in prices over the last 12 months, the November reading came in significantly below expectations. The reading should give the Federal Reserve the vote of confidence it needs to cut rates again next year, building on a total 75 basis points' worth of cuts in 2025, said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank.\n\nStory Continues\n\"The Fed will be heartened to see total and core CPI slow\" as the report \"bolsters the case for more interest rate cuts in 2026,\" Adams said in an email.\nEven so, \"Consumers will likely still feel saltier about inflation than the upbeat headline would suggest, since the prices of many essentials outside of shelter continue to rise rapidly,\" he said.\n'All but giving the green light' Traders wait all year for the \"Santa Claus Rally,\" which covers the final five trading days of one year and the first two of the next as one of the market's best-performing weekly windows.\nOn Friday, markets showed signs of meeting history's expectations. And, notably, so did Big Tech stocks.\nOracle ( ORCL ) stock, which has dropped almost 40% since its highs in September on worries over its AI commitments, rose more than 7% on Friday after news broke that the company is the lead buyer in a cohort of American partners buying TikTok from its Chinese owner ByteDance.\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) shares also rose Friday after reports from Reuters said the Trump administration is reviewing plans for Jensen Huang's chipmaking giant to sell its second-most-powerful H200 chips to Chinese buyers.\nMicron's ( MU ) earnings report this week, and the stock's more than 10% rally in response , also settled some investor fears over the state of the AI and the broader market heading into the final handful of trading days in 2025.\n\n\"Lukewarm US labour market data, a surprise drop in US inflation figures, and a notionally dovish Fed is providing support for equity prices,\" Capital analyst Kyle Rodda wrote in a note to clients.\n\"Despite the Fed all but giving the green light for a Santa Rally, justifiable fears about valuations is keeping the handbrake on the market and holding it back from record highs.\"\nStill, most strategists on Wall Street remain positive on the market outlook heading into next year, with the economic growth and earnings backdrop also offering reasons for investor enthusiasm outside of the AI trade, which has become a crutch for many over the last few years.\n\"2025 has been a good example of the early optimism phase [of the macroeconomic cycle] where many equity markets ... have seen valuations rise with earnings,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a client note.\n\"We believe that the optimism phase will continue in 2026.\"\nEconomic and earnings calendar Monday Economic data: Chicago Fed national activity index, September (-0.20 expected)\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nTuesday Economic data: ADP Weekly employment change, week ended Dec. 6 (16,250 previously); Personal consumption, third quarter (+2.7% expected); Core PCE index, quarter-on-quarter, third quarter (+2.9% expected); Durable goods orders, October preliminary reading (-1.5% expected, 0.5% previously); Industrial production, month-on-month, November (+0.1% expected, +0.1% previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, December (-15 previously); Conference Board consumer confidence, December (92.0 expected, 88.7 previously)\n\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nWednesday Economic data: MBA mortgage applications, week ended Dec. 19 (-3.8% previously); Initial jobless claims, week ended Dec. 20 (223,000 expected, 224,000 previously)\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nThursday Markets closed for Christmas.\nFriday Economic data: No notable economic data.\nEarnings calendar: No notable earnings.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nLa historia continúa\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This Quiet AI Company Could Be the Next Big Winner\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SOUN\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points SoundHound AI has rapid revenue growth but steep losses.\nMost of its Q3 loss was due to a one-time accounting charge.\nSoundHound has some similarities to Palantir from three years ago.\n10 stocks we like better than SoundHound AI ›\nThe dramatic rise in tech stocks over the last two years has made a lot of investors wealthier -- and that's something to celebrate! But when we're done patting ourselves on the back for a job well done with Nvidia , Alphabet , and Palantir Technologies , it's time to look for the next big thing.\n\nThat's because it's easier to have dramatic gains when you're starting with a smaller market capitalization . Palantir had a market cap of less than $50 billion when I first bought the stock in 2022, and its current $431 billion market cap now makes it one of the largest companies in the world.\nIts stock has gained 2,210% since July 2022. And if it were to gain another 2,210% in the next three years, it would have a market cap of $10 trillion -- more than twice as large as the current market leader, Nvidia.\nObviously, that's not happening. To find an artificial intelligence (AI) stock with the potential for a Palantir-size gain over the next three years, we need to examine one that still has significant growth ahead. One that I'm considering right now is a stock I've been skeptical about in the past: SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) .\nWhat is SoundHound AI? SoundHound operates an AI platform that allows users to have conversations to use voice-enabled services and apps. Voice-enabled products have been around for a long time -- for example, automated customer-service phone numbers and voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa. However, the early iterations of this technology were clunky enough to create significant user frustration.\n\nSoundHound, which went public in 2021, primarily worked in the automotive and restaurant industries before taking a significant step forward in 2024 with its $80 million acquisition of Amelia AI, an AI agent that is customizable for internal use or public-facing applications.\nThe acquisition pushed SoundHound's corporate client base to more than 200 customers. However, the company still hasn't been able to turn a profit, and investors may have signaled this year that they're becoming concerned about the stock: Shares are down more than 40% this year.\nPart of the problem may be the company's third-quarter earnings report, which showed a sharp net loss of $109.3 million, versus a loss of $21.7 million a year ago. The loss wiped out its impressive $42 million in revenue, which was up 68% from a year ago.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, $66 million of the loss was due to a noncash, nonoperating accounting charge related to previous acquisitions. The adjusted net loss was $13 million, which was an improvement from a year ago. And most importantly, the business ended the quarter with zero debt and cash on hand of $269 million.\n\nIn addition, SoundHound is increasing its client base, including by the following:\nA deal to integrate SoundHound Chat AI into \"double-digit millions of AI-enabled smart devices\" developed by an unnamed Chinese company.\nAn agreement with an Italian commercial-vehicle company to install voice AI in its fleet.\nExpansions of the scope of contracts with three top financial services institutions.\nAn agreement with a U.S. regional hospital system to deploy the Amelia platform.\nA deal to supply a national full-service restaurant chain with voice-ordering technology.\nAn agreement with a telecommunications provider that offers TV and internet in 20 U.S. states.\nWhat should you expect from the stock? Analysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance are unanimous in their prediction that SoundHound stock will move higher in the next year. The mean price target of $17.19 is 53% higher than the current stock price; the low price target of $15 is 33% higher.\nSoundHound may not replicate Palantir's rapid growth, but I see many similarities between the two companies. Three years ago, in the second quarter of 2022, Palantir was losing money, too -- it posted a net loss in the quarter of $179.3 million as it was building out its platforms.\n\nManagement has expanded SoundHound's business model to include a variety of functions, including customer service, sales, marketing, operations, and IT service management. The company has enabled more than 10 billion personalized automated voice conversations annually.\nAs companies strive to become more efficient and increasingly reliant on AI solutions to streamline their products while still personalizing customer interactions, SoundHound AI's growth is expected to continue. Clearly, I've misjudged this company with my aforementioned skepticism.

      "Content": "Will Nvidia's Stock Double in 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia's GPUs remain the most popular computing option on the market.\nThe AI hyperscalers plan to spend record amounts in data centers again in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had a lackluster 2025 compared to 2023 and 2024. In both of those years, the stock more than doubled, but in 2025, it's only up about 30%. That's still outperforming the broader market, but not by as much as you may think, considering Nvidia's excellent growth and results.\nLooking ahead to 2026, the trends that prevailed during the previous three years are still ongoing, which could set Nvidia up for an excellent 2026. But will it be enough for the stock to double?\nNvidia's success is tied to the spending habits of others Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , which are accelerated computing units that can process multiple calculations in parallel. These computing units are the muscle behind most of the transformative artificial intelligence technology we experience today. Nvidia has a strong grip on the data center computing market. In Q3 FY 2026 (ended October 2026), Nvidia's data center revenue totaled $51.2 billion -- up 66% year over year. Two of Nvidia's biggest competitors are Advanced Micro Devices , which also makes GPUs, and Broadcom , which collaborates directly with AI hyperscalers to design custom AI computing chips. In their most recent quarters, AMD grew data center revenue at a 22% to $4.3 billion, and Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue increased 74% year over year to $6.5 billion. While Broadcom may be growing faster than Nvidia, it's still much smaller. AMD is both smaller and growing far slower than Nvidia, which is a poor position to be in.\n\nWhile investors may be worried about Nvidia's dominance waning, they shouldn't. Nvidia is clearly the best option available for, and the results back that up. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs, highlighting the incredible demand for computing.\nThat demand isn't expected to die down anytime soon. After record-setting capital expenditures in 2025 by the AI hyperscalers, they have all informed investors that 2026 will be a year of further growth. This bodes well for Nvidia's future, allowing it to extend its strong growth into another year.\nHowever, Nvidia doesn't think this buildout will stop in 2026. They estimate that global data center capital expenditures will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's up significantly from the $600 billion in 2025.\n\nContinua a leggere\nShould AI spending continue to trend in this direction, Nvidia's stock will continue to outperform the market, making it an excellent stock to own. But will it be enough for the stock to double in 2026?\nA double from Nvidia would be a tall task If we assume that Nvidia will grow at about the same pace as data center capital expenditures are expected to grow through 2030, that would assign a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46% at the high end. That's well short of the 100% growth needed to ensure an Nvidia double, so the remaining slack must be picked up by an increase in Nvidia's valuation.\nAt less than 38 times forward earnings, Nvidia's stock isn't cheap.\nHowever, considering Nvidia's projected growth rates, I'd argue that it isn't expensive either. As a result, any further valuation increase should come solely from business performance. This isn't expected to provide 100% growth, so I doubt Nvidia stock will double in 2026. If it did, the company would be worth nearly $10 trillion by market cap.\n\nStill, Nvidia remains an excellent stock pick due to all of the money being spent on AI data centers. We've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with AI, and there's still a long runway of growth. Nvidia will be there to supply the computing power needed to fuel this buildout, making it a great stock to own in 2026, even if it's unlikely that it will double.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge , our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe launch marks Moore Threads' latest bid to challenge foreign rivals like Nvidia, and comes close on the heels of the company's blockbuster initial public offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on December 5.\nZhang Jianzhong, founder and CEO of Moore Threads, pictured in November 2023. Photo: Handout alt=Zhang Jianzhong, founder and CEO of Moore Threads, pictured in November 2023. Photo: Handout>\nThe company's shares have gained more than 480 per cent since their debut, closing at 664.1 yuan on Friday.\n\nZhang claimed that Huashan's performance exceeded that of Nvidia's Hopper series, which includes the H100 and H200 chips, in computing power, memory bandwidth and capacity, but did not provide specifications for the chips.\nThe sale of Nvidia's H100 and H200 - popular choices among global tech firms for AI training - to China was banned until recently by the US government, which cited national security concerns.\nWashington, in a surprising move, recently approved the sale of the H200 chips to China in a move to balance export control, economic interests and national security concerns. But Beijing has yet to approve its domestic sale.\nZhang, 59, an Nvidia veteran and former China market general manager who left to found Moore Threads in 2020, acknowledged that local AI developers had previously hesitated to use domestic chips to train their AI models, fearing subpar outcomes.\n\"But now we can confidently say that if you previously used Hopper [chips], switching to our new product for your large language models will yield better results,\" he said.\n\nStory Continues\nMoore Threads also launched Lushan, a new chip focusing on high-performance graphics processing, which could be a boon for China's high-end gamers.\nZhang claimed that the Lushan chip provided 15 times higher gaming performance for triple-A games, an unofficial designation for games with large budgets and long development times.\n\nThe two chips were scheduled to go into mass production next year, Zhang said.\nThe chips were built on Huagang, Moore Thread's next generation of graphics processing unit architecture, which provided a 10 per cent better performance compared with the previous generation, he said.\nOther products announced at the event included a KUAE computing cluster that supports the interconnection of tens of thousands of chips for training large AI models.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP) , the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Of the 64 analysts surveyed by S&P Global (NYSE: SPGI) in December who cover Nvidia, 60 rated the stock as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\"\nSurging demand for the company's chips has driven Nvidia's share price up by around 30% this year. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock reflects a potential upside of 44% – an impressive gain. However, another artificial intelligence (AI) stock could soar even more than that in 2026, according to one Wall Street analyst.\nOn the rise? In November, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis raised his price target for ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON) from $68 to $80. This represents a 47% increase from the chipmaker's share price at the market close on Dec. 18, 2025.\nLipacis's outlook also suggests a significantly better performance for Onsemi than it has delivered in 2025. The stock is down by a double-digit percentage year-to-date.\n\nGranted, not every Wall Street analyst is as upbeat about Onsemi as Evercore ISI. The average price target for the stock reflects a potential upside of only 9%. Lipacis's $80 price target for Onsemi is the highest on Wall Street.\nAlso, fewer than half of the analysts surveyed by S&P Global (15 out of 34) rated Onsemi as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\" Eighteen analysts recommended holding the stock, while one advised investors to sell it.\nWhy ON Semiconductor could soar in 2026 While Nvidia makes GPUs used in servers that host AI systems, Onsemi develops intelligent power and sensing technology. The company's products are used in data centers, automobiles – especially electric vehicles (EVs), industrial facilities, energy infrastructure, and other applications.\nThe company has significant growth opportunities. Onsemi estimates its total addressable market to be $44 billion, with this market expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 18%.\n\nOnsemi's launch of its new vertical gallium nitride (vGaN) power semiconductors could help the company capture a larger share of its addressable market. The chips enable higher operating voltages and faster switching. As a result, they can reduce energy loss by up to 50%. These attributes should make the company's vGaN semiconductors especially attractive to customers operating AI data centers.\n\nStory continues\nThe recent acquisition by Onsemi of Aura Semiconductor's Vcore power technologies could also boost growth next year. Onsemi CEO Hassane El-Khoury said in the company's third-quarter earnings call that Vcore should help \"close key gaps\" in the solutions offered for next-generation AI data centers.\n\nWill this AI stock really soar by 47% in 2026? Evercore ISI's view about Onsemi seems too bullish to me. The company definitely has some work to do. Onsemi's Q3 revenue fell 12% year over year. Its diluted earnings per share sank by 32%.\nManagement expects to increase revenue by a CAGR of 10% to 12% by 2027. While that's three times the growth of the semiconductor industry, it's not all that impressive. By comparison, analysts project that Nvidia's revenue will increase by 48% next year.\n\nAlso, the fastest-growing areas of Onsemi's addressable market are projected to be in EVs and charging stations for EVs. But U.S. EV adoption is slowing, according to BloombergNEF. This slowdown is attributed to factors including the rollback of national fuel-economy targets, the removal of specific provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that promote EVs, and the potential restriction of California's ability to establish state-specific air quality standards.\nThe good news is that Onsemi's valuation is reasonable. Shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18.5. But is this forward earnings multiple low enough to attract investors en masse? Probably not.\nI think that the consensus Wall Street view of a modest gain for Onsemi in 2026 seems more realistic than Evercore ISI's projection of a 47% surge. For what it's worth, though, I suspect analysts' predictions that Nvidia will soar by 44% could also be overly optimistic.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ON Semiconductor right now?

      "Content": "What Is the Best Quantum Computing Stock Billionaire Investors Are Buying Right Now?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nGOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points The most popular quantum computing stocks include pure plays like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum.\nSeveral \"Magnificent Seven\" companies are also exploring the benefits of quantum artificial intelligence (AI).\nInstitutional investors poured into Alphabet stock during the third quarter.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nWhen it comes to investing in quantum computing stocks, it's natural for pure plays like IonQ , Rigetti Computing , or D-Wave Quantum to surface first in the conversation. What investors may not fully realize, however, is that a number of megacap tech companies are also exploring the advantages of quantum artificial intelligence (AI).\nFor instance, cloud hyperscalers Microsoft and Amazon have each designed their own quantum chips. Meanwhile, Nvidia offers a suite of software platforms that can be used in hybrid environments featuring classical and quantum computing.\nWhen it comes to the best quantum computing stock, though, billionaire investors seem to have a clear winner. According to 13F filings from the third quarter, a number of high-caliber institutional investors have been pouring into Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\n\nStanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office initiated a position in Alphabet, buying 102,200 shares.\nIsrael Englander's fund, Millennium Management, increased its position in the company by 66%, adding 1.4 million shares in the third quarter.\nKen Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, bought 1.2 million shares during the third quarter, increasing his stake by 200%.\nPhilippe Laffont's Coatue Management increased its stake in Alphabet by 259%, purchasing 5.2 million shares.\nMost notably, Warren Buffett added the company to Berkshire Hathaway 's portfolio during the third quarter, buying 17.8 million shares worth roughly $4.3 billion.\nLet's explore how Alphabet is quietly disrupting the quantum computing landscape. From there, I'll also break down how the technology fits into the company's broader ambitions in the AI market.\nHow is Alphabet investing in quantum computing? Google Quantum AI is the laboratory responsible for leading Alphabet's quantum computing efforts.\nThe company's Willow chip focuses on building scalable, error-correcting systems that specialize in solving complex problems that today's supercomputers simply cannot process.\nIt also released Cirq, a software tool kit that allows developers to research and refine quantum algorithms.\n\nThe real reason billionaires love Alphabet Alphabet is far more than an internet business. While advertising revenue from Google and YouTube is the company's crown jewel, management has quietly integrated new AI services across its entire business.\n\nStory Continues\nToday, users can leverage Alphabet's large language model (LLM), Gemini, on the Google Search homepage, as well as through the company's Android devices.\nGoogle Cloud is also one of the fastest growing and most profitable segments of Alphabet's business, proving it can compete with incumbents like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. A potentially lucrative component of Google Cloud that is yet to be fully launched is the commercialization of Alphabet's custom chips, called tensor processing units (TPUs).\n\nCompanies including Apple and Anthropic have already trained AI models using TPUs, and rumor has it that Meta Platforms is eyeing these custom chips for its next-generation of AI products.\nAlphabet has masterfully stitched AI across the broader fabric of its ecosystem -- in search, advertising, cloud computing, consumer electronics, hardware, and even autonomous driving through Waymo.\nIn technical terms, Alphabet has vertically integrated its various assets, positioning it to remain resilient during just about any economic cycle and making its revenue and profitability profile especially durable.\nWhy Alphabet stock looks like a screaming buy heading into 2026 The takeaway from the details above is that quantum computing represents yet another piece of the foundation in Alphabet's broader AI pyramid. It's not commercially available today, but I see Google Quantum as a pillar of Alphabet's next wave of AI products that can be seamlessly integrated within the company's existing architecture.\nAs the graph above illustrates, Alphabet stock has been soaring lately. As a result, the company's valuation has become quite extended. While a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 29 isn't exactly cheap, I still see the stock as a compelling buy right now.\nTo me, the caliber of institutional capital flowing toward it at the moment is unrivaled. Despite the momentum, I see Alphabet's valuation as reasonable relative to the company's long-term upside.\n\nIn my view, the combination of the company's existing AI ecosystem and the upside of quantum computing make it unique in an otherwise frothy and fiercely competitive market. For these reasons, I see Alphabet as a screaming buy as 2026 approaches.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "1 Big Reason Why Today's Value Investors Won't Find Tomorrow's Nvidia\n\nJon Quast, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 7:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Nvidia had an above-average valuation right before the stock went up by 3,000%.\nInvestors must not neglect to look toward the future when investing in stocks.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nIn his 1992 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, said, \"We think the very term 'value investing' is redundant.\" In other words, seeking value is the only way to invest. Given Buffett's affinity for value investing and his incredible success over the years, many investors seek to emulate his approach to stocks.\nUnfortunately, most value investors miss the forest for the trees. And I'll explain how by using Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- the best-performing large-cap stock of the past decade -- as an example.\nYes, I know it's a cherry-picked example. But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way. It's important to recognize the misconception that holds investors back from life-changing opportunities.\nWhy value investors missed Nvidia Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks. And cheapness is measured by comparing the value of the company with something from its financial results, including profits.\nLet's say a company is valued at $50 billion and only has $50 million in net income. This stock would be valued at 1,000 times its earnings. In other words, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (a popular valuation metric) would be 1,000. Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.\nIn 2019, Nvidia's market cap, the value of the company, was around $100 billion. But its average P/E ratio for the year was 35, as the chart below shows.\nThe average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is somewhere around 25. Anything above that has an above-average valuation and is considered expensive by value investors. Nvidia in 2019, therefore, would have been too pricey to buy.\nValue investors believe that the best value stocks to buy trade at a P/E ratio below the average. And often, value investors think that the cheaper a stock is, the better.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has gone on to outperform virtually every other publicly traded company since the start of 2020, despite having an above-average P/E ratio. In short, value investing, as traditionally approached, prevented some investors from buying one of the greatest stocks of our time.\nHow to improve the value mindset There's another important quote from Buffett that needs to be considered here. In the same letter, he wrote, \"Growth is always a component in the calculation of value.\" In other words, value investors must look ahead when looking for a bargain.\n\nStory Continues\nHerein lies the problem with value investing as it's usually done: The P/E ratio (and others) measures past results. But investors must buy stocks today, looking ahead to what the business results could be tomorrow.\nReturning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019. But the P/E ratio didn't reflect the company's superb future earnings growth. As the chart below shows, the stock price is up nearly 3,000% in the last five years, but its earnings per share (EPS) are up even more than that.\nNvidia has earned $100 billion in net income over the past year. The stock traded at 35 times trailing earnings in 2019, which looked expensive. But for those with foresight, the entire value of the company then was equal to its profits right now, which is about as cheap as a stock could possibly be.\n\nOn a personal note, I missed Nvidia stock in 2019, not because of its pricey P/E ratio, but rather because I didn't foresee earnings growth of this magnitude. I didn't believe that the current build-out for AI infrastructure would be so big and last for so long. And in a traditionally cyclical space, I worried that overestimating demand would lead to lower margins at Nvidia.\nI was dead wrong, and that underscores why investing is hard. Looking at a P/E ratio or a market cap is easy. Predicting where the world is going, how a company is positioned, and what that means financially is a tall order. It's why even the best investors often make mistakes.\nThe takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability. The best stocks for the next 10 years might not look like value stocks right now. But they will be a tremendous value in hindsight.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Should You Buy Nvidia Before Jan. 6, 2026?\n\nAdria Cimino, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points Nvidia has delivered gains to investors this year and over time.\nThe company has built a leading position in the area of AI, and that’s driven enormous growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has proven its status as an artificial intelligence (AI) winner over a variety of time periods -- from the short term to the long term. For example, it's climbed about 30% just this year and has soared 1,200% over the past five years. This is thanks to Nvidia's top AI chips, which have conquered the AI market -- they're the fastest around, and this is very valuable for tech giants aiming to win in the AI race.\n\nAll of this makes Nvidia a great buy for any investors interested in betting on the future of AI. But the big question often is: When should you buy? Sometimes, investors look to potential stock price catalysts, such as an earnings report or an event that may renew excitement about the company -- and push the stock price higher. One such occasion is right around the corner, set to begin on Jan. 6. Should you get in on Nvidia beforehand? Let's find out.\nNvidia's rivals First, though, let's consider why Nvidia has drawn this much attention -- after all, it's not the only AI chip designer around, as it competes with players including Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom . And even some of Nvidia's own customers, like Amazon , are producing their own chips, so they compete with the chip giant to some degree.\n\nBut, as mentioned, Nvidia sells the world's highest-performance chips as well as an entire portfolio of products and services -- making it almost a one-stop place for AI customers to shop for all of their needs. This has translated into spectacular growth for the company, with revenue and profit reaching record levels quarter after quarter.\nAnd, with AI spending forecast to reach into the trillions of dollars over the coming five years, Nvidia may have plenty of bright days ahead.\nNow, let's consider what's happening as of Jan. 6, and that's a massive consumer electronics show known as CES. It's the opportunity for tech giants to show off their latest innovations as well as make new product announcements.\nThe spotlight on Nvidia Attendees may visit an Nvidia showcase daily from Jan. 6 through Jan. 8 at the event to see more than 20 demos and speak with experts from the company. Nvidia has scheduled special sessions on physical AI, as well as AI in manufacturing, drug discovery, and more. Lenovo 's Tech World also will be unfolding during CES, and Nvidia chief Jensen Huang will be one of the speakers at the event.\n\nStory continues\nSo, could all of this represent a catalyst for Nvidia's stock? I wouldn't expect a major new announcement from Huang since the company recently reported earnings -- on Nov. 19 -- so may not have an update in such a short period of time. And since the focus is on consumer electronics, Huang may not choose this moment to talk about subjects such as Nvidia's presence in China. (After several months of halted sales there due to export controls, the U.S. recently said Nvidia could start selling its H200 chip to China.)\n\nA reminder of Nvidia's AI strengths Still, Nvidia probably will talk about the role of its chips in areas such as robotics and drug discovery, reminding attendees and investors that the potential of the company's products and services doesn't end with the training of AI models. Nvidia's chips will fuel the application of AI to real-world problems, meaning the company's growth could continue at high levels well into the future.\n\nIt's possible that any details about this growth opportunity -- the actual use of AI -- could generate some excitement among investors and push the stock higher. But, as I mentioned, I wouldn't expect significant news from Nvidia, so any gains may be small or even temporary.\nNow, let's get back to our question: Should you buy Nvidia before Jan. 6 to get in on any potential pop in the stock? Not necessarily. As I said, Nvidia isn't likely to deliver game-changing gains during or after this event, so whether you buy the stock today or after the show won't make much difference over the long term.\nThat said, Nvidia still makes an excellent buy for investors looking for an AI winner -- and the great news is you can get in on this stock at your leisure and don't have to rush in at one specific moment to score a win over time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMU\n\nAVGO\n\nAMD\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock has underperformed its peers in the semiconductor space this year.\nThe company's valuation is becoming cheaper despite its historic operating performance.\nNvidia has a number of catalysts going into 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWhen it comes to leading semiconductor stocks, investors don't need to look much further than companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Broadcom , Advanced Micro Devices , Micron Technology , and of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nWhile Nvidia has been the headline act for much of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, shares have lagged its chip peers throughout 2025.\nAs 2026 draws closer, growth investors may be wondering if Nvidia remains a good buy , or if now is the time to rotate capital away from the world's most valuable company and seek new opportunities.\nWhat should Nvidia investors be on the lookout for in 2026? For the last three years, Wall Street's primary focus surrounding Nvidia is the performance of its data center business. This segment accounts for the bulk of Nvidia's revenue and profits, as it captures demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPU).\nThroughout the AI revolution, investors have paid close attention to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's commentary around the company's Hopper and Blackwell GPU architectures. While Blackwell remains an important catalyst for Nvidia, investors should start to pay closer attention to guidance around the upcoming Rubin chips. So far, investors have already gotten a small preview of demand for Rubin.\n\nFor instance, Huang recently noted that Nvidia has a total order backlog of around $500 billion for Blackwell, Rubin, and accompanying networking products. Of note, a portion of this revenue has already been booked, with an estimated $300 billion expected to be recognized during 2026.\nIn addition, Anthropic recently signed a $30 billion compute capacity agreement with Microsoft . As part of the deal, Anthropic will be leveraging clusters of Blackwell and Rubin chips.\nAt a macro level, Goldman Sachs estimates that hyperscalers including Microsoft, Alphabet , Amazon , and Meta Platforms will spend roughly $500 billion on AI capital expenditures (capex) next year. Taking this one step further, McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion opportunity over the next five years.\nAgainst this backdrop, investors should monitor how these secular tailwinds fueling accelerated investment in infrastructure continue to impact Nvidia, being aware that rising infrastructure will impact Nvidia well beyond its core data center operation.\n\nStory Continues\nThroughout next year and beyond, Nvidia's opportunities in adjacent markets, including next-generation CPUs and accelerated computing operating systems, should begin to come into focus as well, thanks to some savvy partnerships with Intel and Palantir Technologies .\nNvidia's valuation trends are getting interesting In the table, I've summarized Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, as of the end of each quarter over the last year.\nMetric\nCurrent\n3Q25\n2Q25\n1Q25\n4Q24\nPrice-to-sales (P/S)\n23.3\n30.2\n29.6\n20.7\n26.4\nForward price-to-earnings (P/E)\n23.4\n31.5\n57.4\n24.8\n28.1\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\nThere are two anomalies that stick out from the data.\nFirst, Nvidia's valuation multiples experienced notable compression during the company's first fiscal quarter of 2025 (ended April 30). This was driven by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, as well as fear that a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek could pose a threat to U.S. dominance in the AI landscape.\n\nThe second theme that's beginning to become more noticeable is that Nvidia's P/S and forward P/E ratios are hovering around the same levels as their prior lows earlier this year. Once again, I think this contraction revolves around fear more than anything else. Specifically, investors are concerned about rising competition from AMD and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from Broadcom.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy heading into the new year? While rising competition in the chip space is a very real thing, I don't see Nvidia necessarily losing its grip anytime soon. AI infrastructure is expected to be a multitrillion-dollar market that lasts several years. Buying into the idea that the hyperscalers will migrate away from Nvidia's GPUs overnight is unrealistic.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is becoming cheaper by the day despite the company operating at historic levels and signing new deals and partnerships -- effectively broadening its total addressable market (TAM) beyond data center services and simultaneously bringing new levels of business visibility as the AI infrastructure era kicks off.\nI think now is a great time to buy the dip and capitalize on the chip king's ongoing sell-off. Investors with a long-term time horizon could use the recent depressed price action to add to a core buy-and-hold position. Given these dynamics, I see Nvidia as a no-brainer heading into the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "CoreWeave Stock Soars: Time to Buy?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 12:11 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRWV\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points CoreWeave is riding a surge in demand for AI compute.\nThe company must spend and borrow heavily to keep up with its soaring backlog.\nThe stock's valuation leaves very little room for execution missteps.\n10 stocks we like better than CoreWeave ›\nCoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) shares jumped on Friday, after Citigroup analysts gave the AI (artificial intelligence) computing stock a buy rating and a 12-month price target of $192 -- far ahead of where the stock is trading now (even after its nearly 23% jump on Friday).\n\nWhile CoreWeave bulls undoubtedly appreciate the big move higher, nothing has changed in the underlying business. CoreWeave's core problem remains: It will likely need to spend an extraordinary amount of capital before it can prove it can produce substantial and durable profits that live up to its valuation.\nThe tech company, which runs data centers packed with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and sells that computing power to AI labs and hyperscalers that want to train and run large and powerful AI models, has seen explosive demand. Of course, the challenge is translating that demand into revenue and, ultimately, into profits.\nDemand keeps outrunning capacity CoreWeave's latest quarter shows both the pull and the limits of its business expansion. In its third-quarter 2025 update, CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator pointed to record-breaking revenue and a near-doubling of its revenue backlog sequentially. Revenue for the period came in at $1.365 billion, up 134% year over year, while revenue backlog stood at an astounding $55.6 billion as of Sept. 30 (up from $30.1 billion just three months earlier.\n\nWith a backlog that is far in excess of its quarterly limits, the company will undoubtedly strive to grow as fast as it possibly can. But there are limits to how fast a company can grow -- especially in a capital-intensive business like AI infrastructure.\nIndeed, growth is already cooling from an extreme pace. CoreWeave's revenue growth decelerated from 207% year over year in Q2. That does not automatically mean something is wrong, but the slowdown matters because investors will likely value this business on how long its breakneck pace of growth can persist. In addition, this deceleration highlights some of the risks to the timeline of CoreWeave's buildout.\nSpending and debt CoreWeave's income statement shows why investors should stay cautious even after the stock's momentum late last week. The company posted third-quarter operating income of $51.9 million; but it still reported a net loss of $110.1 million. Interest expense is the big culprit: CoreWeave's net interest expense for the quarter was $310.6 million -- up from $104.4 million in the year-ago quarter as the company takes on debt to finance its expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nAnd CoreWeave's financing burden is not going away anytime soon. Growing into its backlog will require a lot more hardware and power. CoreWeave reported $1.9 billion of capital expenditures in the third quarter alone, and it guided to $12 billion to $14 billion of capital expenditures for full-year 2025.\n\nOf course, debt isn't the only way to raise money. But when the company isn't securing debt to finance its buildout, it is diluting shareholders through equity sales. Either way, there are risks to shareholder returns involved.\nHighlighting just how capital-hungry CoreWeave is, the company has secured $14 billion in debt and equity transactions year to date.\nTime to buy? For CoreWeave, execution is what matters. The company will need to bring new sites online on schedule, filling them with contracted demand, and do so without its cost of capital rising faster than its operating income.\nWe're already seeing some risks in execution. In its third-quarter update, management flagged that a third-party data center developer fell behind schedule, negatively affecting the company's fourth-quarter outlook.\n\nOf course, we can't rule out the possibility that CoreWeave will turn into a long-term winner in the fast-growing AI infrastructure space. For now, the company's soaring backlog suggests customers are desperate for capacity from the company. Still, risks seem to be building just as fast as revenue.\nSo, is the growth stock a buy today? With shares trading at a price-to-sales ratio of almost 10, even as interest expense is soaring and the company remains unprofitable, I personally think that waiting for a more attractive entry point makes sense. Sure, there's no guarantee we'll see a more attractive entry point. But instead of buying into the hype, I'd rather patiently wait for a potentially lower price that better balances risks with the potential reward.\n\nShould you buy stock in CoreWeave right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Is All Set to Hit a $5 Trillion Market Cap in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \" Magnificent Seven \" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\nAI is set to accelerate Microsoft's growth There is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.\n\nStory Continues\nFrom cloud computing to personal computing to productivity tools, Microsoft has infused AI across all of its business segments. The good part is that its AI tools are gaining traction among customers. For example, Microsoft management remarked on the company's October earnings conference call that Copilot, its chat-based AI assistant, is now being used by 90% of the Fortune 500 companies.\n\nEven better, Microsoft says that a \"large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more seats.\" Even coders and cybersecurity specialists are using Microsoft's Copilot to enhance productivity and improve the effectiveness of their tools. So, it won't be surprising to see Microsoft cornering a bigger share of the office productivity tools market in the long run, as compared to its current share of 30%.\nOn the other hand, the demand for Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure is outpacing supply. This explains why Microsoft intends to double its data center capacity over the next couple of years to support the rapidly growing demand from customers looking to build AI tools on its platform.\nIt is worth noting that Microsoft's commercial remaining performance obligations (RPO) stood at a massive $392 billion at the end of the previous quarter, up by 51% from the prior year. This metric refers to the total value of contracts yet to be fulfilled. The size of Microsoft's RPO is larger than the $294 billion revenue it recorded in the trailing 12 months. Additionally, its RPO grew at a faster pace than the 18% revenue jump Microsoft recorded last quarter, indicating that it is winning new business at a faster rate than it is fulfilling existing contracts.\n\nAs such, don't be surprised to see Microsoft's growth accelerating in 2026, putting the tech giant on track to attain a $5 trillion market cap.\nHere's how it can reach that milestone Microsoft currently has a market cap of $3.6 trillion. So, it needs to appreciate by another 41% from current levels to reach the $5 trillion milestone. Analysts expect a 16% jump in Microsoft's revenue in the current fiscal year to $327 billion, followed by a 15% increase in the next one to $376 billion.\n\nHowever, Microsoft's massive RPO and the pace of growth in this metric indicate that it could outpace those expectations. Assuming Microsoft's revenue grows by 20% in the next fiscal year to $392 billion (from this year's estimated revenue of $327 billion) and it trades at 13 times sales at that time, in line with its current price-to-sales ratio, its market cap will land at just over $5 trillion.\nSo, this AI stock seems poised to deliver healthy gains in the coming year, which is why investors may consider adding it to their buy list for the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

      "Content": "Why Micron Stock Can Continue to Soar\n\nJon Quast, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:39 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points The data center boom and the push toward agentic AI are giving Micron a tailwind unlike any it's ever experienced.\nAs with Nvidia in recent years, strong customer demand is lifting profit margins beyond belief.\n10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology ›\nIt took computer memory company Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) 20 years to regain the highs it had achieved during the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century. But since finally hitting a new all-time high again in 2021, Micron's stock has continued to soar. It is up nearly 400% in just the last three years.\nWith the shares soaring to new highs, investors are clearly enthusiastic. But on Dec. 17, the company reported financial results for its fiscal first quarter of 2026. And it turns out that investors actually may not be enthusiastic enough.\nThe business trends are so favorable for the company right now that investors may be underappreciating its potential over the next three to five years. And it's why Micron stock could still enjoy some more upside from here.\nThe big-picture trend Investors tend to be cautious about buying Micron Technology stock because it's a historically cyclical business. The chart below illustrates the fluctuations from 2005 to 2020.\nIf the boom-and-bust financials continue, then this entire discussion falls apart. However, a significant trend is currently underway that may finally help Micron's stock break free from its historical cyclicality.\nThe secular trend is artificial intelligence (AI), of course. Investors have heard plenty about it in recent years, but there is a lot of work still to be done to build out the AI infrastructure needed to achieve the goals laid out by tech giants.\n\nThese major tech companies are building new data centers and filling them with graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia . These GPUs supply the computing power needed to do useful things with AI. However, there is much more to the AI technology stack than just GPUs.\nIt has thus far centered on generative AI. In these applications, the models find generalities from large data sets and use them to create new things. But generative AI is starting to take a back seat to agentic AI. And this is fueling new hardware needs in data centers.\nThe shift to agentic AI -- where it is working on behalf of the user in a more active and personalized way -- requires more computer memory than before. And it's why computer memory businesses have more demand than they can handle right now.\n\nWhy Micron is suddenly a hot business For the first quarter, Micron's revenue was up a stunning 57% year over year and more than 20% just from the previous quarter. And this isn't a one-off; it could be the new normal.\n\nStory Continues\nFor the fiscal second quarter of 2026, management is guiding for revenue of $18.7 billion. If it hits this target, it would be a 132% year-over-year increase, within reach of its all-time fastest growth that occurred back in the dot-com bubble.\nOne of the things driving this growth is demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM). The AI trend doesn't only need memory, it also needs fast memory. And Micron is a market leader in HBM.\n\nAccording to management, the HBM market is expected to triple from 2025 through 2028. In other words, demand for Micron's hottest product should soar over the next three years. Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that the company has already sold out its supply for 2026, and discussions with its customers for subsequent years' orders are also underway.\nIn past cycles, it has had too much supply when demand tapered off, leading to lower profit margins. But that's been true of many semiconductor players, including makers of GPUs. This time, the AI trends have sustained GPU demand far better than many expected.\nNvidia's chart below demonstrates what can happen when demand exceeds supply by a large margin for a long time: Its profit margins are 60% higher than its 10-year average.\nDon't look now, but a similar trend appears to be underway with Micron. In the first quarter, the company achieved a profit margin of 38%. For perspective, its 10-year average profit margin is 14%, according to YCharts. And for the second quarter, management expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.19. That's more than the company has made in most years of its existence.\n\nIf revenue continues to grow over the next three years, as management has commented, the company could enjoy unprecedented profitability. For this reason, I believe Micron stock can keep soaring, even after jumping by so much in recent years.\nShould you buy stock in Micron Technology right now? Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Should You Buy Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks In 2026?\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft have struggled in the last few months, bringing their valuations down with them.\nOther AI stocks like Amazon still look cheaper at today's prices.\nCyclicality risks should keep investors away from Nvidia stock in 2026. Amazon looks like a better buy.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence ( AI ) trade began to sputter in late 2025. Stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are flat since August of this year after seemingly going up at an insatiable rate for three straight years. Similar results have occurred for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shareholders, with its stock actually down over the last six months.\nInvestors have begun to lose faith in the growth-at-any-cost mindset among these AI start-ups even though underlying revenue growth is still strong for the sector.\nDoes that make now a perfect time to buy AI stocks for 2026? Let's take a look at the numbers and find out.\nHigh multiples and fast-growing businesses Stagnant share prices have helped some of the fundamentals for these AI stocks catch up to their share prices. Last quarter, Nvidia's revenue grew 62% year over year to $57 billion, with net income up 65% to $31.9 billion. Microsoft's revenue was up 18%, with 24% growth in operating income.\nAI companies are still paying big paychecks to buy Nvidia's advanced computer chips or to utilize them in AI data centers run by cloud providers such as Microsoft. OpenAI is the leader in AI spending, with commitments in the hundreds of billions of dollars across various sources. A lot of this spending will go to Nvidia computer chips.\n\nStill, even with soaring earnings, both Microsoft and Nvidia (two of the largest companies in the world by market cap) do not have dirt cheap earnings ratios. Nvidia has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 44, while Microsoft's is 34. If earnings keep growing quickly, these ratios will come down in a hurry, but it puts high expectations on future growth.\nMore exposure to AI and cyclicality than others Booming spending in any industry can lead to supply gluts. This has happened in the computer chip space many times throughout history, as well as in other infrastructure build-outs like telecommunications and railroads.\nDon't ignore this risk with the AI winners like Nvidia. There is a major downside risk to Nvidia's earnings power if the company's revenue growth declines along with its profit margin, a double whammy to net income.\n\nSome stocks are more exposed to the AI trade than others, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, or Oracle . Others have been less aggressive on spending or winning contracts, such as Amazon , and are therefore less at risk to an AI or computer chip spending downcycle. With a P/E ratio of 31, Amazon's valuation is lower based on its trailing earnings as well.\n\nStory Continues\nDon't ask whether you should buy AI stocks Investors shouldn't ask whether they should buy AI stocks, as there are dozens, if not hundreds, of stocks exposed to the AI trade, all with different stories and valuations. You have direct beneficiaries such as Nvidia that may be a risky bet right now, or even wilder companies like CoreWeave , laden with debt.\n\nDon't ask if you should buy AI stocks. Ask which AI stocks you should buy today. Amazon looks like a good candidate at today's prices because of its lower P/E ratio, dual growth engines from cloud computing and e-commerce, as well as its growing relationship with start-up Anthropic. Amazon has not gotten as much enthusiasm from Wall Street in 2025, which just might make it a good pick for 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "A Signal Seen Only Once Before: History’s Forecast for the S&P 500’s Next Move\n\nDavid Beren\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 7:19 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nWith the S&P 500 delivering double-digit growth in both 2023 and 2024, we're on track to do something similar as we head into the last week of December 2025. For investors who have been enjoying these gains, this feels a little bit like validation for their willingness to hold on in what has been easily considered a volatile market.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio crossed 40 for only the second time in history. The first occurrence was at the 1999 dot-com peak.\nAfter the CAPE ratio exceeded 40 in 1999, the S&P 500 declined 37% over the next two years.\nThe S&P 500 has delivered three consecutive years of double-digit returns totaling 26% in 2023 and 23% in 2024.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIf you are on the sidelines, you very well might be feeling like you have missed out on one of the best market runs in recent history. No matter which of these two sides you are on, there is something hidden underneath all of this celebration, as a rare market signal has come to the surface. Having only appeared once before, it carries a warning that every investor needs to understand.\nWhile history doesn't always repeat itself, it does sometimes follow very similar patterns, and this means you should be well aware of what happened the last time the market sustained this kind of strong momentum.\nAI and Easy Rates: The Engine Behind Double-Digit S&P 500 Gains Almost without question, the primary fuel for this multi-year period has been a sense of overwhelming optimism around artificial intelligence and a shift toward an easier interest rate environment. Investors have been pouring capital into mega-cap technology leaders like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA) and betting that AI is going to fundamentally reshape global productivity in the very same manner that the internet did almost two decades ago.\n\nThis sense of enthusiasm has driven the S&P 500 to a 26% gain in 2023 and a similarly strong return of 23% in 2024. With just over a week left of trading days in 2025, the double-digit ascent three years in a row is all but a sure thing. Beyond the conversation around AI, the Federal Reserve's pivot toward lower interest rates has also acted as something of a significant tailwind for stock valuations. By proactively cutting rates three times since 2024, the central bank of the United States has lowered borrowing costs and has helped reinforce the argument around a \"soft landing\" scenario for investors.\n\nStory Continues\nThis combination of innovation in the tech space and supportive liquidity has created a market that has essentially ignored what would otherwise be traditional headwinds. Instead, it's pushing indexes to record highs even as concerns about valuation, especially in the tech space, begin to surface in the broader financial community.\n\nThe Once-in-a-Lifetime Market Signal and Investor Problem The extraordinary run investors have been enjoying has now resulted in a market signal that has only been seen once before. This signal is that the S&P Shiller CAPE ratio (Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings) has crossed the 40 threshold. This metric, which measures the index's price against its average inflation-adjusted earnings over the last ten years, provides a smoothed-out view of market valuation.\n\nThe only other instance in history that we have seen a similar situation was at the very peak of the dot-com bubble in 1999. Between 1995 and 1999, the S&P 500 posted five consecutive years of returns exceeding 20% annually. Understandably, investors were thrilled, and technology, similar to how AI is being viewed today, transformed the economy, and valuations didn't matter because the old rules no longer applied, again, very similar to today.\nIf you are an everyday investor, this signal could be cause for concern as the market is currently trading at its second-highest valuation level in over 150 years. Ultimately, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio sitting near 23x, significantly above the 25-year average of 16.3x, the market is considered to be effectively priced for perfection. When valuations are this stretched, even a minor disappointment in corporate earnings or a Fed policy shift can trigger a sharp downturn. This results in investors being in somewhat of a precarious position where they must decide if the risk is worth the reward.\n\nThe problem really isn't that the market is overvalued by any single metric, and markets can stay expensive for years. The problem is that after three consecutive years of double-digit gains, we're in a market scenario that has very little room for any errors.\nAnalyzing the Precedent: What History Says Comes Next For better or worse, history does give us a pretty clear and almost sobering forecast of what has typically followed such an extreme valuation peak. After the Shiller CAPE ratio passed 40 toward the end of 1999, the S&P 500 entered a multi-year decline, and the market lost roughly 37% of its value between December 1999 and December 2001.\n\nHistorical averages also show that once the market records a monthly CAPE ratio above 39, the index has typically declined an average of 4% over the next year and as much as 30% over a three-year horizon. On the plus side, there are some analysts who believe the current bull market still has some runway to keep growing due to the robust AI infrastructure spending and healthy corporate margins. Still, all of the signals point to a sense of overwhelming caution.\nIn every prior instance where the Shiller CAPE has topped 30, it was eventually followed by a significant drawdown that ranged from 20% to as high as 89%, both of which are not good for investors. It's for this reason that the modern investor should heed this signal as a reminder that the underlying technology around AI might be truly transformative, but that the price being paid for this future is entering a market zone that has historically been preceded by some of the most difficult market periods for equity returns.\n\nWhat Investors Should Do Right Now Does this mean a crash is inevitable in 2026 or 2027? Not necessarily, as market conditions today are different in pretty substantial ways from years prior. Most importantly, corporate earnings are stronger and more broadly distributed, while AI is actually generating real revenue and not just the promise of revenue. Separately, the economy, while slowing, hasn't fallen into recession.\n\nUltimately, the comparison isn't trying to predict an exact repeat of 1999, but about recognizing that the same kind of momentum as that period creates very specific risks. This said, for investors that are heavily concentrated in mega-cap tech stocks, now is the time to diversify. The stocks that have been leading this current rally are also some of the most vulnerable if there is a sentiment shift.\nThe idea would be to take some profits that have been made out of tech and rotate them into dividend-paying stocks, international equities, or defensive sectors that can reduce exposure without abandoning the idea of growth entirely. Any concerns should be especially true for retirees, who should be particularly cautious as locking in some gains and shifting toward income-generating assets will protect against the desire to panic sell down the road.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "This Glorious Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Has Crushed Nvidia and Broadcom With 147% Returns in 2025. It Can Jump by 111% in 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 7:05 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nCIEN\n\nKey Points Ciena is taking off due to growing demand for high-speed data transmission in data centers.\nIts latest results demonstrate that it's on track to achieve healthy revenue and earnings growth.\nThe stock's valuation suggests it has room for more upside despite rising impressively in 2025.\n10 stocks we like better than Ciena ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) are among the leading names in the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware space. Their chips are deployed in massive numbers by cloud computing companies, hyperscalers, and AI companies for AI model training and inference.\nNot surprisingly, both Broadcom and Nvidia have been witnessing remarkable growth lately. Nvidia reported an impressive 62% jump in revenue last month for the third quarter of its fiscal 2026 (ended on Oct. 26, 2025) to $57 billion. Even Broadcom just reported a solid 28% year-over-year increase in revenue for its latest quarter, driven by a terrific year-over-year jump of 74% in AI revenue.\nThese solid results explain why their shares are up nicely in 2025. While Broadcom stock has jumped 47% this year, Nvidia is sitting on respectable gains of 32%. The good part is that both companies still have a lot of room for growth, but their expensive valuations could limit their upside in 2026.\nHowever, there's one AI infrastructure play that's significantly cheaper than both Nvidia and Broadcom, despite soaring a stunning 147% this year: Ciena (NYSE: CIEN) . Let's see why this company could continue to outperform Nvidia and Broadcom in 2026.\nCiena's growth is set to accelerate in 2026 While Broadcom and Nvidia make AI processors that help train large language models (LLMs) and run AI inference applications, Ciena's optical networking components and software ensure that their chips can perform optimally. After all, Ciena's products, which include routers and switches, ensure high-speed data transmission over fiber networks.\n\nIts offerings are used in data centers, telecom networks, and cloud computing to move massive amounts of data quickly over long distances. This explains why Ciena has been witnessing healthy growth lately. The company released its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results (for the three months ended Nov. 1) on Dec. 11.\nCiena reported a 20% increase in revenue from the year-ago period to $1.35 billion. Its non-GAAP earnings jumped by a much stronger pace of 68% from the year-ago quarter, driven by an improvement in the top line as well as a stronger mix of software sales. More importantly, Ciena is expecting its revenue growth to accelerate in the current quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nIt anticipates a 30% year-over-year increase in revenue at the midpoint to $1.39 billion. Ciena management remarked on the latest earnings conference call that it is now experiencing stronger demand for its networking products from Meta Platforms , which is going to contribute toward the bigger jump in its top line.\n\nMeta is going to deploy Ciena's solutions in \"multiple new data centers.\" Ciena management also added that it is \"engaged in advanced technical discussions with additional hyperscalers\" to supply its data communications products in their data centers. So there is a possibility of Ciena's revenue growing at a faster pace than the 24% increase that it is currently expecting for fiscal 2026 to $5.9 billion.\nThe company's top line jumped by 19% last year, and the guidance for the first quarter suggests that it could easily overhaul its full-year forecast. Importantly, Ciena can sustain the acceleration in its growth in the long run as well. That's because AI data centers reportedly require five times more optical connections as compared to traditional data centers.\nThe size of the AI data center market is poised to grow at an annual rate of 27% through 2032. This explains why analysts have become more bullish about Ciena's prospects.\nThey are forecasting its top-line growth to filter down to the bottom line as well, and expect the company to witness stronger earnings growth thanks to a potential improvement in its margin profile.\nThe strong growth in the company's top and bottom lines could send the stock soaring in 2026 and beyond. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising to see it outperforming both Nvidia and Broadcom in the new year as well.\nThis networking stock could keep crushing the AI infrastructure stalwarts We have already seen that Ciena's fiscal first-quarter revenue is on track to increase by 30% from the year-ago period. Though the company's fiscal 2026 revenue growth guidance of 24% is lower than what it expects to achieve in the current quarter, there is a chance that it could exceed expectations for the full year.\n\nCiena received $7.8 billion worth of orders in the previous fiscal year, which exceeded its annual revenue of $4.8 billion by a big margin. It ended fiscal 2025 with a revenue backlog of $5 billion, pointing out that this figure \"supports a large share of our fiscal 2026 revenue expectations.\" Ciena's impressive backlog and its negotiations with other hyperscalers suggest that the company is on track to exceed the $5.9 billion revenue estimate for fiscal 2026.\nAssuming it can consistently maintain a 30% growth rate throughout the year, its top line could hit $6.25 billion (based on the fiscal 2025 revenue of $4.8 billion). Ciena is currently trading at just 6.4 times sales, which is significantly lower than the two other AI stocks discussed in this article.\nThe U.S. technology sector trades at an average price-to-sales ratio of 8.7. If the market rewards Ciena with a premium valuation owing to its accelerating growth, and it trades at even 10 times sales after a year, its market cap could jump to $62.5 billion (based on the $6.25 billion revenue it could generate this year).

      "Content": "The Ultimate Stock to Buy for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 6:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points When it comes to making chips, all major computing companies turn to Taiwan Semiconductor.\nIts chip fabrication business provides the critical production capacity needed by the industry.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is launching a new technology that could solve the energy crisis.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nFinding the ultimate stock to buy for 2026 is no easy task. First, you have to address whether the stock will come from an AI-related field or not. There are growing fears of an AI bubble forming, but those fears are negated by real money being spent by the AI hyperscalers, who are racing to build out as much computing capacity as possible. I think one of the best stocks to buy for 2026 comes from this industry, and it's a key supplier.\nWhile I'll entertain an argument of whether Nvidia 's dominance is slipping, what isn't up for debate is how much is being spent on AI infrastructure. After setting records in 2025, the AI hypercalers look to be setting a new record on data center capital expenditures again in 2026. There are several companies positioned to take advantage of that buildout, but none is in a better spot than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a neutral party in the AI arms race Taiwan Semiconductor is a chip fabrication business and sells its production capacity to various companies in the chip realm. Taiwan Semiconductor is regarded as the top company in its industry, which is why nearly all of the major computing unit designers partner with Taiwan Semiconductor. It doesn't matter if the computing unit being purchased is from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , or Broadcom ; chances are, it has a chip from TSMC in it.\n\nThis places Taiwan Semiconductor in a neutral position, as it benefits from increased spending regardless of which computing unit is the most popular. The trends are clearly in favor of increased data center spending, and that trend isn't expected to slow down anytime soon.\nNvidia believes that the global data center capital expenditures will rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. Not all of that money will flow toward computing, as there are also construction and land costs to consider. AMD offered a similar projection, as they believe the compute market will be worth $1 trillion by 2030. This bodes well for Taiwan Semiconductor, as it will be providing the chips to power most of these data centers.\nHowever, one issue that may hamper the growth of the industry is power capacity. It's no secret that we could be headed for an energy shortage in the near future, and doing everything possible to consume less energy to maximize computing performance is critical.\n\nStory Continues\nTaiwan Semiconductor understands this, which is why its latest technology is focused on improving energy consumption. Its next generation of chips, 2nm (nanometer), promises to consume 25% to 30% less energy when configured for the same speed as its 3nm predecessor. That's a huge jump in efficiency, and may be what's needed to keep the AI buildout going.\n\nThese chips are entering production right now and will boost Taiwan Semiconductor's finances throughout 2026. However, Taiwan Semiconductor is also doing incredibly well right now.\nTSMC provides incredible performance at a low price In its most recent quarter, Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue rose at a 41% pace in U.S. dollar terms, placing it among the fastest-growing big tech stocks. With the AI buildout not expected to slow down anytime soon, Taiwan Semiconductor should be able to keep this growth rate up for several years.\nDespite its strong growth, the stock really doesn't have a premium price tag assigned to it.\nAt 23 times next year's earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor doesn't carry a premium price tag. It is priced lower than its peers, with AMD trading at 32 times next year's earnings, Broadcom at 25, and Nvidia at 24.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is reasonably priced and is slated to deliver impressive growth over the next few years. As a result, I think it's the ultimate stock to buy now, as it's set to benefit regardless of which computing unit the AI hyperscalers are using. All it needs to succeed is for the AI hyperscalers to continue spending heavily, and they are primed to do just that.\n\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Did Nvidia Just Lose Its Spot as Wall Street’s AI Chip Darling? JPMorgan Says This ‘Overall Top Pick’ Is Better.\n\nJustin Estes\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAMD\n\nIf someone asked you to name a large AI chip manufacturer, you’d probably say Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), or maybe Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Your first thought probably wouldn’t be Broadcom (AVGO).\nBut Broadcom is actually a giant in the AI hyperscaler space with a $1.6 trillion market cap. Up 54% over the past year, the company has found defining success by pursuing only seven to 10 main customers who need billion-dollar buildouts rather than chasing many small $10 million contracts.\n\nMore News from Barchart 5 \"Best of the Best\" Dividend Stocks to Own in 2026\nThis 1 Lesser-Known Stock Is Set to Dominate with Nvidia and Broadcom in 2026\nNike, Tilray, and Palantir: Their Unusually Active Put Options Will Boost Your Wallet After Christmas\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nThat strategy is paying off in a major way. Broadcom reported an AI order backlog of $73 billion to be delivered over the next six quarters, with management expecting that figure to continue growing as new orders roll in.\nJPMorgan recently raised its price target on the stock and maintained its “Overweight” rating, calling the recent dip a buying opportunity. So what exactly does Broadcom do, and why are Wall Street’s biggest investors loading up on shares?\nWhat Does Broadcom Do? Broadcom has achieved its success through category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. The company operates two primary business segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.\nOn the semiconductor side, Broadcom is the leader in custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) designed specifically for data center AI workloads.\n\nASICs are specialized chips built to exact specifications for hyperscalers such as Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which need massive computing power.\nThe infrastructure software segment, which includes the VMware acquisition, provides enterprise software for planning, developing, automating, managing, and securing applications across different platforms.\nWith roots in the technical heritage of AT&T/Bell Labs, Lucent, and Hewlett-Packard/Agilent, Broadcom combines more than 60 years of innovation with global scale and engineering depth. The company serves the world’s most successful tech companies by focusing on technologies that connect our world.\nCEO Hock Tan explained the strategy at the Goldman Sachs technology conference: Broadcom is laser-focused on about seven customers building large language models and racing toward what he calls “super intelligence.” These companies are collectively spending around $30 billion annually on AI compute infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nRather than pursuing thousands of enterprise customers who might spend $10 million each on merchant GPUs, Broadcom sees its biggest opportunity in providing custom chips and networking infrastructure for these hyperscalers building AI at unprecedented scale.\nWhy Did JPMorgan Upgrade Broadcom Stock? JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur pointed to the continued surge in capital expenditure by hyperscalers and the consequent rise in demand for ASIC chips as key drivers for Broadcom’s growth.\nBroadcom reported Q4 2025 revenue of $18.02 billion, up 28% year over year. The semiconductor segment jumped 35% to $11.07 billion, while the high-margin infrastructure software segment grew 19% to $6.94 billion.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, Broadcom’s revenue hit $63.9 billion, a 24% increase driven overwhelmingly by AI, which saw revenue grow 65% year-over-year to $20 billion.\nBut here’s where it gets really interesting: Broadcom forecasts its AI business will hit $8.2 billion in Q1 2026 alone, marking roughly 100% year-over-year growth. And Tan revealed that his compensation package tied to 2030 targets includes achieving AI revenue over $120 billion — a sixfold increase from the $20 billion generated in fiscal 2025.\nOne customer prospect turned into over $10 billion in orders expected in the second half of fiscal 2026—a major driver behind this is that Broadcom designs and manufactures Google’s custom TPU chips, a specialized ASIC built specifically for AI tasks rather than general-purpose computing (GPU). Google’s latest TPUv7 chip is performing better than expected and attracting major customers like Anthropic and Meta, with Anthropic alone committing to potentially 1 million units.\n\nWall Street Doubled Down Many investors have been trying to make the most of the AI trade, but when AVGO dipped over 27% in Q1 2025 — hitting a yearly low of $138 in April — that was a green light for some of Wall Street’s most famous money managers.\nThese investors spotted what Michael Burry later articulated in his new Substack: while 40%-50% of hyperscaler spending goes to Nvidia GPUs with “ever shorter product cycles,” Broadcom is positioned differently.\n\nBurry specifically named Broadcom alongside Google, Amazon, and Microsoft as “very well-funded” and capable of challenging Nvidia’s dominance.\nMajor Q1 2025 buyers included:\nJeremy Grantham (GMO): Bought over 1.5 million shares despite calling AI a bubble. His fund holds a $291 million position in Broadcom versus just $21 million in Nvidia — nearly 14x more exposure to AVGO than NVDA.\nRenaissance Technologies: Purchased over 2.4 million shares, massively increasing its stake. Regarded as the most successful hedge fund of all time, Renaissance’s bet signals strong conviction in Broadcom’s differentiated positioning.\nTwo Sigma Advisors: Bought around 2.5 million shares, bringing its total position to 3.9 million shares — the largest holding since Q3 2024 when Broadcom traded at just $159 versus Q1’s average of $211.\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio): Added 280,000 shares, betting that Broadcom’s custom ASIC strategy offers structural advantages over commodity GPU manufacturers.\n\nThe stock has since recovered to around $330. While Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting hit other AI stocks, Broadcom’s $73 billion backlog of multi-year contracts with just 7-10 customers provides revenue certainty that short-cycle GPU sales can’t match.\nIs Broadcom a Buy? Broadcom stock has pulled back from December highs near $415 to around $330. If you’ve been on the sidelines, here are three bullish indicators worth considering:\n1. The structural moat is different. While Nvidia sells commodity GPUs facing shorter product cycles and growing competition, Broadcom has locked in $73 billion in backlog with just 7-10 hyperscaler customers through multi-year custom chip contracts. These aren’t off-the-shelf components that competitors can easily replicate.\n\n2. Wall Street’s smartest money doubled down. Renaissance Technologies, Jeremy Grantham, Two Sigma, and Ray Dalio all bought aggressively when the stock dipped in Q1. Grantham holds 14 times more Broadcom than Nvidia despite calling AI a bubble, betting that custom ASICs offer better risk-adjusted returns than merchant chip sales.\n3. Broadcom (mostly) dodged the Burry selloff. Michael Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting triggered the recent tech selloff, but he specifically named Broadcom as well-positioned to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. The company’s custom chip focus sidesteps the depreciation and replacement cycle concerns hitting pure-play GPU manufacturers.\nThe stock trades at 61x earnings, but with 100% AI revenue growth and signed contracts providing multi-year visibility, Broadcom offers a differentiated AI infrastructure play built on structural advantages rather than pure momentum and hype.\nOn the date of publication, Justin Estes did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

However, viable alternatives are starting to pop up that could challenge Nvidia's dominance. If Nvidia's empire starts to crack, two stocks could soar in its place.\nI think both are excellent buys for 2026 and are primed to soar, even if Nvidia can maintain its superiority.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) , but it doesn't manufacture them. Instead, it farms out that work to a handful of other companies. In the chip manufacturing world, that work primarily goes to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) . Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest chip foundry by revenue , and it has achieved this position through continuous technological innovation and strong production yields.\n\nMany of Nvidia's competitors also source their chips from Taiwan Semiconductor, so if Nvidia's dominance slips, Taiwan Semiconductor will be OK. Additionally, if Nvidia maintains its incredible grip on the artificial intelligence computing market, TSMC will continue to do great. For Taiwan Semiconductor to succeed as an investment, AI hyperscalers need to continue spending at their current rate. If they do, Taiwan Semiconductor will be well-positioned to soar in 2026, as it trades at a discount to the fabless chip companies.\nThe three primary computing unit providers in the AI arms race are Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Nvidia is the largest of all of them, and happens to be the cheapest. But none of these three is cheaper than Taiwan Semiconductor.\nTaiwan Semiconductor trades for 29 times forward earnings. That's a hefty discount to its peers, despite benefiting from the same tailwinds pushing these other stocks higher. I think this low starting valuation will play in its favor during 2026 and will be a key reason why it outperforms Nvidia in 2026.\n\nBroadcom Broadcom is taking a different approach to the AI computing problem than its peers. Instead of creating a broad-purpose GPU like AMD or Nvidia, it's partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to build custom AI accelerators. These computing units aren't designed to handle a wide variety of workloads like a GPU is. Instead, it's designed specifically around the workload that it will see. By doing this, Broadcom can maximize performance while decreasing costs, albeit at the expense of flexibility.\n\nStory Continues\nThese computing units are surging in popularity, and Broadcom's financials reflect that. In Q4 (ending Nov. 2), its AI semiconductor revenue rose 74% year over year. For reference, Nvidia's data center division, which encompasses the GPUs primarily used for AI computing, increased revenue at a 66% pace. Broadcom is growing as a popular option to partner with, and I'd expect that trend to accelerate during 2026.\n\nHowever, Broadcom doesn't just make custom AI accelerator units. It has a whole host of other business units that develop mainframe software and hardware, virtual desktops, cybersecurity solutions, and numerous other products. These divisions slow down Broadcom's overall growth rate, as evidenced by Broadcom's net revenue only rising 28% in Q4.\nThis could be what holds Broadcom's stock back from outperforming in 2026, but if the investment community is excited about Broadcom's AI prospects, it could soar past Nvidia. For Q1, Broadcom expects AI revenue to come in at $8.2 billion -- indicating a double over last year's total. This shows that Broadcom's AI growth rate is accelerating while others are moderating. Investors love to see accelerating growth, and if there is still appetite for AI investment, Broadcom's stock could soar past Nvidia's, especially if Nvidia starts to lose market share to more of Broadcom's custom AI accelerators.\n\nI think both of these companies will do great in 2026, but I also wouldn't count Nvidia out, either. Owning all of these stocks may be a smart idea, as the AI buildout is far from over.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Could This Be the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Right Now?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Nvidia is growing rapidly and shows no signs of slowing.\nNvidia believes global data center capital expenditures could reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout since its start in 2023. There have also been other top performers, such as Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) , which provides artificial intelligence -powered software.\n\nAdditionally, there are the AI hyperscalers that are powering much of the AI computing capacity built out. And even more in the weeds are utility companies delivering the energy needed to power AI, as well as the construction companies building the data centers .\nThe AI investment realm is incredibly wide, and several companies are benefiting from the massive spending spree by the AI hyperscalers. But of all these various companies involved in the AI race, which is the best one to buy now?\nSometimes, the answer is obvious and right in front of you. I think Nvidia is among the best AI stocks to buy right now.\nNvidia is making money right now If you break down each of the AI sectors mentioned above, there are three cohorts. First are the companies that are making money right now. These include the construction companies and computing power providers like Nvidia.\nSecond are the companies that are growing into the AI demand, which include companies like Palantir and energy companies. While both cohorts have experienced strong growth so far, there is still plenty more to come as AI adoption ramps up.\n\nLast are companies that are set to benefit from AI in the future, which include the AI hyperscalers. These businesses are the big AI spenders, and their investments may or may not pay off in the long run.\nAs an investor, I'm focused on the companies that are making money right now. Nvidia is among the best in this category, which makes it an excellent AI stock to buy right now.\nNvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which have powered a large chunk of the AI workloads so far. GPUs can process multiple calculations in parallel, making them perfectly suited for tasks like AI that require extreme computing power.\nNvidia isn't the only GPU provider in the world; there are others with competing products. There are also GPU alternatives that can compete with GPUs in one area but fail as soon as the computing workload isn't optimized for the custom chip. This makes Nvidia's GPUs the most powerful and flexible computing units available, which is why they are the most popular.\n\nStory Continues\nThey are so popular that Nvidia has actually sold out of cloud GPUs. Considering that Nvidia's sales were $57 billion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026 (ended Oct. 26), that's an incredible statement to be sold out. Furthermore, revenue was up 62% year over year, so demand is still rising. Nvidia will continue to push its component providers as fast as possible to accelerate production, as the AI buildout will wait for no company.\n\nThe AI buildout is slated to ramp up in the next few years Although a massive amount has already been spent on data centers, we're just beginning the ramp-up. In 2025, AI hyperscalers spent record amounts on capital expenditures, mostly going toward data center construction. However, these companies have all informed investors that 2026's expenses will be greater than 2025's by a significant margin.\n\nAnd that's just one year in a long-term trend, as Nvidia believes that global data center capital expenditures will rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's incredible growth and shows that the companies involved in the data center buildout realm are slated to experience monster growth over the next few years.\nWith Nvidia already being a successful investment in the past, I think it's primed to continue winning. The stock is also fairly cheap and trades for less than 24 times next year's earnings. That's far cheaper than many of its big tech peers, which should ease investors' concerns for overpaying for Nvidia's stock.\nNvidia's stock is currently down by around 15% from its all-time high, making now a great time to buy shares.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This ETF Trounced the S&P 500 in 2025. Here's Why It Could Do It Again Next Year\n\nJeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 11:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nSMH\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nSPY\n\nKey Points The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has been a top performer over the last decade, and is up about 40% this year.\nPaced by Nvidia, Taiwan Semi, and Broadcom, its holdings are delivering strong revenue growth.\nThe ETF trades at a premium to the S&P 500, but that seems deserved.\n10 stocks we like better than VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF ›\n\nInvesting in an S&P 500 ETF like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF or the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: SPY) can be one of the best financial decisions you make in your lifetime.\nAfter all, the S&P 500 has historically returned an annual average of 9% a year, and the broad-market index even beats most hedge funds most years. With its holdings diversified among the top 500 U.S. stocks, and a quarterly rebalancing to make sure that the collection stays up to date, the S&P 500 has a proven formula to deliver long-term gains.\nHowever, an S&P 500 index fund isn't necessarily the best-performing ETF in a given year, and several ETFs have outperformed in 2025. In fact, one has delivered more than double the S&P 500's gains this year. That's the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH) , which is up 39.5% year-to-date through Dec. 17. The chart below shows how the semiconductor ETF's performance this year compares to the S&P 500.\nIn the third year of the AI boom, semiconductor stocks, led by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , have continued to surge, so perhaps it's not a surprise that the SMH has beaten the S&P 500 by such a wide margin. Let's take a closer look at the VanEck Semiconductor ETF and why it's a good candidate to outperform the S&P 500 again this year.\nWhat's in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF The ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, which is designed to track the overall performance of the semiconductor production and equipment sector.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF's top three holdings include Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , three stocks that have been among the biggest winners in the AI boom and continue to set the pace for the sector.\nAll three stocks are growing briskly heading into 2026. The chart below shows how fast revenue growth has been for all three companies over the last year.\nAs you can see, all three of these stocks, which make up more than a third of the ETF, are delivering strong growth, and two of the three of them reported accelerating revenue growth in their most recent quarters. Those results seem to push back on the narrative of an AI bubble , and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said as much in the company's most recent earnings report, saying he sees AI at a tipping point, implying that demand and usage were about to accelerate.\n\nStory Continues\nWhy the VanEck Semiconductor ETF could beat the S&P 500 next year The strength of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF will depend on the AI boom, but the same could be said for the S&P 500.\nThe SMH does trade at a premium to the S&P 500, but it's not by as much as you might think. The semiconductor ETF currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 38.6, which compares to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF at 28.5.\n\nEven with that premium, the risk/reward in the VanEck ETF looks attractive considering the growth rates of its top three holdings and other major holdings like Micron and Advanced Micro Devices .\nThe buildout of AI data centers is continuing, and demand for semiconductors, which are becoming an essential component in everything from medical equipment to automobiles, will keep growing.\nThe ETF is vulnerable to an AI bubble, and valuations could eventually catch up to the semiconductor sector, but as Jensen Huang believes, the facts on the ground seem to point in the opposite direction. That's a good reason to bet on its outperformance next year as well.\nShould you invest $1,000 in VanEck ETF Trust - VanEck Semiconductor ETF right now?

      "Content": "Here Are My Top 10 Stocks for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 10:50 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points The AI buildout trend is expected to continue at full speed.\nCloud infrastructure companies are expected to thrive due to increased AI demands.\nSeveral stocks that had disappointing performances in 2025 could bounce back in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWith 2025 nearly over, it's a good time for investors to think about which companies they might want to add to their portfolios in 2026. A market pullback can happen at any time, so having a shopping list ready to go is a smart idea.\nHere are my top 10 stock picks for 2026. I'm fairly confident that each of them will outperform the market next year.\n1. Nvidia This is just a list of stocks -- it's not in ranked order. However, if it were in ranked order, there's a good chance that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) would still be No. 1. The chipmaker has been the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) buildout since it began in 2023, and that trend shows no signs of stopping in 2026.\n\nHyperscalers are slated to spend record amounts on capital expenditures in 2026. Most of that money is going toward constructing data centers and filling them with computing equipment, such as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia projects that by 2030, global data center capital expenditures will total $3 trillion to $4 trillion. If that forecast proves accurate, Nvidia will be a top stock to own in 2026 and several years beyond.\n2. AMD AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) has played second fiddle to Nvidia in the GPU market for many years, but it could start closing the gap. AMD's offerings are far more competitive than they were just a few years ago, and management believes it can capture more of the market for the new AI workloads coming online.\n\nThe company projects that its data center revenue growth rate will rise to a 60% compound annual growth rate over the next five years. In Q3, its data center growth rate was 22%. If it can accelerate its growth to that 60% level, AMD will be a winning stock pick in 2026.\n3. Broadcom Chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is taking a different approach to AI computing. Instead of offering general-purpose GPUs like AMD and Nvidia, it's partnering with hyperscalers to design custom AI accelerators that are optimized to handle the needs of their workloads. These application-specific integrated circuits can provide better performance at lower costs, but at the cost of reduced flexibility. Many cloud giants are willing to make that trade, and Broadcom's growth is accelerating as a result.\nIn the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2025 (which ended Nov. 2), Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue rose 74% year over year, and management expects that growth rate to accelerate to above 100% in its Q1 fiscal 2026.\n\nStory Continues\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom are all fabless chip companies: They design chips, but outsource the manufacturing of them to specialists like Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) . It is by far the world's largest chip foundry by revenue, and with its industry dominance, that likely won't change anytime soon.\n\nAs long as high AI infrastructure spending continues, Taiwan Semiconductor will be a great investment, as it's a neutral player in the AI realm. That spending is expected to rise again in 2026, boding well for Taiwan Semi.\n5. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is becoming a force to be reckoned with in the AI realm. Originally, its generative AI model, Gemini, was viewed as inferior to its rivals. But now, it's seen as one of the leaders in the space.\nFurthermore, Alphabet has a thriving base business (Google Search), as well as a strong cloud computing offering in Google Cloud. It's hard to find a weak spot in Alphabet's business right now.\n\n6. Meta Platforms Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) tumbled after it reported its Q3 results, with the market apparently reacting unfavorably to its high capital expenditure plans. However, that response ignores how strong the base business was in the quarter. Meta's revenue rose by 26% year over year, thanks to the effects of AI on its platforms.\n\nThis growth will likely persist throughout 2026, and investors will come back around to Meta stock once they realize that all the other tech giants in its megacap cohort are spending just as heavily on AI as Meta is. The stock's current discount is a great buying opportunity, and investors should take advantage.\n7. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has performed poorly in 2025: It's only up about 3% so far this year. However, that wasn't because Amazon's business struggled. Its revenue rose at a 13% pace in Q3, led by its strong advertising division and cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services.\nBoth of these businesses are expected to thrive in 2026. With each accounting for a significant chunk of Amazon's profits, that bodes well for the stock's chances of regaining its momentum.\n\n8. PayPal PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) stock has fallen by around 30% in 2025. However, it hasn't been as bad a year for the payment processing giant's business as that result would suggest.\nPayPal delivered strong diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth in 2025, and that trend could continue in 2026, particularly if it continues its share buybacks. PayPal's stock is dirt cheap at 11.5 times forward earnings, making it an attractive stock to buy.\n9. The Trade Desk The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) has had a disappointing year as well, with its stock falling by around 70% so far. When it switched to its AI-powered ad-buying platform, Kokai, its platform migration was poorly executed, leading to problems for its clients. This caused some clients to pull back on their spending with it, and it lost business to Amazon.\n\nHowever, The Trade Desk is still in a great spot and is expected to grow revenue in 2026 at a 16% pace, according to Wall Street analysts. Combine that with its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20, and you have a recipe for a stock that could outperform in 2026.\n10. MercadoLibre Last but not least is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) , a Latin American e-commerce and fintech giant that has posted year after year of successful quarters. The stock is up by around 20% for the year, but down by more than 20% from the high it hit in July.\nMercadoLibre is the dominant e-commerce company in Latin America, and its growth is far from over. Previous pullbacks in MercadoLibre's stock over the past few years have proven to be excellent buying opportunities, and the current one looks no different.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?
