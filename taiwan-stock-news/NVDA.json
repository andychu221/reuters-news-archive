      "Content": "Nvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\n\nFaizan Farooque\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 3:33 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNvidia ’s H200 processor is becoming the epicenter of a conflict in China, and stock market experts and investors cannot see it on a chart.\nChinese cloud and internet corporations want Nvidia's processor right now, since their own accelerators aren't fast enough. Beijing, on the other hand, is looking at the big picture and may be ready to give up short-term success in exchange for control over its semiconductor future.\nSince 2018, Washington has levied new tariffs on nearly $370 billion worth of Chinese imports. Trade organizations claim this package currently means that products arriving from China have to pay about $77 billion more in taxes each year.\nThe trade war between the U.S. and China is unlikely to subside anytime soon. The conflict intensified in the incumbent administration. However, the previous government made every effort to minimize China's \"unfair\" advantage.\n\nKatherine Tai, who served as U.S. Trade Representative from 2021 until January 2025, put it plainly in a 2024 statement .\nTaking stock of the situation is important for Nvidia. The business has previously downplayed China in its predictions, but the H200 is still the most powerful AI processor that Chinese clients can lawfully purchase from the U.S.\nHow much of Nvidia's potential is still related to China and how much is gone for good will depend on whether it ever ships into the market at volume.\nRelated: History of Nvidia: Company timeline and facts\nCorporate China is still chasing Nvidia’s H200 The demand for Nvidia's H200 in China is already more than what the firm can currently make, according to a Reuters report .\nThe news outlet said Nvidia has informed Chinese customers that it is thinking about adding H200 capacity, since big buyers like Alibaba and ByteDance are very interested, even if the company is mostly focusing on its newer Blackwell and future Rubin processors.\n\nRelated: You won’t believe what Coca-Cola just did with its coffee brand\nReuters also said that Chinese cloud service providers and business clients have been asking Beijing officials to approve H200 imports, saying local accelerators still don't come close to the sheer computing power of the H200.\nReuters spoke to one investor who indicated that the H200 is about two to three times faster than the most sophisticated AI processors made in China. This makes it the best processor Chinese purchasers can access without breaking U.S. export laws.\nThat difference in performance is causing a lot of anger on the ground. Some Chinese authorities have suggested a solution that would allow H200 imports only if they come with native accelerators.\n\n繼續閱讀\nThis would help domestic chipmakers while still allowing businesses to use Nvidia's technology.\nKey points for Nvidia investors: Chinese cloud and internet platforms still think Nvidia is the best choice for performance.\nIn China, there is enough demand for H200 to put a strain on Nvidia's present supply.\nAny access to H200 is likely to come with strings attached, such as obligations to bundle with competitors in the same country.\n\nFor investors, all of this makes one thing clear: Nvidia's silicon is still in demand in China's data centers. Policy, not demand, is what's holding things up.\nBeijing would rather back Huawei than buy more Nvidia Bloomberg's report shows that Beijing is not as excited as its tech companies are.\nDavid Sacks, the White House's AI and crypto czar, informed the outlet that China is deliberately rejecting Nvidia's H200 in favor of chips made in China.\nSacks stated that Chinese authorities had \"figured out\" Washington's strategy of only permitting exports that are behind the curve. They are using their own clearance procedure to slow down H200 shipments and safeguard local producers.\n\nRelated: US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding\nBloomberg also said that China is thinking about giving its semiconductor sector up to $70 billion in new incentives. That package would be meant to speed up the country's drive for self-sufficiency, with businesses like Huawei at the core, even if U.S.-approved Nvidia chips are technically accessible.\nBloomberg is saying that Beijing sees the H200 as a short-term convenience that it is ready to give up in order to build up its own champions.\nIt seems as if Nvidia really listened to that message. Bloomberg said the business has already taken China out of its short-term revenue forecasts, even though CEO Jensen Huang thinks the Chinese data center sector is worth around $50 billion a year, according to CNBC .\n\nH200 sales in China might potentially reach roughly $10 billion a year, but only if Beijing lets in a lot more imports, estimates show.\nWhat this means for Beijing’s strategy:\nBeijing is using approvals to slow H200 adoption and shield local chipmakers.\nSubsidies and incentives are being scaled up to pull AI workloads onto domestic silicon.\nNvidia is planning as if China is upside optionality, not a core growth driver.\nWhy the H200 standoff matters for Nvidia stock When you put the two stories together, you have a two-level game on which investors need to keep a careful eye.\nThere is talk about urgency and pent-up demand at the business level. Chinese IT businesses prefer H200s because they still work better per chip than chips made in China. The longer they wait, the more likely they are to lag behind competitors across the world that already have Blackwell-class gear.\n\nAt the same time, there is deliberate caution at the state level. Beijing appears to be increasingly keen on utilizing subsidies and clearances to give local suppliers an edge, even if it means AI rollouts for its own firms may take longer in the short term.\nMore Nvidia:\nIs Nvidia’s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn’t think so\nMorgan Stanley revamps Nvidia’s price target ahead of big Q3\nInvestors hope good news from Nvidia gives the rally more life\nBank of America resets Nvidia stock forecast before earnings\nAMD flips the script on Nvidia with bold new vision\nFor Nvidia stockholders, the difference between what China wants and what Beijing is ready to allow is an uncertainty premium.\nNvidia has assured clients that any licensed H200 sales to China will not stop it from serving U.S. customers, according to Reuters . This shows that the company is confident it can service both markets if it receives the go-ahead.\n\nBloomberg's research, on the other hand, shows that investors can't trust that green light would ever come at a large scale, at least not without rigorous restrictions that also help Chinese rivals.\nImplications for Nvidia’s long-term setup include the following.\nMoney coming in from China may not be a steady source of development, but it may be lumpy and based on policy.\nIf domestic Chinese accelerators don't have to compete with Nvidia, they may become better quicker.\nNvidia's multiple may start to show how much it is exposed to the U.S. and other \"open\" AI markets, with China seen as a call option.\nIf Beijing lets in a small number of strictly controlled H200 imports, Nvidia might get back billions of dollars in extra sales from a market it has mostly given up on, while also making people think that its chips are still the best in the world.\n\nNvidia's business in China may continue to be fundamentally weak, no matter how loud the demand is, if approvals are limited or take a long time.\nRelated: Jensen Huang’s 2025 net worth as Nvidia market cap tops $4 trillion\nWhat Nvidia investors should watch next The H200 is no longer Nvidia's most advanced product, but it is a good way to see how much more the business can expand in China under the present export rules.\nBloomberg's article makes it clear that the key issue is no longer whether the H200 is good enough (it is), but whether Beijing is still ready to allow U.S. export policy to determine its AI agenda.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Nvidia is still the most popular option in China when it comes to data centers, as long as purchasers can acquire it.\nFor Nvidia investors, the setup is simple: If clearances start to go through or if Beijing starts to change its attitude on H200 imports, it might mean that Nvidia's China forecast is not completely priced in.\nA hard turn to indigenous chips, supported by big subsidies and stricter unofficial rules, would show that Nvidia has to develop in places other than China.\nIn any case, the H200 debate is less about one \"old\" chip and more about how Wall Street should evaluate China's risk across all of Nvidia's AI products over the next several years.\nRelated: Tesla has problem no one was pricing in\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 17, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Could This AI Chip Stock Make a Major Comeback by the End of the Year?\n\nJohn Bromels, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 3:16 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points During each of the previous three Decembers, Nvidia's stock has surged 8.8% or more.\nThese surges were usually accompanied by broader market uptrends, which seem unlikely this year.\nThat leaves big company news as the only likely catalyst for a share price jump.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had a rough couple of months, with its stock down about 17% from its October peak. The last time Nvidia's shares were this far off their highs -- almost a year ago -- it took nearly six months for them to recover.\nHowever, could we be in for a holiday miracle? Could the stock not only regain its lost ground, but also hit new highs in the last 10 trading days of the year?\nHere's why it might actually happen -- and the one big obstacle standing in the way.\nWhat history says Nvidia's stock is no stranger to December \"mini-surges.\" Just last year, for example, its shares rose 8.8% between Dec. 18 and Dec. 24. The year before that, its stock shot up 10.1% between Dec. 6 and Dec. 18. And in 2022, its shares jumped 13% between Dec. 6 and Dec. 13.\nThose are all impressive moves, but in order for the stock to return to October's record $207.04 closing price, it would have to rise by about 17.4%. That's a tall order, but it isn't impossible.\n\nIn fact, Nvidia's done it before. In 2016, share prices surged a huge 33.9% between Dec. 1 and Dec. 27, with 16.8% of that rise occurring between the 16th and the 27th of the month. So a 2025 repeat isn't outside the realm of possibility. That said, the company's market cap in December 2016 was less than $64 billion, a far cry from its current $4.3 trillion valuation.\nPlus, in recent years, the stock has also seen a few double-digit declines in December. Some of them even happened alongside the stock's record jumps. Last year, for example, right before its 8.8% surge, Nvidia had dropped 11.2%. In 2022, right after its 13% jump, shares fell 22.3%. And in some years, there was no major jump or big plunge at all.\nReflecting the market Nvidia's end-of-year moves have tended to mirror the overall market, only with more intensity. For example, that big 22.3% price drop in December 2022 reflected a 5.9% decline in the S&P 500 . Last year, during its 11.2% December slide, the broader market also slid by 3.5%.\nIn other words, if the S&P 500 is doing well, Nvidia's stock tends to be doing really well. If the broader market is doing badly, its shares tend to be doing really badly.\n\nStory Continues\nUnfortunately, the market's growth has slowed over the past few quarters. Between its April 5 low and the end of the second quarter, the S&P 500 rose by a robust 24.5%. In the third quarter, it rose just 7.8%. So far in the fourth, it's only risen 1.9%.\nThat slowing growth came despite three Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, in September, October, and December. There won't be any further rate cuts this year.\n\nThat makes it unlikely that there will be a big year-end market surge that will benefit Nvidia stock. The likeliest reason for the shares to surge would be some major company-specific news.\nWhat news is left? But Nvidia has already put out excellent news in its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 19.\nThe company reported record revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year over year; per-share earnings of $1.30, up 67%; and an impressive gross margin of 73.4%, as measured under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Sales of its Blackwell chips are \"off the charts,\" according to CEO Jensen Huang, and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) are sold out. The company is expecting $65 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, with 74.8% GAAP gross margins.\n\nIt's hard to think of what more the company could possibly announce that would be enough to boost its shares by 17.4%, or about $700 billion in market value. That's more than the entire market caps of Costco and Coca-Cola combined.\nUnless a major issue emerges over the next couple of weeks with Alphabet 's tensor processing units (TPUs) or AMD 's high-end chips, which are expected to compete with Nvidia's GPUs, I really can't think of any likely scenario that would add so much value to Nvidia so quickly.\nThat's why it doesn't seem likely that the stock will make enough of a comeback to hit new highs by the end of 2025. But so what? Given the company's very strong outlook, 2026 is shaping up to be a big banner year for the chipmaker, and if the price is a bit cheaper during the holidays, it offers an opportunity for new investors to buy Nvidia shares at a discount.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the Next $4 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:50 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Alphabet's market cap has come out of nowhere to surpass Microsoft's.\nMassive investments in its technology and the release of Gemini 3 have dramatically changed perceptions about the Google parent.\nAlphabet has the second-lowest P/E ratio in the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nMany investors were shocked when Nvidia became the first company to achieve a $4 trillion market cap . The competition for the world's largest market cap was long a contest between Apple and Microsoft , so to see Nvidia emerge out of nowhere likely came as a surprise.\nNow, the question is, which company is the next to achieve a $4 trillion market cap? Today, Apple has already achieved that, but instead of Microsoft (which previously reached that point before retreating), I believe another emerging company will be the next one to reach this milestone. Here's why.\nThe next $4 trillion company Today, the stock most likely to reach $4 trillion and stay above that point is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . Currently, its market cap is at $3.7 trillion, surpassing Microsoft's current $3.5 trillion market cap.\nThat choice may come as a surprise to some investors. As recently as spring 2025, the Google parent's market cap was under $2 trillion.\nAlphabet stock had long been smaller than many of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, as the rise of ChatGPT weighed on the stock. When GPT-4 came out in 2023, investors soured on Google Search, and its market share had fallen below 90% for the first time in decades.\nAt that point, not only did ChatGPT offer more thorough and concise results, but it bypassed the advertising ecosystem that had long served as the primary source of the Google parent's revenue.\n\nThe company released Google Gemini later that year. Still, Gemini did not initially stand out from the likes of Claude, Grok, Copilot, and numerous other AI platforms trying to unseat ChatGPT.\nAlso, investors should remember that Alphabet has long worked to reduce its dependence on advertising for revenue. In recent years, Google Cloud has claimed an increasing share of the revenue. Still, even though Alphabet was an early pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI), these efforts did not seem to impress investors.\nWhat changed? However, Alphabet has long benefited from a massive level of liquidity and considerable free cash flows. In late 2024, it pledged to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures (capex) in 2025, later raising that to the $91 billion-$93 billion range.\nMuch of that spending has gone into improving legacy products. Search now incorporates AI-driven results, and Google Cloud offers upgraded infrastructure, multimodality AI models, and new tools for developers. Additionally, AI should help to make Waymo a source of revenue as it seeks to compete in the autonomous driving space.\n\nStory Continues\nNonetheless, it seems to be the release of Gemini 3 in November that has captured the most attention recently. With improved reasoning, coding, and multimodal understanding, some analysts claim it is \"better than ChatGPT.\"\nWith that, the stock is up more than 60% over the last year, and more than 110% from its April low. Not surprisingly, almost half of that increase has occurred since October.\nMoreover, despite these gains, it is the second-cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. Its P/E ratio of around 30 is undercut only by Meta Platforms , a stock trading at 28 times earnings. That comparative discount could give investors all the more reason to continue buying stock in the Google parent.\nAlphabet at $4 trillion (and beyond) Between the relatively low valuation and the newfound success of Gemini 3, Alphabet appears likely to reach $4 trillion next.\nUltimately, investors like winners in cutting-edge technologies, and amid Alphabet's massive investments, having Gemini 3 perceived as \"better than ChatGPT\" positions Alphabet stock for higher moves.\n\nAdditionally, the AI pioneer is aggressively applying the technology to Google Cloud, and its efforts with Waymo could begin to bear fruit soon. As investors notice the stock as undervalued relative to peers, it continues to benefit from numerous tailwinds.\nAmid such successes, Alphabet may not only reach $4 trillion, but could challenge Apple and Nvidia for the world's largest market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Stock Market Today, Dec. 17: Broadcom Drops on China AI Chip Breakthrough and AI Buildout Uncertainty\n\nHoward Smith, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:33 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) , which designs and supplies semiconductor devices and infrastructure software solutions, closed at $326.02, down 4.48%. Trading volume reached 73 million shares, coming in about 287% above versus its three-month average of 26 million shares.\nHow the markets moved today Wednesday’s trading reflected renewed concern about AI chip profitability and competitive threats from Chinese AI developments, and investors are watching how Broadcom manages margins alongside VMware integration and AI infrastructure demand.\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) fell 1.15% to 6,722, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) lost 1.81% to close at 22,694. Among Semiconductors industry rivals, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) slid 3.81% and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) dropped 3.38%, underscoring broad pressure on major AI-focused chipmakers.\n\nWhat this means for investors Rising competition from China had tech investors on their heels to start the day. It only got worse with reports that one private equity firm may not back an Oracle data center project as had been expected.\nAn ongoing Chinese government project to boost semiconductor self-sufficiency made a breakthrough, according to reports. While it has yet to result in working chips, a laboratory prototype represents progress.\n\nInvestors are also souring on names like Broadcom as questions arise around AI infrastructure funding. Reports today that Blue Owl Capital may not back the Oracle project as expected gave investors another reason to book profits today.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Elon Musk is worth a record $648 billion — and his wealth gain this year exceeds Bernard Arnault's entire fortune\n\nTheron Mohamed\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:30 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nLVMHF\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nElon Musk's wealth hit a record $648 billion, extending his lead as the world's richest person.\nHis fortune jumped thanks to Tesla's record stock rally and SpaceX's soaring valuation.\nMusk has gained an unrivaled $216 billion this year, more than Bernard Arnault's net worth.\nElon Musk's net worth has surged to a record $648 billion — and his wealth gain this year exceeds LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's entire $205 billion fortune, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO's wealth has jumped by $178 billion in just two days, boosting his year-to-date gain to an unmatched $216 billion.\nIf that figure were his entire fortune, he would rank sixth on the rich list — ahead of not just Arnault but also former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\nMusk's record wealth partly reflects Tesla stock closing at an all-time high of $490 on Tuesday, as investors cheered news that the EV maker is testing driverless robotoxis on Austin, Texas streets. Musk holds a roughly 12% stake in Tesla, valued at around $200 billion.\nBut the bigger driver of his wealth surge this week has been SpaceX's valuation reportedly doubling since the summer to $800 billion, based on a secondary share sale by the aerospace company ahead of a potential IPO next year .\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is now more than twice as wealthy as number two on the rich list, Alphabet cofounder Larry Page, who's worth $264 billion after a year-to-date wealth gain of $96 billion — second only to Musk .\nHe's also more than four times as rich as Warren Buffett , the outgoing CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who's worth $150 billion after giving more than half of his fortune to good causes.\nMusk's personal fortune exceeds the market values of Oracle , Mastercard, and Johnson & Johnson — three of the 20 most valuable US public companies with market capitalizations exceeding $500 billion. His recent gains have narrowed the gap with Visa, which has a market value of $660 billion.\nMusk's epic wealth rally The serial entrepreneur has had a striking wealth recovery in recent months. Tesla stock roughly halved between mid-January and mid-March as his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sparked public backlash and worried shareholders that he was getting distracted .\nMusk even briefly lost his top spot on the rich list to Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison in September, before Tesla shares rallied to fresh highs.\nTesla and other huge US tech companies have seen their stock prices soar this year, fueled by immense buzz around AI . In Musk's case, he's excited investors by spending big on AI to develop Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\nStory Continues\nBy contrast, skeptics such as Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame have warned that AI companies are overspending on microchips and data centers, and diagnosed a stock-market bubble that's bound to burst.\nThe AI boom has translated into huge wealth gains for key shareholders such as Musk, Page and his cofounder Sergey Brin, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang.\nMusk could become the world's first trillionaire after Tesla shareholders approved his pay package in November, which promises to roughly double his stake in Tesla over the next decade if he hits milestones such as selling 1 million Optimus robots and raising adjusted profits from around $17 billion last year to $400 billion.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Not All AI Stocks Are Falling These Days. Micron Is Rising on Strong Earnings\n\nKara Greenberg\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nKey Takeaways Micron Technology posted earnings that topped analysts' estimates, sending shares higher in extended trading Wednesday.\nCEO Sanjay Mehrotra said growing AI demand drove record results for the memory chipmaker and Nvidia supplier.\nWorries about an AI bubble have weighed on the tech sector lately. Micron is still riding the AI boom higher.\n\nShares of the memory chip maker were up over 5% in extended trading Wednesday after the company posted earnings that blew past analysts' estimates, driven by growing demand for AI hardware.\nMicron Technology ( MU ) posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.78 for the fiscal first quarter, well above the $3.96 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for . Its revenue jumped nearly 60% year-over-year to a record $13.64 billion, also exceeding expectations.\n\nWhy This Matters to Investors As a supplier for leading AI chipmakers including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Micron has seen strong momentum in its data center business this year, helping it earn a reputation as a winning \"pick-and-shovel\" play for the AI trade.\n\"Micron delivered record revenue and significant margin expansion at the company level and also in each of our business units,” said CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, who called the company an \"essential AI enabler.\"\n\nMicron projected adjusted earnings per share of $8.22 to $8.62 on revenue of $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion for the second quarter, well ahead of consensus estimates.\n\nMicron's stock, though well off record highs seen earlier this month, has largely avoided the worst of the recent slump in the AI sector. It's continued to benefit from a shortage in the memory market , supporting stronger pricing and higher margins. Micron's GAAP gross margin jumped to 56% in the first quarter, up from around 38% a year earlier, with the company saying it expects that to climb as high as 68% in the current quarter.\nShares of Micron have nearly tripled in value in 2025 through Wednesday's close, making it one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 for the year.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Riley Wealth Management described Oracle as \"probably the poster child\" for questions about AI project financing and profitability.\n\"Investors are starting to be more differentiated and looking at the potential winners and the potential time frame before return on invested capital,\" Hogan said. \"That doesn't mean we're anywhere close to the final innings of artificial intelligence. It just means investors are being more discerning.\"\nBesides Oracle, which fell 5.4 percent, other AI players such as Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet and Broadcom all lost more than three percent.\nWhile technology and communications services were among the sectors to retreat, energy led the winners among sectors moving higher.\n\nOil prices rallied after US President Donald Trump ordered a blockade of \"sanctioned\" oil tankers heading to and leaving Venezuela.\nThe commodity later pared some of its gains, but finished the day up more than one percent.\nVenezuela, which has the world's largest proven oil reserves, shrugged off the threat of more pain, insisting that it was proceeding with business as usual.\n\"Export operations for crude and byproducts continue normally.

      "Content": "Prediction: These 2 AI Darlings Will Be Worth $5 Trillion or More in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Nvidia's growth is expected to be rapid in 2026.\nAlphabet could see its valuation increase and strong growth continue to cross the $5 trillion mark.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nCurrently, there are no stocks with a $5 trillion market cap or greater. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is valued at $4.3 trillion, and was recently valued at over $5 trillion before pulling back. Following up Nvidia are Apple at $4 trillion, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) at $3.7 trillion, and Microsoft at $3.5 trillion. These are the only real candidates that can be worth $5 trillion or more, as Amazon is the fifth-largest company in the world at $2.6 trillion, which means its stock would have to more than double to breach the $5 trillion threshold.\nSo, of these four, which ones could be worth $5 trillion or more in 2026? I think there are only two real answers, and one may surprise you.\nReaching the $5 trillion valuation threshold won't be easy for one of these stocks It should come as no surprise that I think Nvidia will cross the $5 trillion valuation threshold in 2026. It's still growing at a rapid pace thanks to its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPU) technology stack. Demand for artificial intelligence computing power in data centers isn't slowing down, and it is shouldn't for some time. Nvidia believes global data center capital expenditures will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from $600 billion in 2025. Should that come to fruition, Nvidia would be a monster performer over the next five years, and 2026 is shaping up to be another phenomenal year.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs, although he didn't elaborate on how far in the future they are sold out. Regardless, demand outpaces supply for its GPUs, which allows it to maintain high prices and lofty profit margins. This will fuel Nvidia's growth in 2026, and Wall Street analysts are expecting 48% growth again in fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027) after rising a projected 63% in fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026).\nWith growth like that, it won't take a whole lot for Nvidia to reach the $5 trillion threshold in 2026.\nHowever, it will take a bit more effort from Alphabet.\nAlphabet was a bit of a laggard in the AI arms race because competitors launched generative AI tools before it did. Furthermore, the initial release of its model was bad and caused several PR nightmares. However, Alphabet has addressed those issues and is now one of the leading providers of generative AI. In addition, Alphabet's core Google search business was spared from being broken up due to monopoly concerns earlier this year, and its future is now much clearer than it was just six months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nSince July 1, Alphabet's stock has been on fire, rising about 80%. However, for Alphabet's stock to be worth $5 trillion, it must rise at least 35% from today's levels.\nCan it do that?\nAlphabet's earnings growth has been impressive in recent quarters There are a few ways for a stock to rise: growing revenue and earnings, or an increase in valuation. Both of these are reasonable actions for a share price to rise, and Alphabet will likely need a boost from both to cross the $5 trillion threshold. In Q3, revenue rose 16% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 35%. If Alphabet can keep up its EPS growth, then it could cross the $5 trillion threshold with growth alone. However, I think it could also use some help in the valuation department.\nDespite growing at the same pace or faster than Apple or Microsoft, Alphabet trades at a discount from a price-to-earnings perspective.\nShould Alphabet's stock receive a 35 times trailing earnings valuation, that would result in 14% growth alone.\nAlphabet will need all the help it can get to reach a $5 trillion valuation by the end of 2026, but I think it can do it. Even if it doesn't, I think it could easily reach that level by 2027.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Micron has broken its quarterly record in two straight quarters, with a third potential record coming this week.\nMicron has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in 10 straight quarters.\nAnalysts expect Micron to report first-quarter earnings per share of $3.93, up from $1.79 in last year&#039;s first quarter.\nThe company has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in seven straight quarters and in nine of the past 10 quarters overall.\nGuidance from the company calls for first-quarter revenue in a range of $12.2 billion to $12.8 billion and earnings per share in a range of $3.60 to $3.90.\n\nDon&#8217;t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\n\nWhat Analysts Are Saying: Micron will set a new quarterly record and the company could have \"record quarters ahead,\" Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a new investor note.\nThe analyst maintained a Buy rating on Micron with a price target of $300.\n\"We are expecting Micron to report another record quarterly only to be topped by February quarter guidance,\" Cassidy said.\nThe analyst said the record revenue is coming by disciplined supply growth in recent years along with strong demand for the company&#039;s products.\n\"We see the financial performance as supporting the growth.\"\n\nCassidy said the company is becoming stronger with AI applications having an increased need for memory.\nThe analyst said a key item to watch will be management commentary for when more meaningful capacity is coming.\n\"We recommend owning the stock.\"\nNeedham analyst Quinn Bolton maintained a Buy rating on Micron and raised the price target from $200 to $300 ahead of the earnings report.\n\"With the memory market continuing to tighten, demand likely to exceed supply throughout CY 26,\" Bolton said.\nThe analyst raised revenue and eps estimates for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027 \"substantially.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\"Demand conditions in the data center market remain robust, driven by increasing hyperscaler and neocloud CapEx.\"\nBolton said this is a strong tailwind for Micron that will help average selling prices and gross margins.\nSeveral other analysts raised their price targets for Micron stock ahead of the earnings report, including Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson , who maintained an Outperform rating and raised the price target from $220 to $300.\n\nSee Also: The AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nKey Items to Watch: Micron shares are up over 160% in 2025, which could create high expectations for the stock.\nAnalysts and investors likely expect another double beat and raised guidance. If the company fails to beat or update on guidance, shares could end up being volatile the rest of the week.\nFreedom Capital Markets Chief Market Strategist Jay Woods cautioned on shares being volatile in his weekly newsletter .\n\"Shares have traded lower after posting results over the last four quarters and over five of their last six,\" Woods said.\nThe market expert said this could be a case of shares trading higher before earnings and selling off after the earnings report.\n\nMicron said it had all-time highs for its data center business and was entering 2026 with \"strong momentum\" during its fourth quarter financial results. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told investors Micron was \"uniquely positioned to capitalize on the AI opportunity ahead.\"\nAnalysts and investors will be looking forward to guidance and commentary on future growth for the company.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nTrending Now:\nWall Street&#039;s $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That&#039;s why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn&#039;t tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10 . Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn&#039;t just for trading — it&#039;s also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery . With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It&#039;s a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\nThis article Micron Q1 Preview: Record Quarter Predicted By Analyst — 'We Recommend Owning The Stock' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Best Tech ETF Picks for 2026\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 1:18 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Tech has been a strong outperformer, but it might be time to rethink investing in this sector.\nCompanies with strong fundamentals and more reasonable valuations present enticing opportunities.\nSoftware and digital payments are two subsectors that have the chance to outperform in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Amplify ETF Trust - Amplify Digital Payments ETF ›\n\nAs we wrap up 2025, tech stocks are again on pace to be one of the best-performing S&P 500 sectors. Fueled by strong demand for anything tied to artificial intelligence (AI) , investors steadily bought stocks and pushed the Nasdaq-100 index to several new all-time highs.\nWhile the \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks helped lead the way higher, 2026 may not be a repeat. If you're looking to invest in tech, it may be time to look beyond just Nvidia , Microsoft , and Apple . While these have been terrific-performing companies for a long time, there are a number of opportunities within the sector that may be flying under the radar.\nIn particular, undervalued areas of the tech sector could see better performance. The mega-cap companies, as well as chip stocks, have really gotten all the attention lately. Areas, such as software and digital payments, could enjoy renewed interest if investors begin seeking out more value-oriented stocks backed by healthy fundamentals.\nHere are three tech ETFs that I believe could outperform in the coming year.\nInvesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: RSPT) invests in all of the big large-cap tech companies, but removes the concentration factor. It equally weights the roughly 70 tech stocks within the S&P 500 and rebalances quarterly to ensure it maintains its diversified exposure.\n\nRSPT is a great way to invest in the tech stocks that have led the market over the past several years, but broaden out the exposure in case the mega-cap names begin to underperform. We've already seen some hints that investors are worried about Magnificent Seven valuations. This ETF allows you to invest in the long-term tech narrative while mitigating some of that idiosyncratic risk.\nTop holdings currently include Western Digital , Micron Technology , and Teradyne .\nAmplify Digital Payments ETF Think of the one thing that almost every person does at least once a day (and probably multiple times): buy something! Years ago, people would pay for these purchases using cash or a check. Today, everybody uses credit cards or some form of digital payment, such as PayPal .\nThe Amplify Digital Payments ETF (NYSEMKT: IPAY) invests in all the major companies that provide payment services. Its top three holdings -- American Express , Visa , and MasterCard -- are all major credit card issuers, but other companies within the top 10 reflect how the entire sector is evolving. PayPal is more of a traditional online payment platform. Global Payments is a payment processor and software provider. Coinbase Global is a cryptocurrency trading platform.\n\nStory Continues\nThe transaction processing space is already a big cash flow generator. Adding the next-generation fintech evolution to it provides a great long-term growth opportunity.\niShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF Ever since coming out of the 2022 bear market, software has been a tech laggard. The AI boom had investors gravitating toward semiconductor stocks, leaving certain segments of the sector underbought and unloved.\nWithin the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGV) , there are a lot of high-quality companies with strong revenue growth and solid margins that could finally see some of that value get unlocked in 2026. Top 10 holdings include Palantir Technologies , Salesforce , Intuit , and ServiceNow alongside industry heavyweight Microsoft.\n\nSoftware is intriguing because it covers so many areas within tech. IGV is essentially an investment in cloud computing, enterprise automation, cybersecurity, and AI productivity tools. There's constant demand for performance improvement and staying ahead of the latest threats. That makes a lot of these companies steady cash flow generators that can actually add some stability to a portfolio.\nWith software lagging behind the Nasdaq-100 in 2025, there's some catch-up potential in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amplify ETF Trust - Amplify Digital Payments ETF right now?

It comes amid scrutiny of increasing use of debt and off-balance-sheet moves to fund tech companies' capital spending on AI infrastructure, despite persistent questions over demand for the tech.\n\nOracle shares fell nearly 6%, and megacap tech stocks followed.

Markets are also waiting for the other data shoe to drop: Thursday's update on consumer inflation in November.\nIn a clue to the path ahead, Fed governor Chris Waller said Wednesday that the central bank still has scope to cut rates, hinting at \"50 to 100 basis points\" of room.\nElsewhere in corporates, Netflix ( NFLX ) stock rose after Warner Bros.

Year to date, GE Vernova stock has run up 93%, inclusive of a 15% gain last Wednesday, after the company announced plans to roll out a fuel cell business for data centers at its investor day.\n\nGE Vernova has been seen as a beneficiary of the AI infrastructure build-out, as demand for energy transmission and grid integration is booming. According to RBC analyst Christopher Dendrinos, GE Vernova's electrification backlog has grown 4x since 2022 and is projected to double again by 2028.\nBut news that private lender Blue Owl Capital ( OWL ) will not back a $10 billion deal for Oracle's data center threw funding for that build-out into greater scrutiny on Wednesday.\nStill, GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik emphasized in an interview last week that the company has \"a lot of other drivers\" of demand. Strazik said that only 10% of the company's current backlog comes from hyperscalers, which could grow to approximately one-third of the backlog over the next three years.\n\nToday at 6:06 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nMedline stock begins trading above $35 per share Medline ( MDLN ) shares began trading on Wednesday afternoon at $35 each.

AI chipmaking machine producer ASML ( ASML ) also shed 3%, while contract semiconductor manufacturer TSMC ( TSM ) dropped nearly 2% and Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) edged down just over 1%,\n\nToday at 3:35 PM UTC Myles Udland\n\nMedline raises $6.3 billion in year's biggest IPO The biggest IPO of 2025 is getting in just before the finish line.\nMedical supply giant Medline ( MDLN ) said late Tuesday that it had raised $6.26 billion in its IPO, selling a little over 216 million shares at $29 a piece, with the stock set to begin trading on Wednesday. The IPO values Medline at upwards of $50 billion, based on a total of roughly 1.8 billion Class A and Class B shares outstanding.\nThe deal caps the best year for the IPO market since 2021 , with Wall Street's outlook for deals and new issues even more optimistic heading into 2026 .\nRecent reports have indicated that SpaceX is likely to go public in 2026 , with the company having recently struck a deal for insiders to sell stock in Elon Musk's rocketry and satellite business that valued the company at $800 billion.\nMajor AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic are also expected to explore going public within the next 18 months, according to The Information . Database giant Databricks, which raised money at a $134 billion valuation this week, said it could explore a public offering as soon as next year.\n\nToday at 3:02 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nOracle drops on debt concerns Oracle ( ORCL ) shares fell nearly 4% Wednesday after the Financial Times reported that private lender Blue Owl Capital will not back a $10 billion deal for its next data center as the burgeoning AI cloud player rushes to secure computing capacity and investors scrutinize its mounting use of debt to do so.\n\nThe decline put Oracle shares down nearly 18% for the month. The stock fell after the company's earnings last week showed its costs rising more than expected while bleeding more cash than anticipated.

      "Content": "Better AI Stock: ASML vs. Nvidia\n\nChris Neiger, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 12:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nASML\n\nKey Points ASML makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and holds 90% market share.\nNvidia's GPUs are in heavy demand from tech giants, and its earnings surged 67% higher in the third quarter.\nNvidia's shares are cheaper than ASML's.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nStocks in the semiconductor sector have been among the most sought-after investments over the past few years, as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) processors has surged. Two companies that have benefited from the trend are semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) and chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nBoth could continue to benefit from heavy spending on AI infrastructure, which is forecast to reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion over the next five years. But which one looks like the better AI stock to buy now and hold for the long term?\nNvidia's AI dominance Nvidia 's ability to meet the soaring demand for powerful parallel processors propelled the company's market capitalization from approximately $364 billion at the end of 2022 to around $4.3 trillion today. Its dominance in the AI semiconductor market has led to skyrocketing revenue and earnings.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025 (which ended Jan. 26, 2025), Nvidia's sales rose by 114% to $130.5 billion, and its diluted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 130% to $2.99. And the good times are still rolling for Nvidia. Its revenue increased by 62% in its fiscal 2026 third quarter to $57 billion, and EPS popped by 67% to $1.30.\nThe chipmaker's ability to grow sales and earnings so quickly stems from its estimated 90% share of the data center GPU market. The company's chip designs are superior to competitors' at AI processing, leaving tech giants clamoring for its most advanced semiconductors.\nMoreover, the AI chip market's growth will have more drivers than chatbots from OpenAI and Alphabet . Tech companies are increasingly betting on robotics, self-driving vehicles, and other autonomous systems that will also require advanced AI processors. Consider that Morgan Stanley estimates the humanoid robotics market could be worth $5 trillion by 2050.\n\nAs these other markets begin to take shape, it could fuel further sales growth for Nvidia's processors.\nASML benefits from demand for Nvidia's processors ASML makes some of the key equipment required to manufacture AI processors, which it sells to foundry operators like Taiwan Semiconductor , which in turn churn out the semiconductors designed by clients like Nvidia. This part of the supply chain has boomed lately, and ASML's shares are up 52% over the past year.\n\nStory Continues\nASML enjoys an enviable position in the AI chip manufacturing equipment space, holding an estimated 90% market share in lithography. That's impressive enough, and research from Morningstar indicates that ASML's technology is a decade ahead of its rivals. When it comes to making the most advanced chips, its machines hold a technological monopoly, because no peer offers similarly capable options.\n\nThe company also benefits from the fact that it services the machines it sells, providing it with potentially decades of recurring revenue for each machine. ASML's service revenue rose 39% in the first nine months of this year to 6 billion euros, and more growth is expected on that front as it sells more equipment that could remain in use for up to 30 years.\nWhile there are some concerns about the possibility that the AI market may be in a bubble, it's important to note that ASML, like Nvidia, is highly profitable. The company's gross margins hover in the low 50% range, and in the first nine months of this year, its diluted earnings per share were $17.38 -- a 40% increase from the same period in 2024.\nWhy Nvidia has a slight edge over ASML I think both of these AI stocks deserve a place in most people's portfolios, but Nvidia gets the win in this matchup because its shares are cheaper than ASML's. Nvidia's stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 23 right now, compared to ASML's P/E ratio of 34. It's worth noting, though, that both are well below the tech sector's average P/E ratio of 45.\n\nAnd while Nvidia does get my vote, you probably couldn't go wrong buying either stock and holding onto it for years to come.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,955 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,089,460 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 968 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

We already covered the best Dow Jones Industrial Average stock of 2025 -- spoiler alert, it's not Nvidia (NVDA) -- so now the S&P 500 Index (SPX) gets the same treatment.\n\nTaking the benchmark's top spot for the year is Wall Street newbie SanDisk Corp (NASDAQ:SNDK), which began trading in early February and joined the SPX in late November. The flash memory manufacturing company is a spinoff of Western Digital (WDC), which takes the runner-up spot.\nSNDK has added 268.2% in the last nine months, more than quadrupling off its independent trading debut on the Nasdaq at $36 on Feb. 13. Analysts were already taking notice before the rally picked up in September, culminating in a Nov. 12, record high of $284.59. Shares have since pulled back from that peak, but support at $200 appears to be keeping recent losses in check.\nDespite this outperformance, short sellers have been piling on the security, likely due to AI overvaluation concerns . Short interest is up 22.8% in the last two reporting periods, and now makes up more than 5.2% of the security's available float. This suggests SNDK may be a short squeeze contender in 2026.\nIt's also worth noting that the chip stock tended to outperform volatility expectations in the past year, as suggested by its Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) of 89 out of 100.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Credo Technology Stock Is Down 28% in Two Weeks. Is the Dip Worth Buying?\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:44 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRDO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Credo Technology stock dropped 28% in two weeks, but there's no company-specific bad news behind the pullback.\nThe stock's high beta of 2.7 means double-digit swings are normal for this volatile growth name.\nThis high-priced stock is not for everyone, but long-term investors with strong stomachs may find this dip worth buying.\n10 stocks we like better than Credo Technology Group ›\n\nCredo Technology Group (NASDAQ: CRDO) has had a rough couple of weeks. Shares dropped nearly 12% in just five market days as of Dec. 17, and the data networking expert's stock is down 28% in two weeks.\nBut zoom out a bit, and the picture looks very different. Credo's stock is still up 103% year to date and has gained 839% over the past three years -- nearly matching Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) legendary run in almost exactly the first three years of ChatGPT and generative artificial intelligence (AI). That's some legendary company at these lofty heights.\nIs Credo's dip a buying opportunity , or perhaps the start of a long-lasting retreat? Let's take a look.\nWhy Credo's stock dropped There's no company-specific bombshell behind this pullback. Credo didn't miss earnings, lose a customer, or bungle a product launch. Instead, this looks like garden-variety volatility in a high-flying stock.\nAnd make no mistakeL Credo is both high-flying and volatile. The stock's beta value is 2.7, which means the stock tends to move in the same direction as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) market index -- but 2.7 times faster . Double-digit weekly swings aren't unusual for this stock; they're the price of admission to Credo's party.\n\nWhen you own a stock that's up 860% in three years, you're going to see some gut-wrenching drops along the way. That's just how it works in Wall Street's high-octane growth stock lane.\nThe bull case remains intact Nothing about Credo's fundamental story has changed recently.\nThe AI connectivity opportunity is massive. As GPU clusters scale from thousands to millions of chips, the data-transfer \"plumbing\" connecting them becomes mission-critical.\nThat's where Credo enters the conversation. Credo's active electrical cables (AECs) reportedly offer 1,000 times better reliability and approximately 50% lower power consumption than fiber-optic alternatives with similar data speeds. Those are game-changing advantages when deployed across a massive data center.\nThe company is executing. Revenue more than doubled last fiscal year, gross margins are expanding, and the company recently turned profitable.\n\nStory Continues\nThe product roadmap is also compelling, as the company finds new use cases for its fundamental components. New offerings like ZeroFlap optical transceivers and OmniConnect gearboxes could triple or quadruple Credo's total addressable market by 2030.\nAnd Credo's leadership is solid. Co-founders Lawrence Cheng and Job Lam are still running the show 17 years in, serving as CTO and COO, respectively. CEO Bill Brennan has been at the helm since 2013.\n\nThe risks haven't changed either Credo's biggest vulnerability remains customer concentration. Its largest customer accounts for over 40% of revenue, and the entire business serves just a handful of hyperscaler tech giants. That's a real risk, and it's not going away anytime soon.\nFurthermore, the stock isn't cheap by most metrics. Shares are changing hands at 120 times trailing earnings and 31 times sales. That may be a bargain next to market darlings like Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) , but Credo's multiples are loftier than Nvidia's. You're paying a higher price for Credo's hypergrowth, and if that growth stumbles, the stock will take a hit.\nSo is the dip worth buying? Credo's long-term investing thesis is that the company is building the foundational connectivity layer for AI infrastructure. If you see great value in that idea, and you're willing to assume that Credo can stave off well-heeled challengers such as Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , then a 28% pullback in two weeks is just noise, not a value-altering signal.\n\nThis is an aggressive stock for investors with strong stomachs and long time horizons. If that's you, and you've been waiting for a better entry point, you should consider grabbing a few Credo shares while they're trading at a modest discount.\nJust don't expect the volatility to stop. Credo is still a relatively small company, with just $796 million of trailing revenues, and it didn't start delivering consistent bottom-line profits until a year ago. The ride will be bumpy for years to come, but so far, Credo has been heading in the right direction.\nShould you buy stock in Credo Technology Group right now? Before you buy stock in Credo Technology Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Credo Technology Group wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025\n\nRyan Peterson\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:37 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nShares of AMD have steadied near recent highs as investors digest strong AI-related momentum alongside lingering questions about how quickly the company can meaningfully close the gap with Nvidia in data center acceleration. The story right now is less about AMD's growth prospects and more about whether enthusiasm around AI chips has largely been priced in heading into year-end.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, we ran AMD through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI's GPT. The goal wasn't to set a bold long-term target, but to produce a short, data-driven outlook that blends price action, technical signals, and the current narrative around AI demand and competition.\nWhat the AI model is actually predicting The agent was fed recent price action and a focused set of inputs to produce a short-term outlook. At the time of the run, AMD traded at $207.58. For the period from Dec. 16 through Jan. 6, the model's base-case projection came out to:\nAverage predicted price: $207.30\nImplied move: essentially flat drift into early January\nSignal snapshot: MACD remains low and flat, while RSI has begun to decline, pointing to cooling momentum rather than a breakdown\n\nIn plain language, the AI sees AMD's most likely path over the next few weeks as sideways, with little incentive for traders to push the stock meaningfully higher or lower without a new catalyst. That reflects a market that's comfortable with AMD's positioning, but not eager to expand the multiple further in the near term.\nFundamentally, AMD continues to benefit from rising demand for its MI300 AI accelerators, which management has highlighted as a key growth driver into 2025 as hyperscalers diversify beyond Nvidia. Recent earnings results showed data center revenue accelerating sharply year over year, reinforcing the idea that AMD is firmly in the AI spending cycle, even if it remains a distant second to Nvidia in market share.\nAt the same time, AMD's stock has already reflected much of that optimism. Shares rallied strongly earlier in the year on AI enthusiasm and improving PC demand, leaving less room for short-term upside unless orders or guidance surprise meaningfully. Broader coverage has also noted that while MI300 adoption is growing, the pace of revenue ramp and margins will be critical to sustaining investor confidence.\n\nPrice action in December supports that view. The stock has traded in a relatively tight range, with momentum indicators softening. The declining RSI suggests buying pressure is easing, while the flat MACD points to indecision rather than distribution. That combination often precedes consolidation rather than a sharp move, especially in large-cap semiconductor names late in the year.\n\nStory Continues\nThink of this AI outlook as a short-term temperature check. The model isn't making a judgment on AMD's long-term role in AI compute or its ability to take share over time. Instead, it's estimating how the market is likely to behave while investors wait for clearer signals on AI revenue scaling, margins, and competitive dynamics. In this run, the agent favors a muted move.\n\nFor longer-term investors bullish on AMD's AI roadmap and diversified chip portfolio, a flat few weeks is largely noise.

      "Content": "Want Decades of Passive Income? Buy This ETF and Hold It Forever.\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:31 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nSCHD\n\nABBV\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points The Schwab Dividend 100 ETF has delivered at least 1.3 times the S&P 500's dividend yield for its entire 12-year history.\nThe fund's top three holdings account for just 13.7% of assets, versus 20.5% for the S&P 500.\nTotal returns often lag SPY-style trackers, but income-first investors get steadier, more predictable payouts.\n10 stocks we like better than Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF ›\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) , also known as the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF, is the kind of fund you pick when you want income to arrive like clockwork.\nIt skips extreme growth names with low dividend yields such as Nvidia and Microsoft . Instead, the fund leans into reliable dividend payers such as AbbVie , Home Depot , and Coca-Cola . With only 13.7% of the fund concentrated in its top three holdings, the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF spreads risk more evenly than the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and tends to produce steadier dividends over time.\nIf your goal is decades of passive income you can count on, this fund can serve as a sensible, low-maintenance core.\nWhat makes the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF tick Let's start with the basics:\nSince its founding in 2011, the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF has always offered at least 30% higher dividend yields than the average S&P 500 tracker. These days, the fund's yield stands at 3.79%, which is more than 3 times the leading market index's yield.\nIt's the only U.S.-listed fund that tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index. It's an automated index, ranking American stocks with a proprietary score based on free cash flows, debt balances, return on equity (ROE), effective yields, and five-year dividend growth rates.\nThe tech giants that rule the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes are absent from this top-100 list, presumably because of their modest dividend yields.\nThe 0.06% annual expense ratio is low enough to match many Vanguard funds, and far below popular income ETFs such as the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEMKT: JEPI) at 0.35% and the iShares iBoxx Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEMKT: LQD) with a 0.14% fee ratio.\n\nThere are other dividend-focused ETFs on the market, but the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF tracks a unique high-quality income index with a heavy focus on high-quality dividend funding. It's not a simple bet on high yields , but a more sophisticated approach that also considers each company's fiscal management and cash profits.\nThe trade-off nobody wants to talk about It should be said that the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF isn't for everyone. The fund often lags behind S&P 500 trackers like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) in terms of long-term price gains. Even if you reinvest your dividends in more shares along the way, the broader market's total returns are usually stronger. That's especially true in the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom, where many of the market's top performers come with modest dividend yields or none at all:\n\nStory Continues\nThat's the trade-off you sign up for. You give up some upside during megacap growth runs, and in return you get a steadier paycheck from your portfolio that arrives without a fuss.\nFor many income-first investors, that matters more than headline returns. Dividends pay the bills, fund weekend plans, cover health costs, or buy groceries without forcing a sale in a down market.\n\nThe Schwab Dividend 100 ETF is built for that role: reliable distributions from cash-generating businesses that have paid through cycles, and a mix of household-name holdings that feels like an old friend you can call on when you need it.\nIs this fund right for you? This dividend stability is not a promise, since dividends can be cut even in a diversified portfolio of high-quality payers. It is a practical approach, though.\nIf your plan is to find income to lean on for years, this fund makes it easier to sleep at night. You're relying on companies that have shown they can keep paying, and that they have the financial chops to keep the quarterly checks coming. Pair this security with a few growth-oriented stocks or ETFs if you still want some runway for upside, but treat the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF as the part of your portfolio that writes the checks.\n\nYou may not beat the market this way, but the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF's generous payouts should keep coming in any economy. This fund is for investors who value reliable income over maximum growth; skip it if you want to chase the next Nvidia.\nShould you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?

      "Content": "LIVE\n\nStock market today: Nasdaq sinks, leading Dow, S&P 500 lower as Oracle shares plummet\n\nKaren Friar , Brett LoGiurato and Laura Bratton\nUpdated Wed, December 17, 2025 at 12:01 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nTSLA\n\n^DJI\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nUS stocks fell on Wednesday as investors weighed what the latest data and Federal Reserve comments mean for interest rate cuts, with tech stocks under pressure as Oracle ( ORCL ) stock slid.\nThe Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) sank over 1.4%, while the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) fell around 0.9%, with both backing off slight opening gains as tech weakness returned. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) lost 0.3%, after US stocks finished mixed in Tuesday's session .\n\nAfter weeks in a data vacuum, Wall Street is trying to find a clear signal in a noisy November jobs report to pinpoint a path for interest rates next year. Markets are also waiting for the other data shoe to drop: Thursday's update on consumer inflation in November.\nIn a clue to the path ahead, Fed governor Chris Waller said Wednesday that the central bank still has scope to cut rates, hinting at \"50 to 100 basis points\" of room. Another key policymaker, the New York Fed's John Williams, is speaking at a separate appearance.\n\nMeanwhile, AI trade worries rattled tech stocks again following a Financial Times report that Oracle's $10 billion data center project has lost the backing of private lender Blue Owl Capital. It comes amid scrutiny of increasing use of debt and off-balance-sheet moves to fund tech companies' capital spending on AI infrastructure, despite persistent questions over demand for the tech. Oracle shares fell nearly 6%.\nThat intensifies the spotlight on Micron Technology's ( MU ) quarterly results, due after the bell on Wednesday. Its report should help paint a clearer picture of demand on the AI semiconductor side of the market, as the company supplies chips for Nvidia's ( NVDA ) server systems.\nElsewhere in corporates, Netflix ( NFLX ) stock rose after Warner Bros. Discovery's ( WBD ) board called on shareholders to reject a rival bid from Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ), questioning funding guarantees.\nLIVE 20 updates\n9 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nGold climbs near record while silver squeeze sends precious metal skyrocketing The price of precious metals jumped on Wednesday as the broader markets sank.\nGold ( GC=F ) neared a record high, extending its year-to-date gains to more than 60%.\nMeanwhile, silver (SI=F) jumped 5% on Wednesday, touching new highs amid what appeared to be a short squeeze, as traders who had bet on falling prices were forced to cover their positions, driving prices higher.\n\n55 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nBitcoin hovers at $86,000 as token faces 'lackluster' end of 2025 Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hovered near $86,000 on Wednesday as Wall Street remained wary of a meaningful rebound heading into the end of the year.\nRecent jitters over AI-related stocks and speculation over who will take over Fed Chair Jerome Powell's position next year may be keeping a lid on prices.\n\"For a while, the market was convinced that ultra-dove Kevin Hassett was a shoo-in for the next Fed Chair role, but now Kevin Warsh — a far more hawkish candidate — appears to be emerging as the frontrunner,\" Coin Bureau investment analyst and co-founder Nic Puckrin said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nToday at 6:45 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nGE Vernova stock pulls back after Oracle data center snafu casts doubts on AI boom GE Vernova ( GEV ) stock was one of the AI-related plays getting crushed in the wake of Oracle's ( ORCL ) nearly 5% slide on Wednesday.\nShares of the energy infrastructure company, which spun off from General Electric ( GE ) in 2024, dropped nearly 8% in midday trading as valuation concerns came to the forefront. Year to date, GE Vernova stock has run up 93%, inclusive of a 15% gain last Wednesday, after the company announced plans to roll out a fuel cell business for data centers at its investor day.\n\nGE Vernova has been seen as a beneficiary of the AI infrastructure build-out, as demand for energy transmission and grid integration is booming. According to RBC analyst Christopher Dendrinos, GE Vernova's electrification backlog has grown 4x since 2022 and is projected to double again by 2028.\nBut news that private lender Blue Owl Capital ( OWL ) will not back a $10 billion deal for Oracle's data center threw funding for that build-out into greater scrutiny on Wednesday.\nStill, GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik emphasized in an interview last week that the company has \"a lot of other drivers\" of demand. Strazik said that only 10% of the company's current backlog comes from hyperscalers, which could grow to approximately one-third of the backlog over the next three years.\n\nToday at 6:06 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nMedline stock begins trading above $35 per share Medline ( MDLN ) shares began trading on Wednesday afternoon at $35 each. The stock popped over 26% above the expected IPO price of $29.\nEarly trading gave the company, which makes gauze, hospital beds, and a host of other medical supplies, a market capitalization of $28.65 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nRead more here.\n\nToday at 5:15 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nThe stock market is being powered by 10 stocks that are fueling AI bubble fears Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes:\nRead the full story here.\n\nToday at 4:30 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nFed's Waller favors more rate cuts next year Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:\nRead more here.\n\nToday at 3:44 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nAI chip stocks sink as tech names come under pressure The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) led a partial market downturn as stocks diverged on Wednesday.\nAI chip names fell across the board, with Google ( GOOG ) TPU supplier Broadcom ( AVGO ) sinking 3% and Nvidia ( NVDA ) dropping 2%. AI chipmaking machine producer ASML ( ASML ) also shed 3%, while contract semiconductor manufacturer TSMC ( TSM ) dropped nearly 2% and Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) edged down just over 1%,\n\nToday at 3:35 PM UTC Myles Udland\n\nMedline raises $6.3 billion in year's biggest IPO The biggest IPO of 2025 is getting in just before the finish line.\nMedical supply giant Medline ( MDLN ) said late Tuesday that it had raised $6.26 billion in its IPO, selling a little over 216 million shares at $29 a piece, with the stock set to begin trading on Wednesday. The IPO values Medline at upwards of $50 billion, based on a total of roughly 1.8 billion Class A and Class B shares outstanding.\nThe deal caps the best year for the IPO market since 2021 , with Wall Street's outlook for deals and new issues even more optimistic heading into 2026 .\nRecent reports have indicated that SpaceX is likely to go public in 2026 , with the company having recently struck a deal for insiders to sell stock in Elon Musk's rocketry and satellite business that valued the company at $800 billion.\nMajor AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic are also expected to explore going public within the next 18 months, according to The Information . Database giant Databricks, which raised money at a $134 billion valuation this week, said it could explore a public offering as soon as next year.\n\nToday at 3:02 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nOracle drops on debt concerns Oracle ( ORCL ) shares fell nearly 4% Wednesday after the Financial Times reported that private lender Blue Owl Capital will not back a $10 billion deal for its next data center as the burgeoning AI cloud player rushes to secure computing capacity and investors scrutinize its mounting use of debt to do so.\n\nThe decline put Oracle shares down nearly 18% for the month. The stock fell after the company's earnings last week showed its costs rising more than expected while bleeding more cash than anticipated. The tech firm's $248 billion in off-balance sheet lease obligations revealed in its quarterly SEC filing added to investor fears over its growing debt pile, while its over-reliance on OpenAI to meet its ambitious revenue targets has also sent shareholders backpedaling.\nThough Oracle execs said after its earnings results that it's committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating — it currently has a BBB rating on its bonds — investors haven't been so sure, piling into Oracle credit default swaps that saw spreads reach their highest level since 2009 last week.\n\nToday at 2:45 PM UTC\n\nStocks rise at the open Stocks rose briefly at the market open as Wall Street weighed the latest jobs data and oil surged, while Oracle ( ORCL ) shares slid.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) moved up nearly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) added 0.3% after US stocks finished mixed in Tuesday's session .\n\nToday at 2:05 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nGeneral Mills stock rises as revenue tops estimates, guidance reaffirmed General Mills stock ( GIS ) climbed about 1% in premarket trading after earnings missed estimates, but revenue came in better than expected for the quarter.\nThe Cheerios maker reported fiscal second quarter earnings per share of $0.78 on revenue of $4.86 billion. Wall Street analysts estimated earnings of $1.04 on revenue of $4.78 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nGeneral Mills' efforts to invest in its brands, divest its North American yogurt business, and unfavorable trade comparisons weighed on the results, the company said.\nFor the full fiscal year, which ends in May, General Mills reaffirmed it expects net sales growth to range from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%. Adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS are both expected to fall 10% to 15% for the year.\nGeneral Mills' guidance was largely in line with analysts' expectations. Although many on the Street believe the packaged foods company is facing some challenges, analysts noted that these challenges are already reflected in the stock price.\n\"Underlying fundamentals remain challenging, but we think many are of the view that this is largely reflected in Street estimates and with shares trading at a discount to PF peers on a historical basis and no major surprises expected for the print itself, many find it difficult to see how the stock could trade lower,\" UBS analysts wrote in a note ahead of the results.\n\nToday at 1:30 PM UTC Brett LoGiurato\n\nHut 8 shares surge as ex-bitcoin miner signs $7 billion AI data center lease Reuters reports :\n\nRead more here .\n\nToday at 1:00 PM UTC\n\nAmerica's biggest banks are ending 2025 on top with big growth goals and markets 'wide open' Bank of America ( BAC ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Wells Fargo ( WFC ), and Citigroup ( C ) are setting ambitious plans for growth in 2026 as they wrap up an upbeat 2025.\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nRead more here .\n\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC Karen Friar\n\nWarner Bros Discovery board urges shareholders to reject rival bid from Paramount The contest for Warner Bros.

Bitcoin is now about 7% lower for the year. It was trading at about $87,100 at noon in Singapore on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the latest decline is a much milder correction than in the previous three down years, it’s happened against a vastly different backdrop. Since the last major crypto crash in 2022, institutional adoption has widened, regulation has matured, and the industry has found its arguably most important champion in US President Donald Trump.\nThe rapid lurch lower since bitcoin hit a record of over $126,000 in early October has confounded bulls and left cryptoassets struggling to find a footing. Volumes are low, investors are bailing on bitcoin ETFs and derivatives markets are showing a lack of appetite for betting on a rebound. Even massive buying from the dominant bitcoin whale — Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ) — hasn’t been enough to turn things around.\n“Most are surprised by the lack of follow-through despite so many positive catalysts,” said Pratik Kala, a portfolio manager at hedge fund Apollo Crypto.\nRead more here .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "1 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock You'll Want to Own Next Year\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:55 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points This company operates market-leading businesses in three industries.\nMassive investments in AI infrastructure have weighed heavily on its free cash flow.\nIt's showing strong operating results that should eventually lead to an increase in free cash flow.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been the driving force behind many of the stock market's biggest winners over the last three years. Big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have seen their share prices reach new all-time highs, driven by strong AI-related business results across both software and cloud computing . Both companies are pushing toward $4 trillion valuations. Meanwhile, Nvidia briefly touched a $5 trillion market cap this year as big tech companies continue to buy up its graphics processing units (GPUs) as fast as it can sell them.\n\nBut not every AI-related stock has zoomed higher this year. One company, in particular, has seen its stock stuck in neutral, climbing less than 5% this year while the S&P 500 is up more than 17%. But that could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors. In fact, the stock could produce very strong returns as soon as next year. Here's why you'll want to own Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2026.\nA dominant force across three major industries Amazon may have started as a small online bookseller, but it has grown to be much more. Its marketplace offers nearly everything you can think of, and it can ship millions of items to U.S. customers within one to two days thanks to its massive fulfillment network. It has built a burgeoning advertising business that has expanded from retail media ads to video ads served through its Prime Video service and other streaming partners. And it's the largest cloud computing platform in the world, operating Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAll three businesses are experiencing rapid growth and demonstrating strong momentum.\nThe online retail business continues to produce high-single-digit revenue growth despite generating over $250 billion in annual sales. Its third-party seller services, which enable other businesses to sell through Amazon's marketplace, are showing accelerating growth, up 11% in the most recent quarter. The entire ecosystem rests on Amazon's Prime subscription service, which has steadily pushed subscription revenue 10% higher.\nAmazon's advertising business is accelerating, climbing 24% in the most recent quarter, reaching a $70 billion run rate. Prime Video is a key catalyst for that continued growth, as 80% of subscribers are on the ad-supported tier and Amazon adds more live sports content to the service. It has also partnered with several major streaming platforms through its demand-side ad-buying platform.\n\nStory Continues\nOverall, Amazon is seeing operating margin expansion in its North American and International reporting segments. A couple of factors are leading to higher margins. First, advertising sales have extremely high margins relative to product sales and even third-party services. The second is that Amazon's improvements to its fulfillment center have reduced its shipping costs. Shipping costs have increased at a slower pace than paid units in each of the last eight quarters.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing business remains the company's most important segment, accounting for most of the operating income and growing quickly. Management has successfully reaccelerated revenue growth for the segment, achieving 20% year-over-year growth last quarter, driven by strong triple-digit revenue from AI services. That rate is significantly slower than both Microsoft and Google, but AWS is also growing off a larger base.\nCEO Andy Jassy expects sales to continue at the current pace for the foreseeable future. That's supported by a growing backlog, which reached $200 billion by the end of the third quarter. Amazon also signed deals in October with commitments exceeding everything it booked in Q3, so there's a lot of momentum behind the cloud computing segment to keep growing.\n\nAmazon looks undervalued right now Amazon is investing heavily to capitalize on the opportunities it sees in both cloud computing and e-commerce. It spent $90 billion through the first three months of the year on capital expenditures (capex), and management expects full-year cash capex to come in around $125 billion. That's well above Alphabet's planned $92 billion in capex for the year and slightly more than Microsoft (which spent $80 billion through the first nine months of the year).\n\nThat high spending has weighed heavily on Amazon's free cash flow, which fell to $14.8 billion over the trailing-12-month period. That's down from $47.7 billion in the previous 12-month period. Indeed, the high capex has hit Amazon's cash flow much harder than capex has hit either Microsoft or Alphabet. That's in part because its competitors have high-margin software businesses that continue to grow quickly, offsetting their spending, while Amazon's retail business still has relatively low margins.\nBut Amazon has gone through multiple investment cycles throughout its history. Each time, it has emerged with much stronger cash flows than it had before the investment cycle. Considering the growing backlog of cloud computing contracts and the secular trend toward migrating to cloud computing services, investors should remain confident that the pattern will hold. While management expects to increase its capex further in 2026, free cash flow will eventually trough as capital intensity levels off. With strong operating cash-flow growth, Amazon should see a rapid recovery in free cash flow.\n\nAmazon has historically traded around 50 times its free cash flow near its peaks. With its current market cap of $2.5 trillion, investors are merely expecting it to return to its peak free-cash-flow levels from a bit over a year ago. It seems very likely that Amazon will far exceed those levels over time, pushing its stock price significantly higher.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "How will the stock market perform in 2026? Wall Street pros weigh in.\n\nMary Cunningham\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:45 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.\nThe S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17— a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.\nThe key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an AI bubble percolate?\n\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"\nOther forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.\nWhat will drive stocks in 2026?\nSeveral catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.\n\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the group said in its equity outlook. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"\nThe AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.\nAnother area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers .\n\nStory Continues\nGrowth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.\n\"That's something we haven't seen,\" he said. \"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it.\"\n\nAdam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.\nStill, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.\n\nIs my money safe?\nThe biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.\nAI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with earnings growth from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.\n\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.\nAmid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.\n\nIn its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.\nCrisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped . The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.\n\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"\nStill, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.\n\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.\nEye Opener: New video emerges of Nick Reiner moments before arrest\nWhat we know after Rob and Michele Reiner's son Nick arrested in their deaths\nMore details emerge about Rob Reiner and wife Michele's killings\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

It's the undisputed leader in accelerated computing. However, Nvidia's chips aren't the only reason why.\n\nThe company's graphics processing unit (GPU) stacks combine hardware, software, and platform solutions designed to support applications from gaming to professional visualization and accelerated computing. I believe Nvidia's vast array of solutions will reaccelerate growth in the stock price next year.\nAI solutions for the future Nvidia's revenue soared to a record $57 billion in the recently reported fiscal third quarter. That was a remarkable 62% year-over-year jump.\nSome investors believe that this kind of growth is unsustainable. That seems like a sensible position considering that level of sales. I predict that another leg of sustainable growth lies ahead that investors will begin to recognize in 2026. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has already publicly signaled what it will be, too.\n\nEven if the AI data center buildout slows, as some believe will happen, Jensen Huang sees a long growth runway for his company over the next decade. In an interview earlier this year, Huang stated, \"This is going to be the decade of AV [autonomous vehicles], robotics, autonomous machines.\"\nNvidia will supply both hardware and software to support that development. The company produces embedded systems for autonomous and robotic applications. Nvidia's Drive ADX platform provides high-level compute performance for the highest level of self-driving technology.\nThe company calls its Jetson platform \"the ideal software for robotics and generative AI at the edge.\" It's powered by Nvidia's leading Blackwell GPU, helping to generate more hardware sales, too.\n\nInvestors should continue to monitor data center growth to track the state of Nvidia's business. However, watching developments in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and machines should provide confidence that a new leg of sales growth for Nvidia is likely. That, in turn, should drive the stock higher after shares have consolidated over the past couple of months.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Micron's Make-or-Break Moment: Can AI Hype Justify a 176% Surge?\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nMarket participants are bracing for Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) to report earnings after Wednesday's close, with the bar set high as skepticism around the AI trade begins to surface. The shares have surged 176% in 2025, ranking as the fifth-best performer in the S&P 500 and marking Micron's strongest year since 2013, well ahead of the roughly 40% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. That momentum has softened in recent sessions, with the stock down about 12% over the past four days following a Dec. 10 high, suggesting investors may be reassessing expectations ahead of the report.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Sign with MU.\nIs MU fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe company is expected to post strong growth as sustained spending on AI data centers supports demand for its high-bandwidth memory chips, but the market appears focused on whether that momentum is still accelerating. Recent sharp declines in Oracle and Broadcom, both of which fell 11% in a single session last week, have highlighted how quickly sentiment can turn on perceived AI beneficiaries. Some investors may now be adopting a more cautious stance, waiting for clearer signals on how durable data-center growth could be before re-engaging with the sector.\nValuation remains a central part of the Micron debate. Despite this year's rally, the shares trade at roughly 11 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, the lowest multiple among the 30 stocks in the semiconductor index, which trades closer to 25 times forward earnings. That discount stands out against peers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ), and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), which command significantly higher multiples. At the same time, expectations for Micron's fundamentals have been moving higher, with consensus forecasts for fiscal 2026 net earnings up 16% over the past month and more than 50% over the past quarter, while revenue estimates have risen by more than 20% over the past three months. With enthusiasm elevated and memory demand still cyclical, the upcoming earnings report could either reinforce the view that Micron is reasonably valued or test how much optimism is already reflected in the shares.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "My Surprising Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Pick for 2026\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Investors have become impatient with the lack of immediate results from Amazon's increased spending.\nAmazon is adding more computing capacity to Amazon Web Services.\nAdvertising was Amazon's fastest-growing segment in the third quarter.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nThe \" Magnificent Seven \" is the name given to the group of Nvidia , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , Meta , Tesla , and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . These seven companies are bundled together because they have driven much of the stock market's gains in recent years. As of Dec. 15, they are seven of the world's top nine most valuable companies and represent nearly 35% of the S&P 500 .\nSo far this year, every \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has produced double-digit returns except for one: Amazon.\nOnce the face of growth stocks, Amazon has lagged over the past year, frustrating its investors along the way. Despite that retreat, Amazon may be positioned to bounce back in 2026.\nWhy has Amazon's stock been lagging? There hasn't been one issue that's caused Amazon's underperformance. It's more a combination of factors. First, Amazon has spent a lot of money this year, with capital expenditures (capex) of around $90 billion through the first nine months of 2025.\nGiven how much Amazon has been spending (mostly on AI infrastructure), investors have been wanting more to show for it -- especially when it comes to Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth. With many of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks making big splashes in AI, some people viewed Amazon as falling behind in the race.\nAmazon's heavy spending has weighed on its free cash flow, and that's not something investors typically like without seeing more immediate results. Add in how expensive Amazon's stock has been, and there was little room for error in many investors' eyes.\nAWS is positioning itself for the future AWS may not have been producing the results that we've grown used to seeing over the years, but investors jumping ship seems like a premature overreaction (which is no surprise if you know investors). Yes, AWS has been losing market share to Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, but it's still the world's largest cloud platform by far.\n\nCloud platforms are, and will continue to be, crucial to AI training and scaling. That's why Amazon has been focusing so much on building out more infrastructure and adding computing capacity. It has added more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months and plans to double its capacity through 2027.\n\nStory Continues\nThis investment is noteworthy because, according to calculations from investment bank Oppenheimer , each incremental gigawatt of capacity could add $3 billion in revenue. The high capex might be weighing on Amazon's financials right now, but it's poised to pay off in the long term.\nAmazon has an underrated profit machine There's no doubt that AWS is Amazon's profit engine, accounting for most of its operating income. However, advertising is a high-margin business that has been growing steadily over the past couple of years.\nOn one hand, Amazon has access to data from its millions of customers and Prime members, making it more effective at helping advertisers with targeted ad campaigns. They know what customers buy, when they buy it, what they watch, what they listen to, what they browse, and other information that allows advertisers to target with greater precision.\nOn the other hand, Amazon's massive reach means it has plenty of places to set these ads. Whether it's online, when you search for a specific product, stream something on Prime Video, watch Twitch, or listen to music, there's no shortage of real estate for advertisers looking to reach potential customers. Amazon also announced that it recently struck partnerships that allow its advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix , Spotify , and SiriusXM .\n\nIn the third quarter, Amazon's advertising services revenue grew 24% to $17.7 billion, outpacing its revenue from subscriptions ($12.5 billion). Beyond revenue growth, advertising is a high-margin business that can help Amazon boost its overall profitability. I expect the momentum to continue in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Google teams with Meta’s PyTorch to chip away at Nvidia’s moat, Reuters says\n\nLuke Juricic\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:17 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nInvesting.com -- Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is intensifying efforts to make its proprietary artificial intelligence hardware more compatible with the industry’s leading software, a move aimed at challenging NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) grip on the AI computing market, Reuters reported Wednesday.\n\nThe initiative, known internally as \"TorchTPU,\" focuses on optimizing Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to run PyTorch, an open-source framework originally developed by Meta Platforms Inc. PyTorch has become the global standard for AI development, and its seamless integration with Nvidia’s hardware has historically acted as a significant barrier to entry for competing chipmakers.\nFor years, Google’s TPUs were primarily optimized for its own internal software framework, Jax. While efficient for Google’s internal workloads, this requirement created a \"bottleneck\" for external enterprise customers who have already built their AI infrastructure on PyTorch, according to the Reuters report, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe TorchTPU project represents a shift in organizational focus. By allocating more engineering resources to ensure TPUs are \"developer-friendly\" for the broader PyTorch ecosystem, Google aims to make its silicon a more viable alternative to Nvidia’s market-leading GPUs.\nThe push comes as Google Cloud seeks to prove to investors that its massive capital investments in AI hardware are yielding scalable returns.\nCloud Revenue: TPU adoption is a critical engine for Google’s cloud division, which competes with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.\nThe CUDA Moat: Wall Street analysts often cite Nvidia’s CUDA software as its primary competitive advantage. By natively supporting PyTorch, Google is attempting to neutralize that advantage.\nOpen-Source Strategy: To accelerate market uptake, Google is reportedly considering open-sourcing components of the new software bridge.\n\nWhile Nvidia remains the dominant provider of AI processors, the high cost and limited availability of its chips have led major tech firms to seek alternatives. Meta, one of Nvidia’s largest customers, has been a key proponent of open-source software like PyTorch to ensure hardware flexibility across the industry.\nBy creating a software bridge that allows developers to easily switch away from Nvidia hardware, Google seems set on positioning its own chips to undercut Nvidia’s premium pricing and force a more competitive environment across the AI data center market.\nNvidia stock is down 3.1% in late morning trading, while Alphabet has dropped 3% itself.\n\nStory Continues\nRelated articles\nGoogle teams with Meta’s PyTorch to chip away at Nvidia’s moat, Reuters says\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Amazon Set to Waste $10 Billion on OpenAI\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nAmazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) apparently cannot help itself. Media reports say it plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) reportedly plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI, a firm swarmed by competition.\nClearly, Amazon is trying to buy its way into the AI market when the bubble may be about to burst.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nOpenAI, which until recently has been the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world, has raised money from a long list of investors. Some are venture capitalists who are simply writing checks to get returns. However, another list consists of money or strategic deals with Microsoft, Oracle, Softbank, Nvidia, and, soon, Disney.\nWhat these tech investors are getting is a stake in a company that has had its spot at the top of the industry challenged by Gemini 3. That is an Alphabet Inc. ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) offering. It is also one that the company says will not make money until 2030, one that will need hundreds of billions of dollars to hit its ambiguous goals, and one that has a growing number of direct competitors. These competitors include divisions of public companies, well-funded xAI and Anthropic, and a legion of smaller companies.\n\nBloomberg reports, “OpenAI is in initial discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. and use its chips, a potential win for the online retailer’s effort to broaden its AI industry presence and compete with Nvidia Corp.” Amazon is a tiny player in the AI chip business. Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) dominates, with a market cap of $4.33 trillion, which makes it the most valuable company in the world. Put plainly, the Amazon deal is part of the dangerous “round tripping” that goes on in the industry. One company invests in another. The company that gets the investment uses the money to buy products or services from the investor.\nAmazon clearly has little chance of competing head-to-head with Nvidia, so it is buying its way into the market. And Amazon can hardly say it is getting special treatment from OpenAI. The Financial Times reports, “OpenAI has already locked in $1.5tn in long-term deals with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom to supply chips and other computing infrastructure.”\nOpenAI does have one important strategic advantage in an Amazon deal. Like the rest of the AI world, it does not want to be trapped in a world where Nvidia is the only arms supplier.\n\nStory Continues\nPeople have begun to ask whether the AI industry has created a valuation bubble. They are worried that the companies leading the race into AI will never make money. Many AI products are currently free. Investors worry that the data centers needed to run AI will take years to build and may not have enough electricity to run them. Still others believe that not all the large AI companies can survive in a brutally competitive market. The total of these investments will eventually move into the trillions of dollars.\n\nThe Amazon deal with OpenAI is another example that the train has run off the rails.\nAmazon Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Exclusive-Google works to erode Nvidia's software advantage with Meta's help\n\nReuters\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nDec 17 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google is working on a new initiative to make its artificial intelligence chips better at running PyTorch, the world’s most widely used AI software framework, in a move aimed at weakening Nvidia 's longstanding dominance of the AI computing market, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe effort is part of Google's aggressive plan to make its Tensor Processing ​Units a viable alternative to Nvidia's market-leading GPUs. TPU sales have become a crucial growth engine of Google's cloud revenue as it seeks to prove to investors that its AI investments are generating returns.\nBut ‌hardware alone is not enough to spur adoption. The new initiative, known internally as “TorchTPU,” aims to remove a key barrier that has slowed adoption of TPU chips by making them fully compatible and developer-friendly for customers who have already built their tech infrastructure using PyTorch software, the ‌sources said. Google is also considering open-sourcing parts of the software to speed uptake among customers, some of the people said.\n\nCompared with earlier attempts to support PyTorch on TPUs, Google has devoted more organizational focus, resources and strategic importance to TorchTPU, as demand grows from companies that want to adopt the chips but view the software stack as a bottleneck, the sources said.\nPyTorch, an open-source project heavily supported by Meta Platforms, is one of the most widely used tools for developers who make AI models. In Silicon Valley, very few developers write every line of code that chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices or Google will actually execute.\nInstead, those developers rely on tools like PyTorch, which is a ⁠collection of pre-written code libraries and frameworks that automate many common tasks in ‌developing AI software. Originally released in 2016, PyTorch’s history has been closely tied to Nvidia’s development of CUDA, the software that some Wall Street analysts regard as the company’s strongest shield against competitors.\n\nNvidia’s engineers have spent years ensuring that software developed with PyTorch runs as fast and efficiently as possible on its chips. Google, by contrast, has long ‍had its internal armies of software developers use a different code framework called Jax, and its TPU chips use a tool called XLA to make that code run efficiently. Much of Google’s own AI software stack and performance optimization has been built around Jax, widening the gap between how Google uses its chips and how customers want to use them.\nA Google Cloud spokesperson did not comment on the specifics of the project, but confirmed to Reuters that the move would provide customers with choice.\n\nStory Continues\n\"We ​are seeing massive, accelerating demand for both our TPU and GPU infrastructure,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our focus is providing the flexibility and scale developers need, regardless of the hardware they choose to build on.\"\nTPU FOR CUSTOMERS\nAlphabet had ‌long reserved the lion’s share of its own chips, or TPUs, for in-house use only. That changed in 2022, when Google’s cloud computing unit successfully lobbied to oversee the group that sells TPUs. The move drastically increased Google Cloud's allocation of TPUs and as customers' interest in AI has grown, Google has sought to capitalize by ramping up production and sales of TPUs to external customers.\n\nBut the mismatch between the PyTorch frameworks used by most of the world’s AI developers and the Jax frameworks that Google’s chips are currently most finely tuned to run means that most developers cannot easily adopt Google’s chips and get them to perform as well as Nvidia’s without undertaking significant, extra engineering work. Such work takes time and money in the fast-paced AI race.\nIf successful, Google's “TorchTPU” initiative could significantly reduce switching costs for companies that want alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia’s dominance has been reinforced ⁠not only by its hardware but by its CUDA software ecosystem, which is deeply embedded in PyTorch and has become the ​default method by which companies train and run large AI models.\n\nEnterprise customers have been telling Google that TPUs are harder to adopt ​for AI workloads because they historically required developers to switch to Jax, a machine-learning framework favored internally at Google, rather than PyTorch, which most AI developers already use, the sources said.\nJOINT EFFORTS WITH META\nTo speed development, Google is working closely with Meta, the creator and steward of PyTorch, according to the sources. The two tech giants have been discussing deals ‍for Meta to access more TPUs, a move first reported ⁠by The Information.\nEarly offerings for Meta were structured as Google-managed services, in which customers like Meta installed Google's chips designed to run Google software and models, with Google providing operational support. Meta has a strategic interest in working on software that makes it easier to run TPUs, in a bid to lower inference costs and diversify its AI infrastructure away from Nvidia’s GPUs to gain negotiating power, the people ⁠said.\n\nMeta declined to comment.\nThis year, Google has begun selling TPUs directly into customers’ data centers rather than limiting access to its own cloud. Amin Vahdat, a Google veteran, was named head of AI infrastructure this month, reporting directly to CEO Sundar Pichai.\nGoogle needs that ‌infrastructure both to run its own AI products, including the Gemini chatbot and AI-powered search, and to supply customers of Google Cloud, which sells access to TPUs to companies such as ‌Anthropic.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu, Kenrick Cai and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This $500k Retirement Portfolio Pays $7,700 Per Month\n\nOmor Ibne Ehsan\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:55 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: SI=F\n\nTLT\n\nNVDA\n\nTLTW\n\nJEPI\n\nQuick Read iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF (TLTW) yields 13.92% through covered calls on long-term Treasury bonds.\nTLTW holdings likely benefit from Fed rate cuts as long-term bonds increase in value.\nA three-ETF strategy combining TLTW with gold and silver covered call funds targets 18.5% total yield.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nIf you want a $7.7k monthly income on a $500k portfolio, some may call you crazy, but it is still possible. ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF ( BATS:TLTW ) , FT Vest Gold Strategy Target Income ETF (BATS:IGLD) , and the Ubs Ag Etracs Silver Shares Covered Call ETN Exp 21 Apr 2033 (NASDAQ:SLVO) give you very high yields and a respectable safety profile that can boost your yields massively if you put them in your portfolio.\nThe catch is that these ETFs alone should not constitute your entire portfolio. If you have a portfolio of, say, $1 million, and you want a little more income, you can set aside $500k to higher-yielding ETFs like these to boost your overall income while having some funds to fall back on just in case they don't do as well.\n\nIf not, you should only chase more yield if you fall into any of the two following categories:\nYou are nearing the end of your retirement, and you want to end it lavishly.\nYou're struggling to make ends meet, and you're willing to sacrifice some safety for yield.\nA $500k portfolio churning out $7.7k per month means $92.4k a year, or an 18.5% yield. The following 3 ETFs can make that happen. You can squeeze out even more yield if you allocate more money to the higher-yielding ones, but I'll assume you're just going to split your money equally among them for the sake of this article.\nFT Vest Gold Strategy Target Income ETF (IGLD) The FT Vest Gold Strategy Target Income ETF gives you exposure to the price movements of gold via the popular SPDR Gold Trust ETF ( NYSEARCA:GLD ) while also generating a consistent monthly income. Simply put, it tracks gold but adds extra income by writing call options on gold and then collecting premiums.\n\nYour typical covered call ETF that targets the stock market also generates its income this way. The difference is that gold is much more likely to stay solid through a recession. One bad jobs report, or a major company like Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) reporting a bad quarter, can send covered-call ETFs like JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF ( NYSE:JEPI ) down by double digits. They're only flashy today due to the extended rally.\n\nStory Continues\nIGLD has a stronger foundation as gold itself looks incredibly strong right now, with central banks worldwide stockpiling gold. Sanctions on Russia have caused gold exports from the country to plunge. It's a triple whammy that favors gold when you take the shaky global economy into account.\nIGLD yields 7.39% with an expense ratio of 0.85%, or $85 per $10,000. It's steep, but you won't find a higher-yielding name if you want to buy something that targets GLD.\n\niShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF (TLTW) The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF executes a very similar strategy, this time with U.S. Treasury bonds. It holds shares of another ETF called the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( NASDAQ:TLT ) , which holds U.S. bonds expiring in 20+ years.\nThen, it uses monthly covered call options on those holdings to boost income.\n\nAgain, this is much better than your run-of-the-mill covered call ETF in terms of safety. Bonds are not going to shift under your feet, because they're the safest asset you can hold. Besides, you are likely to get upside on top of the generous yield as Fed interest rates come down. The Fed lowered its interest rates last week, and this is going to make long-term bonds more expensive as they already have secured a higher yield until they mature.\nAnd even if a recession hits, I expect TLTW and TLT to go up, not down. TLT went from $95 to over $122 in a few months as interest rates were cut drastically in 2008. Today, TLT trades below $90 and snaps back quickly as Wall Street gets hungrier for yield. This will translate into more upside for TLTW, as it holds TLT.\n\nThe catch is that TLTW will underperform if the TLT remains flat, which is unlikely to stand the case as the Fed is cutting.\nTLTW yields 13.92%. The expense ratio is 0.35%, or $35 per $10,000.\nUbs Ag Etracs Silver Shares Covered Call ETN Exp 21 Apr 2033 (SLVO) The Ubs Ag Etracs Silver Shares Covered Call ETN Exp 21 Apr 2033 tracks the performance of an index that mimics owning shares of a silver ETF. You benefit from rises in silver prices, but your upside is capped each month. It's very similar to IGLD but more aggressive.\nDo note that this is not an ETF. It is a debt note from UBS (credit risk involved), and it matures on April 21, 2033.\n\nSLVO has long been a loser in the market, as it did not offer any capital appreciation until very recently. If you reinvested the dividends, it would still get you 2% to 3% a year.\nHowever, what changed the equation is that silver prices have tripled since 2024. This is due to unceasing demand from multiple sectors like solar, AI, and more. Plus, silver is seen as a safe haven like gold. Many believe it can still deliver multibagger returns from here as silver's valuation still pales in comparison to the historical gold/silver ratio.\nSLVO is very under-the-radar and gets you a 34.73% yield. The expense ratio is 0.65%, or $65 per $10,000.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

The talks, which remain preliminary and subject to change, could value OpenAI north of $500 billion and may involve the ChatGPT creator adopting Amazon's Trainium chips. If the discussions progress, the arrangement could represent an incremental but meaningful step for Amazon's semiconductor ambitions, particularly as large AI developers begin to test alternatives to Nvidia's dominant GPU offerings.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs MSFT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTrainium is positioned as a core part of Amazon's broader AI strategy alongside Amazon Web Services, which remains the largest global provider of cloud computing and data storage. Despite that scale, AWS has faced stiff competition in attracting AI developers from rivals such as Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), one of OpenAI's largest backers, as well as platforms linked to Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) and Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), both of which have been evaluating non-Nvidia chip options. Amazon has suggested that Trainium chips could handle AI workloads more cheaply and efficiently than Nvidia's market-leading GPUs, an argument aimed at customers seeking cost-effective infrastructure as AI spending accelerates.\n\nThe negotiations between OpenAI and Amazon reportedly began around October, following a corporate restructuring at OpenAI that resulted in Microsoft taking a 27% ownership stake after nearly a year of talks. OpenAI was most recently valued at $500 billion in an employee share sale, briefly placing it ahead of SpaceX as the world's largest startup and highlighting the intensity of investor interest in AI leaders. At the same time, some market observers have warned that parts of the AI funding cycle could be vulnerable to excess, particularly where capital flows loop between suppliers and customers. Notably, OpenAI and Amazon announced last month that AWS will provide $38 billion of cloud computing capacity over seven years, a deal centered on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips, suggesting that any future shift toward Trainium would unfold alongside, rather than immediately replace, existing infrastructure commitments.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

There are already businesses winning the AI race, whether they make hardware, operate cloud platforms, or run the large language models that have become so popular among consumers.\nBut other industries are starting to embrace AI instead of fighting it, showcasing how seriously executive teams are taking this new technology to bolster their competitive positions.\nIn fact, a prominent streaming giant just decided to partner with a top AI company in a move that could impact the media and entertainment sector. Investors should take notice.\nThe House of Mouse is leaning into AI It was announced on Dec. 11 that Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) entered a three-year partnership with OpenAI , licensing more than 200 characters (including Mickey Mouse, characters from Inside Out and Frozen, and Marvel superheroes) for photo generation on ChatGPT and video generation on Sora by those apps' user bases. Disney can show these user-generated videos on Disney+, its streaming platform.\n\nWhat's more, Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI. And it will become a customer, integrating OpenAI's technology across its organization in various ways for its employees and to help create new products for customers.\nThis is clear evidence that Disney is leaning into AI, at a time when those in Hollywood worry about the tech's impact on content creation.\n\"Disney and OpenAI affirm a shared commitment to responsible use of AI that protects the safety of users and the rights of creators,\" the press release reads.\nThis is an encouraging statement for those in the industry, but it will be interesting to see how much appetite there is for watching AI-created videos from viewers.\nDisney benefits because it can potentially earn incremental revenue by leveraging its intellectual property in this new way. While it's not known if the business will make money from its characters' use on ChatGPT or Sora prompts, it can drive more engagement on Disney+ if this type of short-form content catches on. Disney could better compete with Meta Platforms ' Reels on Facebook and Instagram and Alphabet 's YouTube Shorts. There is intense competition for attention .\n\nStory Continues\nAnd it gives Disney a first-mover advantage. Perhaps if AI-generated videos go viral, investors could see similar moves by Netflix , for example.\nOne obvious critique of this decision might be that Disney is selling out and diluting the value of its intellectual property, making its famous characters available to the masses. With ChatGPT counting 800 million weekly users (as of early November), however, this is a good example of a media and entertainment powerhouse attempting to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nInvestors can find value in the streaming market This partnership highlights just how valuable Disney's intellectual property is. With characters, storylines, and franchises that span Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, no company can go toe-to-toe with this depth and breadth of content. It makes sense that OpenAI would want to sign a deal with an industry leader. This also suggests there has been significant demand from ChatGPT and Sora users to be more creative and work with Disney characters rather than other studios' intellectual property.\n\nFrom an investment point of view, those looking to put capital to work in the streaming industry might want to consider Disney. It has become a leader in the streaming wars, with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN providing a full range of content for an entire household. And its experiences segment is extremely profitable.\nShares currently trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.8. It's difficult to find value like this in the stock market these days.\nShould you buy stock in Walt Disney right now?

The program awarded $1.5 million in AI cloud compute and inference credits to startups selected from more than 250 applicants across 60+ countries.\nRLWRLD was selected as the top winner following evaluations by a judging panel that included leaders from NVIDIA, OpenAI, ABB, Physical Intelligence, and venture firms such as Khosla Ventures, Accel, Next47, and Shanda Grab Ventures. Judges assessed finalists on technical originality, scalability, and readiness for real-world deployment.\nAs the first-place winner in the Foundation Models category, RLWRLD received $150,000 in Nebius AI Cloud compute and inference credits, accelerated by NVIDIA AI infrastructure.\n\nThe Nebius Robotics & Physical AI Awards were created to spotlight startups building the models and systems required to deploy Physical AI in real industrial environments. Sixteen companies were recognized across categories spanning Foundation Models, Simulation, Robot Runtime, Industrial Deployment, and Vision AI.\nRLWRLD’s work focuses on building robot foundation models designed for high-difficulty manipulation and reliable industrial deployment, rather than technology demonstrations for general-purpose robotics. At the core of its platform is RLDX, a proprietary robotics foundation model capable of controlling a 15-degree-of-freedom robotic hand, enabling precise manipulation tasks that require human-level dexterity.\nJudges also cited RLWRLD’s use of high-fidelity, multimodal industrial data and its active collaboration with industry partners as indicators of the company’s commercial readiness, particularly for manufacturing and logistics environments where reliability and precision are critical.\n“Winning this category reinforces our belief that Physical AI needs foundation models built for the real world, not just controlled demos,” said Jung-hee Ryu, CEO of RLWRLD . “This recognition reflects the progress we’ve made working directly with industry partners to deploy our technology.”\n\nStory Continues\nFollowing the award, RLWRLD plans to expand global partnerships and accelerate commercial deployment of its foundation models across humanoid and industrial robotics, with a focus on manufacturing and logistics environments in the U.S. and Asia.\nAbout RLWRLD\nFounded in 2024, RLWRLD is a Physical AI startup developing robot foundation models that enable machines to see, sense, and act with human-like dexterity and cognition.

      "Content": "The stock market is being powered by 10 stocks that are fueling AI bubble fears\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nUpdated Wed, December 17, 2025 at 6:28 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\n^SPX\n\nGOOG\n\nIf you're in the \"stock market is in a bubble\" camp, look no further than the composition of the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nThe top 10 stocks now account for roughly 32% of S&P 500 earnings and over 41% of total market capitalization — levels not seen since at least 1980, according to new data from Barclays strategist Venu Krishna.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been the primary driver of this market power concentration. Those seven companies — Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Apple ( AAPL ) — are essentially powering the artificial intelligence boom.\nThese stocks are up on average 21% this year compared to a 15% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data. Alphabet is the top performer with an advance of 62% amid optimism on its new Gemini 3 model.\nIn turn, the valuation of the S&P 500 has reached a level even most bulls would agree is on the rich side. Krishna's work reveals the S&P 500 is trading at the 91st percentile relative to its 10-year valuation history.\n\"Complacency\" could ignite an AI bubble, Deutsche Bank strategist Adrian Cox told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (video above).\nRead more: How AI, unemployment, and interest rates could shape the stock market and your investments next year\nIndeed, complacency appears to have settled in, despite the risks investors had to endure this year.\nRemember the \"Liberation Day\" tariff spectacle in April? The S&P 500 tanked 4.8% the day after President Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on April 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped a staggering 1,679 points.\n\nTariffs are now in effect, though they are not as severe as first advertised.\nAnd more recently, disappointments from AI darlings CoreWeave ( CRWV ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) have begun to call into question the near-term outlook for the AI trade.\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation in 2026 in the AI trade,\" Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye said on Opening Bid .\nAlphabet is Essaye's top AI pick for 2026, though he acknowledges there are likely to be winners and losers from the Magnificent Seven complex next year.\n\"I think companies like Oracle that [are] not overextended financially but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that is tied to open AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" Essaye added. \"There's going to be some pretty serious bifurcation. We've seen it in the last, say, two months of 2025. I think that gets worse in 2026.\"\n\nStory Continues\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 17)\n\nJoel South\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:25 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTM\n\nTOYOF\n\nTSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nShares of Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) have retreated 3.4% in the past week, as it announced the acquisition of SchedMD and a partnership with Mistral AI, and in the wake of the White House approving sales of H200 chips to certain Chinese customers. Meanwhile, insiders continue to sell shares. Nvidia’s stock is 22.8% higher than six months ago, outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in that time.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points U.S.-China trade relations have presented headwinds, but Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) is also the dominant AI chipmaker in the market, and the company’s profitability remains strong.\nHere is a look at where Nvidia stock could be headed for the rest of this year and into the next.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nNote that gains for the chipmaker in that time have helped wipe away the steep drop the stock suffered early in 2025, after it reported it would take a $5.5 billion charge tied to the H20 chip export restrictions to China. While some analysts have raised price targets, others caution about ongoing headwinds due to uncertainty surrounding future U.S.-China trade relations and the potential for stricter regulations. The third-quarter report was stellar on the top and bottom lines due to strong growth in the data center segment.\nDespite its challenges, the company's pivot to U.S. AI infrastructure investments signals resilience. With analysts eyeing robust data center demand, 24/7 Wall St. here explores whether Nvidia can sustain its recovery and drive further growth.\n\nWhy Invest in Nvidia? Nvidia faces significant hurdles as it navigates U.S.-China trade restrictions and intense market expectations. In the first quarter, export controls on its H20 AI chip—which had been designed specifically to circumvent export restrictions on advanced technology to China—led to the substantial write-down noted above. Analysts believed the ban could result in a $9 billion revenue hit. Some $700 million would affect fiscal first-quarter results, with the remaining $8 billion spread across the second and third quarters.\n\nU.S. tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures also threatened supply chain costs, particularly for components sourced globally, while competition from Huawei’s Ascend chips grows. These factors had analysts warning of margin pressure. Yet, Nvidia's profitability remains robust. The company has reportedly raised prices 10% to 15% on some of its most popular GPUs as a result of the tariffs. Gaming processor prices jumped 5% to 10%, while it hiked high-end AI GPUs as much as 15% to account for surging manufacturing costs and to keep its earnings stable.\n\nStory Continues\nYet investments in U.S. AI infrastructure, supported by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's $165 billion Arizona fab expansion, bolster Nvidia's supply chains and are backed by its $37.6 billion cash reserve.\nCEO Huang announced during his recent trip to South Korea that Nvidia will supply more than 260,000 advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to South Korean firms, including Samsung and Hyundai Motor. He believes AI has reached a \"virtuous cycle\" where improvements in the models lead to more investment, which in turn leads to further improvement and investment. He also expressed hope that trade talks between the U.S. and China might lead to a change in policy that allows Nvidia to resume sales of state-of-the-art chips in China. As mentioned, the U.S. president has now allowed the company to sell its advanced H200 AI chips to China.\n\nThe AI market is projected to grow at a 37% CAGR through 2030, according to Grand View Research. This supports Nvidia’s $170 billion fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, a 30% increase over the $130.5 billion it generated in 2025.\nNvidia as a Company In its third-quarter earnings report, Nvidia revenue totaled a record $57.01 billion, including $51.2 billion from its data center division. The total was up 66% year over year, largely fueled by the voracious demand for its AI chips.\nThe chipmaker invested $3.2 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, expanding Blackwell accelerator production and AI infrastructure. The company's capex has spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion to meet hyperscaler demand.\n\nU.S.-China trade restrictions still pose risks, even with the seeming thaw, tariffs could raise costs, which would explain the price hikes reportedly implemented. A 36% operating expense increase to $5.8 billion for R&D offset Nvidia's adjusted operating income of $37.8 billion.\nYet, Nvidia's growth is not solely tied to data centers. The company expanded its automotive segment, with a 32% year-over-year increase to $592 million, driven by partnerships with Toyota and Aurora Innovation for autonomous vehicles. This diversifies Nvidia's portfolio amid tariff uncertainties.\nNvidia has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of $65 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook exceeded analysts' consensus projection.\nNvidia as a Stock This has been a rollercoaster year for Nvidia shareholders. The stock dropped to a 52-week low of $86.62 in April. After an announced pause in U.S.-China tariffs and the first-quarter results, the share price recovered. It hit an all-time high of $212.19 in October, which had the company's market cap briefly over $5 trillion.\n\nWhile some insiders have been selling shares, analyst sentiment remains bullish. Of 64 analysts who cover the stock, 60 recommend buying shares, 11 of them with Strong Buy ratings. Their consensus one-year price target is $250.93, which signals over 41% upside potential from its current price. Targets range from $140 to $352 per share.\nCitigroup, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and others recently maintained their Buy-equivalent ratings. Evercore ISI has the street-high target price. It cited accelerating revenue growth, strong demand for Blackwell chips, an improving supply chain, and a significant pipeline. Yet, renowned investor Michael Burry is bearish on Nvidia.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$140.00\n−21.2%\nMedian\n$250.93\n41.2%\nHigh\n$352.00\n98.1%\n\nNvidia's AI dominance, 93% data center growth, and automotive partnerships with Toyota positioned the company for gains in 2025. However, tariff risks and DeepSeek’s competitive AI models require caution. The AI market's growth and the chipmaker's $47 billion second-quarter revenue position Nvidia to achieve its $170 billion full-year revenue target, while its cash buffer and Stargate Project role offer stability. Still, valuation concerns linger. Nvidia is a buy for growth-oriented investors, but others should use caution.\n\n24/7 Wall St.'s 2026 year-end price target for Nvidia is $300.14 per share, which would be a 68.9% gain. That estimate accounts for tariff risks, competition from DeepSeek, and potential Blackwell supply constraints. It also reflects Nvidia's AI dominance and second-quarter 2026 revenue guidance.\nTime to Sell Nvidia Stock as Michael Burry Takes Aim?\n\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are.

      "Content": "Marvell Technology Looks Undervalued as Artificial Intelligence Spending Surges\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Marvell Technology is one of the most undervalued AI stocks right now, and it's down by 25% this year.\nA sale and acquisition have positioned the company to become a long-term winner in the AI data center boom.\nA questionable rumor still weighs heavily on the stock despite Marvell Technology's CEO rebuking it.\n10 stocks we like better than Marvell Technology ›\n\nIf you want to find undervalued artificial intelligence (AI) stocks , you have to start with ones that aren't receiving as much hype. Nvidia is the most well-known growth stock right now, and Palantir Technologies is another AI leader that has attracted plenty of investors.\nHowever, fewer investors know about Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) , and a few controversial rumors have made the stock even cheaper. Marvell Technology is a custom AI chipmaker that investors may want to monitor.\nDispelling the rumors Marvell Technology looked undervalued for most of the year. Its revenue growth rates have steadily outpaced the stock's 25% year-to-date decline. However, Marvell took another hit when rumors swirled around that the company lost a lot of business from Amazon and Microsoft .\nThat type of news would be devastating for the company. AI chipmakers make most of their revenue from a small handful of tech companies , and losing two of the largest hyperscalers in the industry would limit future growth opportunities. Other tech companies may be wary of doing business with an AI chipmaker that lost Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nHowever, Marvell Technology CEO Matt Murphy poured cold water on the rumors when speaking with CNBC's Jim Cramer. Murphy told viewers that Marvell did not lose any business from those tech giants.\nThe debunked rumor continues to weigh on the stock price, which presents an opportunity for long-term investors. However, the credibility around this rumor isn't the only reason investors should appreciate the dip in Marvell Technology stock.\nMarvell's valuation hasn't moved as quickly as its revenue Marvell Technology has a 23.5 forward P/E ratio and continues to post impressive revenue growth. The chipmaker boosted its sales by 37% year over year in the third quarter of its fiscal 2026, ended Nov. 1, while operating income increased by 23% year over year.\nThe net income figure for the third quarter isn't the best for gauging the stock since that number includes the proceeds from a $2.5 billion sale of its automotive Ethernet business. It's a one-off event that inflated Marvell Technology's net income growth, but the company has maintained a net profit margin of roughly 10% in previous quarters.\n\nStory continues\nThis isn't even the first quarter of strong growth for fiscal 2026. Marvell delivered 63% and 58% year-over-year revenue growth rates in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2026. Its revenue and net income are moving in the right direction despite its stock price suggesting that the complete opposite has happened.\n\nMarvell Technology is locked into AI chip growth Marvell's $2.5 billion divestiture gave it more capital while freeing up resources to prioritize custom AI chips. However, the company didn't just stop with selling off a slower part of its business. The AI chipmaker acquired photonic fabric provider Celestial AI for $3.25 billion. The total acquisition may be valued at $5.5 billion if certain sales objectives are achieved.\n\nThe deal should help Marvell Technology scale faster in the burgeoning AI data center industry and boost demand for its AI chips. AWS Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services Dave Brown praised the December acquisition, casting even more doubt into rumors that Marvell Technology lost business from two tech giants.\nMarvell swapped a slow-growth business for a high-growth one that complements its AI ambitions nicely. Investors have not yet priced in this reality. Marvell shares traded above $100 per share to start the year, and it may be due for a rally to all-time highs soon enough.\nIf the AI chipmaker continues to post 30%-plus year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2027 and beyond, the mismatch between revenue growth and its current valuation will become more difficult to ignore.\n\nShould you buy stock in Marvell Technology right now?

      "Content": "Exclusive-How China built its ‘Manhattan Project’ to rival the West in AI chips\n\nFanny Potkin\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:17 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nINTC\n\nSSNLF\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nBy Fanny Potkin\nSINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence , smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. ​The smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\nNevertheless, China still faces ‌major technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government ‌initiative to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.\n\nStory Continues\nChinese electronics giant Huawei plays a key role coordinating a web of companies and state research institutes across the country involving thousands of engineers, according to the two people and a third source.\nThe people described it as China's version of the Manhattan Project, the U.S. wartime effort to develop the atomic bomb.\n\n“The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,” one of the people said. \"China wants the United States 100% kicked out of its supply chains.\"\nHuawei, the State Council of China, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to requests for comment.\nUntil now, only one company has mastered EUV technology: ASML, headquartered in Veldhoven, Netherlands. Its machines, which cost around $250 million, are indispensable for manufacturing the most advanced chips designed by companies like Nvidia and AMD—and produced by chipmakers such as TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.\nASML built its first working prototype of EUV technology in 2001, and told Reuters it took nearly two decades and billions of euros in R&D spending before it produced its first commercially-available chips in 2019.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small ⁠feat,” ASML told Reuters in a statement.\nASML's EUV systems are currently available to U.S. allies including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.\nStarting in 2018, the United States began pressuring ‌the Netherlands to block ASML from selling EUV systems to China. The restrictions expanded in 2022, when the Biden administration imposed sweeping export controls designed to cut off China's access to advanced semiconductor technology.\nThe controls targeted not just EUV systems but also older deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines that produce less-advanced chips like Huawei’s, aiming to keep China at least a generation behind in chipmaking capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said the Trump Administration has strengthened enforcement of export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and is working with partners \"to close loopholes as technology advances.”\nThe Dutch Ministry of Defence said the Netherlands is developing policies requiring “knowledge institutions” to perform personnel screenings to prevent access to sensitive technology “by individuals that have ill intentions or who are at risk of being pressured.”\nExport restrictions ‍have slowed China's progress toward semiconductor self-sufficiency for years, and constrained advanced chip production at Huawei, the two people and a third person said.\nThe sources spoke on condition they not be identified due to the confidentiality of the project.\n\nCHINA'S MANHATTAN PROJECT\nOne veteran Chinese engineer from ASML recruited to the project was surprised to find that his generous signing bonus came with an identification card issued under a false name, according to one of the people, who was familiar with his recruitment.\nOnce inside, he recognized other former ASML colleagues who were also working under aliases and was instructed to use their fake names at work to maintain secrecy, the person said. Another person independently confirmed that recruits were given fake IDs to conceal their identities from other workers inside the secure facility.\nThe guidance was clear, the two people said: Classified under national security, no one outside the compound could know what they were building—or that they were there at all.\n\nThe team includes recently retired, Chinese-born former ASML engineers and scientists—prime recruitment targets because they possess sensitive technical knowledge but face fewer professional constraints after leaving the company, ​the people said.\nTwo current ASML employees of Chinese nationality in the Netherlands told Reuters they have been approached by recruiters from Huawei since at least 2020.\nHuawei did not respond to requests for comment.\nEuropean privacy laws limit ASML's ability to track former employees. Though employees sign non-disclosure agreements, enforcing them across borders has proven difficult.\nASML won an $845 million judgment in 2019 against a former Chinese engineer accused of stealing trade secrets, but the defendant filed for bankruptcy and continues to ‌operate in Beijing with Chinese government support, according to court documents.\n\nASML told Reuters that it “vigilantly guards” trade secrets and confidential information.\n\"While ASML cannot control or restrict where former employees work, all employees are bound by the confidentiality clauses in their contracts,\" the company said, and it has \"successfully pursued legal action in response to the theft of trade secrets.”\nReuters was unable to determine if any legal actions have been taken against former ASML employees involved in China’s lithography program.\nThe company said it safeguards EUV knowledge by ensuring only select employees can access the information even inside the company.\nDutch intelligence warned in an April report that China \"used extensive espionage programmes in its attempts to obtain advanced technology and knowledge from Western countries,\" including recruiting \"Western scientists and employees of high-tech companies.”\n\nThe ASML veterans made the breakthrough in Shenzhen possible, the people said. Without their intimate knowledge of the technology, reverse-engineering the machines would have been nearly impossible.\nTheir recruitment was part of an aggressive drive China launched in 2019 for semiconductor experts working abroad, offering signing bonuses that started at 3 million to 5 million yuan ($420,000 to $700,000) and home-purchase subsidies, according to a Reuters review of government policy documents.\nRecruits included Lin Nan, ASML's former head of light source technology, whose team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Shanghai Institute of Optics has filed eight patents on EUV light sources in 18 months, according to patent filings.\nThe Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics did not respond to requests for comment. Lin could not be reached for comment.\n\nTwo additional people familiar with China’s recruitment efforts said some naturalized citizens of other countries were given Chinese passports and allowed to maintain dual citizenship.\nChina officially prohibits dual citizenship and did not answer questions on issuing passports.\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nINSIDE CHINA'S EUV FAB\nASML's most advanced EUV systems are roughly the size of a school bus, and weigh 180 tons. After failed attempts to replicate its size, the prototype inside the Shenzhen lab became many times larger to improve its ⁠power, according to the two people.\nThe Chinese prototype is crude compared to ASML's machines but operational enough for testing, the people said.\nChina's prototype lags behind ASML's machines largely because researchers have struggled to obtain optical systems like those from Germany's Carl Zeiss AG, one of ASML's ​key suppliers, the two people said.\n\nZeiss declined to comment.\nThe machines fire lasers at molten tin 50,000 times per second, generating plasma at 200,000 degrees Celsius. The light is focused using mirrors that take months to produce, according to Zeiss' website.\nChina's top research institutes have played key roles in developing homegrown ​alternatives, according to the two people.\nThe Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIOMP) achieved a breakthrough in integrating extreme-ultraviolet light into the prototype's optical system, enabling it to become operational in early 2025, one of the people said, though the optics still require significant refinement.\nCIOMP did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a March online recruitment call on its website, the institute said it was offering \"uncapped\" salaries to PhD lithography researchers and research grants worth up to 4 million yuan ($560,000) plus 1 million yuan ($140,000) in personal subsidies.\n\nJeff Koch, an analyst at research firm SemiAnalysis and a former ASML engineer, said China will have achieved \"meaningful progress” if the “light source has enough power, is reliable, and doesn’t generate too much contamination.”\n\"No doubt this is technically feasible, it's ‍just a question of timeline,\" he said. \"China has the advantage that commercial EUV now exists, so they aren't starting from zero.\"\nTo ⁠get the required parts, China is salvaging components from older ASML machines and sourcing parts from ASML suppliers through secondhand markets, the two people said.\nNetworks of intermediary companies are sometimes used to mask the ultimate buyer, the people said.\nExport-restricted components from Japan’s Nikon and Canon are being used for the prototype, one of the people and an additional source said.\n\nNikon declined to comment. Canon said it was not aware of such reports. The Japanese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nInternational banks regularly auction older semiconductor fabrication equipment, the sources said. Auctions in China sold older ASML lithography equipment as recently as October 2025, according to a review of listings on Alibaba Auction, an Alibaba-owned platform.\nA team of around 100 recent university graduates is focused on reverse-engineering components from both EUV and DUV lithography machines, according to the people.\nEach worker's desk is filmed by an individual camera ⁠to document their efforts to disassemble and reassemble parts—work the people described as key to China's lithography efforts.\n\nStaffers who successfully reassemble a component receive bonuses, the people said.\nHUAWEI SCIENTISTS SLEEP ON-SITE\nWhile the EUV project is run by the Chinese government, Huawei is involved in every step of the supply chain from chip design and fabrication equipment to manufacturing and final integration into products like smartphones, according to four people familiar with Huawei’s operations.\nCEO Ren Zhengfei briefs senior Chinese leaders on progress, according to one of the people.\nThe U.S. placed Huawei on an entity list in 2019, banning American companies from ‌doing business with them without a license.\nHuawei has deployed employees to offices, fabrication plants, and research centers across the country for the effort. Employees assigned to semiconductor teams often sleep on-site and are barred from returning home during the work week, with phone access restricted for teams handling more sensitive tasks, according to the people.\nInside Huawei, few employees know the scope of this work. \"The teams are kept isolated from ‌each other to protect the confidentiality of the project,\" one of the people said. “They don't know what the other teams work on.”\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore, additional reporting by Alexandra Alper in Washington, editing by Ken Li and Michael Learmonth)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
