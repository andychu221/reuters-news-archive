      "Content": "Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT): A Bull Case Theory\n\nRicardo Pillai\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:40 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: VRT\n\nNVDA\n\nWe came across a bullish thesis on Vertiv Holdings Co on X.com by @TheValueist. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on VRT. Vertiv Holdings Co's share was trading at $160.66 as of December 16th. VRT’s trailing and forward P/E were 60.63 and 30.30 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nVertiv Holdings Co designs, manufactures, and services critical digital infrastructure technologies and life cycle services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments in the Americas, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. VRT is increasingly positioned as a core beneficiary of the global AI data center build-out, with roughly 80% of revenue tied to data centers and leadership positions across thermal management, large-scale UPS, and power distribution.\n\nIts scale, global manufacturing footprint, and expanding service network underpin deep relationships with hyperscalers, colocation providers, and NVIDIA, positioning Vertiv as a system-level partner rather than a component supplier. Demand visibility is unusually strong, with orders up sharply year over year, backlog approaching $9.5 billion, and a book-to-bill well above 1x, providing multi-year revenue visibility into at least 2026.\nManagement attributes this strength to structural drivers including accelerating AI monetization, geographic expansion of AI infrastructure beyond North America, and grid and labor constraints that elongate rather than truncate the cycle while increasing Vertiv’s content per site through prefabrication and behind-the-meter solutions. Strategically, Vertiv is shifting toward higher-value architectures such as 800V DC power, co-developed with NVIDIA, and system-level offerings like OneCore and SmartRun that compress deployment timelines and increase share of wallet. Services, now over 20% of revenue, are a key differentiator, with rising margins and intensity as AI infrastructure grows more complex.\n\nThe planned acquisition of PurgeRite reinforces this service moat in liquid cooling at an attractive valuation and strengthens Vertiv’s lifecycle engagement with customers. Financially, margins, free cash flow, and leverage have improved materially, supporting disciplined reinvestment and bolt-on M&A. However, the stock already reflects a premium valuation that capitalizes sustained high-teens growth and continued margin expansion. While Vertiv offers compelling exposure to AI infrastructure bottlenecks with strong execution and management quality, returns from current levels depend largely on earnings delivery and the durability of AI data center capex beyond 2026 rather than further multiple expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT) by OppCost in May 2025, which highlighted AI-driven data center demand, margin expansion, and improving free cash flow. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 52% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out. The thesis still stands as secular data center growth remains intact. @TheValueist shares a similar thesis but emphasizes on system-level positioning, backlog visibility, and valuation risk.\n\nVertiv Holdings Co is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds . As per our database, 102 hedge fund portfolios held VRT at the end of the third quarter which was 104 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of VRT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "China Prepares to Wreck US AI Industry\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:15 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nORCL\n\nMETA\n\nMSFT\n\nThe math is simple. It starts with three facts. China has spent massive amounts to create very low-priced electricity at a rate several times the U.S. pace. It has built massive dams. The best example is the Motuo Hydropower Station on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. No other nation could build a colossal project so fast. And China has extraordinary solar power supply. Do the large Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) companies pay for these? No. The central government largely does. China is a dictatorship, so things happen that way.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points There are three ways China is poised to leap ahead in artificial intelligence.\nThe United States faces many headwinds in creating AI infrastructure.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNext, China creates a science project like the one America did when we built the atomic bomb. The nation’s best scientists all work on one project: chips that rival those made by Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ). Reuters calls it China’s Manhattan Project. The news service reports, “Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance.” Much of the tech seems to have been “stolen” from Western companies.\nFinally, China creates extremely advanced AI products, like those from Alphabet Inc. ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and OpenAI, which it then dumps into the market. The latest versions include DeepSeek-V3.2, which anyone in the public can use, and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, which is more for tech business operations. Chen Fang, a Chinese engineer who worked on the project, said, “People thought DeepSeek gave a one-time breakthrough, but we came back much bigger,” according to VentureBeat.\n\nThe Chinese could be lying, but experts with access to the DeepSeek products don’t think so. The Chinese can employ huge numbers of top experts to move forward even faster. There is no competition for talent like there is among America’s tech companies. No engineer in China is being paid $10 million to move from Microsoft Corp. ( NASDAQ: MSFT ) to Meta Platforms Inc. ( NASDAQ: META ). China won’t allow it.\nU.S. AI Headwinds It takes three years to build a data center in the United States, especially for large hyperscale projects. Ask Elon Musk.\nU.S. data centers face a scarcity of electricity as builders attempt to bring data centers online quickly. Renewable energy has not scaled fast enough. This has forced America to return to coal generation. Environmental activists are trying to stop that.\n\nStory Continues\nIn the U.S. AI data center builders will need hundreds of billions of dollars to build out infrastructure. That capital has to be raised somewhere. Tech companies and financial players are cobbling it together. Companies like Microsoft and Meta do not have enough capital to cover these expenses themselves. Blue Owl Capital just walked away from helping to fund an Oracle Corp. ( NYSE: ORCL ) data center project. Money is fickle.\n\nNearby residents and businesses oppose U.S. data centers. Data center power use can drive up electricity prices. The grid in some areas is too weak to supply the power. And politicians are starting to make electricity prices an issue. That can slow or kill data centers in some parts of the country.\nThe Wall Street Journal recently wrote, “An escalating artificial intelligence race between China and the U.S. is drawing comparisons to the Cold War, and is likely to be just as consequential.”\nWhat happens to the valuation of Nvidia, Microsoft, OpenAI, and other sector leaders if China starts to pull ahead? It is similar to what people worry about with an AI bubble.\nHow to Short the Entire AI Industry\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

Palantir and Seagate have seen big gains as well, causing a growing number of investors to worry that AI is in a bubble akin to the dot-com era . But those gains are small potatoes compared to one Indian company.\nThe share price of RRP Semiconductor Ltd. has surged by an eye-popping 55,000% in the past 20 months. On Dec. 17, 2023, you could have bought shares for 10 Indian rupees (roughly 11 cents in U.S. dollars). Today, those shares are selling for 11,095 rupees (approximately $123).\n\nThat stock surge comes despite a number of things that would cause red flags to shoot up at near terminal velocity normally. The company has just two full-time employees, according to Bloomberg , and it posted negative revenue in the most recent quarter. And until early last year, it was focused on the real estate industry, not semiconductors.\nThat hasn't mattered to investors, even as regulators have sounded some warnings. (India's Securities and Exchange Board is investigating the company for potential wrongdoing, which has caused the stock price to fall slightly, but nothing compared to its rise.)\nRRP began to move into the AI space in 2024, when the company's owner acquired GD Trading and Agencies. That company previously acted as an agent/broker for a wider variety of goods (from chemicals to consumer products), but shifted to semiconductor manufacturing after the acquisition and changed its name to RRP Semiconductor.\nThat set off an investor firestorm. (India has a limited market for semiconductor companies, which might explain some of the investor fervor.) One reason the share price might have escalated as much as it does? Only 2% of the company is publicly traded. Founder Rajendra Chodankar and a small group of associates hold the other 98%, says Bloomberg.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Liquidity constraints, regulatory uncertainty and limited distribution often confined earlier offerings to niche crypto platforms.\nBy embedding tokenized stocks inside a mainstream messaging app, Kraken and its partners appear to be testing whether access and ease of use can unlock broader adoption.\nThe TON Foundation framed the launch as a step toward bringing real-world assets into everyday digital activity.\nTON Foundation president and CEO Max Crown said the integration allows users to hold and trade tokenized U.S. equities “with the same ease as sending a message,” while maintaining self-custody through TON Wallet.\n\nFor Telegram’s wallet ecosystem, the move builds on earlier experiments. Wallet in Telegram previously launched custodial access to stocks and ETFs through its Crypto Wallet product, which saw early demand despite limited geographic availability.\nTelegram claims more than 900 million global users, while TON Wallet reports close to 100 million users, giving xStocks immediate exposure to a large consumer base.\n\nStory Continues\nRWA Tokenization Gains Momentum Earlier this month, Libeara, the blockchain infrastructure platform backed by Standard Chartered’s venture arm SC Ventures, rolled out a new tokenized gold investment fund in Singapore, bringing one of the world’s oldest safe-haven assets onto digital rails.\nThe fund, launched in partnership with FundBridge Capital, allows professional investors to gain exposure to gold through blockchain-based tokens issued on Libeara’s ledger.\n\nIn a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market.\nAnimoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth.\n“The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote.\nMeanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 .\nRead original story Kraken-Backed xStocks Launch on TON, Bringing Tokenized US Stocks to Telegram by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Rivian CEO on self-driving, designing AI chips, and why Tesla needs more competition\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\nUpdated Thu, December 18, 2025 at 5:05 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nVLKAF\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAt Rivian's ( RIVN ) Autonomy and AI Day on Dec. 11, the pure-play EV maker outlined a whole range of tech and software products, with a focus on vertical integration — meaning doing everything from end to end in-house.\nCEO RJ Scaringe launched the company's new Autonomy platform at the event — and during a trying time for the EV sector, in which so far only Tesla has achieved profitability. While Rivian has achieved gross profits in recent quarters, actual bottom-line (or net) profits have been elusive.\n\nScaringe, who founded the company in 2011, saw Rivian go public in 2021 and reach stratospheric heights of $120 a share before the stock came back down to earth, now at $18. A crucial cash infusion from Volkswagen ( VWAGY ) of nearly $6 billion via a joint venture between the two companies has given Rivian much-needed breathing room.\nThe following is a condensed version of Yahoo Finance's conversation with Scaringe, touching on the company's path toward full self-driving (FSD), or personal L4, as Rivian calls it, building in-house chips, and where the overall EV industry is headed.\nYahoo Finance: Thanks for having us here, RJ. Rivian's Autonomy platform — talk to me about the progression from where Rivian is right now to what's going to come out in the near term and its vision for the future.\nRJ Scaringe: Autonomy has been a journey for us. We followed the launch of our Gen 1 vehicles at the end of 2021. In early 2022, we realized we wanted to do a clean-sheet approach to our Autonomy platform. So we started the process on that, and that involved developing a camera platform, redesigning the compute platform, and architecting the whole system around an AI-centric approach.\n\nThat was what went into our [current] Gen 2 vehicles that we ultimately launched in the middle of 2024, and the compute relative to our Gen 1 [vehicles] increased by about 10x — that's the inference on the vehicle. When we launched that, there was 55 megapixels of cameras, an array of radars, and that began the process of building the data stream to really train this model.\nOn our Gen 3 platform, it's [built using] an in-house chip ... This is a platform that can process 5 billion pixels per second, so that's roughly 5x the best in class today. This is very, very high processing capability. And that not only raises the performance level of this platform, but it also allows us to build the model more efficiently and more quickly.\nCurrently, Rivian offers Universal Hands-Free, which is akin to GM's Supercruise, and that will be expanded to more roads. What comes next?\nIn 2026, we'll add \"point to point.\" So you can get in the car from your driveway, type the address, and it does everything, hands-free, eyes-on, etc. .... But it's still supervised.\n\nStory Continues\nThen the platform expands to the next big step, which is eyes-off — and eyes-off is really powerful. That's when you can start to be in the car, be on your phone, be reading a book. Essentially, your role in driving the car diminishes to nothing. You're just a passenger.\nAnd then the next step beyond that is what we call personal Level 4, which is the idea that the vehicle can completely operate on its own, even without anybody in the car. And so things like picking the kids up from school, an airport drop-off, or grabbing groceries.\n\nRead more: How to find the best luxury car insurance\nYou mentioned the custom silicon Riving is making in-house. Talk to me about why that's important for you to make that the next jump in the next few years. Why not use an off-the-shelf self-driving product like Nvidia's?\nWe made the decision years and years ago to build our entire vertical software platform in-house and not rely on tier-one suppliers for any of that content ... We then built teams of thousands of people to go put all that together. [We] spent many, many, many hundreds of millions of dollars to develop those systems. And when we've approached autonomy and our overall AI roadmap, we had a very similar view, which is this is going to be the most important technical shift in transportation, I would say, more than anything else, more than anything since the beginning of the car. And we wanted to control our own destiny...\n\nYou [also] need a partnership with someone like a TSMC, which in our case is our partner. [Although Rivian designed its chip in-house, a chipmaker is needed to actually produce the chip.] And what we're going to get is better performance, something that's very specific to vision-based robotics ... And then we needed to build this data flywheel, and so lots of offline training, that means lots of GPUs.\nI want to mention Tesla because it is doing the same thing with regard to going fully vertical. It has its own chips. It's doing its own data centers. But unlike Tesla, Rivian uses sensors as opposed to just camera vision. Do you think Rivian can meet, and even surpass, where Tesla FSD is in the next couple of years?\n\nOur goal is to be world-class. Tesla, to be clear, is a great product. They've built a really impressive platform. We're very much aligned with them on believing it needs to be a neural-net-based approach, building an end-to-end trained model that's using a fleet of vehicles, building a data flywheel that trains the model with reinforcement learning. So we really agree here.\nWe do have a different view on the benefits of a diverse set of perception modalities. In our case, still being camera-heavy, call it camera-primary. But by including radar and lidar [light detection and ranging], it allows us to turn our entire fleet into a \"ground truth\" fleet. So every vehicle on the road is very helpful in training our model. [Similar to Tesla, Rivian's EVs will send massive amounts of data collected via sensors and cameras to train its self-driving model.]\nI want to ask you about the bigger picture of the EV industry in America. The tax credit went away in Q4. How are things going for you now as a result? I've heard people talk about how the pure-play EV makers might actually benefit from this because we have fewer competitors in the market.\nI think what you postulated in your question is probably somewhat right. I think you are seeing a lot of manufacturers pull back. I think that's unfortunate. I think it'd be healthier for the auto industry if everybody was focused on electrification. I think that pullback means there's going to be less choice, which is bad for customers. But I do think because there's less choice, it means it's going to be a less competitive environment...\n\nIf you were to look at the segment of vehicles with price points that start under $50,000, there's very few highly compelling choices, and as a result of that, a single company, Tesla, has accumulated around 50% market share ... and that's not a reflection of a healthy industry. It's a reflection of an underserved market. And so if we want to see electrification go from its 8% adoption, which is what it is in the United States today, to let's say 25 or 30 or ultimately 100%, we need to have more than one great choice.\nAnd of course, I think Rivian is one of those [great choices] with our R2. I think it's going to be exceptional. The car itself is just amazing, but I hope there's others.\nPras Subramanian is Lead Auto Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Got $1,000? 3 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nIONQ\n\nORCL\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia boasts of exceptional multiyear revenue visibility.\nAlphabet’s full-stack AI approach is proving to be a key competitive advantage.\nIonQ can prove to be a high-growth, high-risk addition to a large and well-diversified investment portfolio.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe Federal Reserve's much-awaited 25-basis-point interest rate cut, announced on Dec. 10, has not delivered the market relief many investors had hoped for. While tech stocks initially jumped, the optimism was quickly replaced as renewed concerns around artificial intelligence (AI)-powered stocks resurfaced. Investor sentiment has further deteriorated after AI cloud giant Oracle missed earnings estimates in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Nov. 30, 2025), raising concerns about its ability to convert high-level capital investment into sustained profits.\nWith markets swinging sharply in response to changing sentiment, long-term investors can convert today's uncertainty into an entry opportunity. In case you have $1,000 not required to pay bills and debt or kept aside for contingencies, then investing in any of these three stocks can help generate wealth in the long run.\n\nNvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) might seem like the most obvious buy-and-hold pick for decades, and for good reason.\nThe company's exceptional long-term order visibility, worth nearly $500 billion of Blackwell and Rubin systems through 2025 and 2026, is itself a strong indicator of the durability of its long-term growth trajectory. While $150 billion in orders have already shipped, $350 billion worth of orders remain. Nvidia has expanded its strategic partnership with Saudi Public Investment Fund-backed AI company HUMAIN to jointly deploy up to 600,000 of its latest GPU systems over the next three years. This, coupled with a new compute capacity supply agreement with Anthropic, has expanded Nvidia's multiyear demand in addition to the $500 billion.\n\nThe reopening of the Chinese market is also a significant growth catalyst, considering that Nvidia once earned nearly 20% to 25% of its data center revenue from this market. Recently, the U.S. government approved the export of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, provided that 25% of the revenue is paid to the U.S. Treasury. According to a Reuters report, the company has informed Chinese clients that it is evaluating options to expand H200 chip production to meet the surging demand. While the Chinese government has yet to formally approve the purchases of these chips, the report notes that several Chinese technology companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already contacted Nvidia to secure supply.\n\nStory Continues\nDespite the stellar demand, visibility, and expanding market access, Nvidia stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of 23 and a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.48. While the stock may experience short-term volatility due to changes in hyperscaler spending and policy shifts, its long-term growth story remains intact. Hence, investors should be picking up a stake in this stock, especially at its current reasonable valuation levels.\n\nAlphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has also become a crucial player in the global development of AI infrastructure. The company exited the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025) with a Google Cloud backlog of $155 billion, up 46% on a sequential basis. Customers also entered into a larger number of deals valued at over $1 billion in the first nine months of 2025, compared to the combined total of the previous two years. Additionally, nearly 70% of the company's cloud customers are already using the company's AI products.\n\nThe rapid pace of enterprise adoption and improved multiyear revenue visibility of Google Cloud can be partly attributed to the company's full-stack AI strategy, spanning AI infrastructure, proprietary chips, AI models, and enterprise platforms. The full-stack approach is helping Google Cloud support large-scale AI deployments more efficiently. This, in turn, is contributing to improving margins and deepening existing customer relationships.\nBeyond Cloud, Alphabet's strategy of embedding AI across its ecosystem is also delivering strong results. AI experiences are already driving higher engagement in Search through AI Mode and AI Overviews. The company is seeing a higher number of overall queries, including commercial queries, which present additional avenues for monetization. YouTube is also benefiting from AI-driven recommendation systems and is witnessing robust double-digit revenue growth from advertising and subscriptions.\n\nAlphabet is generating durable cash flows from its consumer products, while Google Cloud is well positioned to ride the multiyear enterprise AI wave. The company trades at 27.6 times forward earnings, which appears rich. However, considering its scale, diversified revenue base, and technological edge, Alphabet can be a solid long-term pick even at an elevated valuation level.\nIonQ IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is too speculative to serve as a core holding in a diversified portfolio. However, this quantum computing specialist could still merit a small allocation for investors seeking exposure to its long-term growth optionality or those growth drivers that cannot be fully modeled.\nIonQ has delivered exceptional top-line performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30, 2025), with revenue soaring 222% year over year to $39.9 million, exceeding even the upper end of its own guidance by 37%. IonQ also has $3.5 billion in cash and no debt on its balance sheet, allowing the company to invest in future growth initiatives.\n\nManagement has highlighted multiple technical and product-specific milestones. The company successfully deployed its #AQ 64 Tempo system (capable of running large and complex quantum circuits) three months ahead of schedule and achieved a record two-qubit fidelity of 99.99% (meaning the system executes two-qubit operations correctly 99.99% of the time).\nIonQ is focused on expanding its presence beyond quantum computing, into associated areas, such as quantum networking, sensing, and security, through targeted acquisitions, including that of Oxford Ionics, Vector Atomic, and a controlling stake in ID Quantique. The company is also exploring commercialization opportunities through large-scale solutions-based contracts and a land-and-expand strategy. The company is thus striving to build long-term and sticky client relationships.\n\nStill, investors should remain aware of IonQ's risks, considering that the company is loss-making and incurring significant expenses on innovation. IonQ stock trades at 208.3 times sales, which is also very rich. Yet, the stock can be a good addition provided it does not exceed 5% of a large diversified portfolio.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "10 Most Undervalued Semiconductor Stocks to Invest in\n\nJabran Kundi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:42 AM PST 17 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nSemiconductor stocks have been a big beneficiary of the AI boom since 2022. At the same time, they are also prone to escalations in the US-China AI trade war, which dominates headlines and often brings negative sentiment into the market.\nOne such development happened on December 9, when Reuters reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had allowed Nvidia to sell its H200 processors to China. According to the news, the U.S. Commerce Department was working on the details of the agreement. This agreement would also apply to all other chipmakers. As a result, the broader semiconductor sector is likely to generate positive sentiment going forward.\nHere is how Nvidia reacted to the development:\nDespite this deal, China will still not have access to the latest Blackwell and Rubin chips that Nvidia makes. In this way, the U.S. government appears to have struck a balance between continuing trade with China and denying it access to state-of-the-art technology.\nHere is how Donald Trump announced the deal on the Truth social media platform:\nThese developments should be seen as supportive of the semiconductor industry in the near term. With that background, we have evaluated the most undervalued semiconductor stocks to invest in and present the list below.\nOur Methodology To identify the 10 most undervalued stocks to invest in, we first screened all semiconductor companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion. We then examined their forward P/E ratios to identify those trading at least 25% below the NASDAQ forward P/E of 26.35. Finally, we selected the top 10 stocks with the best potential upside based on Wall Street consensus and ranked them accordingly. Additionally, we also included data on hedge fund holdings in these companies as of Q3 2025 to provide further insight into investor interest.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 427.7% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 264 percentage points ( see more details here ).\n\nStory Continues\n10. ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: ON ) Potential Upside: 3.63%\nForward P/E: 19.01\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 45\nOn December 11, ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) announced that it was extending its longstanding strategic partnership with the automotive supplier FORVIA HELLA. Across its advanced automotive platforms, FORVIA HELLA will incorporate ON Semiconductor’s PowerTrench T10 MOSFET technology under the new agreement.\n\nThe T10 power MOSFETs are designed to reduce system-level costs for automotive applications while increasing efficiency and power density. They are produced at ON Semiconductor’s state-of-the-art facility based in East Fishkill, New York. With ultra-low conduction and switching losses, ON’s T10 power MOSFETs deliver higher density while maintaining a compact design. By reducing both drain-to-source resistance and gate charge, the shielded-gate power trench MOSFET technology also lowers output capacitance.\nThe companies intend to address the increasing electrical demands of autonomous driving, safety systems, and electrification by combining FORVIA HELLA’s expertise in automotive systems with ON Semiconductor’s intelligent power solutions.\nExecutive Vice President of Purchasing at FORVIA HELLA, Sven Hoenecke, pointed out the impact of this collaboration by saying:\nGroup President of Onsemi’s Power Solutions Group, Simon Keeton, highlighted that the extended agreement reinforces ON’s 25-year partnership with FORVIA HELLA.\nON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ: ON) provides intelligent sensing and power solutions. The company operates through the Analog and Mixed-Signal Group, Power Solutions Group, and Intelligent Sensing Group segments. ON Semiconductor is based in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\n9. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ: SYNA ) Potential Upside: 6.9%\nForward P/E: 14.98\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 27\nOn December 11, Barclays’ analyst Thomas O’Malley reaffirmed his Buy rating on the company with a price target of $78. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) enjoys a consensus Buy rating with a median upside potential of 6.9%.\nThe upside also received a boost on December 5 when Northland Capital Markets initiated coverage of the company with a Strong Buy rating. The coverage highlighted SYNA’s forward earnings estimates, where the research firm expects FY26 earnings of $1.11 and FY27 earnings of $1.92.\n\nWhile the stock’s 6% YTD decline has kept the shares undervalued, the outlook looks bright if management’s guidance is anything to go by. Even this year, the company’s revenue growth was driven by its Core IoT portfolio, which grew 74% YoY. The growth is expected to continue, as per CEO Rahul Patel, who mentioned the next-generation Synaptics Astra Edge AI processors, which are going to power the next generation of computing at the edge.\nThe company’s intentions to target this emerging market are what make it an exciting and undervalued play to bet on. The CEO noted that while the company is currently relying on existing markets, once AI on the Edge becomes the norm, SYNA's market will expand significantly.\nSynaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a semiconductor equipment maker that develops products like displays, touch systems, biometrics, audio, wireless, and voice processing for various devices. It was founded in 1986 and is based in San Jose, California.\n8. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Potential Upside: 8.39%\nForward P/E: 13.94\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 63\nOn December 16, C J Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald maintained his Buy rating on Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) and raised the price target from $150 to $185. The research firm’s price target remains well below the $200 median target per CNN’s compilation of 36 analyst ratings. The company has also announced on December 18 that it completed the acquisition of Alphawave Semi. The acquisition is intended to help Qualcomm enter the data center market, a move it made earlier this year after exiting the market in 2018.\n\nQualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) continues to surge amid analyst optimism and positive developments. The company’s Snapdragon Cockpit Elite technology will be on display at the CES 2026, according to LG Electronics’ press release on December 10. LG is set to showcase its Qualcomm-powered AI Cabin Platform at the event.\nQualcomm’s technology will enable the AI Cabin to perform all AI calculations on the device without requiring a connection to any external server. This will significantly improve real-time AI assistance. The press release mentioned examples where this technology will be useful. If a driver fails to notice a merging vehicle, they can be quickly alerted by the Qualcomm System-on-Chip (SoC). The lack of a cloud connection also reduces vulnerabilities, such as latency and hacking.\n\nQualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops and commercializes foundational technologies for the wireless industry worldwide. The company is operating through Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL), Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI).\n7. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: SWKS ) Potential Upside: 9.89%\nForward P/E: 13.71\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 35\nOn December 11, Thomas O’Kalley of Barclays maintained his Hold rating on Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SKWS) stock, along with the price target of $88. This price target remains well above the median price target of $75 and offers 31% upside from the current level.\n\nSWKS has struggled since the announcement of the merger with Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO), but the stock has been rallying for the past month, and Barclays’ $88 price target may add further to the bullish sentiment. Investors were possibly spooked by the amount of time it may take for the merger to financially benefit the company. The merger is expected to be executed by early 2027, with about $500 million in cost savings expected by 2028-2029. The cash-and-stock transaction is weighing heavily on the stock, as is the risk of regulatory approval.\nThe regulatory risk stems from the fact that both Skyworks and Qorvo are competitors and significant suppliers for one company: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). A merger would reduce competition in RF components, increasing Apple’s dependence on a single supplier. This reduced competition is generally bad for the end consumer, which is why regulators usually side with companies like Apple in such merger scenarios.\n\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) specializes in radio-frequency and analog solutions. These products enable wireless connectivity across industrial applications, automotive systems, and smartphones, among other things. It is based in Irvine, California.\n6. NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ: NXPI ) Potential Upside: 15.33% Forward P/E: 16.86 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53 On December 16, Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) and raised the price target from $255 to $265. According to estimates from 34 analysts covering the stock on Wall Street, the stock has a median upside target of $265, exactly where BofA’s price target now stands. Cantor Fitzgerald Research also made some comments on the semiconductor industry on December 16, expecting relative outperformance from NXPI stock. These two positive analyst responses come at a time when investors are fearing negative sentiment as a result of news coming out of Chandler, where the company’s ECHO fab used to manufacture parts for 5G equipment. According to an NXP spokesperson who spoke to Business Journal on December 13:\nThe Chandler facility is expected to close by 2027 after a lack of ROI on investments amid lower-than-expected global 5G deployments. The firm will completely exit the radio power market while scaling down operations at the Chandler fab. NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) is a designer and manufacturer of semiconductor equipment based in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Its high-performance mixed-signal products are sold globally across markets such as automotive, IoT, mobile, and communication infrastructure.\n\n5. Cirrus Logic Inc (NASDAQ: CRUS ) Potential Upside: 19.66%\nForward P/E: 16.51\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 25\nIn a report released on December 12, Thomas O’Malley, an analyst at Barclays, maintained his Hold rating on Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) stock. He also maintained the $95 price target, originally set on November 5, immediately after the company’s Q2 Fy2026 earnings report.\n\nIn stark contrast to the above, on December 10, analyst Tore Svanberg of Stifel maintained a Buy rating on the stock, assigning a target price of $150. This bullish sentiment stems from the company’s launch of the CS40L5X series on December 9. This is a closed-loop haptics driver for the automotive industry. Cirrus Logic has traditionally been focused on the smartphone market. But the company is now moving into the automotive market to drive growth, and this product launch is a step in that direction. This move will not only help growth but also reduce reliance on a single sector.\nTore Svanberg believes this move aids the company’s drive to focus on the High-Performance Mixed-Signal (HPMS) segment. The stock fell right after the November 4 earnings announcement. However, with this move, analysts remain upbeat about the company’s growth prospects, even as investors exited the stock immediately after the earnings due to relatively disappointing guidance.\n\nCirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) is a fabless semiconductor company that provides low-power, high-precision mixed-signal processing solutions for mobile and consumer applications. The company operates in two main segments, Audio and High-Performance Mixed-Signal (HPMS). It is based in Austin, Texas.\n4. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU ) Potential Upside: 20.42% Forward P/E: 9.48 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105 On December 16, Needham raised Micron Technology’s (NASDAQ:MU) price target from $200 to $300, a staggering 50% increase. The firm also maintained the prior Buy rating on the stock. Needham estimates Micron's tangible book value at $96.15 per share by the fiscal first quarter of 2028, implying a $300 price target with a 3.1x tangible book value multiple. The price target boost comes as analysts foresee demand comfortably outpacing supply throughout the next calendar year. This demand is also likely to contribute to higher DRAM and NAND prices, helping improve Micron’s margins. Micron’s HBM3E and HBM4 capacity is completely booked for the whole of 2026, with margins comfortably above DRAM averages. These DRAM averages are up 162% YoY, clearly reflecting bullish sentiment around the stock. As a result of this demand, Needham estimates Micron will likely update its 2026 capital expenditure forecasts to $20 billion. Just a day prior to this, Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson also maintained his Outperform rating on MU, upgrading the price target from $220 to $300. CNN’s analyst estimates show a highest price target of $362, based on 40 price targets. The back-to-back price target upgrades move the stock’s median price target of $280 further above, suggesting Micron is still undervalued according to analysts. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a semiconductor company that provides memory and storage solutions, both of which have become increasingly important in the high-performance computing era. The company employs over 53,000 people and is based in Idaho, United States.\n\n3. ASE Technology Holding Co. (NYSE: ASX ) Potential Upside: 20.85%\nForward P/E: 18.77\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 22\nOn December 9, ASE Technology Holding Co. (NYSE:ASX) reported its unaudited consolidated net revenues for the month of November. ASX continues to prove its stability and strength in the semiconductor industry. Net revenue totaled NT$58,820 million in November, reflecting a 2.3% month-over-month decline. However, it was 11.1% higher than the same month last year in New Taiwan dollar terms.\n\nIn U.S. dollar terms, revenue totalled $1,903 million, indicating a sequential decline of 3.9% but a strong year-over-year increase of 15.5%. Despite small monthly fluctuations, these numbers demonstrate a steady annual growth, strengthening ASE Technology Holding’s position in the semiconductor sector.\nThe firm’s ATM (assembly, testing, and materials) segment delivered NT$36,082 million in revenue in November. ATM segment’s revenue was slightly up by 0.1% from October in NT$ terms, but saw a strong year-over-year growth of 23.6%. In US dollar terms, the ATM segment posted revenue of $1,167 million, a 1.5% decline from October. It showed a significant 28.5% year-over-year growth. ASX’s November performance highlights solid demand for its assembly and testing business. This segment is contributing substantially to the company’s overall growth trajectory.\n\nASE Technology Holding Co. (NYSE:ASX) provides semiconductor manufacturing services across Taiwan, Europe, the United States, Asia, and global markets. The company operates in four segments: Testing, Packaging, EMS, and Others. It provides front-end engineering testing, semiconductor packaging, final testing, wafer probing, and interconnect materials production services.\n2. Photronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLAB ) Potential Upside: 26.6% Forward P/E: 15.91 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27 Photronics Inc. (NASDAQ:PLAB) boasts significant upside after a strong earnings report and back-to-back analyst upgrades. On December 11, D.A. Davidson analyst Thomas Diffely maintained his Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $30 to $45. On the same day, Christian Schwab of Craig-Hallum also assigned a price target of $42, along with a Buy rating. These earnings came as the company continued to ride strong momentum in the last month, resulting in an incredible rally that saw the stock price double in less than a month. On the earnings call, Christian Schwab inquired about the pricing pressure in China. Management replied that it prioritizes its capacity for higher value customers, so if one product faces margin pressure, another is prioritized for production. At the moment, 22nm and 28nm technologies are considered higher-margin and therefore prioritized. Management also confirmed to the analyst that it expects gross margins to stay steady in the near term as it continues to make new investments. When asked about tariffs and other geopolitical issues, the company mentioned that customers have now become used to supply chain disruptions as a result of these factors and therefore factor them in when placing orders, resulting in improved planning that doesn’t hurt the company as it did before. Photronics, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLAB) manufactures semiconductor chips. It provides photomasks containing microscopic images of the circuits printed on these chips. The company is based in Connecticut, United States.\n\n1. Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (NASDAQ: SIMO ) Potential Upside: 41.89% Forward P/E: 18.19 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36 On December 15, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss maintained his Buy rating on Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (NASDAQ:SIMO). The company now has a median target price of $120, according to CNN’s compilation of 9 analyst ratings, implying 41.89% upside from current levels. This median price target is close to $125 price target that Craig Ellis of B. Riley Securities assigned on November 13. The stock rallied nearly 20% after that rating, but is now dropping back to the same level as the broader market declines. Following the announcement above, the company released the SM8388, a power-efficient SSD controller. Its low power consumption, high performance, high capacity, and relatively low cost make it a leading controller in the market. The enterprise-grade security features further add to the controller’s reliability when deployed in enterprise environments. With the above development, the company now addresses two key bottlenecks facing companies building AI infrastructure: power costs and memory constraints. As AI workloads generate massive amounts of new data, Nearline SSDs become increasingly important. This is an improvement over HDDs, which can’t meet the performance and power-efficiency requirements of these AI workloads, which is why the stock price rose heading into December. Silicon Motion Technology Corp. (NASDAQ:SIMO) develops, manufactures, and supplies essential semiconductor equipment to the electronics market, including flash controllers and storage solutions. It is based in Hong Kong, with offices in Taiwan and the United States.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of SIMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

      "Content": "Why Is Crypto Down Today? – December 18, 2025 “With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days,” says Fadi Aboualfa, Head of Research at Cooper.\n\nSead Fadilpašić\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:16 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nCOIN\n\nNVDA\n\nAfter a day of a very minor rise, the crypto market is down today. The cryptocurrency market capitalisation decreased by 1.5% and now stands at $3.01 trillion. Also, 95 of the top 100 coins have gone down over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $129 billion.\nTLDR: Crypto market cap is down on Thursday morning (UTC); 95 of the top 100 coins and all the top 10 coins have gone down today; BTC decreased by 0.3% to $86,722, and ETH is down 3.9% to $2,834; BTC positioning remains decisively bearish; ‘ETH tells a more nuanced story’; Bitcoin has shown a repeatable pattern in 2024 and 2025; BTC may move above $140,000 in the next 180 days; Bitcoin’s volatility decreased below Nvidia’s in 2025; Anatoly Aksakov affirmed a strict ban on crypto payments in Russia; Coinbase expanded into stocks, advanced trading, and built-in prediction markets; US BTC spot ETFs saw inflows of $457.29 million, and BTC spot ETFs recorded $22.43 million in outflows; Crypto market sentiment keeps falling.\n\nCrypto Winners &#038; Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices decrease over the past 24 hours.\nBitcoin (BTC) is down by just 0.3% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $86,722. This is the category’s smallest drop.\nBitcoin (BTC)24h7d30d1yAll time\nEthereum (ETH) is down by just 3.9%, now changing hands at $2,834.\n\nThe highest drop is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 5% to the price of $0.1245.\nXRP follows with a change of 4.6%, now standing at $1.84.\nWhen it comes to the top 100 coins, 95 coins saw decreases. Of these, three are double-digit.\nLEO Token (LEO) is at the top of the red list, having dropped 27.1% to the price of $6.58.\nHyperliquid (HYPE) and Pump.fun (PUMP) follow, with falls of 12% and 11.8%, currently changing hands at $23.94 and $0.002021.\nOn the green side, Canton (CC) appreciated the most: 5.6% to $0.07517.\nMidnight (NIGHT) is next with a 3.9% rise, now trading at $0.06385.\nBitcoin’s volatility becoming more restrained, decreasing below the volatility of Nvidia shares in 2025, Bitwise says. According to the analysts, this shifts reflects a maturing and more diversified investor base.\n\nMeanwhile, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on Financial Markets , affirmed a strict ban on payments using crypto in the country.\n“We must understand that cryptocurrencies will never become money within our country,” he said. “They can only be used as an investment instrument. If payment is required, it will only be in rubles.”\nBTC Hitting $140,000 in 180 Days Fadi Aboualfa, Head of Research at Cooper , commented that Bitcoin has shown the same repeatable pattern in 2024 and 2025. Price hits all-time highs, corrects sharply, and “then finds support almost perfectly at its ETF investor cost basis before beginning the next expansion.”\n\nStory Continues\n“Institutions are not ‘staking sats’,” Aboualfa says. In fact, he argues, “most do not care about sats at all now that Bitcoin is accessible through equities-style ETF shares. They care about risk-adjusted contribution to a portfolio.”\nNotably, without rebalancing, a modest 2% BTC moves to 6.2% in less than 180 days during these cycles. “A 5% allocation drifts dangerously close to double-digit.”\n\n“With BTC now trading near its $84,000 cost basis, that pattern points to a move north of $140,000 in the next 180 days. If cost basis rises 10% to 15% as in prior cycles, the resulting premium seen at past peaks produces a target range of $138,000 to $148,000.”\nMoreover, Nick Forster, Founder at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , noted that markets continue to slide as we head into the New Year, “with prices sitting on a knife’s edge amid mixed U.S. economic data and persistent macro uncertainty.”\nHe says that BTC positioning remains decisively bearish. Traders are pricing continued downside risk through Q1 and Q2, as ongoing sell pressure from previously inactive wallets weighs on spot prices.\n“Looking into the December 26 expiry, positioning is increasingly polarised. On the upside, there is a notable build-up of calls at the $100K and $120K strikes, suggesting some traders are still holding out for a sharp relief rally. On the downside, bears have accumulated substantial put exposure at the $85K strike, pointing to expectations of BTC sliding below $85K in the near term.”\n\nThe probability of NTC reaching $100,000 is now near 30%, while the chance of reclaiming ATHs sits at around 10%, Forster says.\n“ETH tells a more nuanced story,” he says. Signals show a far more balanced outlook into the end of Q2 next year compared to BTC’s persistent bearish bias.\nThere’s a 45% chance that ETH reclaims $3,000 by the end of Q1 next year. Also, there’s a 25% chance it surpasses $4,000 over the same period.\nOverall, Forster says, “volatility remains elevated and positioning is defensive, but upside tails have not been fully abandoned as markets brace for a volatile start to the year.”\nLevels &#038; Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC stood at $86,722. The day began with $87,011, trading relatively sideways before briefly jumping to the intraday high of $90,164.\nIt quickly plunged to the intraday low, however, of $85,373. It’s been trading sideways again since.\nBitcoin could further decrease towards $84,000, followed by the $82,300-83,200 range. A higher drop would pull the price below $80,000. On the other hand, a rise may see BTC reclaim 90,000.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView\nEthereum is currently changing hands at $2,834. Initially, it went up from about $2,906 to the high of $3,021.\nIt then plunged to the intraday low of $2,796. Like BTC, it has traded sideways up until the time of writing.\nIf the price continues falling, ETH may see a pullback to the $2,700 level, followed by $2,630. A market uptick could push it upwards to regain the $3,000, if it manages to hold it.\nEthereum (ETH)24h7d30d1yAll time\nMeanwhile, the crypto market sentiment continues decreasing within the fear territory.\nThe crypto fear and greed index stands at 22 today, compared to 25 yesterday. It is moving towards the extreme fear zone.\nThe fear and uncertainty is increasing as the market continues trending downward. Analysts argue that this may continue in the short- and mid-term at least.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nETFs Sees a Mixed Wednesday The US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke the outflow streak on Wednesday, with $457.29 million in inflows.

By the closing time on 17 December, the S&#038;P 500 was down by 1.16%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 1.93%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.47%. This is the major indices’ fourth successive decline, as AI bubble worries increase.\n\nIs this drop sustainable?\nThis latest decrease was expected, many analysts argue. It may continue in the short term.

      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nbis-ai-cloud-3-1s-121400275.html",
      "Content": "Can NBIS AI Cloud 3.1's Blackwell Ultra Launch Trigger Growth Momentum?\n\nShreya Majumder\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:14 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWV\n\nAMZN\n\nNBIS\n\nAs AI initiatives grow, enterprises face new operational challenges regarding GPU availability across regions, planning capacity for multiple teams and ensuring predictable access to resources. Nebius Group N.V. NBIS is addressing these needs with the launch of Nebius AI Cloud 3.1, the latest release of its full-stack AI cloud platform. Building on the Nebius AI Cloud “Aether\" framework, version 3.1 infuses next-generation NVIDIA NVDA Blackwell Ultra infrastructure, transparent GPU capacity management, expanded AI/ML developer tools and improved enterprise security and compliance features. These updates position Nebius AI Cloud as an ideal platform for enterprises scaling AI workloads in production.\n\nNebius is now rolling out NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra globally, including HGX B300 and GB300 NVL72 systems, becoming the first cloud provider in Europe to run both in production and the first worldwide to deploy GB300 NVL72 with 800 Gbps NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand. Paired with accelerated networking, storage and filesystem scaling, Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 removes AI infrastructure bottlenecks and reinforces its position with top MLPerf Training v5.1 results. Furthermore, version 3.1 introduces Capacity Blocks and a real-time dashboard, providing enterprises with full visibility into reserved GPU capacity across regions. Additionally, project-level quotas and new storage rules enable tighter control over resources and costs.\nBeyond infrastructure and operations, Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 expands its ecosystem to streamline AI development, offering simplified access to NVIDIA BioNeMo NIM microservices for healthcare and life sciences without requiring NGC keys or NVDA AI Enterprise licenses. The release also enhances developer experience with improved Slurm orchestration, FOCUS-compliant billing and a refined console, while strengthening enterprise security with HIPAA-ready audit logs, granular access controls, VPC security groups and Microsoft Entra ID–based IAM for regulated and government workloads.\n\nAs AI models grow larger and more complex, platforms like Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 are poised to play a key role in enabling enterprises to innovate faster, without compromising on performance, governance, or control. While capacity expansion supports NBIS’ revenue outlook, with 2025 guidance now set at $500–$550 million, up from the prior $450-$630 million, near-term risks remain. Power constraints, supply-chain uncertainty and intensifying competition from top players like Amazon AMZN and rivals such as CoreWeave, Inc . CRWV could limit capacity growth and weigh on execution in an increasingly crowded AI infrastructure market.\n\nStory Continues\nRising Rivalry to Cloud NBIS’ AI Infrastructure Growth Path CoreWeave continues to ramp up investments in data centers and server infrastructure to keep pace with the ongoing traction in customer demand. CRWV grew from a niche GPU provider into a leading AI cloud by buying large GPU inventories and carving out relationships with AI labs and companies that need lots of H100/Blackwell-class GPUs. A major force behind its momentum is its multi-billion-dollar agreements with NVDA. Third-quarter highlights include being the first to deploy NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems for large-scale frontier AI workloads and the first to offer NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances, giving CRWV an early lead in real-time AI and simulation workloads.\n\nAmazon is rapidly expanding AWS’ power capacity, doubling what it had in 2022 and on track to double again by 2027. In the fourth quarter alone, it expects to add another 1 GW. The expansion includes power, data centers and chips like AWS’ Trainium and NVIDIA GPUs. AMZN continues to deepen partnerships with NVIDIA, AMD and Intel, placing large chip orders and expanding these relationships over time. Backed by strong security, performance and enterprise focus, AWS continues to dominate major enterprise and government cloud migrations, driving AI demand. To support this, AWS added over 3.8 GW of capacity in the past year, more than any other cloud provider.\nNBIS’ Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Nebius have gained 179% in the past year compared with the Internet – Software and Services industry’s growth of 26.8%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation-wise, Nebius seems overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of F. In terms of Price/Book, NBIS shares are trading at 3.95X, higher than the Internet Software Services industry’s 3.74X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NBIS’ 2025 earnings has seen a downward revision over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNBIS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

( NVDA , Financials ) board member Harvey Jones sold roughly $44 million worth of company stock , according to a regulatory filing published.Jones, who has been a director at the chipmaker since 1993, sold 250,000 shares on December 15 for an average price of $177.33 per share. The sale is just a minor part of a stake that has been held since 1997, which is two years before Nvidia went public in 1999.\n\nWarning!

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe filing indicated that Jones still owns more than 7 million shares indirectly via the H.C. Jones Living Trust after the deal. Nvidia wouldn't say anything about the deal.\nThe company's stock has gone up roughly 28% this year because there is a lot of demand for its processors that are used in AI and data centers. Nvidia is still the most valuable semiconductor company in the world, with a market value of almost $4.32 trillion.\nJones's sell is only one of several insider trades that long-term owners have made as the company's stock has risen for many years.

      "Content": "Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.: Why the Mag 7 needs to 'recalibrate'\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is concentrated primarily in the top ten technology stocks, according to Barclays.\nPNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati, Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré , and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss the market's concentration in tech and whether it's time for investors to start selling the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat I mentioned at the top about how much concentration risk there is in the S&P 500. What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

With it, “stocks start to feel like a native internet object, not a brokerage product,” he added.\n“For many users, especially outside the U.S. or EU, this is the first time equities are one tap away: no broker account, no complex onboarding, fractional by default,” he noted.\n“That said, there’s a key friction point people underestimate: these assets still trade 24/5, not true 24/7.” Even though the tokenized assets “live on-chain and can technically move anytime,” pricing, corporate actions, and redemptions “remain anchored to U.S. market hours,” Dadybayo said. “For a crypto-native audience used to always-on DeFi, weekends are effectively dead time, which breaks the mental model of seamless on-chain finance,” he opined. “In practice, this blends TradFi constraints with crypto UX,” one that is “powerful, but not fully native yet.”\n\nThe launch marks one of the clearest attempts yet to bring tokenized financial products to mass-market distribution channels, rather than keeping them confined to crypto-native wallets and exchanges.\nThe aim is to bring “tokenized equities onto truly open infrastructure,” Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said in a statement.\nSethi believes that what counts is “the real promise of tokenization,” one that could become “neutral, composable building blocks that anyone can use.”\nTelegram Goes Exclusive With TON, Barring Other Networks From Apps and Games\nTelegram claims to have more than 900 million users globally, while TON Wallet reports nearly 100 million users, according to project figures.\nxStocks, meanwhile, offers a fully collateralized, one-to-one backed product, backed by underlying equities and ETFs held through regulated partners. The tokens are designed to trade on-chain while tracking the price of the underlying assets, offering exposure without direct ownership of the shares.\n\nHowever, the service is not available to U.S. users and is limited to jurisdictions where the tokens can be legally offered, given how xStocks has not registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933.\nThat legal structure relies on careful jurisdictional controls, which could limit how broadly the distribution model can expand, particularly as regulators scrutinize tokenized representations of traditional assets more closely.\n\nStory Continues\nTelegram Founder Alleges French Role in Moldova Vote Censorship\nTokenized equities have existed for years, but adoption has remained limited. Earlier efforts often struggled with liquidity, regulatory uncertainty, and narrow user bases concentrated on crypto trading platforms.\nBy embedding tokenized assets within a consumer messaging app with a broad user base, Kraken and its partners appear to be testing whether distribution could have been the missing ingredient for scaling.\nFor Kraken, the TON rollout fits into a wider strategy. The exchange recently announced plans to acquire Backed Finance to consolidate issuance, trading, and settlement of xStocks. Support for additional blockchains is already underway, including Mantle and TRON.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Its EngineeringOS platform brings people, data, and AI into one workspace to support faster design decisions and capture expert knowledge as part of daily work.\nCoLab co-founder and CEO Adam Keating said: “This is about accelerating the development of products that matter.\n\n“Whether it’s national security, healthcare, or the energy transition, progress in these areas depends on how quickly engineering teams can design, test, and refine complex physical systems. At CoLab, we envision a future where they can do those things much faster.”\nWithin the Nvidia Inception programme, CoLab will explore how Nvidia platforms that support advanced simulation, training environments and synthetic data generation can align with its decision-making workflows.\nCoLab intends to bring outputs from these tools into a structured process so that relevant data reaches specific engineers at appropriate points in the design cycle.\nCoLab co-founder and chief technology officer Jeremy Andrews said: “AI will accelerate how designs are generated and validated.\n\n“But the limiting factor will be decision-making. Our focus is on capturing design intent — the discussions, rationale, and trade-offs behind engineering decisions — and using that context to make AI outputs more relevant and consistent with how teams actually work.”\nCoLab also plans to examine how to use Nvidia technologies for AI training and evaluation.\nThe company said that its platform records a dataset of engineering knowledge through digital design reviews, capturing a continuing record of why decisions were made as well as what changed.\nIn November 2025, CoLab announced a $72M USD Series C funding round led by Intrepid Growth Partners. The company said it will use the funds to develop new AI agents, build integrations with other engineering and AI applications, expand partnerships, and scale its go-to-market teams. CoLab also indicated that it expects to make several product and partnership announcements before the end of the year.\n\nStory Continues\n\"CoLab joins Nvidia Inception to speed AI adoption in engineering\" was originally created and published by Verdict , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Bitwise Asset Management’s 2026 forecast anticipates the launch of more than 100 new crypto-linked ETFs, driven by the SEC’s streamlined listing standards effective from October 2025.\nWhile the outlook projects new all-time highs for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart warns that a significant shakeout may be inevitable as the sector becomes overcrowded.\n\nBitwise Shares 11 Crypto Predictions for 2026 Bitwise has made 10 projects for 2026, spanning crypto and ETF markets that investors will track closely. According to the crypto index fund manager:\nBitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana will set new all-time highs\nBitcoin will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs\nBitcoin will be less volatile than Nvidia.\nETFs will purchase more than 100% of the new supply of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as institutional demand accelerates.\nCrypto equities will outperform tech equities.\nPolymarket open interest will set a new all-time high, surpassing 2024 election levels.\nStablecoins will be blamed for destabilizing an emerging market currency.\nOnchain vaults will double in AUM.\nEthereum and Solana will set new all-time highs (if the CLARITY Act passes).\nHalf of Ivy League endowments will invest in crypto.\nMore than 100 crypto-linked ETFs will launch in the US.\nBitcoin’s correlation to stocks will fall.\n\nA Wave of ETF Liquidations Could Occur in 2026, James Seyffart The eleventh prediction turned heads, becoming of particular concern for analysts. The surge of anticipated crypto-linked ETF launches follows a major regulatory shift.\nIn September 2025, the SEC introduced generic listing standards for commodity-based trust shares, including crypto assets.\nThis change allows ETFs to list without individualized review, reducing delays and uncertainty.\nBitwise expects this regulatory clarity to drive institutional adoption and fresh inflows into crypto ETFs in 2026.\nhttps://twitter.com/BitwiseInvest/status/2001307177084957053?s=20\n\n繼續閱讀\nBitcoin ETF Dominance and Altcoin Saturation Bloomberg data shows 90 existing crypto ETPs managing $153 billion, with 125 filings pending. Bitcoin leads with $125 billion across 60 products, while Ethereum follows at $22 billion in 25 ETFs.\nAltcoins like XRP and Solana remain niche, with 11–13 products each and $1.5–$1.6 billion in assets, signaling rising saturation risks.\nWith the market poised to be flooded, analysts anticipate direct competition for investor capital. However, historical trends suggest caution, with roughly 40% of ETFs launched since 2010 eventually closing, often due to insufficient assets or trading volume.\nThe Coming Crypto ETF Shakeout: Winners, Losers, and the Rise of ‘Zombie’ Assets Seyffart’s warning reflects a broader concern that fast expansion often precedes consolidation. Crypto ETFs that fail to attract sufficient AUM, differentiate their strategies, or establish strong distribution networks may face early closure.\nProducts offering specialized exposure strategies, income features, or tailored risk profiles could establish lasting positions.\nChris Matta, CEO of Liquid Collective, echoes this concern in the context of “zombie” projects, describing crypto assets with market caps of $1 billion or more but minimal development.\nTherefore, investors entering the ETF space will need to be highly selective. Trading liquidity, tracking accuracy, fee structures, and issuer credibility will be crucial in distinguishing sustainable products from those that are likely to fail.\nMeanwhile, Bitwise’s bullish predictions suggest that leading ETFs tied to major assets may continue to benefit from sustained institutional inflows.\n\nThe expected wave of liquidations by late 2027 will likely reshape the sector, consolidating capital among the strongest products.\nWhile disruptive, the process may ultimately strengthen the US crypto ETF market by:\nRemoving weak offerings,\nClarifying choices for investors, and\nHighlighting differentiated strategies.\nThe question remains: in a crowded ETF sector, which products will survive and which will join the growing ranks of crypto’s forgotten “zombie” assets?\nRead original story The 11th Crypto Prediction from Bitwise May Not Survive—James Seyffart Warns by Lockridge Okoth at beincrypto.com\n\n條款 及 私隱政策\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Bitcoin has moved 68% between its 2025 low of around $75,000 in April and its all-time high of $126,000 reached in early October.\nNvidia, by comparison, has recorded a much wider 120% swing, rising from a low near $94 in early April to a peak of $207 later in the year.\nDespite Nvidia’s higher volatility, the chipmaker’s shares have delivered stronger returns.\nNvidia is up roughly 27% year-to-date, while Bitcoin has slipped about 8% since the start of the year as crypto markets have increasingly decoupled from equities.\n\nBitwise sees the calmer price action as a structural shift rather than a temporary phase. The firm said traditional market forces that once drove extreme crypto cycles, such as leverage-fueled speculation and sharp reactions to halving events, are losing influence.\nLooking ahead, Bitwise struck an optimistic tone on Bitcoin’s broader outlook. The firm expects Bitcoin to set a new all-time high and break away from the historical four-year cycle that has shaped previous bull and bear markets.\nIt also predicts deeper institutional involvement in 2026, naming banks such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch as potential entrants.\n\nStory Continues\nBitcoin’s Long-Term Holder Selling May Be Nearing Its End: K33 Bitcoin has seen sustained sell-side pressure from long-term holders since 2024, but that trend may be nearing exhaustion , according to a new report from research and brokerage firm K33.\nThe firm estimates that around 1.6 million BTC, worth roughly $138 billion, has re-entered circulation over the past two years as early investors took profits.\n\nK33 head of research Vetle Lunde said the scale of these movements points to deliberate selling rather than technical factors like wallet consolidation or ETF-related transfers.\nThe report notes that 2024 and 2025 rank among the largest years on record for long-term supply reactivation, driven not by speculation, but by direct selling into deeper institutional liquidity.\nRead original story Bitcoin Now Less Volatile Than Nvidia as Investor Base Broadens, Says Bitwise by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

On December 9, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri reiterated a Buy rating and a $235 price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The positive stance comes as Jefferies continues to doubt the demand for the company’s H200 chips in China.\nEven with the US clearing Nvidia to sell the chips to Chinese clients, Jefferies has questioned the demand as the country prioritizes domestic alternatives. That’s because the H200 processors are the second-best AI chips with reduced capabilities.\nThe research firm warns that the company could feel the brunt of the Chinese government’s push for independence in the advanced AI processor. That’s in part because Chinese AI model performance is advancing, with Moonshot’s Kimi K2 Thinking model rising to fourth globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia has partnered with Mistral AI to accelerate the development of a new family of Open Models. Mistral 3 family is the latest model, optimized for Nvidia platforms and designed for distributed intelligence from the cloud to the edge. The models deliver industry-leading accuracy and efficiency for enterprise AI and are available for use in the cloud, data centers, or at the edge. Additionally, the new models are tailored to enable researchers and developers to experiment with and accelerate AI innovation.\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) designs and sells specialized processors, initially for gaming but now also crucial for AI, data centers, professional visualization, and the automotive industry. It developed the graphics processing unit (GPU) and the CUDA parallel computing platform, which allows its GPUs to perform tasks beyond graphics.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

On December 12, Reuters reported that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) informed Chinese clients that it is evaluating adding production capacity for its powerful H200 AI chips. This comes after orders surpassed its current output level.\nTo provide a brief background, the US President Donald Trump recently announced that the US government will allow the company to export H200 processors to China and take a 25% fee on such sales. In addition to the above, Reuters also reported that major Chinese companies, such as Alibaba and ByteDance, reached out to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with regards to purchasing H200, and they are keen to place large orders.\n\nElsewhere, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) highlighted that the world hyperscalers, which is a trillion-dollar industry, continue to transform search recommendations and content understanding from classical machine learning to Gen AI. NVIDIA CUDA tends to excel at both.\nAt Meta, AI recommendation systems continue to deliver better quality and more relevant content, because of which more time is being spent on apps like Facebook and Threads.

Currently on analysts’ watchlists, Nvidia has a consensus Buy rating with a $250 average price target.\nOn December 11, Vivek Arya of Bank of America reiterated its $275 price target on the company with a Buy Rating. BofA cited Nvidia’s commanding market share in the AI compute and networking sectors as the primary reason for maintaining its position. However, this positive view is counterbalanced by several risk factors, including the irregular nature of global AI projects, the cyclical variability of the gaming market, and outstanding concerns regarding the availability and access to power.\nEarlier on December 9, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers maintained his Overweight rating on the Nvidia’s shares with a $265 price target. The analyst upgraded his evaluation of Nvidia after official statements confirmed that the Trump Administration had finalized its plans to remove export restrictions on Nvidia’s H200 chips being sold to China. Rakers characterized this development as an incremental positive and estimated that it could potentially generate an additional $25 billion to $30 billion in annual revenue for the company and add 60 to 70 cents per share to earnings.\n\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company that provides graphics and compute & networking solutions in the US, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and internationally.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "3 Ultra-Safe Vanguard ETFs to Buy, Even if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:35 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points The Total Stock Market ETF is more diversified than an S&P 500 index fund.\nLarge-cap value stocks tend to hold up well during stock market sell-offs.\nThe consumer staples sector contains many high-yielding stocks at reasonable valuations.\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF ›\n\nIf the calendar year ended at the time of this writing, the S&P 500 would be up over 15% in 2025 -- a strong encore to over 20% gains in 2024 and 2023 . Whereas historically, the S&P 500 has produced an average annual total return of 9% to 10%.\nHowever, there are valid reasons why the S&P 500 is rising so rapidly. Nvidia and 19 other stocks make up around half of the index. Many of these companies have demonstrated solid earnings growth and high margins.\nInvestors looking to diversify their portfolios with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have come to the right place. Investment management firm Vanguard offers some of the lowest-cost ETFs available. It can charge low fees because it manages a massive amount of assets.\nHere's why the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSEMKT: VTI) , the Vanguard Value ETF (NYSEMKT: VTV) , and the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEMKT: VDC) are good buys even if the stock market falls in 2026.\n1. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF The Total Stock Market fund is the largest ETF or index fund in the world -- surpassing $2 trillion in net assets earlier this year. As the largest companies have grown larger, the S&P 500 has expanded to comprise a greater share of the total U.S. stock market. But it's not the entire market.\n\nThe Total Stock Market ETF fund comprises thousands of companies not included in the S&P 500. Combined, these non-S&P 500 companies make up around 16% of the stock market. That's the key difference between the Total Stock Market fund and an S&P 500 index fund.\nOver the long run, the Total Stock Market ETF will perform similarly to the S&P 500. But the Total Stock Market ETF could be a better buy for investors who want to fully participate in the market.\nIt's also a better choice for investors concerned about a stock market sell-off, as many smaller companies have inexpensive valuations compared to high-flying top tech names. There's a psychological component to owning the Total Stock Market ETF as well. If you believe that the U.S. stock market will go up in value over time, then it can be easier to hold an ETF like the Total Stock Market fund through periods of volatility than individual stocks, where you can talk yourself into a bad reason to sell them.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Vanguard Value ETF The Vanguard Value ETF is a great investment option for investors looking to participate in the stock market with reduced exposure to tech-focused companies compared to the S&P 500. You won't find any \"Magnificent Seven\" names in this ETF.\nThe largest holdings are JPMorgan Chase , Berkshire Hathaway , ExxonMobil , Johnson & Johnson , and Walmart . The financials, industrials, and healthcare sectors dominate this ETF, with many companies offering attractive valuations and growing dividends.\n\nValue stocks tend to hold up better during a market sell-off because they are priced based on their existing earnings rather than potential earnings.\nThe Value ETF yields 2.1% and has a 21.2 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio compared to a 1.1% yield and 29.1 P/E for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -- making it a good choice for risk-averse investors looking to boost their passive income stream.\n3. Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF The consumer staples sector has been among the worst-performing sectors in 2025 as investors gravitate toward growth stocks and business-to-business companies.\nConsumers are pulling back on spending, and inflation has made it challenging for consumer staples companies to pass along higher costs to strained consumers. Many leading consumer staples companies are experiencing weak volume and margin pressure.\n\nThe Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF is an excellent choice for value-focused investors looking to boost their passive income. The ETF yields 2.2% and features a 23.6 P/E ratio. Walmart , Costco Wholesale , Procter & Gamble , Coca-Cola , and PepsiCo make up 51.8% of the fund. These reliable companies should do well during a recession thanks to their elite supply chains and pricing power.\nEven with consumers looking to stretch their dollars, the sector should hold up well during a stock market sell-off, especially if it has nothing to do with consumer staples -- like a downturn in artificial intelligence spending. For example, consider that during the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off on April 8, the S&P 500 was down by just over 15% year to date, while the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF was down by just 3.1%.\n\nUsing ETFs in a diversified portfolio In today's age of low-cost ETFs, it's easy to use ETFs as tools in your portfolio. If you like investing in individual stocks in sectors where you feel you have a comprehensive understanding, then ETFs can be used as role players to fill a need outside of your wheelhouse. For example, if your portfolio is heavily concentrated in AI growth stocks, but you want to allocate some capital to dividend-paying stocks, a simple way to do that would be to buy the Vanguard Value ETF or the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF. Or if you're looking for a catch-all way to invest in the broader market without having to pay attention to individual stocks, then the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF could be for you.\n\nThe best way to navigate potential market volatility isn't to hit the sell button, run for the exits, and wait for prices to fall before jumping back in. Rather, a better approach is to align your holdings with your risk tolerance, hold stocks during periods of volatility, and compound returns over time.\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF right now?

In some cases, these companies may be too niche to remain independent and will ultimately become acquisition targets. Others simply won't survive.\nWhen I think about AI stocks I want to hold for the next decade, I look for companies that are key players in different phases of the AI pipeline. The following three companies fit that description and appear to be good long-term investments.\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) isn't an AI stock in the traditional sense, but it's one of the more important companies in the space. As the world's leading third-party semiconductor foundry, TSMC manufactures chips designed by \"fabless\" companies that don't own the facilities to produce them themselves.\n\nWhen it comes to manufacturing the types of advanced AI chips used in data centers, TSMC essentially has a monopoly . With its superior technology and efficiency, it's the go-to company, and there's not a close second.\nCompanies like Intel and Samsung also operate foundries that can deliver chips using some of the most cutting-edge process nodes, but they have issues -- such as production delays and low yields -- that make them far less reliable. Not only has this made AI chips a large part of TSMC's business, but it has also given it more pricing power.\nBoth TSMC's revenue and operating income (profit from core operations) have grown impressively over the past couple of years; however, its dominance in advanced AI chips has enabled it to grow its profits at a significantly faster pace.\n2. Nvidia Whereas TSMC is the manufacturer that brings chips to life, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the designer behind critical parts of the AI ecosystem. Its lead in the parallel processor market, in particular, is why the stock skyrocketed over the past few years, turning it into the world's most valuable public company, with a market cap of nearly $4.2 trillion.\n\nFor a time, Nvidia was known for making graphics processing units (GPUs) that were primarily used to improve the performance of video games. However, the company and other clients realized that its parallel processors were useful for other types of computing workloads, and it began to pivot its focus toward those markets. Its latest pivot came as the AI trend picked up steam, and demand soared for hardware capable of handling the massive data sets involved in that technology. Many of the data center chips used for training and operating AI systems come from Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nOf the $57 billion in revenue Nvidia made in the third quarter (up 62% year over year), $51.2 billion (up 66%) came from its data center segment.\nWhile Nvidia's GPUs and other hardware have gotten a lot of attention, CUDA -- its parallel computing platform and application programming interface -- has flown under the radar a bit. CUDA allows Nvidia's chips to be programmed for specific tasks, and the developers who work in AI are widely familiar with it, which adds to the company's moat. Moreover, CUDA programs only run on Nvidia chips, which further increases the switching costs associated with purchasing AI accelerator chips from competitors.\n\nOther major tech companies, including Alphabet and Amazon , have begun designing their own AI chips, often with the assistance of Broadcom; however, Nvidia has a significant head start. It will inevitably lose some market share over the next decade, but as the size of the overall AI chip market continues to grow, it should remain relatively stable.\n3. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has two major things working in its favor regarding AI. First, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud infrastructure platform in the world, and a go-to choice for many companies to build and host their own AI apps. Azure's AI capabilities have helped it close the gap a bit with segment leader Amazon Web Services.\n\nThe second major factor is that Microsoft's software portfolio comprises numerous titles and services that hundreds of millions of people use regularly, including Microsoft 365 (Excel, Word, Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.), LinkedIn, GitHub, and the Windows operating system, among others.\nThis allows Microsoft to act as a seamless AI distributor because it can easily add this new technology to software that people are already using, and then monetize it. For many corporations and individuals, paying a relatively small additional fee for Microsoft 365 Copilot is a straightforward decision. It has become another reliable revenue source for Microsoft, and it should only get better as adopting these tools becomes the norm for corporations.\n\nWhile pure-play AI companies, by definition, rely solely on this new tech for their revenues, for Microsoft, AI is more of a bonus. The company's business is well-diversified, spanning software, tech hardware, gaming, cloud computing, and professional networking. Even if the AI hype cools over the next decade, Microsoft's business will remain strong and highly profitable.\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

The company reported earnings per share of $1.30, beating a Street estimate of $1.25.\nNvidia is guiding fourth-quarter revenue to be in the range of $63.70 billion to $66.30 billion. The analyst estimate is currently $61.48 billion .\n\nDon’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nAlso, Nvidia said demand for its newest AI chips continues to accelerate, potentially driving total revenue for its Blackwell and Rubin platforms past the previously announced $500 billion target through 2026.\nAnalyst View Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives described the quarter as a \"Massive beat and raise,\" noting that Nvidia lifted its January revenue outlook by $3 billion. He said the company’s commentary made it clear the AI boom is still in its \"early innings,\" calling the report a “Major validation moment from the Godfather of AI, Jensen and Nvidia.\"\n\nAccording to Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, if Nvidia's earnings touch $6.50 per share in fiscal year 2027, which marks a 42% increase from its forecasted $4.57 per share this fiscal year, the stock could hit $292 per share at 45 times earnings.\nAdditionally, economist Mohamed El-Erian noted that the company's quarterly earnings release \"has arguably evolved from a corporate update to a full-blown ‘macro event,’\" which he said illustrates the rapid growth of AI's systemic importance for markets, companies, and the economy.\nExpansion In the Middle East HUMAIN , backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund , expanded its strategic partnership with Nvidia to accelerate sovereign AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the U.S.\n\nStory Continues\nAlso, Oracle Corp (NYSE: ORCL ) is supercharging its Abu Dhabi cloud region with the Middle East’s first Nvidia-powered Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Supercluster .\nSee Also: Missed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Invest Now at Just $0.85 a Share\nOther Key Events Last month, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the growing dominance of the company's CUDA platform, which has become the backbone for nearly every major AI frontier model and an increasingly wide range of scientific and industrial applications.\nThis month, NVIDIA invested roughly $2 billion in Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNPS ) common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share to further expand the partnership.\n\nAlso, the company is expanding its open-source artificial intelligence portfolio with a sweeping set of new models, datasets, and development tools designed to accelerate progress in both digital and physical AI.\nNvidia and Amazon Web Services deepened their long-running partnership at AWS re:Invent with new integrations across interconnect technology, cloud infrastructure, and AI software .\nStock Comparison Year-to-date, Nvidia shares rose 28.4%, compared to the VanEck Fabless Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMHX ), which gained about 28.57% and Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (NYSE: SHOC ), which escalated 46.27% so far this year.\nAlso, the company’s share growth compares favorably with that of its closest peers, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO ) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM ), which rose approximately 46.61% and 45.00%, respectively, so far this year.\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nTrending Now:\nWall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share .\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10 . Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery . With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\nThis article Billionaire Investor Adds To Nvidia Position As AI Conviction Builds originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Nvidia slid 3.8% to its lowest since September, and the S&#038;P 500 fell 1.2% to a three-week low, slipping under its 50-day moving average.\nThe selling gathered pace as investors questioned whether the companies at the center of the AI boom can continue to justify their lofty valuations and heavy spending. Concerns around the cost and viability of data centre expansion added to the unease, with traders watching how big-ticket financing plans ripple through the sector.\n\nOracle fell 5.4% after a report said its largest data centre partner, Blue Owl Capital, will not back a $10B deal for its next facility.\nAmazon slipped 0.6% after a report said it is in talks to invest about $10B in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and Alphabet dropped 3.2% after a Reuters report said Google is working on an effort, alongside Meta, to erode Nvidia’s software advantage.\nThe chip complex took a broader hit. Broadcom fell 4.5% and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.9%, reinforcing a market mood that has turned more sensitive to any sign that the AI buildout may deliver profits slower than hoped.\nCrypto Awaits CPI As Bitcoin Hovers Without Clear Support For Bitcoin, that backdrop kept the move heavy and the bounce restrained. Mike Marshall, head of research at Amberdata, said the key is that the “support bid” has not shown up in size.\n“We are seeing weak market structure beneath price and relatively light ETF inflows, which reduces the market’s ability to stabilize quickly when momentum flips. Broader macro worries around rates, growth uncertainty, and cautious risk sentiment are compounding it.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;In this environment, the market tends to probe until it finds a level where buyers have conviction. Based on our ETF cost-basis analysis, the first meaningful floor is near $80K, and if we see sustained outflows or tighter financial conditions, $60K becomes the next major reference,” he said.\n\nStory Continues\nRate markets reflected the same caution. Comments from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, often viewed as dovish, supported demand for two- and five-year Treasuries, and longer-dated bonds lagged, nudging the 10-year yield about one basis point higher to roughly 4.15%.\nTraders now turn to Thursday’s consumer inflation data, which could reset rate expectations into year-end and decide whether crypto stabilizes near current levels or keeps probing for a clearer floor.\nRead original story Asia Market Open: Bitcoin Edges Lower As Asia Follows Wall Street’s Tech Rout by Shalini Nagarajan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: These 2 Stocks Will Be the First to Join the $5 Trillion Market Cap Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 5:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Nvidia will continue to benefit from increased AI infrastructure spending.\nAlphabet's structural cost advantage should become more evident in 2026.\nBoth stocks are attractively valued, even after nice runs in 2025.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWhile a company obtaining a $5 trillion market cap seemed like a fantasy just several years ago, I think there will not just be one company that hits this milestone next year, but two.\nLet's look at the stocks ready to join the $5 trillion club in 2026.\nNvidia With a market cap of nearly $4.3 trillion, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's largest company. Its stock price would need to rise just around 16%, as of this writing, to hit the $5 trillion mark. While its share price doesn't need to see a massive gain to get there, it's still a meaningful move. However, Nvidia has the ingredients for its stock to outperform once again in 2026.\n\nNvidia's performance in 2026 and beyond will largely be determined by artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending, both next year and into the future. Right now, that spending only continues to rise, led by cloud computing companies, which have been struggling to keep up with demand despite enormous capital expenditure (capex) budgets. Meanwhile, OpenAI, in coordination with Oracle , plans to spend a massive amount on AI infrastructure in the coming years, while other large tech companies and even governments are also spending big.\nAt this point, megacap tech companies are trying not to get left behind in the AI race, and that is great news for Nvidia. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the main chips used to power AI workloads, and the ecosystem it has built around them has given it a wide moat. This starts with its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundation AI was written on and optimized for its GPUs. Meanwhile, its proprietary NVLink interconnect system helps its chips act as one powerful unit, discouraging mixing and matching.\n\nNvidia's stock is also reasonably valued, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 24 times 2026 analyst estimates and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio near 0.6 times (with below 1 times considered undervalued). That gives the stock plenty of room to run next year.\nAlphabet Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) market cap currently checks in around $3.7 trillion, which means it has a little more work to do than Nvidia. To get to a $5 trillion market cap, the stock would have to increase by about 35%. Alphabet's stock has climbed more than 60% in 2025 as of this writing, so that type of performance isn't out of reach.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is already the most profitable company in the world, and the stock is attractively valued, trading at a 27 times forward P/E and a PEG below 1 time for a very durable business. Getting to a $5 trillion market cap in 2026 is largely going to be about accelerating revenue growth and positioning the company as an AI leader. Alphabet helped flip the narrative that it was going to be an AI loser in 2025, and now it needs to continue to show why it is likely to be one of the biggest AI winners.\n\nThe company's cloud computing and search/AI businesses actually complement each other tremendously, which it should further demonstrate in 2026. By having both its own world-class AI chips and a foundational large language model (LLM), Alphabet has a structural cost advantage that cannot be matched. The company can train its Gemini models and run inference much more cheaply due to its custom tensor processing units (TPU).\nThis gives Google Cloud a margin advantage and makes it more attractive to customers, while Alphabet also embeds Gemini into its products to make them better. This just becomes a virtuous cycle that should see Alphabet gain more cost and performance advantages over time through its businesses. Expect this to become more evident in 2026, helping power the stock higher.\n\nThrow is some additional upside next year from its expanding Waymo robotaxi business and its sizable investment in SpaceX, and Alphabet looks set to hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Morgan downgrade on concerns about Fortinet’s competitive standing and platform recognition contrasts with its push into AI-centric security, highlighting a tension between innovation momentum and market perception.\nWe’ll now examine how J.P.

These 29 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early identification of life changing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.\nFortinet Investment Narrative Recap To own Fortinet, you need to believe its integrated security and networking platform can stay relevant as customers consolidate vendors and shift toward AI-centric and cloud security. The J.P.

The latest AI data center announcements do not materially change those near term drivers, but they do shape how investors frame the opportunity.\n\nAmong the recent news, the integrated FortiGate VM running on NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs looks most relevant because it ties Fortinet’s ASIC and virtual firewall strengths directly into private cloud and AI infrastructure. For investors focused on catalysts, this kind of deep hardware level integration can support the idea that Fortinet is building a credible role inside high performance AI data centers, which may matter as buyers rationalize vendors and increase scrutiny on which platforms truly scale across on premises, cloud, and AI workloads.\nYet even as Fortinet pushes deeper into AI data centers, investors should be aware that the industry wide shift toward cloud native, consolidated security platforms could...\nRead the full narrative on Fortinet (it's free!)\n\nFortinet's narrative projects $9.2 billion revenue and $2.4 billion earnings by 2028.

      "Content": "Bill Gates, Ken Fisher Rake In $1.7 Billion From Dow Stock That Trounced Nvidia\n\nSurbhi Jain\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 4:31 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nNVDA\n\n^DJI\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nBill Gates and Ken Fisher are quietly sitting on massive gains from one of 2025's most overlooked winners. Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT ), now the top-performing stock in the Dow, is up more than 62% year-to-date. CAT stock’s rally has added roughly $1.7 billion in combined value to holdings tied to the Gates Foundation and Fisher Asset Management, even as flashier names like Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA ) continued to grab the headlines .\n\nThe rally hasn't been driven by hype or headline-grabbing narratives. Instead, CAT stock has delivered steady, low-volatility gains — the kind institutions love and retail investors often overlook.\nDon’t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\nThe Dow's Surprise Leader Caterpillar’s leadership in the Dow Jones Industrial Index stands out in a year where market returns have been uneven. The stock is up nearly 65% over the past six months and recently traded near $589 after climbing from cycle lows earlier in the year.\nEven after a brief pullback, Caterpillar remains firmly in an established uptrend, supported by strong intermediate-term performance rather than short-lived momentum bursts.\n\nThat consistency is what separates CAT from flashier trades. While tech leadership has rotated and volatility has resurfaced, Caterpillar has kept grinding higher and now sits at the top of the Dow's performance table.\nBillionaires Are Already Cashing In The gains are especially visible in billionaire portfolios.\nAs of Sep. 30, CAT was trading around $477. Since then, the stock has risen roughly 23%, adding meaningful value for large holders. Bill Gates' foundation trust, which still owns about 6.35 million shares, has seen roughly $700 million in additional value in just three months — even after trimming the position during the quarter.\n\nSee Also: Missed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Invest Now at Just $0.85 a Share\nKen Fisher's firm holds an even larger stake, with 9.44 million shares, translating into more than $1 billion in unrealized gains over the same period, with almost no change in position size.\nWhy CAT's Rally Matters This isn't a speculative run tied to a single trend. Caterpillar's outperformance reflects a market rewarding durability — infrastructure exposure, pricing power, and earnings visibility — at a time when investors are growing more selective.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen the Dow's top stock of the year is an industrial heavyweight rather than a tech darling, it sends a clear signal. Capital isn't just chasing growth — it's chasing reliability.\nAnd in 2025, Caterpillar has delivered both.\nImage created using artificial intelligence via Midjourney.\nTrending Now:\n\nWall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nDeloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share .\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10 . Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery . With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\nThis article Bill Gates, Ken Fisher Rake In $1.7 Billion From Dow Stock That Trounced Nvidia originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\n\nFaizan Farooque\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 3:33 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nNvidia ’s H200 processor is becoming the epicenter of a conflict in China, and stock market experts and investors cannot see it on a chart.\nChinese cloud and internet corporations want Nvidia's processor right now, since their own accelerators aren't fast enough. Beijing, on the other hand, is looking at the big picture and may be ready to give up short-term success in exchange for control over its semiconductor future.\nSince 2018, Washington has levied new tariffs on nearly $370 billion worth of Chinese imports. Trade organizations claim this package currently means that products arriving from China have to pay about $77 billion more in taxes each year.\nThe trade war between the U.S. and China is unlikely to subside anytime soon. The conflict intensified in the incumbent administration. However, the previous government made every effort to minimize China's \"unfair\" advantage.\n\nKatherine Tai, who served as U.S. Trade Representative from 2021 until January 2025, put it plainly in a 2024 statement .\nTaking stock of the situation is important for Nvidia. The business has previously downplayed China in its predictions, but the H200 is still the most powerful AI processor that Chinese clients can lawfully purchase from the U.S.\nHow much of Nvidia's potential is still related to China and how much is gone for good will depend on whether it ever ships into the market at volume.\nRelated: History of Nvidia: Company timeline and facts\nCorporate China is still chasing Nvidia’s H200 The demand for Nvidia's H200 in China is already more than what the firm can currently make, according to a Reuters report .\nThe news outlet said Nvidia has informed Chinese customers that it is thinking about adding H200 capacity, since big buyers like Alibaba and ByteDance are very interested, even if the company is mostly focusing on its newer Blackwell and future Rubin processors.\n\nRelated: You won’t believe what Coca-Cola just did with its coffee brand\nReuters also said that Chinese cloud service providers and business clients have been asking Beijing officials to approve H200 imports, saying local accelerators still don't come close to the sheer computing power of the H200.\nReuters spoke to one investor who indicated that the H200 is about two to three times faster than the most sophisticated AI processors made in China. This makes it the best processor Chinese purchasers can access without breaking U.S. export laws.\nThat difference in performance is causing a lot of anger on the ground. Some Chinese authorities have suggested a solution that would allow H200 imports only if they come with native accelerators.\n\n繼續閱讀\nThis would help domestic chipmakers while still allowing businesses to use Nvidia's technology.\nKey points for Nvidia investors: Chinese cloud and internet platforms still think Nvidia is the best choice for performance.\nIn China, there is enough demand for H200 to put a strain on Nvidia's present supply.\nAny access to H200 is likely to come with strings attached, such as obligations to bundle with competitors in the same country.\n\nFor investors, all of this makes one thing clear: Nvidia's silicon is still in demand in China's data centers. Policy, not demand, is what's holding things up.\nBeijing would rather back Huawei than buy more Nvidia Bloomberg's report shows that Beijing is not as excited as its tech companies are.\nDavid Sacks, the White House's AI and crypto czar, informed the outlet that China is deliberately rejecting Nvidia's H200 in favor of chips made in China.\nSacks stated that Chinese authorities had \"figured out\" Washington's strategy of only permitting exports that are behind the curve. They are using their own clearance procedure to slow down H200 shipments and safeguard local producers.\n\nRelated: US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding\nBloomberg also said that China is thinking about giving its semiconductor sector up to $70 billion in new incentives. That package would be meant to speed up the country's drive for self-sufficiency, with businesses like Huawei at the core, even if U.S.-approved Nvidia chips are technically accessible.\nBloomberg is saying that Beijing sees the H200 as a short-term convenience that it is ready to give up in order to build up its own champions.\nIt seems as if Nvidia really listened to that message. Bloomberg said the business has already taken China out of its short-term revenue forecasts, even though CEO Jensen Huang thinks the Chinese data center sector is worth around $50 billion a year, according to CNBC .\n\nH200 sales in China might potentially reach roughly $10 billion a year, but only if Beijing lets in a lot more imports, estimates show.\nWhat this means for Beijing’s strategy:\nBeijing is using approvals to slow H200 adoption and shield local chipmakers.\nSubsidies and incentives are being scaled up to pull AI workloads onto domestic silicon.\nNvidia is planning as if China is upside optionality, not a core growth driver.\nWhy the H200 standoff matters for Nvidia stock When you put the two stories together, you have a two-level game on which investors need to keep a careful eye.\nThere is talk about urgency and pent-up demand at the business level. Chinese IT businesses prefer H200s because they still work better per chip than chips made in China. The longer they wait, the more likely they are to lag behind competitors across the world that already have Blackwell-class gear.\n\nAt the same time, there is deliberate caution at the state level. Beijing appears to be increasingly keen on utilizing subsidies and clearances to give local suppliers an edge, even if it means AI rollouts for its own firms may take longer in the short term.\nMore Nvidia:\nIs Nvidia’s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn’t think so\nMorgan Stanley revamps Nvidia’s price target ahead of big Q3\nInvestors hope good news from Nvidia gives the rally more life\nBank of America resets Nvidia stock forecast before earnings\nAMD flips the script on Nvidia with bold new vision\nFor Nvidia stockholders, the difference between what China wants and what Beijing is ready to allow is an uncertainty premium.\nNvidia has assured clients that any licensed H200 sales to China will not stop it from serving U.S. customers, according to Reuters . This shows that the company is confident it can service both markets if it receives the go-ahead.\n\nBloomberg's research, on the other hand, shows that investors can't trust that green light would ever come at a large scale, at least not without rigorous restrictions that also help Chinese rivals.\nImplications for Nvidia’s long-term setup include the following.\nMoney coming in from China may not be a steady source of development, but it may be lumpy and based on policy.\nIf domestic Chinese accelerators don't have to compete with Nvidia, they may become better quicker.\nNvidia's multiple may start to show how much it is exposed to the U.S. and other \"open\" AI markets, with China seen as a call option.\nIf Beijing lets in a small number of strictly controlled H200 imports, Nvidia might get back billions of dollars in extra sales from a market it has mostly given up on, while also making people think that its chips are still the best in the world.\n\nNvidia's business in China may continue to be fundamentally weak, no matter how loud the demand is, if approvals are limited or take a long time.\nRelated: Jensen Huang’s 2025 net worth as Nvidia market cap tops $4 trillion\nWhat Nvidia investors should watch next The H200 is no longer Nvidia's most advanced product, but it is a good way to see how much more the business can expand in China under the present export rules.\nBloomberg's article makes it clear that the key issue is no longer whether the H200 is good enough (it is), but whether Beijing is still ready to allow U.S. export policy to determine its AI agenda.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Nvidia is still the most popular option in China when it comes to data centers, as long as purchasers can acquire it.\nFor Nvidia investors, the setup is simple: If clearances start to go through or if Beijing starts to change its attitude on H200 imports, it might mean that Nvidia's China forecast is not completely priced in.\nA hard turn to indigenous chips, supported by big subsidies and stricter unofficial rules, would show that Nvidia has to develop in places other than China.\nIn any case, the H200 debate is less about one \"old\" chip and more about how Wall Street should evaluate China's risk across all of Nvidia's AI products over the next several years.\nRelated: Tesla has problem no one was pricing in\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 17, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "Could This AI Chip Stock Make a Major Comeback by the End of the Year?\n\nJohn Bromels, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 3:16 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nKey Points During each of the previous three Decembers, Nvidia's stock has surged 8.8% or more.\nThese surges were usually accompanied by broader market uptrends, which seem unlikely this year.\nThat leaves big company news as the only likely catalyst for a share price jump.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has had a rough couple of months, with its stock down about 17% from its October peak. The last time Nvidia's shares were this far off their highs -- almost a year ago -- it took nearly six months for them to recover.\nHowever, could we be in for a holiday miracle? Could the stock not only regain its lost ground, but also hit new highs in the last 10 trading days of the year?\nHere's why it might actually happen -- and the one big obstacle standing in the way.\nWhat history says Nvidia's stock is no stranger to December \"mini-surges.\" Just last year, for example, its shares rose 8.8% between Dec. 18 and Dec. 24. The year before that, its stock shot up 10.1% between Dec. 6 and Dec. 18. And in 2022, its shares jumped 13% between Dec. 6 and Dec. 13.\nThose are all impressive moves, but in order for the stock to return to October's record $207.04 closing price, it would have to rise by about 17.4%. That's a tall order, but it isn't impossible.\n\nIn fact, Nvidia's done it before. In 2016, share prices surged a huge 33.9% between Dec. 1 and Dec. 27, with 16.8% of that rise occurring between the 16th and the 27th of the month. So a 2025 repeat isn't outside the realm of possibility. That said, the company's market cap in December 2016 was less than $64 billion, a far cry from its current $4.3 trillion valuation.\nPlus, in recent years, the stock has also seen a few double-digit declines in December. Some of them even happened alongside the stock's record jumps. Last year, for example, right before its 8.8% surge, Nvidia had dropped 11.2%. In 2022, right after its 13% jump, shares fell 22.3%. And in some years, there was no major jump or big plunge at all.\nReflecting the market Nvidia's end-of-year moves have tended to mirror the overall market, only with more intensity. For example, that big 22.3% price drop in December 2022 reflected a 5.9% decline in the S&P 500 . Last year, during its 11.2% December slide, the broader market also slid by 3.5%.\nIn other words, if the S&P 500 is doing well, Nvidia's stock tends to be doing really well. If the broader market is doing badly, its shares tend to be doing really badly.\n\nStory Continues\nUnfortunately, the market's growth has slowed over the past few quarters. Between its April 5 low and the end of the second quarter, the S&P 500 rose by a robust 24.5%. In the third quarter, it rose just 7.8%. So far in the fourth, it's only risen 1.9%.\nThat slowing growth came despite three Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, in September, October, and December. There won't be any further rate cuts this year.\n\nThat makes it unlikely that there will be a big year-end market surge that will benefit Nvidia stock. The likeliest reason for the shares to surge would be some major company-specific news.\nWhat news is left? But Nvidia has already put out excellent news in its third-quarter earnings report on Nov. 19.\nThe company reported record revenue of $57 billion, up 62% year over year; per-share earnings of $1.30, up 67%; and an impressive gross margin of 73.4%, as measured under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Sales of its Blackwell chips are \"off the charts,\" according to CEO Jensen Huang, and cloud graphics processing units (GPUs) are sold out. The company is expecting $65 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, with 74.8% GAAP gross margins.\n\nIt's hard to think of what more the company could possibly announce that would be enough to boost its shares by 17.4%, or about $700 billion in market value. That's more than the entire market caps of Costco and Coca-Cola combined.\nUnless a major issue emerges over the next couple of weeks with Alphabet 's tensor processing units (TPUs) or AMD 's high-end chips, which are expected to compete with Nvidia's GPUs, I really can't think of any likely scenario that would add so much value to Nvidia so quickly.\nThat's why it doesn't seem likely that the stock will make enough of a comeback to hit new highs by the end of 2025. But so what? Given the company's very strong outlook, 2026 is shaping up to be a big banner year for the chipmaker, and if the price is a bit cheaper during the holidays, it offers an opportunity for new investors to buy Nvidia shares at a discount.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Markets Sell Off -0.5% to -1.8% Ahead of Inflation Rate Thursday\n\nMark Vickery\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 3:10 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: CAT\n\nORCL\n\nTSLA\n\nMU\n\nNVDA\n\nWednesday, December 17, 2025\n\nMarkets experienced a heavier sell-off today, after starting the session at the opening bell flat-to-up. By 11am or so, the Dow and the small-cap Russell were in negative territory; the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had already gotten there. The Dow closed -228 points, -0.47%, and it got off easy. The S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 were all down -1.16%, -1.81% and -1.14%, respectively.\n\nThis marks the fourth-straight down-day for the blue-chip Dow and the comprehensive S&P 500. The Russell 2000 has only traded down since closing at an all-time high last Thursday. The Nasdaq has dipped into the red over the past month of trading, and down -6.5% from its all-time high back in late October of this year.\n\nThe AI trade had been keeping markets buoyant for much of 2025; now that the year is coming to an end, investors are apparently looking toward 2026 with a warier eye than we&rsquo;ve seen &mdash; although we&rsquo;ve only had one &ldquo;Santa Claus Rally&rdquo; in the past five years, in 2023. AI stocks have taken it on the chin, including Oracle ORCL -5.4%, Broadcom AVGO -4.5% and NVIDIA NVDA -3.8%. Also, Caterpillar CAT dropped -4.7% and Lennar Home LEN fell -4.4%.\n\nEven Tesla TSLA, fresh from an all-time closing high just yesterday, suffered a heavy round of profit-taking today, as the EV leader slid -4.6% on the day. Tesla has also been named by the California DMV as having provided misleading claims about its autos, claiming them to have &ldquo;full self-driving capability&rdquo; when they don&rsquo;t, exactly. The DMV adopted this position from a judge&rsquo;s ruling last month, and has been given 60 days to take down such claims.\n\nMicron Posts Huge Beats in Q1 Report\n\nAfter today&rsquo;s close, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated Micron MU blew the doors off expectations in its fiscal Q1 report. Earnings of $4.78 per share swept away the paltry Zacks consensus of $3.91, while revenues of $13.64 billion zoomed past the $12.74 billion anticipated. Next-quarter guidance is also significantly higher than we had previously forecast.\n\nOperating cash flow rose +47% quarter over quarter to $8.41 billion, and is more than double the $3.24 billion it had reported in the year-ago quarter. Micron doubled its cloud memory business year over year to $5.28 billion, on improved +66% gross margins. Shares are up +5% in late trading, adding to its stupendous +168% rise in share price from the start of the year.\n\nNovember CPI Inflation Rate Hits the Tape Thursday Morning\n\nTomorrow ahead of the opening bell, we not only get normal Weekly Jobless Claims , but the government-shutdown-delayed Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November (skipping October completely). We already hear noises from some market participants about the accuracy of this upcoming data 16 hours before it&rsquo;s released, but consensus is currently for a +3.1% Inflation Rate (year-over-year CPI, headline) &mdash; the highest since May of 2024. Core CPI year over year is anticipated at +3.0%.\n\nWe have already seen the erosion to the labor market over the past year yesterday with the Employment Situation report. If we also see CPI numbers continuing to tick up &mdash; and we&rsquo;ve only gone up or stayed pat each month since April&rsquo;s low +2.3% &mdash; that may be a bad sign for the economy on the brink of a new year. &ldquo;May&rdquo; be; it&rsquo;s not certain. Even still, selling off the tops of this healthy 2025 market seems more reasonable if investors are questioning what&rsquo;s to come.\n\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

      "Content": "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the Next $4 Trillion Company in 2026\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:50 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Alphabet's market cap has come out of nowhere to surpass Microsoft's.\nMassive investments in its technology and the release of Gemini 3 have dramatically changed perceptions about the Google parent.\nAlphabet has the second-lowest P/E ratio in the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nMany investors were shocked when Nvidia became the first company to achieve a $4 trillion market cap . The competition for the world's largest market cap was long a contest between Apple and Microsoft , so to see Nvidia emerge out of nowhere likely came as a surprise.\nNow, the question is, which company is the next to achieve a $4 trillion market cap? Today, Apple has already achieved that, but instead of Microsoft (which previously reached that point before retreating), I believe another emerging company will be the next one to reach this milestone. Here's why.\nThe next $4 trillion company Today, the stock most likely to reach $4 trillion and stay above that point is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) . Currently, its market cap is at $3.7 trillion, surpassing Microsoft's current $3.5 trillion market cap.\nThat choice may come as a surprise to some investors. As recently as spring 2025, the Google parent's market cap was under $2 trillion.\nAlphabet stock had long been smaller than many of its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers, as the rise of ChatGPT weighed on the stock. When GPT-4 came out in 2023, investors soured on Google Search, and its market share had fallen below 90% for the first time in decades.\nAt that point, not only did ChatGPT offer more thorough and concise results, but it bypassed the advertising ecosystem that had long served as the primary source of the Google parent's revenue.\n\nThe company released Google Gemini later that year. Still, Gemini did not initially stand out from the likes of Claude, Grok, Copilot, and numerous other AI platforms trying to unseat ChatGPT.\nAlso, investors should remember that Alphabet has long worked to reduce its dependence on advertising for revenue. In recent years, Google Cloud has claimed an increasing share of the revenue. Still, even though Alphabet was an early pioneer in artificial intelligence (AI), these efforts did not seem to impress investors.\nWhat changed? However, Alphabet has long benefited from a massive level of liquidity and considerable free cash flows. In late 2024, it pledged to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures (capex) in 2025, later raising that to the $91 billion-$93 billion range.\nMuch of that spending has gone into improving legacy products. Search now incorporates AI-driven results, and Google Cloud offers upgraded infrastructure, multimodality AI models, and new tools for developers. Additionally, AI should help to make Waymo a source of revenue as it seeks to compete in the autonomous driving space.\n\nStory Continues\nNonetheless, it seems to be the release of Gemini 3 in November that has captured the most attention recently. With improved reasoning, coding, and multimodal understanding, some analysts claim it is \"better than ChatGPT.\"\nWith that, the stock is up more than 60% over the last year, and more than 110% from its April low. Not surprisingly, almost half of that increase has occurred since October.\nMoreover, despite these gains, it is the second-cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. Its P/E ratio of around 30 is undercut only by Meta Platforms , a stock trading at 28 times earnings. That comparative discount could give investors all the more reason to continue buying stock in the Google parent.\nAlphabet at $4 trillion (and beyond) Between the relatively low valuation and the newfound success of Gemini 3, Alphabet appears likely to reach $4 trillion next.\nUltimately, investors like winners in cutting-edge technologies, and amid Alphabet's massive investments, having Gemini 3 perceived as \"better than ChatGPT\" positions Alphabet stock for higher moves.\n\nAdditionally, the AI pioneer is aggressively applying the technology to Google Cloud, and its efforts with Waymo could begin to bear fruit soon. As investors notice the stock as undervalued relative to peers, it continues to benefit from numerous tailwinds.\nAmid such successes, Alphabet may not only reach $4 trillion, but could challenge Apple and Nvidia for the world's largest market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "Elon Musk is worth a record $648 billion — and his wealth gain this year exceeds Bernard Arnault's entire fortune\n\nTheron Mohamed\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:30 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nLVMHF\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nElon Musk's wealth hit a record $648 billion, extending his lead as the world's richest person.\nHis fortune jumped thanks to Tesla's record stock rally and SpaceX's soaring valuation.\nMusk has gained an unrivaled $216 billion this year, more than Bernard Arnault's net worth.\nElon Musk's net worth has surged to a record $648 billion — and his wealth gain this year exceeds LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's entire $205 billion fortune, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO's wealth has jumped by $178 billion in just two days, boosting his year-to-date gain to an unmatched $216 billion.\nIf that figure were his entire fortune, he would rank sixth on the rich list — ahead of not just Arnault but also former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\nMusk's record wealth partly reflects Tesla stock closing at an all-time high of $490 on Tuesday, as investors cheered news that the EV maker is testing driverless robotoxis on Austin, Texas streets. Musk holds a roughly 12% stake in Tesla, valued at around $200 billion.\nBut the bigger driver of his wealth surge this week has been SpaceX's valuation reportedly doubling since the summer to $800 billion, based on a secondary share sale by the aerospace company ahead of a potential IPO next year .\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is now more than twice as wealthy as number two on the rich list, Alphabet cofounder Larry Page, who's worth $264 billion after a year-to-date wealth gain of $96 billion — second only to Musk .\nHe's also more than four times as rich as Warren Buffett , the outgoing CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who's worth $150 billion after giving more than half of his fortune to good causes.\nMusk's personal fortune exceeds the market values of Oracle , Mastercard, and Johnson & Johnson — three of the 20 most valuable US public companies with market capitalizations exceeding $500 billion. His recent gains have narrowed the gap with Visa, which has a market value of $660 billion.\nMusk's epic wealth rally The serial entrepreneur has had a striking wealth recovery in recent months. Tesla stock roughly halved between mid-January and mid-March as his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sparked public backlash and worried shareholders that he was getting distracted .\nMusk even briefly lost his top spot on the rich list to Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison in September, before Tesla shares rallied to fresh highs.\nTesla and other huge US tech companies have seen their stock prices soar this year, fueled by immense buzz around AI . In Musk's case, he's excited investors by spending big on AI to develop Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\nStory Continues\nBy contrast, skeptics such as Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame have warned that AI companies are overspending on microchips and data centers, and diagnosed a stock-market bubble that's bound to burst.\nThe AI boom has translated into huge wealth gains for key shareholders such as Musk, Page and his cofounder Sergey Brin, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang.\nMusk could become the world's first trillionaire after Tesla shareholders approved his pay package in November, which promises to roughly double his stake in Tesla over the next decade if he hits milestones such as selling 1 million Optimus robots and raising adjusted profits from around $17 billion last year to $400 billion.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Not All AI Stocks Are Falling These Days. Micron Is Rising on Strong Earnings\n\nKara Greenberg\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 2:30 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nKey Takeaways Micron Technology posted earnings that topped analysts' estimates, sending shares higher in extended trading Wednesday.\nCEO Sanjay Mehrotra said growing AI demand drove record results for the memory chipmaker and Nvidia supplier.\nWorries about an AI bubble have weighed on the tech sector lately. Micron is still riding the AI boom higher.\n\nShares of the memory chip maker were up over 5% in extended trading Wednesday after the company posted earnings that blew past analysts' estimates, driven by growing demand for AI hardware.\nMicron Technology ( MU ) posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.78 for the fiscal first quarter, well above the $3.96 analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for . Its revenue jumped nearly 60% year-over-year to a record $13.64 billion, also exceeding expectations.\n\nWhy This Matters to Investors As a supplier for leading AI chipmakers including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Micron has seen strong momentum in its data center business this year, helping it earn a reputation as a winning \"pick-and-shovel\" play for the AI trade.\n\"Micron delivered record revenue and significant margin expansion at the company level and also in each of our business units,” said CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, who called the company an \"essential AI enabler.\"\n\nMicron projected adjusted earnings per share of $8.22 to $8.62 on revenue of $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion for the second quarter, well ahead of consensus estimates.\n\nMicron's stock, though well off record highs seen earlier this month, has largely avoided the worst of the recent slump in the AI sector. It's continued to benefit from a shortage in the memory market , supporting stronger pricing and higher margins. Micron's GAAP gross margin jumped to 56% in the first quarter, up from around 38% a year earlier, with the company saying it expects that to climb as high as 68% in the current quarter.\nShares of Micron have nearly tripled in value in 2025 through Wednesday's close, making it one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 for the year.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Riley Wealth Management described Oracle as \"probably the poster child\" for questions about AI project financing and profitability.\n\"Investors are starting to be more differentiated and looking at the potential winners and the potential time frame before return on invested capital,\" Hogan said. \"That doesn't mean we're anywhere close to the final innings of artificial intelligence. It just means investors are being more discerning.\"\nBesides Oracle, which fell 5.4 percent, other AI players such as Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet and Broadcom all lost more than three percent.\nWhile technology and communications services were among the sectors to retreat, energy led the winners among sectors moving higher.\n\nOil prices rallied after US President Donald Trump ordered a blockade of \"sanctioned\" oil tankers heading to and leaving Venezuela.\nThe commodity later pared some of its gains, but finished the day up more than one percent.\nVenezuela, which has the world's largest proven oil reserves, shrugged off the threat of more pain, insisting that it was proceeding with business as usual.\n\"Export operations for crude and byproducts continue normally. Oil tankers linked to PDVSA operations continue to sail with full security,\" state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) said.\nIn Europe, London's stock market rallied as the pound faltered on expectations of cuts to Bank of England interest rates, after data showed UK inflation falling faster than forecast.\n\nBritain's annual inflation rate slowed to 3.2 percent in November, cementing expectations that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate on Thursday and again on more than one occasion in 2026.\nAnalysts had expected inflation to have cooled only slightly to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent in October.\nEurozone inflation remained at 2.1 percent in November, hovering just above the target set by the European Central Bank, slightly revised official data showed Wednesday.\nThe ECB is expected to hold interest rates steady Thursday for its fourth straight meeting with inflation in check, although debate is heating up about the path forward.\nBoth the Paris and Frankfurt stock markets ended lower.

      "Content": "Prediction: These 2 AI Darlings Will Be Worth $5 Trillion or More in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Nvidia's growth is expected to be rapid in 2026.\nAlphabet could see its valuation increase and strong growth continue to cross the $5 trillion mark.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nCurrently, there are no stocks with a $5 trillion market cap or greater. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is valued at $4.3 trillion, and was recently valued at over $5 trillion before pulling back. Following up Nvidia are Apple at $4 trillion, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) at $3.7 trillion, and Microsoft at $3.5 trillion. These are the only real candidates that can be worth $5 trillion or more, as Amazon is the fifth-largest company in the world at $2.6 trillion, which means its stock would have to more than double to breach the $5 trillion threshold.\nSo, of these four, which ones could be worth $5 trillion or more in 2026? I think there are only two real answers, and one may surprise you.\nReaching the $5 trillion valuation threshold won't be easy for one of these stocks It should come as no surprise that I think Nvidia will cross the $5 trillion valuation threshold in 2026. It's still growing at a rapid pace thanks to its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPU) technology stack. Demand for artificial intelligence computing power in data centers isn't slowing down, and it is shouldn't for some time. Nvidia believes global data center capital expenditures will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from $600 billion in 2025. Should that come to fruition, Nvidia would be a monster performer over the next five years, and 2026 is shaping up to be another phenomenal year.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs, although he didn't elaborate on how far in the future they are sold out. Regardless, demand outpaces supply for its GPUs, which allows it to maintain high prices and lofty profit margins. This will fuel Nvidia's growth in 2026, and Wall Street analysts are expecting 48% growth again in fiscal year 2027 (ending January 2027) after rising a projected 63% in fiscal year 2026 (ending January 2026).\nWith growth like that, it won't take a whole lot for Nvidia to reach the $5 trillion threshold in 2026.\nHowever, it will take a bit more effort from Alphabet.\nAlphabet was a bit of a laggard in the AI arms race because competitors launched generative AI tools before it did. Furthermore, the initial release of its model was bad and caused several PR nightmares. However, Alphabet has addressed those issues and is now one of the leading providers of generative AI. In addition, Alphabet's core Google search business was spared from being broken up due to monopoly concerns earlier this year, and its future is now much clearer than it was just six months ago.\n\nStory Continues\nSince July 1, Alphabet's stock has been on fire, rising about 80%. However, for Alphabet's stock to be worth $5 trillion, it must rise at least 35% from today's levels.\nCan it do that?\nAlphabet's earnings growth has been impressive in recent quarters There are a few ways for a stock to rise: growing revenue and earnings, or an increase in valuation. Both of these are reasonable actions for a share price to rise, and Alphabet will likely need a boost from both to cross the $5 trillion threshold. In Q3, revenue rose 16% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 35%. If Alphabet can keep up its EPS growth, then it could cross the $5 trillion threshold with growth alone. However, I think it could also use some help in the valuation department.\nDespite growing at the same pace or faster than Apple or Microsoft, Alphabet trades at a discount from a price-to-earnings perspective.\nShould Alphabet's stock receive a 35 times trailing earnings valuation, that would result in 14% growth alone.\nAlphabet will need all the help it can get to reach a $5 trillion valuation by the end of 2026, but I think it can do it. Even if it doesn't, I think it could easily reach that level by 2027.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Micron has broken its quarterly record in two straight quarters, with a third potential record coming this week.\nMicron has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in 10 straight quarters.\nAnalysts expect Micron to report first-quarter earnings per share of $3.93, up from $1.79 in last year&#039;s first quarter.\nThe company has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in seven straight quarters and in nine of the past 10 quarters overall.\nGuidance from the company calls for first-quarter revenue in a range of $12.2 billion to $12.8 billion and earnings per share in a range of $3.60 to $3.90.\n\nDon&#8217;t Miss: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\n\nWhat Analysts Are Saying: Micron will set a new quarterly record and the company could have \"record quarters ahead,\" Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a new investor note.\nThe analyst maintained a Buy rating on Micron with a price target of $300.\n\"We are expecting Micron to report another record quarterly only to be topped by February quarter guidance,\" Cassidy said.\nThe analyst said the record revenue is coming by disciplined supply growth in recent years along with strong demand for the company&#039;s products.\n\"We see the financial performance as supporting the growth.\"\n\nCassidy said the company is becoming stronger with AI applications having an increased need for memory.\nThe analyst said a key item to watch will be management commentary for when more meaningful capacity is coming.\n\"We recommend owning the stock.\"\nNeedham analyst Quinn Bolton maintained a Buy rating on Micron and raised the price target from $200 to $300 ahead of the earnings report.\n\"With the memory market continuing to tighten, demand likely to exceed supply throughout CY 26,\" Bolton said.\nThe analyst raised revenue and eps estimates for fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2027 \"substantially.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\"Demand conditions in the data center market remain robust, driven by increasing hyperscaler and neocloud CapEx.\"\nBolton said this is a strong tailwind for Micron that will help average selling prices and gross margins.\nSeveral other analysts raised their price targets for Micron stock ahead of the earnings report, including Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson , who maintained an Outperform rating and raised the price target from $220 to $300.\n\nSee Also: The AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\nKey Items to Watch: Micron shares are up over 160% in 2025, which could create high expectations for the stock.\nAnalysts and investors likely expect another double beat and raised guidance. If the company fails to beat or update on guidance, shares could end up being volatile the rest of the week.\nFreedom Capital Markets Chief Market Strategist Jay Woods cautioned on shares being volatile in his weekly newsletter .\n\"Shares have traded lower after posting results over the last four quarters and over five of their last six,\" Woods said.\nThe market expert said this could be a case of shares trading higher before earnings and selling off after the earnings report.\n\nMicron said it had all-time highs for its data center business and was entering 2026 with \"strong momentum\" during its fourth quarter financial results. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told investors Micron was \"uniquely positioned to capitalize on the AI opportunity ahead.\"\nAnalysts and investors will be looking forward to guidance and commentary on future growth for the company.\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nTrending Now:\nWall Street&#039;s $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nBuilding Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That&#039;s why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn&#039;t tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.\n\nArrived Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100 . This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.\n\nWorthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10 . Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.\n\nIRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto . This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.\n\nMoomoo Idle Cash Moomoo isn&#039;t just for trading — it&#039;s also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash , combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.\n\nAmerican Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery . With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It&#039;s a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.\nThis article Micron Q1 Preview: Record Quarter Predicted By Analyst — 'We Recommend Owning The Stock' originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Best Tech ETF Picks for 2026\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 1:18 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Tech has been a strong outperformer, but it might be time to rethink investing in this sector.\nCompanies with strong fundamentals and more reasonable valuations present enticing opportunities.\nSoftware and digital payments are two subsectors that have the chance to outperform in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Amplify ETF Trust - Amplify Digital Payments ETF ›\n\nAs we wrap up 2025, tech stocks are again on pace to be one of the best-performing S&P 500 sectors. Fueled by strong demand for anything tied to artificial intelligence (AI) , investors steadily bought stocks and pushed the Nasdaq-100 index to several new all-time highs.\nWhile the \" Magnificent Seven \" stocks helped lead the way higher, 2026 may not be a repeat. If you're looking to invest in tech, it may be time to look beyond just Nvidia , Microsoft , and Apple . While these have been terrific-performing companies for a long time, there are a number of opportunities within the sector that may be flying under the radar.\nIn particular, undervalued areas of the tech sector could see better performance. The mega-cap companies, as well as chip stocks, have really gotten all the attention lately. Areas, such as software and digital payments, could enjoy renewed interest if investors begin seeking out more value-oriented stocks backed by healthy fundamentals.\nHere are three tech ETFs that I believe could outperform in the coming year.\nInvesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: RSPT) invests in all of the big large-cap tech companies, but removes the concentration factor. It equally weights the roughly 70 tech stocks within the S&P 500 and rebalances quarterly to ensure it maintains its diversified exposure.\n\nRSPT is a great way to invest in the tech stocks that have led the market over the past several years, but broaden out the exposure in case the mega-cap names begin to underperform. We've already seen some hints that investors are worried about Magnificent Seven valuations. This ETF allows you to invest in the long-term tech narrative while mitigating some of that idiosyncratic risk.\nTop holdings currently include Western Digital , Micron Technology , and Teradyne .\nAmplify Digital Payments ETF Think of the one thing that almost every person does at least once a day (and probably multiple times): buy something! Years ago, people would pay for these purchases using cash or a check. Today, everybody uses credit cards or some form of digital payment, such as PayPal .\nThe Amplify Digital Payments ETF (NYSEMKT: IPAY) invests in all the major companies that provide payment services. Its top three holdings -- American Express , Visa , and MasterCard -- are all major credit card issuers, but other companies within the top 10 reflect how the entire sector is evolving. PayPal is more of a traditional online payment platform. Global Payments is a payment processor and software provider. Coinbase Global is a cryptocurrency trading platform.\n\nStory Continues\nThe transaction processing space is already a big cash flow generator. Adding the next-generation fintech evolution to it provides a great long-term growth opportunity.\niShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF Ever since coming out of the 2022 bear market, software has been a tech laggard. The AI boom had investors gravitating toward semiconductor stocks, leaving certain segments of the sector underbought and unloved.\nWithin the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (NYSEMKT: IGV) , there are a lot of high-quality companies with strong revenue growth and solid margins that could finally see some of that value get unlocked in 2026. Top 10 holdings include Palantir Technologies , Salesforce , Intuit , and ServiceNow alongside industry heavyweight Microsoft.\n\nSoftware is intriguing because it covers so many areas within tech. IGV is essentially an investment in cloud computing, enterprise automation, cybersecurity, and AI productivity tools. There's constant demand for performance improvement and staying ahead of the latest threats. That makes a lot of these companies steady cash flow generators that can actually add some stability to a portfolio.\nWith software lagging behind the Nasdaq-100 in 2025, there's some catch-up potential in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amplify ETF Trust - Amplify Digital Payments ETF right now?

It comes amid scrutiny of increasing use of debt and off-balance-sheet moves to fund tech companies' capital spending on AI infrastructure, despite persistent questions over demand for the tech.\n\nOracle shares fell nearly 6%, and megacap tech stocks followed.

Markets are also waiting for the other data shoe to drop: Thursday's update on consumer inflation in November.\nIn a clue to the path ahead, Fed governor Chris Waller said Wednesday that the central bank still has scope to cut rates, hinting at \"50 to 100 basis points\" of room.\nElsewhere in corporates, Netflix ( NFLX ) stock rose after Warner Bros.

Year to date, GE Vernova stock has run up 93%, inclusive of a 15% gain last Wednesday, after the company announced plans to roll out a fuel cell business for data centers at its investor day.\n\nGE Vernova has been seen as a beneficiary of the AI infrastructure build-out, as demand for energy transmission and grid integration is booming. According to RBC analyst Christopher Dendrinos, GE Vernova's electrification backlog has grown 4x since 2022 and is projected to double again by 2028.\nBut news that private lender Blue Owl Capital ( OWL ) will not back a $10 billion deal for Oracle's data center threw funding for that build-out into greater scrutiny on Wednesday.\nStill, GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik emphasized in an interview last week that the company has \"a lot of other drivers\" of demand. Strazik said that only 10% of the company's current backlog comes from hyperscalers, which could grow to approximately one-third of the backlog over the next three years.\n\nToday at 6:06 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nMedline stock begins trading above $35 per share Medline ( MDLN ) shares began trading on Wednesday afternoon at $35 each.

The IPO values Medline at upwards of $50 billion, based on a total of roughly 1.8 billion Class A and Class B shares outstanding.\nThe deal caps the best year for the IPO market since 2021 , with Wall Street's outlook for deals and new issues even more optimistic heading into 2026 .\nRecent reports have indicated that SpaceX is likely to go public in 2026 , with the company having recently struck a deal for insiders to sell stock in Elon Musk's rocketry and satellite business that valued the company at $800 billion.\nMajor AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic are also expected to explore going public within the next 18 months, according to The Information . Database giant Databricks, which raised money at a $134 billion valuation this week, said it could explore a public offering as soon as next year.\n\nToday at 3:02 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nOracle drops on debt concerns Oracle ( ORCL ) shares fell nearly 4% Wednesday after the Financial Times reported that private lender Blue Owl Capital will not back a $10 billion deal for its next data center as the burgeoning AI cloud player rushes to secure computing capacity and investors scrutinize its mounting use of debt to do so.\n\nThe decline put Oracle shares down nearly 18% for the month. The stock fell after the company's earnings last week showed its costs rising more than expected while bleeding more cash than anticipated.

      "Content": "Better AI Stock: ASML vs. Nvidia\n\nChris Neiger, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 12:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nASML\n\nKey Points ASML makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and holds 90% market share.\nNvidia's GPUs are in heavy demand from tech giants, and its earnings surged 67% higher in the third quarter.\nNvidia's shares are cheaper than ASML's.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nStocks in the semiconductor sector have been among the most sought-after investments over the past few years, as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) processors has surged. Two companies that have benefited from the trend are semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) and chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nBoth could continue to benefit from heavy spending on AI infrastructure, which is forecast to reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion over the next five years. But which one looks like the better AI stock to buy now and hold for the long term?\nNvidia's AI dominance Nvidia 's ability to meet the soaring demand for powerful parallel processors propelled the company's market capitalization from approximately $364 billion at the end of 2022 to around $4.3 trillion today. Its dominance in the AI semiconductor market has led to skyrocketing revenue and earnings.\n\nIn its fiscal 2025 (which ended Jan. 26, 2025), Nvidia's sales rose by 114% to $130.5 billion, and its diluted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 130% to $2.99. And the good times are still rolling for Nvidia. Its revenue increased by 62% in its fiscal 2026 third quarter to $57 billion, and EPS popped by 67% to $1.30.\nThe chipmaker's ability to grow sales and earnings so quickly stems from its estimated 90% share of the data center GPU market. The company's chip designs are superior to competitors' at AI processing, leaving tech giants clamoring for its most advanced semiconductors.\nMoreover, the AI chip market's growth will have more drivers than chatbots from OpenAI and Alphabet . Tech companies are increasingly betting on robotics, self-driving vehicles, and other autonomous systems that will also require advanced AI processors. Consider that Morgan Stanley estimates the humanoid robotics market could be worth $5 trillion by 2050.\n\nAs these other markets begin to take shape, it could fuel further sales growth for Nvidia's processors.\nASML benefits from demand for Nvidia's processors ASML makes some of the key equipment required to manufacture AI processors, which it sells to foundry operators like Taiwan Semiconductor , which in turn churn out the semiconductors designed by clients like Nvidia. This part of the supply chain has boomed lately, and ASML's shares are up 52% over the past year.\n\nStory Continues\nASML enjoys an enviable position in the AI chip manufacturing equipment space, holding an estimated 90% market share in lithography. That's impressive enough, and research from Morningstar indicates that ASML's technology is a decade ahead of its rivals. When it comes to making the most advanced chips, its machines hold a technological monopoly, because no peer offers similarly capable options.\n\nThe company also benefits from the fact that it services the machines it sells, providing it with potentially decades of recurring revenue for each machine. ASML's service revenue rose 39% in the first nine months of this year to 6 billion euros, and more growth is expected on that front as it sells more equipment that could remain in use for up to 30 years.\nWhile there are some concerns about the possibility that the AI market may be in a bubble, it's important to note that ASML, like Nvidia, is highly profitable. The company's gross margins hover in the low 50% range, and in the first nine months of this year, its diluted earnings per share were $17.38 -- a 40% increase from the same period in 2024.\nWhy Nvidia has a slight edge over ASML I think both of these AI stocks deserve a place in most people's portfolios, but Nvidia gets the win in this matchup because its shares are cheaper than ASML's. Nvidia's stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 23 right now, compared to ASML's P/E ratio of 34. It's worth noting, though, that both are well below the tech sector's average P/E ratio of 45.\n\nAnd while Nvidia does get my vote, you probably couldn't go wrong buying either stock and holding onto it for years to come.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,955 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,089,460 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 968 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "This Tech Stock Takes the S&P 500 Top Spot in 2025\n\nFernanda Horner\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 12:19 PM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: ^DJI\n\n^GSPC\n\nSNDK\n\nWDC\n\nNVDA\n\nWith traders dusting off their portfolios and reviewing their investment strategies for 2026, now is a good time to evaluate this year's outperformers to see if they still hold promise for the new year. We already covered the best Dow Jones Industrial Average stock of 2025 -- spoiler alert, it's not Nvidia (NVDA) -- so now the S&P 500 Index (SPX) gets the same treatment.\n\nTaking the benchmark's top spot for the year is Wall Street newbie SanDisk Corp (NASDAQ:SNDK), which began trading in early February and joined the SPX in late November. The flash memory manufacturing company is a spinoff of Western Digital (WDC), which takes the runner-up spot.\nSNDK has added 268.2% in the last nine months, more than quadrupling off its independent trading debut on the Nasdaq at $36 on Feb. 13. Analysts were already taking notice before the rally picked up in September, culminating in a Nov. 12, record high of $284.59. Shares have since pulled back from that peak, but support at $200 appears to be keeping recent losses in check.\nDespite this outperformance, short sellers have been piling on the security, likely due to AI overvaluation concerns . Short interest is up 22.8% in the last two reporting periods, and now makes up more than 5.2% of the security's available float. This suggests SNDK may be a short squeeze contender in 2026.\nIt's also worth noting that the chip stock tended to outperform volatility expectations in the past year, as suggested by its Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS) of 89 out of 100.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Credo Technology Stock Is Down 28% in Two Weeks. Is the Dip Worth Buying?\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:44 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRDO\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Credo Technology stock dropped 28% in two weeks, but there's no company-specific bad news behind the pullback.\nThe stock's high beta of 2.7 means double-digit swings are normal for this volatile growth name.\nThis high-priced stock is not for everyone, but long-term investors with strong stomachs may find this dip worth buying.\n10 stocks we like better than Credo Technology Group ›\n\nCredo Technology Group (NASDAQ: CRDO) has had a rough couple of weeks. Shares dropped nearly 12% in just five market days as of Dec. 17, and the data networking expert's stock is down 28% in two weeks.\nBut zoom out a bit, and the picture looks very different. Credo's stock is still up 103% year to date and has gained 839% over the past three years -- nearly matching Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) legendary run in almost exactly the first three years of ChatGPT and generative artificial intelligence (AI). That's some legendary company at these lofty heights.\nIs Credo's dip a buying opportunity , or perhaps the start of a long-lasting retreat? Let's take a look.\nWhy Credo's stock dropped There's no company-specific bombshell behind this pullback. Credo didn't miss earnings, lose a customer, or bungle a product launch. Instead, this looks like garden-variety volatility in a high-flying stock.\nAnd make no mistakeL Credo is both high-flying and volatile. The stock's beta value is 2.7, which means the stock tends to move in the same direction as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) market index -- but 2.7 times faster . Double-digit weekly swings aren't unusual for this stock; they're the price of admission to Credo's party.\n\nWhen you own a stock that's up 860% in three years, you're going to see some gut-wrenching drops along the way. That's just how it works in Wall Street's high-octane growth stock lane.\nThe bull case remains intact Nothing about Credo's fundamental story has changed recently.\nThe AI connectivity opportunity is massive. As GPU clusters scale from thousands to millions of chips, the data-transfer \"plumbing\" connecting them becomes mission-critical.\nThat's where Credo enters the conversation. Credo's active electrical cables (AECs) reportedly offer 1,000 times better reliability and approximately 50% lower power consumption than fiber-optic alternatives with similar data speeds. Those are game-changing advantages when deployed across a massive data center.\nThe company is executing. Revenue more than doubled last fiscal year, gross margins are expanding, and the company recently turned profitable.\n\nStory Continues\nThe product roadmap is also compelling, as the company finds new use cases for its fundamental components. New offerings like ZeroFlap optical transceivers and OmniConnect gearboxes could triple or quadruple Credo's total addressable market by 2030.\nAnd Credo's leadership is solid. Co-founders Lawrence Cheng and Job Lam are still running the show 17 years in, serving as CTO and COO, respectively. CEO Bill Brennan has been at the helm since 2013.\n\nThe risks haven't changed either Credo's biggest vulnerability remains customer concentration. Its largest customer accounts for over 40% of revenue, and the entire business serves just a handful of hyperscaler tech giants. That's a real risk, and it's not going away anytime soon.\nFurthermore, the stock isn't cheap by most metrics. Shares are changing hands at 120 times trailing earnings and 31 times sales. That may be a bargain next to market darlings like Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) , but Credo's multiples are loftier than Nvidia's. You're paying a higher price for Credo's hypergrowth, and if that growth stumbles, the stock will take a hit.\nSo is the dip worth buying? Credo's long-term investing thesis is that the company is building the foundational connectivity layer for AI infrastructure. If you see great value in that idea, and you're willing to assume that Credo can stave off well-heeled challengers such as Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , then a 28% pullback in two weeks is just noise, not a value-altering signal.\n\nThis is an aggressive stock for investors with strong stomachs and long time horizons. If that's you, and you've been waiting for a better entry point, you should consider grabbing a few Credo shares while they're trading at a modest discount.\nJust don't expect the volatility to stop. Credo is still a relatively small company, with just $796 million of trailing revenues, and it didn't start delivering consistent bottom-line profits until a year ago. The ride will be bumpy for years to come, but so far, Credo has been heading in the right direction.\nShould you buy stock in Credo Technology Group right now? Before you buy stock in Credo Technology Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Credo Technology Group wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025\n\nRyan Peterson\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:37 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nShares of AMD have steadied near recent highs as investors digest strong AI-related momentum alongside lingering questions about how quickly the company can meaningfully close the gap with Nvidia in data center acceleration. The story right now is less about AMD's growth prospects and more about whether enthusiasm around AI chips has largely been priced in heading into year-end.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, we ran AMD through an AI price-prediction agent powered by OpenAI's GPT. The goal wasn't to set a bold long-term target, but to produce a short, data-driven outlook that blends price action, technical signals, and the current narrative around AI demand and competition.\nWhat the AI model is actually predicting The agent was fed recent price action and a focused set of inputs to produce a short-term outlook. At the time of the run, AMD traded at $207.58. For the period from Dec. 16 through Jan. 6, the model's base-case projection came out to:\nAverage predicted price: $207.30\nImplied move: essentially flat drift into early January\nSignal snapshot: MACD remains low and flat, while RSI has begun to decline, pointing to cooling momentum rather than a breakdown\n\nIn plain language, the AI sees AMD's most likely path over the next few weeks as sideways, with little incentive for traders to push the stock meaningfully higher or lower without a new catalyst. That reflects a market that's comfortable with AMD's positioning, but not eager to expand the multiple further in the near term.\nFundamentally, AMD continues to benefit from rising demand for its MI300 AI accelerators, which management has highlighted as a key growth driver into 2025 as hyperscalers diversify beyond Nvidia. Recent earnings results showed data center revenue accelerating sharply year over year, reinforcing the idea that AMD is firmly in the AI spending cycle, even if it remains a distant second to Nvidia in market share.\nAt the same time, AMD's stock has already reflected much of that optimism. Shares rallied strongly earlier in the year on AI enthusiasm and improving PC demand, leaving less room for short-term upside unless orders or guidance surprise meaningfully. Broader coverage has also noted that while MI300 adoption is growing, the pace of revenue ramp and margins will be critical to sustaining investor confidence.\n\nPrice action in December supports that view. The stock has traded in a relatively tight range, with momentum indicators softening. The declining RSI suggests buying pressure is easing, while the flat MACD points to indecision rather than distribution. That combination often precedes consolidation rather than a sharp move, especially in large-cap semiconductor names late in the year.\n\nStory Continues\nThink of this AI outlook as a short-term temperature check. The model isn't making a judgment on AMD's long-term role in AI compute or its ability to take share over time. Instead, it's estimating how the market is likely to behave while investors wait for clearer signals on AI revenue scaling, margins, and competitive dynamics. In this run, the agent favors a muted move.\n\nFor longer-term investors bullish on AMD's AI roadmap and diversified chip portfolio, a flat few weeks is largely noise. For traders, it's a reminder that the next meaningful move in AMD will likely hinge on fresh data, either stronger-than-expected AI revenue traction or clearer signs that competition is pressuring pricing and margins.\nImage: Shutterstock\nThis article ChatGPT Thinks AMD Stock Will Close At This Price By The End of 2025 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "Content": "Want Decades of Passive Income? Buy This ETF and Hold It Forever.\n\nAnders Bylund, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 11:31 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nSCHD\n\nABBV\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points The Schwab Dividend 100 ETF has delivered at least 1.3 times the S&P 500's dividend yield for its entire 12-year history.\nThe fund's top three holdings account for just 13.7% of assets, versus 20.5% for the S&P 500.\nTotal returns often lag SPY-style trackers, but income-first investors get steadier, more predictable payouts.\n10 stocks we like better than Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF ›\n\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD) , also known as the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF, is the kind of fund you pick when you want income to arrive like clockwork.\nIt skips extreme growth names with low dividend yields such as Nvidia and Microsoft . Instead, the fund leans into reliable dividend payers such as AbbVie , Home Depot , and Coca-Cola . With only 13.7% of the fund concentrated in its top three holdings, the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF spreads risk more evenly than the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and tends to produce steadier dividends over time.\nIf your goal is decades of passive income you can count on, this fund can serve as a sensible, low-maintenance core.\nWhat makes the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF tick Let's start with the basics:\nSince its founding in 2011, the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF has always offered at least 30% higher dividend yields than the average S&P 500 tracker. These days, the fund's yield stands at 3.79%, which is more than 3 times the leading market index's yield.\nIt's the only U.S.-listed fund that tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index. It's an automated index, ranking American stocks with a proprietary score based on free cash flows, debt balances, return on equity (ROE), effective yields, and five-year dividend growth rates.\nThe tech giants that rule the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes are absent from this top-100 list, presumably because of their modest dividend yields.\nThe 0.06% annual expense ratio is low enough to match many Vanguard funds, and far below popular income ETFs such as the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEMKT: JEPI) at 0.35% and the iShares iBoxx Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEMKT: LQD) with a 0.14% fee ratio.\n\nThere are other dividend-focused ETFs on the market, but the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF tracks a unique high-quality income index with a heavy focus on high-quality dividend funding. It's not a simple bet on high yields , but a more sophisticated approach that also considers each company's fiscal management and cash profits.\nThe trade-off nobody wants to talk about It should be said that the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF isn't for everyone. The fund often lags behind S&P 500 trackers like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) in terms of long-term price gains. Even if you reinvest your dividends in more shares along the way, the broader market's total returns are usually stronger. That's especially true in the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom, where many of the market's top performers come with modest dividend yields or none at all:\n\nStory Continues\nThat's the trade-off you sign up for. You give up some upside during megacap growth runs, and in return you get a steadier paycheck from your portfolio that arrives without a fuss.\nFor many income-first investors, that matters more than headline returns. Dividends pay the bills, fund weekend plans, cover health costs, or buy groceries without forcing a sale in a down market.\n\nThe Schwab Dividend 100 ETF is built for that role: reliable distributions from cash-generating businesses that have paid through cycles, and a mix of household-name holdings that feels like an old friend you can call on when you need it.\nIs this fund right for you? This dividend stability is not a promise, since dividends can be cut even in a diversified portfolio of high-quality payers. It is a practical approach, though.\nIf your plan is to find income to lean on for years, this fund makes it easier to sleep at night. You're relying on companies that have shown they can keep paying, and that they have the financial chops to keep the quarterly checks coming. Pair this security with a few growth-oriented stocks or ETFs if you still want some runway for upside, but treat the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF as the part of your portfolio that writes the checks.\n\nYou may not beat the market this way, but the Schwab Dividend 100 ETF's generous payouts should keep coming in any economy. This fund is for investors who value reliable income over maximum growth; skip it if you want to chase the next Nvidia.\nShould you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?

      "Content": "LIVE\n\nStock market today: Nasdaq sinks, leading Dow, S&P 500 lower as Oracle shares plummet\n\nKaren Friar , Brett LoGiurato and Laura Bratton\nUpdated Wed, December 17, 2025 at 12:01 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nTSLA\n\n^DJI\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nUS stocks fell on Wednesday as investors weighed what the latest data and Federal Reserve comments mean for interest rate cuts, with tech stocks under pressure as Oracle ( ORCL ) stock slid.\nThe Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) sank over 1.4%, while the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) fell around 0.9%, with both backing off slight opening gains as tech weakness returned. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) lost 0.3%, after US stocks finished mixed in Tuesday's session .\n\nAfter weeks in a data vacuum, Wall Street is trying to find a clear signal in a noisy November jobs report to pinpoint a path for interest rates next year. Markets are also waiting for the other data shoe to drop: Thursday's update on consumer inflation in November.\nIn a clue to the path ahead, Fed governor Chris Waller said Wednesday that the central bank still has scope to cut rates, hinting at \"50 to 100 basis points\" of room. Another key policymaker, the New York Fed's John Williams, is speaking at a separate appearance.\n\nMeanwhile, AI trade worries rattled tech stocks again following a Financial Times report that Oracle's $10 billion data center project has lost the backing of private lender Blue Owl Capital. It comes amid scrutiny of increasing use of debt and off-balance-sheet moves to fund tech companies' capital spending on AI infrastructure, despite persistent questions over demand for the tech. Oracle shares fell nearly 6%.\nThat intensifies the spotlight on Micron Technology's ( MU ) quarterly results, due after the bell on Wednesday. Its report should help paint a clearer picture of demand on the AI semiconductor side of the market, as the company supplies chips for Nvidia's ( NVDA ) server systems.\nElsewhere in corporates, Netflix ( NFLX ) stock rose after Warner Bros. Discovery's ( WBD ) board called on shareholders to reject a rival bid from Paramount Skydance ( PSKY ), questioning funding guarantees.\nLIVE 20 updates\n9 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nGold climbs near record while silver squeeze sends precious metal skyrocketing The price of precious metals jumped on Wednesday as the broader markets sank.\nGold ( GC=F ) neared a record high, extending its year-to-date gains to more than 60%.\nMeanwhile, silver (SI=F) jumped 5% on Wednesday, touching new highs amid what appeared to be a short squeeze, as traders who had bet on falling prices were forced to cover their positions, driving prices higher.\n\n55 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nBitcoin hovers at $86,000 as token faces 'lackluster' end of 2025 Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hovered near $86,000 on Wednesday as Wall Street remained wary of a meaningful rebound heading into the end of the year.\nRecent jitters over AI-related stocks and speculation over who will take over Fed Chair Jerome Powell's position next year may be keeping a lid on prices.\n\"For a while, the market was convinced that ultra-dove Kevin Hassett was a shoo-in for the next Fed Chair role, but now Kevin Warsh — a far more hawkish candidate — appears to be emerging as the frontrunner,\" Coin Bureau investment analyst and co-founder Nic Puckrin said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nToday at 6:45 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nGE Vernova stock pulls back after Oracle data center snafu casts doubts on AI boom GE Vernova ( GEV ) stock was one of the AI-related plays getting crushed in the wake of Oracle's ( ORCL ) nearly 5% slide on Wednesday.\nShares of the energy infrastructure company, which spun off from General Electric ( GE ) in 2024, dropped nearly 8% in midday trading as valuation concerns came to the forefront. Year to date, GE Vernova stock has run up 93%, inclusive of a 15% gain last Wednesday, after the company announced plans to roll out a fuel cell business for data centers at its investor day.\n\nGE Vernova has been seen as a beneficiary of the AI infrastructure build-out, as demand for energy transmission and grid integration is booming. According to RBC analyst Christopher Dendrinos, GE Vernova's electrification backlog has grown 4x since 2022 and is projected to double again by 2028.\nBut news that private lender Blue Owl Capital ( OWL ) will not back a $10 billion deal for Oracle's data center threw funding for that build-out into greater scrutiny on Wednesday.\nStill, GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik emphasized in an interview last week that the company has \"a lot of other drivers\" of demand. Strazik said that only 10% of the company's current backlog comes from hyperscalers, which could grow to approximately one-third of the backlog over the next three years.\n\nToday at 6:06 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nMedline stock begins trading above $35 per share Medline ( MDLN ) shares began trading on Wednesday afternoon at $35 each. The stock popped over 26% above the expected IPO price of $29.\nEarly trading gave the company, which makes gauze, hospital beds, and a host of other medical supplies, a market capitalization of $28.65 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nRead more here.\n\nToday at 5:15 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nThe stock market is being powered by 10 stocks that are fueling AI bubble fears Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes:\nRead the full story here.\n\nToday at 4:30 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nFed's Waller favors more rate cuts next year Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:\nRead more here.\n\nToday at 3:44 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nAI chip stocks sink as tech names come under pressure The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) led a partial market downturn as stocks diverged on Wednesday.\nAI chip names fell across the board, with Google ( GOOG ) TPU supplier Broadcom ( AVGO ) sinking 3% and Nvidia ( NVDA ) dropping 2%. AI chipmaking machine producer ASML ( ASML ) also shed 3%, while contract semiconductor manufacturer TSMC ( TSM ) dropped nearly 2% and Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) edged down just over 1%,\n\nToday at 3:35 PM UTC Myles Udland\n\nMedline raises $6.3 billion in year's biggest IPO The biggest IPO of 2025 is getting in just before the finish line.\nMedical supply giant Medline ( MDLN ) said late Tuesday that it had raised $6.26 billion in its IPO, selling a little over 216 million shares at $29 a piece, with the stock set to begin trading on Wednesday. The IPO values Medline at upwards of $50 billion, based on a total of roughly 1.8 billion Class A and Class B shares outstanding.\nThe deal caps the best year for the IPO market since 2021 , with Wall Street's outlook for deals and new issues even more optimistic heading into 2026 .\nRecent reports have indicated that SpaceX is likely to go public in 2026 , with the company having recently struck a deal for insiders to sell stock in Elon Musk's rocketry and satellite business that valued the company at $800 billion.\nMajor AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic are also expected to explore going public within the next 18 months, according to The Information . Database giant Databricks, which raised money at a $134 billion valuation this week, said it could explore a public offering as soon as next year.\n\nToday at 3:02 PM UTC Laura Bratton\n\nOracle drops on debt concerns Oracle ( ORCL ) shares fell nearly 4% Wednesday after the Financial Times reported that private lender Blue Owl Capital will not back a $10 billion deal for its next data center as the burgeoning AI cloud player rushes to secure computing capacity and investors scrutinize its mounting use of debt to do so.\n\nThe decline put Oracle shares down nearly 18% for the month. The stock fell after the company's earnings last week showed its costs rising more than expected while bleeding more cash than anticipated. The tech firm's $248 billion in off-balance sheet lease obligations revealed in its quarterly SEC filing added to investor fears over its growing debt pile, while its over-reliance on OpenAI to meet its ambitious revenue targets has also sent shareholders backpedaling.\nThough Oracle execs said after its earnings results that it's committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating — it currently has a BBB rating on its bonds — investors haven't been so sure, piling into Oracle credit default swaps that saw spreads reach their highest level since 2009 last week.\n\nToday at 2:45 PM UTC\n\nStocks rise at the open Stocks rose briefly at the market open as Wall Street weighed the latest jobs data and oil surged, while Oracle ( ORCL ) shares slid.\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) moved up nearly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) added 0.3% after US stocks finished mixed in Tuesday's session .\n\nToday at 2:05 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell\n\nGeneral Mills stock rises as revenue tops estimates, guidance reaffirmed General Mills stock ( GIS ) climbed about 1% in premarket trading after earnings missed estimates, but revenue came in better than expected for the quarter.\nThe Cheerios maker reported fiscal second quarter earnings per share of $0.78 on revenue of $4.86 billion. Wall Street analysts estimated earnings of $1.04 on revenue of $4.78 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nGeneral Mills' efforts to invest in its brands, divest its North American yogurt business, and unfavorable trade comparisons weighed on the results, the company said.\nFor the full fiscal year, which ends in May, General Mills reaffirmed it expects net sales growth to range from a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%. Adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS are both expected to fall 10% to 15% for the year.\nGeneral Mills' guidance was largely in line with analysts' expectations. Although many on the Street believe the packaged foods company is facing some challenges, analysts noted that these challenges are already reflected in the stock price.\n\"Underlying fundamentals remain challenging, but we think many are of the view that this is largely reflected in Street estimates and with shares trading at a discount to PF peers on a historical basis and no major surprises expected for the print itself, many find it difficult to see how the stock could trade lower,\" UBS analysts wrote in a note ahead of the results.\n\nToday at 1:30 PM UTC Brett LoGiurato\n\nHut 8 shares surge as ex-bitcoin miner signs $7 billion AI data center lease Reuters reports :\n\nRead more here .\n\nToday at 1:00 PM UTC\n\nAmerica's biggest banks are ending 2025 on top with big growth goals and markets 'wide open' Bank of America ( BAC ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), Wells Fargo ( WFC ), and Citigroup ( C ) are setting ambitious plans for growth in 2026 as they wrap up an upbeat 2025.\nYahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:\n\nRead more here .\n\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC Karen Friar\n\nWarner Bros Discovery board urges shareholders to reject rival bid from Paramount The contest for Warner Bros.

Bitcoin is now about 7% lower for the year. It was trading at about $87,100 at noon in Singapore on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the latest decline is a much milder correction than in the previous three down years, it’s happened against a vastly different backdrop. Since the last major crypto crash in 2022, institutional adoption has widened, regulation has matured, and the industry has found its arguably most important champion in US President Donald Trump.\nThe rapid lurch lower since bitcoin hit a record of over $126,000 in early October has confounded bulls and left cryptoassets struggling to find a footing. Volumes are low, investors are bailing on bitcoin ETFs and derivatives markets are showing a lack of appetite for betting on a rebound. Even massive buying from the dominant bitcoin whale — Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ) — hasn’t been enough to turn things around.\n“Most are surprised by the lack of follow-through despite so many positive catalysts,” said Pratik Kala, a portfolio manager at hedge fund Apollo Crypto.\nRead more here .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have seen their share prices reach new all-time highs, driven by strong AI-related business results across both software and cloud computing . Both companies are pushing toward $4 trillion valuations. Meanwhile, Nvidia briefly touched a $5 trillion market cap this year as big tech companies continue to buy up its graphics processing units (GPUs) as fast as it can sell them.\n\nBut not every AI-related stock has zoomed higher this year. One company, in particular, has seen its stock stuck in neutral, climbing less than 5% this year while the S&P 500 is up more than 17%. But that could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors. In fact, the stock could produce very strong returns as soon as next year. Here's why you'll want to own Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2026.\nA dominant force across three major industries Amazon may have started as a small online bookseller, but it has grown to be much more. Its marketplace offers nearly everything you can think of, and it can ship millions of items to U.S. customers within one to two days thanks to its massive fulfillment network. It has built a burgeoning advertising business that has expanded from retail media ads to video ads served through its Prime Video service and other streaming partners. And it's the largest cloud computing platform in the world, operating Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAll three businesses are experiencing rapid growth and demonstrating strong momentum.\nThe online retail business continues to produce high-single-digit revenue growth despite generating over $250 billion in annual sales. Its third-party seller services, which enable other businesses to sell through Amazon's marketplace, are showing accelerating growth, up 11% in the most recent quarter. The entire ecosystem rests on Amazon's Prime subscription service, which has steadily pushed subscription revenue 10% higher.\nAmazon's advertising business is accelerating, climbing 24% in the most recent quarter, reaching a $70 billion run rate. Prime Video is a key catalyst for that continued growth, as 80% of subscribers are on the ad-supported tier and Amazon adds more live sports content to the service. It has also partnered with several major streaming platforms through its demand-side ad-buying platform.\n\nStory Continues\nOverall, Amazon is seeing operating margin expansion in its North American and International reporting segments. A couple of factors are leading to higher margins. First, advertising sales have extremely high margins relative to product sales and even third-party services. The second is that Amazon's improvements to its fulfillment center have reduced its shipping costs. Shipping costs have increased at a slower pace than paid units in each of the last eight quarters.\n\nAmazon's cloud computing business remains the company's most important segment, accounting for most of the operating income and growing quickly. Management has successfully reaccelerated revenue growth for the segment, achieving 20% year-over-year growth last quarter, driven by strong triple-digit revenue from AI services. That rate is significantly slower than both Microsoft and Google, but AWS is also growing off a larger base.\nCEO Andy Jassy expects sales to continue at the current pace for the foreseeable future. That's supported by a growing backlog, which reached $200 billion by the end of the third quarter. Amazon also signed deals in October with commitments exceeding everything it booked in Q3, so there's a lot of momentum behind the cloud computing segment to keep growing.\n\nAmazon looks undervalued right now Amazon is investing heavily to capitalize on the opportunities it sees in both cloud computing and e-commerce. It spent $90 billion through the first three months of the year on capital expenditures (capex), and management expects full-year cash capex to come in around $125 billion. That's well above Alphabet's planned $92 billion in capex for the year and slightly more than Microsoft (which spent $80 billion through the first nine months of the year).\n\nThat high spending has weighed heavily on Amazon's free cash flow, which fell to $14.8 billion over the trailing-12-month period. That's down from $47.7 billion in the previous 12-month period. Indeed, the high capex has hit Amazon's cash flow much harder than capex has hit either Microsoft or Alphabet. That's in part because its competitors have high-margin software businesses that continue to grow quickly, offsetting their spending, while Amazon's retail business still has relatively low margins.\nBut Amazon has gone through multiple investment cycles throughout its history. Each time, it has emerged with much stronger cash flows than it had before the investment cycle. Considering the growing backlog of cloud computing contracts and the secular trend toward migrating to cloud computing services, investors should remain confident that the pattern will hold. While management expects to increase its capex further in 2026, free cash flow will eventually trough as capital intensity levels off. With strong operating cash-flow growth, Amazon should see a rapid recovery in free cash flow.\n\nAmazon has historically traded around 50 times its free cash flow near its peaks. With its current market cap of $2.5 trillion, investors are merely expecting it to return to its peak free-cash-flow levels from a bit over a year ago. It seems very likely that Amazon will far exceed those levels over time, pushing its stock price significantly higher.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "How will the stock market perform in 2026? Wall Street pros weigh in.\n\nMary Cunningham\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 10:45 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.\nThe S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17— a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.\nThe key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an AI bubble percolate?\n\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"\nOther forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.\nWhat will drive stocks in 2026?\nSeveral catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.\n\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the group said in its equity outlook. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"\nThe AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.\nAnother area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers .\n\nStory Continues\nGrowth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.\n\"That's something we haven't seen,\" he said. \"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it.\"\n\nAdam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.\nStill, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.\n\nIs my money safe?\nThe biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.\nAI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with earnings growth from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.\n\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.\nAmid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.\n\nIn its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.\nCrisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped . The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.\n\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"\nStill, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.\n\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.\nEye Opener: New video emerges of Nick Reiner moments before arrest\nWhat we know after Rob and Michele Reiner's son Nick arrested in their deaths\nMore details emerge about Rob Reiner and wife Michele's killings\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

It's the undisputed leader in accelerated computing. However, Nvidia's chips aren't the only reason why.\n\nThe company's graphics processing unit (GPU) stacks combine hardware, software, and platform solutions designed to support applications from gaming to professional visualization and accelerated computing. I believe Nvidia's vast array of solutions will reaccelerate growth in the stock price next year.\nAI solutions for the future Nvidia's revenue soared to a record $57 billion in the recently reported fiscal third quarter. That was a remarkable 62% year-over-year jump.\nSome investors believe that this kind of growth is unsustainable. That seems like a sensible position considering that level of sales. I predict that another leg of sustainable growth lies ahead that investors will begin to recognize in 2026. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has already publicly signaled what it will be, too.\n\nEven if the AI data center buildout slows, as some believe will happen, Jensen Huang sees a long growth runway for his company over the next decade. In an interview earlier this year, Huang stated, \"This is going to be the decade of AV [autonomous vehicles], robotics, autonomous machines.\"\nNvidia will supply both hardware and software to support that development. The company produces embedded systems for autonomous and robotic applications. Nvidia's Drive ADX platform provides high-level compute performance for the highest level of self-driving technology.\nThe company calls its Jetson platform \"the ideal software for robotics and generative AI at the edge.\" It's powered by Nvidia's leading Blackwell GPU, helping to generate more hardware sales, too.\n\nInvestors should continue to monitor data center growth to track the state of Nvidia's business. However, watching developments in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and machines should provide confidence that a new leg of sales growth for Nvidia is likely. That, in turn, should drive the stock higher after shares have consolidated over the past couple of months.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Micron's Make-or-Break Moment: Can AI Hype Justify a 176% Surge?\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MU\n\nAVGO\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\n^GSPC\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nMarket participants are bracing for Micron Technology ( NASDAQ:MU ) to report earnings after Wednesday's close, with the bar set high as skepticism around the AI trade begins to surface. The shares have surged 176% in 2025, ranking as the fifth-best performer in the S&P 500 and marking Micron's strongest year since 2013, well ahead of the roughly 40% gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. That momentum has softened in recent sessions, with the stock down about 12% over the past four days following a Dec. 10 high, suggesting investors may be reassessing expectations ahead of the report.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Sign with MU.\nIs MU fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe company is expected to post strong growth as sustained spending on AI data centers supports demand for its high-bandwidth memory chips, but the market appears focused on whether that momentum is still accelerating. Recent sharp declines in Oracle and Broadcom, both of which fell 11% in a single session last week, have highlighted how quickly sentiment can turn on perceived AI beneficiaries. Some investors may now be adopting a more cautious stance, waiting for clearer signals on how durable data-center growth could be before re-engaging with the sector.\nValuation remains a central part of the Micron debate. Despite this year's rally, the shares trade at roughly 11 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, the lowest multiple among the 30 stocks in the semiconductor index, which trades closer to 25 times forward earnings. That discount stands out against peers such as Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Broadcom ( NASDAQ:AVGO ), and Advanced Micro Devices ( NASDAQ:AMD ), which command significantly higher multiples. At the same time, expectations for Micron's fundamentals have been moving higher, with consensus forecasts for fiscal 2026 net earnings up 16% over the past month and more than 50% over the past quarter, while revenue estimates have risen by more than 20% over the past three months. With enthusiasm elevated and memory demand still cyclical, the upcoming earnings report could either reinforce the view that Micron is reasonably valued or test how much optimism is already reflected in the shares.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "My Surprising Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Pick for 2026\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points Investors have become impatient with the lack of immediate results from Amazon's increased spending.\nAmazon is adding more computing capacity to Amazon Web Services.\nAdvertising was Amazon's fastest-growing segment in the third quarter.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nThe \" Magnificent Seven \" is the name given to the group of Nvidia , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , Meta , Tesla , and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . These seven companies are bundled together because they have driven much of the stock market's gains in recent years. As of Dec. 15, they are seven of the world's top nine most valuable companies and represent nearly 35% of the S&P 500 .\nSo far this year, every \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has produced double-digit returns except for one: Amazon.\nOnce the face of growth stocks, Amazon has lagged over the past year, frustrating its investors along the way. Despite that retreat, Amazon may be positioned to bounce back in 2026.\nWhy has Amazon's stock been lagging? There hasn't been one issue that's caused Amazon's underperformance. It's more a combination of factors. First, Amazon has spent a lot of money this year, with capital expenditures (capex) of around $90 billion through the first nine months of 2025.\nGiven how much Amazon has been spending (mostly on AI infrastructure), investors have been wanting more to show for it -- especially when it comes to Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth. With many of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks making big splashes in AI, some people viewed Amazon as falling behind in the race.\nAmazon's heavy spending has weighed on its free cash flow, and that's not something investors typically like without seeing more immediate results. Add in how expensive Amazon's stock has been, and there was little room for error in many investors' eyes.\nAWS is positioning itself for the future AWS may not have been producing the results that we've grown used to seeing over the years, but investors jumping ship seems like a premature overreaction (which is no surprise if you know investors). Yes, AWS has been losing market share to Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, but it's still the world's largest cloud platform by far.\n\nCloud platforms are, and will continue to be, crucial to AI training and scaling. That's why Amazon has been focusing so much on building out more infrastructure and adding computing capacity. It has added more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months and plans to double its capacity through 2027.\n\nStory Continues\nThis investment is noteworthy because, according to calculations from investment bank Oppenheimer , each incremental gigawatt of capacity could add $3 billion in revenue. The high capex might be weighing on Amazon's financials right now, but it's poised to pay off in the long term.\nAmazon has an underrated profit machine There's no doubt that AWS is Amazon's profit engine, accounting for most of its operating income. However, advertising is a high-margin business that has been growing steadily over the past couple of years.\nOn one hand, Amazon has access to data from its millions of customers and Prime members, making it more effective at helping advertisers with targeted ad campaigns. They know what customers buy, when they buy it, what they watch, what they listen to, what they browse, and other information that allows advertisers to target with greater precision.\nOn the other hand, Amazon's massive reach means it has plenty of places to set these ads. Whether it's online, when you search for a specific product, stream something on Prime Video, watch Twitch, or listen to music, there's no shortage of real estate for advertisers looking to reach potential customers. Amazon also announced that it recently struck partnerships that allow its advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix , Spotify , and SiriusXM .\n\nIn the third quarter, Amazon's advertising services revenue grew 24% to $17.7 billion, outpacing its revenue from subscriptions ($12.5 billion). Beyond revenue growth, advertising is a high-margin business that can help Amazon boost its overall profitability. I expect the momentum to continue in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Google teams with Meta’s PyTorch to chip away at Nvidia’s moat, Reuters says\n\nLuke Juricic\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:17 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nInvesting.com -- Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is intensifying efforts to make its proprietary artificial intelligence hardware more compatible with the industry’s leading software, a move aimed at challenging NVIDIA Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) grip on the AI computing market, Reuters reported Wednesday.\n\nThe initiative, known internally as \"TorchTPU,\" focuses on optimizing Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to run PyTorch, an open-source framework originally developed by Meta Platforms Inc. PyTorch has become the global standard for AI development, and its seamless integration with Nvidia’s hardware has historically acted as a significant barrier to entry for competing chipmakers.\nFor years, Google’s TPUs were primarily optimized for its own internal software framework, Jax. While efficient for Google’s internal workloads, this requirement created a \"bottleneck\" for external enterprise customers who have already built their AI infrastructure on PyTorch, according to the Reuters report, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe TorchTPU project represents a shift in organizational focus. By allocating more engineering resources to ensure TPUs are \"developer-friendly\" for the broader PyTorch ecosystem, Google aims to make its silicon a more viable alternative to Nvidia’s market-leading GPUs.\nThe push comes as Google Cloud seeks to prove to investors that its massive capital investments in AI hardware are yielding scalable returns.\nCloud Revenue: TPU adoption is a critical engine for Google’s cloud division, which competes with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.\nThe CUDA Moat: Wall Street analysts often cite Nvidia’s CUDA software as its primary competitive advantage. By natively supporting PyTorch, Google is attempting to neutralize that advantage.\nOpen-Source Strategy: To accelerate market uptake, Google is reportedly considering open-sourcing components of the new software bridge.\n\nWhile Nvidia remains the dominant provider of AI processors, the high cost and limited availability of its chips have led major tech firms to seek alternatives. Meta, one of Nvidia’s largest customers, has been a key proponent of open-source software like PyTorch to ensure hardware flexibility across the industry.\nBy creating a software bridge that allows developers to easily switch away from Nvidia hardware, Google seems set on positioning its own chips to undercut Nvidia’s premium pricing and force a more competitive environment across the AI data center market.\nNvidia stock is down 3.1% in late morning trading, while Alphabet has dropped 3% itself.\n\nStory Continues\nRelated articles\nGoogle teams with Meta’s PyTorch to chip away at Nvidia’s moat, Reuters says\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Amazon Set to Waste $10 Billion on OpenAI\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:15 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nAmazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) apparently cannot help itself. Media reports say it plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI.\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) reportedly plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI, a firm swarmed by competition.\nClearly, Amazon is trying to buy its way into the AI market when the bubble may be about to burst.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nOpenAI, which until recently has been the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world, has raised money from a long list of investors. Some are venture capitalists who are simply writing checks to get returns. However, another list consists of money or strategic deals with Microsoft, Oracle, Softbank, Nvidia, and, soon, Disney.\nWhat these tech investors are getting is a stake in a company that has had its spot at the top of the industry challenged by Gemini 3. That is an Alphabet Inc. ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) offering. It is also one that the company says will not make money until 2030, one that will need hundreds of billions of dollars to hit its ambiguous goals, and one that has a growing number of direct competitors. These competitors include divisions of public companies, well-funded xAI and Anthropic, and a legion of smaller companies.\n\nBloomberg reports, “OpenAI is in initial discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. and use its chips, a potential win for the online retailer’s effort to broaden its AI industry presence and compete with Nvidia Corp.” Amazon is a tiny player in the AI chip business. Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) dominates, with a market cap of $4.33 trillion, which makes it the most valuable company in the world. Put plainly, the Amazon deal is part of the dangerous “round tripping” that goes on in the industry. One company invests in another. The company that gets the investment uses the money to buy products or services from the investor.\nAmazon clearly has little chance of competing head-to-head with Nvidia, so it is buying its way into the market. And Amazon can hardly say it is getting special treatment from OpenAI. The Financial Times reports, “OpenAI has already locked in $1.5tn in long-term deals with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom to supply chips and other computing infrastructure.”\nOpenAI does have one important strategic advantage in an Amazon deal. Like the rest of the AI world, it does not want to be trapped in a world where Nvidia is the only arms supplier.\n\nStory Continues\nPeople have begun to ask whether the AI industry has created a valuation bubble. They are worried that the companies leading the race into AI will never make money. Many AI products are currently free. Investors worry that the data centers needed to run AI will take years to build and may not have enough electricity to run them. Still others believe that not all the large AI companies can survive in a brutally competitive market. The total of these investments will eventually move into the trillions of dollars.\n\nThe Amazon deal with OpenAI is another example that the train has run off the rails.\nAmazon Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Exclusive-Google works to erode Nvidia's software advantage with Meta's help\n\nReuters\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 7:02 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nDec 17 (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google is working on a new initiative to make its artificial intelligence chips better at running PyTorch, the world’s most widely used AI software framework, in a move aimed at weakening Nvidia 's longstanding dominance of the AI computing market, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe effort is part of Google's aggressive plan to make its Tensor Processing ​Units a viable alternative to Nvidia's market-leading GPUs. TPU sales have become a crucial growth engine of Google's cloud revenue as it seeks to prove to investors that its AI investments are generating returns.\nBut ‌hardware alone is not enough to spur adoption. The new initiative, known internally as “TorchTPU,” aims to remove a key barrier that has slowed adoption of TPU chips by making them fully compatible and developer-friendly for customers who have already built their tech infrastructure using PyTorch software, the ‌sources said. Google is also considering open-sourcing parts of the software to speed uptake among customers, some of the people said.\n\nCompared with earlier attempts to support PyTorch on TPUs, Google has devoted more organizational focus, resources and strategic importance to TorchTPU, as demand grows from companies that want to adopt the chips but view the software stack as a bottleneck, the sources said.\nPyTorch, an open-source project heavily supported by Meta Platforms, is one of the most widely used tools for developers who make AI models. In Silicon Valley, very few developers write every line of code that chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices or Google will actually execute.\nInstead, those developers rely on tools like PyTorch, which is a ⁠collection of pre-written code libraries and frameworks that automate many common tasks in ‌developing AI software. Originally released in 2016, PyTorch’s history has been closely tied to Nvidia’s development of CUDA, the software that some Wall Street analysts regard as the company’s strongest shield against competitors.\n\nNvidia’s engineers have spent years ensuring that software developed with PyTorch runs as fast and efficiently as possible on its chips. Google, by contrast, has long ‍had its internal armies of software developers use a different code framework called Jax, and its TPU chips use a tool called XLA to make that code run efficiently. Much of Google’s own AI software stack and performance optimization has been built around Jax, widening the gap between how Google uses its chips and how customers want to use them.\nA Google Cloud spokesperson did not comment on the specifics of the project, but confirmed to Reuters that the move would provide customers with choice.\n\nStory Continues\n\"We ​are seeing massive, accelerating demand for both our TPU and GPU infrastructure,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our focus is providing the flexibility and scale developers need, regardless of the hardware they choose to build on.\"\nTPU FOR CUSTOMERS\nAlphabet had ‌long reserved the lion’s share of its own chips, or TPUs, for in-house use only. That changed in 2022, when Google’s cloud computing unit successfully lobbied to oversee the group that sells TPUs. The move drastically increased Google Cloud's allocation of TPUs and as customers' interest in AI has grown, Google has sought to capitalize by ramping up production and sales of TPUs to external customers.\n\nBut the mismatch between the PyTorch frameworks used by most of the world’s AI developers and the Jax frameworks that Google’s chips are currently most finely tuned to run means that most developers cannot easily adopt Google’s chips and get them to perform as well as Nvidia’s without undertaking significant, extra engineering work. Such work takes time and money in the fast-paced AI race.\nIf successful, Google's “TorchTPU” initiative could significantly reduce switching costs for companies that want alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia’s dominance has been reinforced ⁠not only by its hardware but by its CUDA software ecosystem, which is deeply embedded in PyTorch and has become the ​default method by which companies train and run large AI models.\n\nEnterprise customers have been telling Google that TPUs are harder to adopt ​for AI workloads because they historically required developers to switch to Jax, a machine-learning framework favored internally at Google, rather than PyTorch, which most AI developers already use, the sources said.\nJOINT EFFORTS WITH META\nTo speed development, Google is working closely with Meta, the creator and steward of PyTorch, according to the sources. The two tech giants have been discussing deals ‍for Meta to access more TPUs, a move first reported ⁠by The Information.\nEarly offerings for Meta were structured as Google-managed services, in which customers like Meta installed Google's chips designed to run Google software and models, with Google providing operational support. Meta has a strategic interest in working on software that makes it easier to run TPUs, in a bid to lower inference costs and diversify its AI infrastructure away from Nvidia’s GPUs to gain negotiating power, the people ⁠said.\n\nMeta declined to comment.\nThis year, Google has begun selling TPUs directly into customers’ data centers rather than limiting access to its own cloud. Amin Vahdat, a Google veteran, was named head of AI infrastructure this month, reporting directly to CEO Sundar Pichai.\nGoogle needs that ‌infrastructure both to run its own AI products, including the Gemini chatbot and AI-powered search, and to supply customers of Google Cloud, which sells access to TPUs to companies such as ‌Anthropic.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu, Kenrick Cai and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This $500k Retirement Portfolio Pays $7,700 Per Month\n\nOmor Ibne Ehsan\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:55 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: SI=F\n\nTLT\n\nNVDA\n\nTLTW\n\nJEPI\n\nQuick Read iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF (TLTW) yields 13.92% through covered calls on long-term Treasury bonds.\nTLTW holdings likely benefit from Fed rate cuts as long-term bonds increase in value.\nA three-ETF strategy combining TLTW with gold and silver covered call funds targets 18.5% total yield.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nIf you want a $7.7k monthly income on a $500k portfolio, some may call you crazy, but it is still possible. ETFs like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF ( BATS:TLTW ) , FT Vest Gold Strategy Target Income ETF (BATS:IGLD) , and the Ubs Ag Etracs Silver Shares Covered Call ETN Exp 21 Apr 2033 (NASDAQ:SLVO) give you very high yields and a respectable safety profile that can boost your yields massively if you put them in your portfolio.\nThe catch is that these ETFs alone should not constitute your entire portfolio. If you have a portfolio of, say, $1 million, and you want a little more income, you can set aside $500k to higher-yielding ETFs like these to boost your overall income while having some funds to fall back on just in case they don't do as well.\n\nIf not, you should only chase more yield if you fall into any of the two following categories:\nYou are nearing the end of your retirement, and you want to end it lavishly.\nYou're struggling to make ends meet, and you're willing to sacrifice some safety for yield.\nA $500k portfolio churning out $7.7k per month means $92.4k a year, or an 18.5% yield. The following 3 ETFs can make that happen. You can squeeze out even more yield if you allocate more money to the higher-yielding ones, but I'll assume you're just going to split your money equally among them for the sake of this article.\nFT Vest Gold Strategy Target Income ETF (IGLD) The FT Vest Gold Strategy Target Income ETF gives you exposure to the price movements of gold via the popular SPDR Gold Trust ETF ( NYSEARCA:GLD ) while also generating a consistent monthly income. Simply put, it tracks gold but adds extra income by writing call options on gold and then collecting premiums.\n\nYour typical covered call ETF that targets the stock market also generates its income this way. The difference is that gold is much more likely to stay solid through a recession. One bad jobs report, or a major company like Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) reporting a bad quarter, can send covered-call ETFs like JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF ( NYSE:JEPI ) down by double digits. They're only flashy today due to the extended rally.\n\nStory Continues\nIGLD has a stronger foundation as gold itself looks incredibly strong right now, with central banks worldwide stockpiling gold. Sanctions on Russia have caused gold exports from the country to plunge. It's a triple whammy that favors gold when you take the shaky global economy into account.\nIGLD yields 7.39% with an expense ratio of 0.85%, or $85 per $10,000. It's steep, but you won't find a higher-yielding name if you want to buy something that targets GLD.\n\niShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF (TLTW) The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond Buywrite Strategy ETF executes a very similar strategy, this time with U.S. Treasury bonds. It holds shares of another ETF called the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ( NASDAQ:TLT ) , which holds U.S. bonds expiring in 20+ years.\nThen, it uses monthly covered call options on those holdings to boost income.\n\nAgain, this is much better than your run-of-the-mill covered call ETF in terms of safety. Bonds are not going to shift under your feet, because they're the safest asset you can hold. Besides, you are likely to get upside on top of the generous yield as Fed interest rates come down. The Fed lowered its interest rates last week, and this is going to make long-term bonds more expensive as they already have secured a higher yield until they mature.\nAnd even if a recession hits, I expect TLTW and TLT to go up, not down. TLT went from $95 to over $122 in a few months as interest rates were cut drastically in 2008. Today, TLT trades below $90 and snaps back quickly as Wall Street gets hungrier for yield. This will translate into more upside for TLTW, as it holds TLT.\n\nThe catch is that TLTW will underperform if the TLT remains flat, which is unlikely to stand the case as the Fed is cutting.\nTLTW yields 13.92%. The expense ratio is 0.35%, or $35 per $10,000.\nUbs Ag Etracs Silver Shares Covered Call ETN Exp 21 Apr 2033 (SLVO) The Ubs Ag Etracs Silver Shares Covered Call ETN Exp 21 Apr 2033 tracks the performance of an index that mimics owning shares of a silver ETF. You benefit from rises in silver prices, but your upside is capped each month. It's very similar to IGLD but more aggressive.\nDo note that this is not an ETF. It is a debt note from UBS (credit risk involved), and it matures on April 21, 2033.\n\nSLVO has long been a loser in the market, as it did not offer any capital appreciation until very recently. If you reinvested the dividends, it would still get you 2% to 3% a year.\nHowever, what changed the equation is that silver prices have tripled since 2024. This is due to unceasing demand from multiple sectors like solar, AI, and more. Plus, silver is seen as a safe haven like gold. Many believe it can still deliver multibagger returns from here as silver's valuation still pales in comparison to the historical gold/silver ratio.\nSLVO is very under-the-radar and gets you a 34.73% yield. The expense ratio is 0.65%, or $65 per $10,000.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

The talks, which remain preliminary and subject to change, could value OpenAI north of $500 billion and may involve the ChatGPT creator adopting Amazon's Trainium chips. If the discussions progress, the arrangement could represent an incremental but meaningful step for Amazon's semiconductor ambitions, particularly as large AI developers begin to test alternatives to Nvidia's dominant GPU offerings.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs MSFT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nTrainium is positioned as a core part of Amazon's broader AI strategy alongside Amazon Web Services, which remains the largest global provider of cloud computing and data storage. Despite that scale, AWS has faced stiff competition in attracting AI developers from rivals such as Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), one of OpenAI's largest backers, as well as platforms linked to Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) and Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), both of which have been evaluating non-Nvidia chip options. Amazon has suggested that Trainium chips could handle AI workloads more cheaply and efficiently than Nvidia's market-leading GPUs, an argument aimed at customers seeking cost-effective infrastructure as AI spending accelerates.\n\nThe negotiations between OpenAI and Amazon reportedly began around October, following a corporate restructuring at OpenAI that resulted in Microsoft taking a 27% ownership stake after nearly a year of talks. OpenAI was most recently valued at $500 billion in an employee share sale, briefly placing it ahead of SpaceX as the world's largest startup and highlighting the intensity of investor interest in AI leaders. At the same time, some market observers have warned that parts of the AI funding cycle could be vulnerable to excess, particularly where capital flows loop between suppliers and customers. Notably, OpenAI and Amazon announced last month that AWS will provide $38 billion of cloud computing capacity over seven years, a deal centered on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips, suggesting that any future shift toward Trainium would unfold alongside, rather than immediately replace, existing infrastructure commitments.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

There are already businesses winning the AI race, whether they make hardware, operate cloud platforms, or run the large language models that have become so popular among consumers.\nBut other industries are starting to embrace AI instead of fighting it, showcasing how seriously executive teams are taking this new technology to bolster their competitive positions.\nIn fact, a prominent streaming giant just decided to partner with a top AI company in a move that could impact the media and entertainment sector. Investors should take notice.\nThe House of Mouse is leaning into AI It was announced on Dec. 11 that Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) entered a three-year partnership with OpenAI , licensing more than 200 characters (including Mickey Mouse, characters from Inside Out and Frozen, and Marvel superheroes) for photo generation on ChatGPT and video generation on Sora by those apps' user bases. Disney can show these user-generated videos on Disney+, its streaming platform.\n\nWhat's more, Disney will invest $1 billion in OpenAI. And it will become a customer, integrating OpenAI's technology across its organization in various ways for its employees and to help create new products for customers.\nThis is clear evidence that Disney is leaning into AI, at a time when those in Hollywood worry about the tech's impact on content creation.\n\"Disney and OpenAI affirm a shared commitment to responsible use of AI that protects the safety of users and the rights of creators,\" the press release reads.\nThis is an encouraging statement for those in the industry, but it will be interesting to see how much appetite there is for watching AI-created videos from viewers.\nDisney benefits because it can potentially earn incremental revenue by leveraging its intellectual property in this new way. While it's not known if the business will make money from its characters' use on ChatGPT or Sora prompts, it can drive more engagement on Disney+ if this type of short-form content catches on. Disney could better compete with Meta Platforms ' Reels on Facebook and Instagram and Alphabet 's YouTube Shorts. There is intense competition for attention .\n\nStory Continues\nAnd it gives Disney a first-mover advantage. Perhaps if AI-generated videos go viral, investors could see similar moves by Netflix , for example.\nOne obvious critique of this decision might be that Disney is selling out and diluting the value of its intellectual property, making its famous characters available to the masses. With ChatGPT counting 800 million weekly users (as of early November), however, this is a good example of a media and entertainment powerhouse attempting to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nInvestors can find value in the streaming market This partnership highlights just how valuable Disney's intellectual property is. With characters, storylines, and franchises that span Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm, no company can go toe-to-toe with this depth and breadth of content. It makes sense that OpenAI would want to sign a deal with an industry leader. This also suggests there has been significant demand from ChatGPT and Sora users to be more creative and work with Disney characters rather than other studios' intellectual property.\n\nFrom an investment point of view, those looking to put capital to work in the streaming industry might want to consider Disney. It has become a leader in the streaming wars, with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN providing a full range of content for an entire household. And its experiences segment is extremely profitable.\nShares currently trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.8. It's difficult to find value like this in the stock market these days.\nShould you buy stock in Walt Disney right now?

The program awarded $1.5 million in AI cloud compute and inference credits to startups selected from more than 250 applicants across 60+ countries.\nRLWRLD was selected as the top winner following evaluations by a judging panel that included leaders from NVIDIA, OpenAI, ABB, Physical Intelligence, and venture firms such as Khosla Ventures, Accel, Next47, and Shanda Grab Ventures. Judges assessed finalists on technical originality, scalability, and readiness for real-world deployment.\nAs the first-place winner in the Foundation Models category, RLWRLD received $150,000 in Nebius AI Cloud compute and inference credits, accelerated by NVIDIA AI infrastructure.\n\nThe Nebius Robotics & Physical AI Awards were created to spotlight startups building the models and systems required to deploy Physical AI in real industrial environments. Sixteen companies were recognized across categories spanning Foundation Models, Simulation, Robot Runtime, Industrial Deployment, and Vision AI.\nRLWRLD’s work focuses on building robot foundation models designed for high-difficulty manipulation and reliable industrial deployment, rather than technology demonstrations for general-purpose robotics. At the core of its platform is RLDX, a proprietary robotics foundation model capable of controlling a 15-degree-of-freedom robotic hand, enabling precise manipulation tasks that require human-level dexterity.\nJudges also cited RLWRLD’s use of high-fidelity, multimodal industrial data and its active collaboration with industry partners as indicators of the company’s commercial readiness, particularly for manufacturing and logistics environments where reliability and precision are critical.\n“Winning this category reinforces our belief that Physical AI needs foundation models built for the real world, not just controlled demos,” said Jung-hee Ryu, CEO of RLWRLD . “This recognition reflects the progress we’ve made working directly with industry partners to deploy our technology.”\n\nStory Continues\nFollowing the award, RLWRLD plans to expand global partnerships and accelerate commercial deployment of its foundation models across humanoid and industrial robotics, with a focus on manufacturing and logistics environments in the U.S. and Asia.\nAbout RLWRLD\nFounded in 2024, RLWRLD is a Physical AI startup developing robot foundation models that enable machines to see, sense, and act with human-like dexterity and cognition.

      "Content": "The stock market is being powered by 10 stocks that are fueling AI bubble fears\n\nBrian Sozzi · Executive Editor\nUpdated Wed, December 17, 2025 at 6:28 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\n^SPX\n\nGOOG\n\nIf you're in the \"stock market is in a bubble\" camp, look no further than the composition of the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\nThe top 10 stocks now account for roughly 32% of S&P 500 earnings and over 41% of total market capitalization — levels not seen since at least 1980, according to new data from Barclays strategist Venu Krishna.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been the primary driver of this market power concentration. Those seven companies — Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), Nvidia ( NVDA ), and Apple ( AAPL ) — are essentially powering the artificial intelligence boom.\nThese stocks are up on average 21% this year compared to a 15% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data. Alphabet is the top performer with an advance of 62% amid optimism on its new Gemini 3 model.\nIn turn, the valuation of the S&P 500 has reached a level even most bulls would agree is on the rich side. Krishna's work reveals the S&P 500 is trading at the 91st percentile relative to its 10-year valuation history.\n\"Complacency\" could ignite an AI bubble, Deutsche Bank strategist Adrian Cox told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid (video above).\nRead more: How AI, unemployment, and interest rates could shape the stock market and your investments next year\nIndeed, complacency appears to have settled in, despite the risks investors had to endure this year.\nRemember the \"Liberation Day\" tariff spectacle in April? The S&P 500 tanked 4.8% the day after President Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on April 2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI ) dropped a staggering 1,679 points.\n\nTariffs are now in effect, though they are not as severe as first advertised.\nAnd more recently, disappointments from AI darlings CoreWeave ( CRWV ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) have begun to call into question the near-term outlook for the AI trade.\n\"I think we're going to see some pretty massive bifurcation in 2026 in the AI trade,\" Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye said on Opening Bid .\nAlphabet is Essaye's top AI pick for 2026, though he acknowledges there are likely to be winners and losers from the Magnificent Seven complex next year.\n\"I think companies like Oracle that [are] not overextended financially but are sort of raising eyebrows with a lot of the spending that is tied to open AI, I think that companies like that could struggle,\" Essaye added. \"There's going to be some pretty serious bifurcation. We've seen it in the last, say, two months of 2025. I think that gets worse in 2026.\"\n\nStory Continues\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

      "Content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 17)\n\nJoel South\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:25 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTM\n\nTOYOF\n\nTSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nShares of Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) have retreated 3.4% in the past week, as it announced the acquisition of SchedMD and a partnership with Mistral AI, and in the wake of the White House approving sales of H200 chips to certain Chinese customers. Meanwhile, insiders continue to sell shares. Nvidia’s stock is 22.8% higher than six months ago, outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in that time.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points U.S.-China trade relations have presented headwinds, but Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) is also the dominant AI chipmaker in the market, and the company’s profitability remains strong.\nHere is a look at where Nvidia stock could be headed for the rest of this year and into the next.\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here .\n\nNote that gains for the chipmaker in that time have helped wipe away the steep drop the stock suffered early in 2025, after it reported it would take a $5.5 billion charge tied to the H20 chip export restrictions to China. While some analysts have raised price targets, others caution about ongoing headwinds due to uncertainty surrounding future U.S.-China trade relations and the potential for stricter regulations. The third-quarter report was stellar on the top and bottom lines due to strong growth in the data center segment.\nDespite its challenges, the company's pivot to U.S. AI infrastructure investments signals resilience. With analysts eyeing robust data center demand, 24/7 Wall St. here explores whether Nvidia can sustain its recovery and drive further growth.\n\nWhy Invest in Nvidia? Nvidia faces significant hurdles as it navigates U.S.-China trade restrictions and intense market expectations. In the first quarter, export controls on its H20 AI chip—which had been designed specifically to circumvent export restrictions on advanced technology to China—led to the substantial write-down noted above. Analysts believed the ban could result in a $9 billion revenue hit. Some $700 million would affect fiscal first-quarter results, with the remaining $8 billion spread across the second and third quarters.\n\nU.S. tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures also threatened supply chain costs, particularly for components sourced globally, while competition from Huawei’s Ascend chips grows. These factors had analysts warning of margin pressure. Yet, Nvidia's profitability remains robust. The company has reportedly raised prices 10% to 15% on some of its most popular GPUs as a result of the tariffs. Gaming processor prices jumped 5% to 10%, while it hiked high-end AI GPUs as much as 15% to account for surging manufacturing costs and to keep its earnings stable.\n\nStory Continues\nYet investments in U.S. AI infrastructure, supported by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's $165 billion Arizona fab expansion, bolster Nvidia's supply chains and are backed by its $37.6 billion cash reserve.\nCEO Huang announced during his recent trip to South Korea that Nvidia will supply more than 260,000 advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to South Korean firms, including Samsung and Hyundai Motor. He believes AI has reached a \"virtuous cycle\" where improvements in the models lead to more investment, which in turn leads to further improvement and investment. He also expressed hope that trade talks between the U.S. and China might lead to a change in policy that allows Nvidia to resume sales of state-of-the-art chips in China. As mentioned, the U.S. president has now allowed the company to sell its advanced H200 AI chips to China.\n\nThe AI market is projected to grow at a 37% CAGR through 2030, according to Grand View Research. This supports Nvidia’s $170 billion fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, a 30% increase over the $130.5 billion it generated in 2025.\nNvidia as a Company In its third-quarter earnings report, Nvidia revenue totaled a record $57.01 billion, including $51.2 billion from its data center division. The total was up 66% year over year, largely fueled by the voracious demand for its AI chips.\nThe chipmaker invested $3.2 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, expanding Blackwell accelerator production and AI infrastructure. The company's capex has spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion to meet hyperscaler demand.\n\nU.S.-China trade restrictions still pose risks, even with the seeming thaw, tariffs could raise costs, which would explain the price hikes reportedly implemented. A 36% operating expense increase to $5.8 billion for R&D offset Nvidia's adjusted operating income of $37.8 billion.\nYet, Nvidia's growth is not solely tied to data centers. The company expanded its automotive segment, with a 32% year-over-year increase to $592 million, driven by partnerships with Toyota and Aurora Innovation for autonomous vehicles. This diversifies Nvidia's portfolio amid tariff uncertainties.\nNvidia has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of $65 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook exceeded analysts' consensus projection.\nNvidia as a Stock This has been a rollercoaster year for Nvidia shareholders. The stock dropped to a 52-week low of $86.62 in April. After an announced pause in U.S.-China tariffs and the first-quarter results, the share price recovered. It hit an all-time high of $212.19 in October, which had the company's market cap briefly over $5 trillion.\n\nWhile some insiders have been selling shares, analyst sentiment remains bullish. Of 64 analysts who cover the stock, 60 recommend buying shares, 11 of them with Strong Buy ratings. Their consensus one-year price target is $250.93, which signals over 41% upside potential from its current price. Targets range from $140 to $352 per share.\nCitigroup, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and others recently maintained their Buy-equivalent ratings. Evercore ISI has the street-high target price. It cited accelerating revenue growth, strong demand for Blackwell chips, an improving supply chain, and a significant pipeline. Yet, renowned investor Michael Burry is bearish on Nvidia.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$140.00\n−21.2%\nMedian\n$250.93\n41.2%\nHigh\n$352.00\n98.1%\n\nNvidia's AI dominance, 93% data center growth, and automotive partnerships with Toyota positioned the company for gains in 2025. However, tariff risks and DeepSeek’s competitive AI models require caution. The AI market's growth and the chipmaker's $47 billion second-quarter revenue position Nvidia to achieve its $170 billion full-year revenue target, while its cash buffer and Stargate Project role offer stability. Still, valuation concerns linger. Nvidia is a buy for growth-oriented investors, but others should use caution.\n\n24/7 Wall St.'s 2026 year-end price target for Nvidia is $300.14 per share, which would be a 68.9% gain. That estimate accounts for tariff risks, competition from DeepSeek, and potential Blackwell supply constraints. It also reflects Nvidia's AI dominance and second-quarter 2026 revenue guidance.\nTime to Sell Nvidia Stock as Michael Burry Takes Aim?\n\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are.

      "Content": "Marvell Technology Looks Undervalued as Artificial Intelligence Spending Surges\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Marvell Technology is one of the most undervalued AI stocks right now, and it's down by 25% this year.\nA sale and acquisition have positioned the company to become a long-term winner in the AI data center boom.\nA questionable rumor still weighs heavily on the stock despite Marvell Technology's CEO rebuking it.\n10 stocks we like better than Marvell Technology ›\n\nIf you want to find undervalued artificial intelligence (AI) stocks , you have to start with ones that aren't receiving as much hype. Nvidia is the most well-known growth stock right now, and Palantir Technologies is another AI leader that has attracted plenty of investors.\nHowever, fewer investors know about Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) , and a few controversial rumors have made the stock even cheaper. Marvell Technology is a custom AI chipmaker that investors may want to monitor.\nDispelling the rumors Marvell Technology looked undervalued for most of the year. Its revenue growth rates have steadily outpaced the stock's 25% year-to-date decline. However, Marvell took another hit when rumors swirled around that the company lost a lot of business from Amazon and Microsoft .\nThat type of news would be devastating for the company. AI chipmakers make most of their revenue from a small handful of tech companies , and losing two of the largest hyperscalers in the industry would limit future growth opportunities. Other tech companies may be wary of doing business with an AI chipmaker that lost Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nHowever, Marvell Technology CEO Matt Murphy poured cold water on the rumors when speaking with CNBC's Jim Cramer. Murphy told viewers that Marvell did not lose any business from those tech giants.\nThe debunked rumor continues to weigh on the stock price, which presents an opportunity for long-term investors. However, the credibility around this rumor isn't the only reason investors should appreciate the dip in Marvell Technology stock.\nMarvell's valuation hasn't moved as quickly as its revenue Marvell Technology has a 23.5 forward P/E ratio and continues to post impressive revenue growth. The chipmaker boosted its sales by 37% year over year in the third quarter of its fiscal 2026, ended Nov. 1, while operating income increased by 23% year over year.\nThe net income figure for the third quarter isn't the best for gauging the stock since that number includes the proceeds from a $2.5 billion sale of its automotive Ethernet business. It's a one-off event that inflated Marvell Technology's net income growth, but the company has maintained a net profit margin of roughly 10% in previous quarters.\n\nStory continues\nThis isn't even the first quarter of strong growth for fiscal 2026. Marvell delivered 63% and 58% year-over-year revenue growth rates in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2026. Its revenue and net income are moving in the right direction despite its stock price suggesting that the complete opposite has happened.\n\nMarvell Technology is locked into AI chip growth Marvell's $2.5 billion divestiture gave it more capital while freeing up resources to prioritize custom AI chips. However, the company didn't just stop with selling off a slower part of its business. The AI chipmaker acquired photonic fabric provider Celestial AI for $3.25 billion. The total acquisition may be valued at $5.5 billion if certain sales objectives are achieved.\n\nThe deal should help Marvell Technology scale faster in the burgeoning AI data center industry and boost demand for its AI chips. AWS Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services Dave Brown praised the December acquisition, casting even more doubt into rumors that Marvell Technology lost business from two tech giants.\nMarvell swapped a slow-growth business for a high-growth one that complements its AI ambitions nicely. Investors have not yet priced in this reality. Marvell shares traded above $100 per share to start the year, and it may be due for a rally to all-time highs soon enough.\nIf the AI chipmaker continues to post 30%-plus year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2027 and beyond, the mismatch between revenue growth and its current valuation will become more difficult to ignore.\n\nShould you buy stock in Marvell Technology right now?

      "Content": "Exclusive-How China built its ‘Manhattan Project’ to rival the West in AI chips\n\nFanny Potkin\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:17 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nINTC\n\nSSNLF\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nBy Fanny Potkin\nSINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence , smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. ​The smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\nNevertheless, China still faces ‌major technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government ‌initiative to achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.\n\nStory Continues\nChinese electronics giant Huawei plays a key role coordinating a web of companies and state research institutes across the country involving thousands of engineers, according to the two people and a third source.\nThe people described it as China's version of the Manhattan Project, the U.S. wartime effort to develop the atomic bomb.\n\n“The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,” one of the people said. \"China wants the United States 100% kicked out of its supply chains.\"\nHuawei, the State Council of China, the Chinese Embassy in Washington, and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to requests for comment.\nUntil now, only one company has mastered EUV technology: ASML, headquartered in Veldhoven, Netherlands. Its machines, which cost around $250 million, are indispensable for manufacturing the most advanced chips designed by companies like Nvidia and AMD—and produced by chipmakers such as TSMC, Intel, and Samsung.\nASML built its first working prototype of EUV technology in 2001, and told Reuters it took nearly two decades and billions of euros in R&D spending before it produced its first commercially-available chips in 2019.\n\n“It makes sense that companies would want to replicate our technology, but doing so is no small ⁠feat,” ASML told Reuters in a statement.\nASML's EUV systems are currently available to U.S. allies including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan.\nStarting in 2018, the United States began pressuring ‌the Netherlands to block ASML from selling EUV systems to China. The restrictions expanded in 2022, when the Biden administration imposed sweeping export controls designed to cut off China's access to advanced semiconductor technology.\nThe controls targeted not just EUV systems but also older deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines that produce less-advanced chips like Huawei’s, aiming to keep China at least a generation behind in chipmaking capabilities.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said the Trump Administration has strengthened enforcement of export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and is working with partners \"to close loopholes as technology advances.”\nThe Dutch Ministry of Defence said the Netherlands is developing policies requiring “knowledge institutions” to perform personnel screenings to prevent access to sensitive technology “by individuals that have ill intentions or who are at risk of being pressured.”\nExport restrictions ‍have slowed China's progress toward semiconductor self-sufficiency for years, and constrained advanced chip production at Huawei, the two people and a third person said.\nThe sources spoke on condition they not be identified due to the confidentiality of the project.\n\nCHINA'S MANHATTAN PROJECT\nOne veteran Chinese engineer from ASML recruited to the project was surprised to find that his generous signing bonus came with an identification card issued under a false name, according to one of the people, who was familiar with his recruitment.\nOnce inside, he recognized other former ASML colleagues who were also working under aliases and was instructed to use their fake names at work to maintain secrecy, the person said. Another person independently confirmed that recruits were given fake IDs to conceal their identities from other workers inside the secure facility.\nThe guidance was clear, the two people said: Classified under national security, no one outside the compound could know what they were building—or that they were there at all.\n\nThe team includes recently retired, Chinese-born former ASML engineers and scientists—prime recruitment targets because they possess sensitive technical knowledge but face fewer professional constraints after leaving the company, ​the people said.\nTwo current ASML employees of Chinese nationality in the Netherlands told Reuters they have been approached by recruiters from Huawei since at least 2020.\nHuawei did not respond to requests for comment.\nEuropean privacy laws limit ASML's ability to track former employees. Though employees sign non-disclosure agreements, enforcing them across borders has proven difficult.\nASML won an $845 million judgment in 2019 against a former Chinese engineer accused of stealing trade secrets, but the defendant filed for bankruptcy and continues to ‌operate in Beijing with Chinese government support, according to court documents.\n\nASML told Reuters that it “vigilantly guards” trade secrets and confidential information.\n\"While ASML cannot control or restrict where former employees work, all employees are bound by the confidentiality clauses in their contracts,\" the company said, and it has \"successfully pursued legal action in response to the theft of trade secrets.”\nReuters was unable to determine if any legal actions have been taken against former ASML employees involved in China’s lithography program.\nThe company said it safeguards EUV knowledge by ensuring only select employees can access the information even inside the company.\nDutch intelligence warned in an April report that China \"used extensive espionage programmes in its attempts to obtain advanced technology and knowledge from Western countries,\" including recruiting \"Western scientists and employees of high-tech companies.”\n\nThe ASML veterans made the breakthrough in Shenzhen possible, the people said. Without their intimate knowledge of the technology, reverse-engineering the machines would have been nearly impossible.\nTheir recruitment was part of an aggressive drive China launched in 2019 for semiconductor experts working abroad, offering signing bonuses that started at 3 million to 5 million yuan ($420,000 to $700,000) and home-purchase subsidies, according to a Reuters review of government policy documents.\nRecruits included Lin Nan, ASML's former head of light source technology, whose team at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Shanghai Institute of Optics has filed eight patents on EUV light sources in 18 months, according to patent filings.\nThe Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics did not respond to requests for comment. Lin could not be reached for comment.\n\nTwo additional people familiar with China’s recruitment efforts said some naturalized citizens of other countries were given Chinese passports and allowed to maintain dual citizenship.\nChina officially prohibits dual citizenship and did not answer questions on issuing passports.\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\nINSIDE CHINA'S EUV FAB\nASML's most advanced EUV systems are roughly the size of a school bus, and weigh 180 tons. After failed attempts to replicate its size, the prototype inside the Shenzhen lab became many times larger to improve its ⁠power, according to the two people.\nThe Chinese prototype is crude compared to ASML's machines but operational enough for testing, the people said.\nChina's prototype lags behind ASML's machines largely because researchers have struggled to obtain optical systems like those from Germany's Carl Zeiss AG, one of ASML's ​key suppliers, the two people said.\n\nZeiss declined to comment.\nThe machines fire lasers at molten tin 50,000 times per second, generating plasma at 200,000 degrees Celsius. The light is focused using mirrors that take months to produce, according to Zeiss' website.\nChina's top research institutes have played key roles in developing homegrown ​alternatives, according to the two people.\nThe Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIOMP) achieved a breakthrough in integrating extreme-ultraviolet light into the prototype's optical system, enabling it to become operational in early 2025, one of the people said, though the optics still require significant refinement.\nCIOMP did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a March online recruitment call on its website, the institute said it was offering \"uncapped\" salaries to PhD lithography researchers and research grants worth up to 4 million yuan ($560,000) plus 1 million yuan ($140,000) in personal subsidies.\n\nJeff Koch, an analyst at research firm SemiAnalysis and a former ASML engineer, said China will have achieved \"meaningful progress” if the “light source has enough power, is reliable, and doesn’t generate too much contamination.”\n\"No doubt this is technically feasible, it's ‍just a question of timeline,\" he said. \"China has the advantage that commercial EUV now exists, so they aren't starting from zero.\"\nTo ⁠get the required parts, China is salvaging components from older ASML machines and sourcing parts from ASML suppliers through secondhand markets, the two people said.\nNetworks of intermediary companies are sometimes used to mask the ultimate buyer, the people said.\nExport-restricted components from Japan’s Nikon and Canon are being used for the prototype, one of the people and an additional source said.\n\nNikon declined to comment. Canon said it was not aware of such reports. The Japanese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nInternational banks regularly auction older semiconductor fabrication equipment, the sources said. Auctions in China sold older ASML lithography equipment as recently as October 2025, according to a review of listings on Alibaba Auction, an Alibaba-owned platform.\nA team of around 100 recent university graduates is focused on reverse-engineering components from both EUV and DUV lithography machines, according to the people.\nEach worker's desk is filmed by an individual camera ⁠to document their efforts to disassemble and reassemble parts—work the people described as key to China's lithography efforts.\n\nStaffers who successfully reassemble a component receive bonuses, the people said.\nHUAWEI SCIENTISTS SLEEP ON-SITE\nWhile the EUV project is run by the Chinese government, Huawei is involved in every step of the supply chain from chip design and fabrication equipment to manufacturing and final integration into products like smartphones, according to four people familiar with Huawei’s operations.\nCEO Ren Zhengfei briefs senior Chinese leaders on progress, according to one of the people.\nThe U.S. placed Huawei on an entity list in 2019, banning American companies from ‌doing business with them without a license.\nHuawei has deployed employees to offices, fabrication plants, and research centers across the country for the effort. Employees assigned to semiconductor teams often sleep on-site and are barred from returning home during the work week, with phone access restricted for teams handling more sensitive tasks, according to the people.\nInside Huawei, few employees know the scope of this work. \"The teams are kept isolated from ‌each other to protect the confidentiality of the project,\" one of the people said. “They don't know what the other teams work on.”\n(Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore, additional reporting by Alexandra Alper in Washington, editing by Ken Li and Michael Learmonth)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
