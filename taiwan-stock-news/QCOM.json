      "Content": "Intel stock soared in 2025. But the chipmaker still has a long road ahead.\n\nLaura Bratton\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBY\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nFor Intel ( INTC ), 2025 was an eventful year, but not one that necessarily changed its narrative .\nThe storied American chipmaker got a new CEO and won massive investments from the US government , Nvidia ( NVDA ), and SoftBank ( SFTBY ). Those developments helped push the stock up 86% for the year, ahead of gains for the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks and Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). At the same time, Intel's crucial manufacturing segment still lacks a major external customer — something it needs to make the cash-bleeding business viable.\n\n\"Intel's exiting the year with some optimism that they will be a relevant chip manufacturer in the US at some point in time ... and that was definitely an uncertain statement at the start of the year,\" MorningStar analyst Brian Colello told Yahoo Finance.\nAt the same time, he noted, \"There wasn't the massive sort of deal that really establishes Intel, either, in manufacturing.\"\n\nThe company's technology is largely responsible for the digital revolution and Silicon Valley's reputation as a global innovation hub: Intel invented the world's first microprocessors, or computer chips, and the x86 architecture, a critical blueprint for designing computer chips. Its co-founder Gordon Moore created Moore's Law, a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. The company has continued to make its own computer chips, even as the rest of the industry has gone \"fabless\" — outsourcing manufacturing to firms like Taiwan's TSMC ( TSM ).\n\nBut years of missteps and poor investment decisions put Intel's manufacturing segment behind TSMC, which in turn caused its products to lose their edge to competitors. As its chips — CPUs for servers, laptops, and desktops — have lost market share to rivals AMD and Arm ( ARM ), its manufacturing business has been stripped of the scale it needs to remain viable.\nFour years of an aggressive turnaround effort by former CEO Pat Gelsinger to revive Intel's manufacturing arm by opening it to outside customers sent investors fleeing. The massive amount of spending required to reboot the foundry, along with its uncertain success, spooked Wall Street.\nThe arrival of Lip-Bu Tan , who was named chief executive in March following the board's ousting of Gelsinger in late 2024, began to renew faith in the company's potential turnaround. While Intel's strategy remains mostly unchanged under Tan, analysts explained, investors have applauded his sober tone, cost-cutting measures, and wide-ranging industry connections.\n\nStory Continues\nThat tepid faith transformed into confidence when the US government made a rare $9 billion investment in the company — albeit funds Intel was supposed to get anyway from the Biden-era CHIPS Act — following Tan's tiff with President Trump over the CEO's business ties to China.\nOnshoring semiconductor manufacturing has been a focus of the US government since the pandemic highlighted the risk of a tech supply chain reliant on Taiwan. Escalating tensions with China, including the threat of a Taiwan invasion, have further intensified the sense of urgency.\n\n\"Semiconductors are not only economically important, they're actually important from a national security perspective,\" Technalysis analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \"Intel has by far the largest infrastructure in place as a true, real American company.\"\nMany critics believe the broader US turn toward state capitalism under Trump, exemplified by the Intel investment, raises questions about national security and the government's conflicting interests. But analysts say the US government's 10% stake in Intel could lead to various positive outcomes for the company, such as Intel having a say in trade policy that affects semiconductors. More importantly, the US could step in to incentivize or force a major company like Apple to use the chipmaker's foundry.\n\nA $2 billion investment from SoftBank and $5 billion from Nvidia further boosted investor sentiment on Intel stock. The cash infusion helped stem the company's steep losses as it figures out a path forward. Notably, though, the Nvidia deal didn't include an agreement for Intel's foundry business to manufacture the AI giant's chips.\n'Everything hinges on 14A' Intel's biggest potential customers for its foundry business — Nvidia, Apple ( AAPL ), and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) — are also, to some degree, competitors of its products arm and have longstanding relationships with TSMC. Not to mention, TSMC is building $165 billion worth of manufacturing capacity in the US, diminishing the geopolitical argument for those companies to use Intel to produce their chips.\nTo win those customers, Intel will need to prove that its latest generation manufacturing processes are up to snuff. The chipmaker's 18A process, a massive technological feat initially marketed to outside customers, is now being used primarily to make Intel's own products. Whether those products — Intel's upcoming Panther Lake chips for PCs and Clearwater Forest chips for data centers — succeed could help convince companies to use its next-generation processes called 18AP and 14A, analysts said.\n\nAlready, rumors have circulated that Apple could use Intel's manufacturing, specifically its 18AP process, for its lowest-end computer chips.\nIntel has 12 to 18 months to secure a big external customer for 14A in order for that process to continue as planned, BNB Paribas analyst David O'Connor estimated.\nHe called the process \"the crux of Intel being successful on the foundry business or not, or potentially even exiting manufacturing long term.\"\n\"Everything hinges on 14A and the success of that,\" O'Connor said.\nOther analysts gave longer timelines for when Intel would see a turnaround.\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said, \"It took 10 years to break it. Why would it take less than 10 years to fix it?\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Bluesky @laurabratton.bsky.social.

      "Content": "Is It Too Late To Consider Qualcomm After Its Strong Multi Year Share Price Rally?\n\nSimply Wall St\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 4:08 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nIf you are wondering whether QUALCOMM is still attractively priced at current levels, or if the easier gains have already been realized, this article will walk through what the numbers indicate about its underlying value.\nDespite a recent 1.7% pullback over the last week, QUALCOMM is still up 5.5% in the past month and has delivered a 14.1% gain year to date, adding to a 69.2% return over three years.\nInvestors have been reacting to a steady stream of headlines around QUALCOMM's position in 5G handsets and infrastructure, as well as its expanding role in automotive and Internet of Things chips. At the same time, ongoing debates about smartphone demand cycles and competition in high performance processors have kept sentiment active rather than complacent.\nRight now QUALCOMM has a 3/6 valuation check score , suggesting it appears undervalued on some metrics but not others. In the next sections we will unpack those methods before circling back to a more comprehensive way to think about what the stock may be worth.\n\nFind out why QUALCOMM's 17.2% return over the last year is lagging behind its peers.\nApproach 1: QUALCOMM Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a business is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and then discounting those cash flows back to today in dollar terms.\nFor QUALCOMM, the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model starts with last twelve months free cash flow of about $12.6 billion. Analyst forecasts and Simply Wall St extrapolations see this rising to around $18.4 billion by 2030, with intermediate annual projections gradually stepping higher over the coming decade as the business scales across handsets, automotive, and IoT.\n\nWhen all those future cash flows are discounted back, the model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of roughly $205.12 per share. Compared with the current share price, this implies QUALCOMM is trading at about a 14.6% discount to its DCF based fair value, which indicates a margin of safety for long term investors rather than a fully priced story.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests QUALCOMM is undervalued by 14.6%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 914 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for QUALCOMM.\nApproach 2: QUALCOMM Price vs Earnings For profitable, established businesses like QUALCOMM, the price to earnings ratio is a useful yardstick because it directly links what investors are paying today to the profits the company is generating. Higher expected growth and lower perceived risk usually justify a higher PE, while slower growth or more uncertainty should push a fair PE lower.\n\nStory Continues\nQUALCOMM currently trades on a PE of about 33.6x, slightly below the broader Semiconductor industry average of roughly 36.8x and well below the peer group average of around 65.5x. While these comparisons are helpful context, they do not fully capture QUALCOMM's specific growth profile, margins, scale, and risk.\n\nSimply Wall St's Fair Ratio framework does this by estimating what a reasonable PE should be once factors such as earnings growth, profitability, industry, market cap and risk are considered together. For QUALCOMM, the Fair Ratio is approximately 33.3x, which is very close to its current PE of 33.6x. This suggests the market is pricing the stock in line with its fundamentals rather than offering a clear bargain or demanding a premium.\nResult: ABOUT RIGHT\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1465 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your QUALCOMM Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simply your story about a company, translated into numbers like fair value, future revenue, earnings and margins. A Narrative links what you believe about QUALCOMM's business, such as edge AI leadership, smartphone cycles, or automotive growth, to an explicit financial forecast and then to a clear fair value estimate, so you can see how your view compares with the current share price. On Simply Wall St, Narratives are an easy, guided tool within the Community page, used by millions of investors, that help you compare your view of Fair Value to today’s Price and understand the potential upside or downside you are assuming. They also update dynamically as new information like earnings, news, or guidance arrives, so your story and valuation stay current without manual rework. For example, one QUALCOMM Narrative might see fair value near $300 with strong AI driven growth, while a more cautious Narrative might sit closer to $192 with modest growth and higher risk, giving you a concrete range to anchor your own view.\nDo you think there's more to the story for QUALCOMM?

      "Content": "Qualcomm’s Monster Rally Has a Catch—Can the Stock Keep Climbing?\n\nSam Quirke, MarketBeat\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:08 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Qualcomm is on track to close out 2025 on strong footing, with its multi-month rally continuing to grind higher.\nBut that also means its P/E ratio is now at the highest level in more than ten years.\nHeading into 2026, investors are right to question whether this signals a bullish re-rating or a bearish warning.\nInterested in QUALCOMM Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nShares of Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) were trading just over $176 on the morning of Dec. 18, extending a run that has been easy to overlook in a market obsessed with mega-cap tech and artificial intelligence leaders. The stock is up about 12% year-to-date and more than 40% since April, marking one of Qualcomm’s strongest years in recent memory after a long stretch of underperformance versus peers.\nWhat has investors paying closer attention to now as we head into the final few sessions of the year is not just the price action, but the valuation that has come with it. Qualcomm’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has climbed to levels not seen in more than a decade. Sometimes that kind of move is a warning sign that expectations are getting ahead of reality.\n\n→ Forget the Chips: 4 Industrial Plays for the AI Rebound\nOther times, it reflects a meaningful shift in how the market views a company’s future. For those of us on the sidelines and thinking about building a position in Qualcomm into 2026, that distinction matters. Let’s jump in and see what it could be, either a good sign or a red flag.\nWhy a Rising Valuation Can Be a Bullish Sign For much of the past decade, Qualcomm traded at a persistent discount relative to peers. As we flagged earlier this year, its P/E ratio of just 15 looked very attractive when compared to the likes of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) , which had a P/E ratio closer to 50. Qualcomm’s historical reliance on the smartphone cycle, periodic royalty disputes, and sluggish share price sanctions always seemed to keep a lid on its multiple, even during the broad semiconductor rally—his context matters when interpreting today’s higher valuation.\n\n→ 3 Cheap Dividend Stocks That Can Beat Inflation and Pay You to Wait\nThe recent jump suggests the market is starting to look at, and therefore to price, Qualcomm differently. Rather than viewing it purely as a handset-driven name, investors seem to be increasingly recognizing the benefits of a more diversified revenue mix. Automotive, IoT, and edge computing exposure have helped transform the market’s perception of the brand and build excitement about fresh long-term growth potential.\n\nStory Continues\nThis has been reflected in the stock’s sustained rally since April—while it mightn’t be winning awards for speed or scale anytime soon, it’s actually been one of Qualcomm’s most sustained moves in a long time. When viewed through this lens, a decade-high valuation can be interpreted less as a potential ceiling and more as confirmation that the market is reassessing what Qualcomm deserves to trade at.\n\n→ Post 35% Surge, Analysts Eye More Upside in Copper Giant Freeport\nWhy a Decade-High Multiple Still Deserves Scrutiny That said, a valuation that has more than doubled in just a few months has to come with a bit of risk, too. The higher stock price and underlying P/E ratio have raised the bar for execution, meaning Qualcomm can’t afford any slips heading into 2026’s earnings reports. The fact that it’s no longer priced as a deep-value laggard means any earnings stumble would likely be met with a good deal of investor panic.\n\nRecent analyst commentary reflects this. Just this week, the team at Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated its Neutral rating on the stock, urging caution around chasing it after the recent run. At the same time, the fact that Qualcomm is still trading well below its $185 price target suggests even more conservative analysts still see some upside from current levels.\nCountering this view are the more bullish updates in recent weeks that remain firmly intact. Both Cowen and Susquehanna have reiterated Buy or equivalent ratings in the past month, with Susquehanna’s $210 price target implying potential upside of 20% from current levels.\nDiverging Views Signal a Pivotal Year for Qualcomm in 2026 The split in analyst opinion is interesting and telling. Qualcomm’s bears are not exactly calling for a ton of downside so much as arguing that the stock is fairly valued, if not a bit undervalued, right now.\nThe bulls will counter that the ongoing multiple expansion is more than justified, and it’s high time Qualcomm’s shares start to log these multi-month rallies that have been the norm with their peers.\nEither way, 2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for Qualcomm, and one that investors will want to stay closely tuned into.\nThe article \" Qualcomm’s Monster Rally Has a Catch—Can the Stock Keep Climbing? \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Qualcomm (QCOM) Surpasses Market Returns: Some Facts Worth Knowing\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nIn the latest trading session, Qualcomm (QCOM) closed at $174.19, marking a +1.07% move from the previous day.

It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $3.38, marking a 0.88% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $12.25 billion, up 4.99% from the year-ago period.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $12.15 per share and revenue of $45.69 billion. These totals would mark changes of +1% and +3.52%, respectively, from last year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Qualcomm.

      "Content": "Marvell Technology (MRVL) Stock Is Up, What You Need To Know\n\nPetr Huřťák\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 12:12 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nTSM\n\nMU\n\nQCOM\n\nINTC\n\nWhat Happened? Shares of networking chips designer Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) jumped 3.2% in the afternoon session after positive results from peer company Micron lifted the broader semiconductor sector.\nThe strong report created a ripple effect, boosting sentiment for chip-related companies. Marvell climbed alongside other industry players, as firms connected to memory and storage saw some of the most notable gains. For instance, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, Broadcom, and Qualcomm all recorded increases. The move highlighted investor optimism across the semiconductor space, reinforcing the view that companies like Marvell, which are key to AI infrastructure, were well-positioned.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $84.30, up 3.1% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Marvell Technology? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Marvell Technology’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 42 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 3.8% on the news that reports revealed that China is moving to substitute US technology by adding domestic AI chips to its government procurement list.\n\nThis development is part of a broader \"buy local\" campaign aimed at reducing China's reliance on foreign technology, particularly from the United States, amid persistent trade and tech tensions. The Chinese government has updated its guidelines to include AI chips from homegrown companies like Huawei and Cambricon. This policy shift effectively steers government and state-affiliated buyers away from American semiconductor firms. For US chipmakers, this signals a potential loss of market share in one of the world's largest tech markets, raising concerns among investors about future revenue streams from the region.\nMarvell Technology is down 25.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $84.30 per share, it is trading 33.1% below its 52-week high of $126.06 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Marvell Technology’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,774.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.
