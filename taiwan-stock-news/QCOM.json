      "Content": "Qualcomm (QCOM) Surpasses Market Returns: Some Facts Worth Knowing\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nIn the latest trading session, Qualcomm (QCOM) closed at $174.19, marking a +1.07% move from the previous day. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.79%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.38%.\nShares of the chipmaker have appreciated by 3.75% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.85%, and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.\n\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Qualcomm in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $3.38, marking a 0.88% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $12.25 billion, up 4.99% from the year-ago period.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $12.15 per share and revenue of $45.69 billion. These totals would mark changes of +1% and +3.52%, respectively, from last year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Qualcomm. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the business health and profitability.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.07% higher within the past month. Qualcomm is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nFrom a valuation perspective, Qualcomm is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 14.19. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 32.69.\n\nInvestors should also note that QCOM has a PEG ratio of 3.09 right now. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Electronics - Semiconductors was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.83 at yesterday's closing price.\nThe Electronics - Semiconductors industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 75, positioning it in the top 31% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nBe sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Marvell Technology (MRVL) Stock Is Up, What You Need To Know\n\nPetr Huřťák\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 12:12 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MRVL\n\nTSM\n\nMU\n\nQCOM\n\nINTC\n\nWhat Happened? Shares of networking chips designer Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) jumped 3.2% in the afternoon session after positive results from peer company Micron lifted the broader semiconductor sector.\nThe strong report created a ripple effect, boosting sentiment for chip-related companies. Marvell climbed alongside other industry players, as firms connected to memory and storage saw some of the most notable gains. For instance, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, Broadcom, and Qualcomm all recorded increases. The move highlighted investor optimism across the semiconductor space, reinforcing the view that companies like Marvell, which are key to AI infrastructure, were well-positioned.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $84.30, up 3.1% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Marvell Technology? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Marvell Technology’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 42 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 3.8% on the news that reports revealed that China is moving to substitute US technology by adding domestic AI chips to its government procurement list.\n\nThis development is part of a broader \"buy local\" campaign aimed at reducing China's reliance on foreign technology, particularly from the United States, amid persistent trade and tech tensions. The Chinese government has updated its guidelines to include AI chips from homegrown companies like Huawei and Cambricon. This policy shift effectively steers government and state-affiliated buyers away from American semiconductor firms. For US chipmakers, this signals a potential loss of market share in one of the world's largest tech markets, raising concerns among investors about future revenue streams from the region.\nMarvell Technology is down 25.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $84.30 per share, it is trading 33.1% below its 52-week high of $126.06 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Marvell Technology’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,774.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

      "Content": "ARM Stock Declines 13% in a Year: Should You Buy the Dip?\n\nShuvra Shankar Dey\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 9:39 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ARM\n\nShares of Arm Holdings plc ARM have declined 13% over the past year against the industry’s 36% growth. The decline raises a key question: will the fall continue, or is a rebound imminent? Let’s unpack the factors that you must look through before making an investment decision.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nARM’s Dual-Sided Network Effect Reinforces Its Leadership ARM’s competitive edge rests on a powerful dual-sided network effect that links software creators and hardware makers in a self-reinforcing loop.\nThe company’s architecture has become the default choice for device manufacturers because it already supports a massive universe of applications across Android, iOS, Windows and Linux ecosystems. This existing software breadth gives hardware producers confidence that chips based on ARM’s designs will integrate smoothly with global tools, platforms and services, making adoption a low-risk, high-benefit decision.\n\nOn the other side, developers are drawn to ARM because their applications immediately gain reach across an enormous installed base of devices. Every new hardware partner expands ARM’s footprint further, strengthening the incentive for developers to keep building for the platform. This creates a flywheel effect: more developers attract more manufacturers, which then bring in even more developers. Over time, this reinforcing cycle has grown into a deep moat that competitors struggle to penetrate.\nThis network-driven advantage has led to an extraordinary outcome. ARM effectively controls mobile CPU architecture. With its IP embedded in nearly every smartphone worldwide, the company operates from a position of unmatched scale, making its lead in mobile computing extremely difficult for rivals to challenge.\n\nNVIDIA NVDA competes with ARM in edge computing and AI-driven device workloads. NVIDIA benefits from its own ecosystem, but lacks ARM’s mobile reach. Even where NVIDIA pushes into low-power processors, the breadth of ARM compatibility limits its ability to displace existing standards.\nQualcomm QCOM remains one of ARM’s most essential partners, yet also a peer, because Qualcomm builds mobile chips around ARM cores. The company depends heavily on ARM’s architecture, and its success in smartphones reinforces ARM’s position. Yet Qualcomm continues investing in custom designs to diversify, although ARM’s scale still keeps Qualcomm aligned with the platform.\n\nStory Continues\nStrong Earnings and Revenue Growth Ahead for ARM The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARM’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $1.72, indicating 5.5% growth from the year-ago level. Earnings for fiscal 2027 are expected to increase 28.2% from the prior-year actuals.\nThe company’s sales are expected to rise 23.5% and 21.6% year over year, respectively, in fiscal 2026 and 2027.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nARM's Valuation Remains Significantly Elevated ARM stock is currently expensive. It is priced at around 60 times forward 12-month earnings per share, significantly higher than the industry’s average of 37 times. When looking at the trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA ratio, ARM is trading at around 100 times, far exceeding the industry’s average of 25 times.\n\nHold Recommendation Despite the recent decline, ARM’s shares still reflect elevated expectations due to the company’s dominant market position and long-term growth narrative. The pullback improves risk-reward but does not yet fully offset valuation concerns, especially in a volatile market environment. ARM’s strong ecosystem, recurring royalty model and exposure to AI-driven demand support the long-term story, but near-term upside may remain capped. Investors already holding the stock can stay patient, while new investors may prefer a wait-and-watch approach, looking for clearer signs of sustained earnings acceleration or a more attractive entry point.\n\nARM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Can Intel's AI Focus Restore Its Competitive Edge & Boost Shares?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 8:31 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSANS.PVT\n\nPer a Bloomberg news report , Intel Corporation ( INTC ) is in advanced talks to acquire AI start-up SambaNova Systems for about $1.6 billion. SambaNova is known for designing custom AI chips and systems. Acquiring an AI-focused company facilitates Intel with a ready-made AI architecture, software stacks and engineering talent, minimizing years of internal development time and speeding up its AI development plans.\n\nIf the deal materializes, it will help Intel to modernize its CPUs with AI chips and software, providing cloud and enterprise customers with a complete AI system. By using AI chip technology, Intel can make chips in its own factories, increasing its manufacturing strength and allowing it to attract more foundry customers.\nIntel has launched new AI-powered chips that are faster and more energy-efficient, helping the company compete better in the growing AI market. It is gaining traction in AI infrastructure as Super Micro Computer has chosen Intel’s Xeon 6 processors for its high-performance enterprise servers.\nThe company has collaborated with Cisco to build a new integrated platform that supports distributed AI workloads. NVIDIA will invest $5 billion in Intel to build advanced technologies that will shape the future of AI infrastructure. Intel is actively investing in AI and is serious about competing in the fast-growing semiconductor market, signaling a credible comeback.\n\nHow Are Competitors Faring? Intel faces competition from Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) and Qualcomm Incorporated ( QCOM ). Qualcomm focuses on making advanced chips for AI-powered PCs. Qualcomm launched the AI 200 and AI 250 chips to meet rising AI processing needs in data centers. HUMAIN has chosen Qualcomm’s AI200 and AI250 chips to provide high-performance AI services in Saudi Arabia and worldwide.\n\nAMD is growing its AI business by launching new MI350 series accelerators and working with major partners like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Oracle to deliver faster and more powerful AI systems. AMD has entered into a long-term deal with OpenAI to power large AI systems using AMD’s Instinct GPUs starting in 2026. IBM and AMD are working with Zyphra to provide powerful AI infrastructure on IBM Cloud using AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs to train advanced AI models.\nINTC’s Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Intel has rallied 79.3% over the past year compared with the industry ’s growth of 31.1%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/book ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 1.53 book value, lower than 30.63 of the industry average.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings estimates for 2025 have increased 128.6% to 32 cents, while those for 2026 have declined 10.7% to 59 cents over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIntel stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this chipmaker have returned +7.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Qualcomm belongs, has gained 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $3.38 per share, indicating a change of -0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.15 points to a change of +1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.6 indicates a change of +3.7% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.25 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $45.69 billion and $46.14 billion estimates indicate +3.5% and +1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Qualcomm reported revenues of $11.27 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10%. EPS of $3 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.43%. The EPS surprise was +4.17%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nQualcomm is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Stock Market Today, Dec. 15: Broadcom Slides After AI Margin Concerns Weigh on Stock\n\nJosh Kohn-Lindquist, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 15, 2025 at 3:13 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AVGO\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nQCOM\n\nNVDA\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) , designer and supplier of semiconductor devices and infrastructure software solutions worldwide, closed Monday’s session at $339.86, down 5.6%. Trading volume reached 55.8 million shares, which is approximately 126% above its three-month average of 24.7 million shares.\nHow the markets moved today Monday’s trading featured renewed pressure on Broadcom after recent earnings, with investors focusing on AI-driven revenue growth versus margin pressure and valuation. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) slipped 0.16% to finish at 6,816, while the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) fell 0.59% to close at 23,057.\n\nRivals Qualcomm and Nvidia both gained modestly, underscoring how competition and shifting sentiment across the chipmaking industry are shaping expectations for Broadcom’s AI chip demand and profitability.\nWhat this means for investors Broadcom shares continued their post-earnings slide from Friday, as Wall Street worried over management's mention of lower AI margins. Although Broadcom's projected first-quarter revenue of $19.1 billion exceeded estimates, management guided for a 100-basis-point decline in gross margin due to lower margins from its AI systems. As the tech industry hurtles toward an AI-powered world, these margin concerns reinforced investor debate over growth quality versus profitability.\n\nWhile Broadcom's earnings and guidance were satisfactory -- most analysts increased their price targets -- the company was priced for perfection at 72 times free cash flow before Thursday's earnings and simply didn't meet these flawless expectations. Ultimately, the launch of a new AI accelerator by Qualcomm and ongoing competition with Nvidia create an intensifying AI chip rivalry, which will keep Broadcom's stock volatile.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "3 Companies Turning Big Cash Flow Into Bigger Shareholder Gains\n\nNathan Reiff, MarketBeat\nMon, December 15, 2025 at 7:10 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nAMAT\n\nGILD\n\nKey Points Capital returns in the form of share buybacks and dividend payments are an attractive element for many investors, helping to boost value in ways other than through share price growth.\nIn the current environment, companies able to provide solid cash flow for these returns are increasingly rare.\nThree names to keep an eye on for their cash flow and returns include Gilead Sciences, Applied Materials, and Qualcomm.\nInterested in Gilead Sciences, Inc.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nInflation, interest rates, and broader economic uncertainty have forced companies across many sectors to prioritize efficiency. In this environment, it can be particularly challenging for firms to maintain cash flow, which is vital to their continued healthy operations and growth. Strong free cash flow also positions companies more favorably to make smart capital returns to investors in the form of dividends or share buybacks.\nInvestors seeking Buy-rated companies that have managed to thrive in the area of cash flow and that are using this cash effectively to enhance value for shareholders might start by looking at three names in the healthcare and technology spaces below.\n→ Rivian’s Autonomy Bombshell Changes Everything—Even Its Valuation\nImpressive Healthcare Portfolio Contributes to Solid Dividend History Biopharmaceuticals giant Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) is known for its antiviral medications and those with applications in oncology and inflammatory diseases. The company has a history of strong cash generation—in the latest quarter, it reported free cash flow of nearly $4 billion and operating cash flow of $4.1 billion—thanks to its high-margin products and strong sales.\n\nGilead's portfolio of drugs is sizable and varied, including major medicines for the treatment of HIV, liver disease, and much more. The strength and breadth of this portfolio helps to ensure that Gilead sees healthy sales each quarter, which it can then feed back into further R&D and, notably for investors, an attractive dividend distribution.\n→ Super Micro's Sell-Off Is a Mirage—Here’s Why the Rally May Come Back Fast\nThe company has paid a 79-cent dividend in each of the last four quarters, after a 2-cent boost early in the year. This translates to a dividend yield of 2.65%, above the average for the healthcare sector. Gilead has been able to sustain dividend growth while maintaining a relatively low payout ratio of around 49%, suggesting that it should be able to maintain these capital returns going forward.\nShares of GILD are up close to 30% this year, and as an added bonus, analysts see another 9.5% in upside in the company's future.\n\nStory Continues\n→ 3 Companies Turning Big Cash Flow Into Bigger Shareholder Gains\nVital AI and Data Center Technology Yields Healthy Cash Flow Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) plays an essential role in the semiconductor industry by providing technology vital to the fabrication of chips of many kinds. This has made the company increasingly indispensable as the AI and data center industries have boomed and has caused AMAT shares to be an analyst favorite for growing earnings.\n\nWhen Applied Materials reported its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results in mid-November, it impressed on multiple fronts: record results included revenue of more than $28 billion for the year and gross margin of 48.8%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. The fiscal year also included strong free cash flow of $5.7 billion, despite headwinds to the company's business in China due to trade restrictions. Importantly for investors, Applied Materials returned more than $6 billion in capital via dividend distributions and buybacks.\nThe company has applied this cash toward dividend growth, achieving a five-year annualized dividend increase of close to 15%. Its dividend yield is 0.69%, but its payout ratio of 21.2% is especially impressive—this also appears to be a company with a healthy dividend that is sustainable over the long term.\n\nTop- and Bottom-Line Growth Alongside Big Cash Flow Another crucial player in the chip-making space, Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) has traditionally focused primarily on wireless communication technology, although it has more recently also expanded into AI and data center efforts, among others. With strong technical indicators in recent periods, QCOM shares may be reversing a downward trend from earlier in the fall.\n\nHaving also reported its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter earnings results in November, Qualcomm noted full-year revenue and earnings per share (EPS) gains of 13% and 18%, respectively, thanks to a strong showing from its core QCT business.\nCash flow from operations for the latest quarter was an impressive $4 billion, and capital expenditure tends to remain low for the tech sector. This means that Qualcomm is freed up to deploy its cash reserves toward buybacks and, especially dividends. QCOM pays a dividend yield of 2.02%, having boosted its quarterly distribution by nearly 5% earlier in the year. With an additional 9% in possible upside anticipated across Wall Street, Qualcomm could be poised to deliver on both passive income and capital appreciation for investors.\nThe article \" 3 Companies Turning Big Cash Flow Into Bigger Shareholder Gains \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
