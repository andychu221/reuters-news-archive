      "Content": "Where Will Coca-Cola Stock Be in 5 Years?\n\nNeil Patel, The Motley Fool\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 8:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: KO\n\nKey Points Coca-Cola's industry-leading position allows it to generate robust profits that fund its dividend increases.\nHistorically, the business has evolved by expanding its product portfolio.\nInvestors should not expect the stock to produce strong returns over the next five years and beyond.\n10 stocks we like better than Coca-Cola ›\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is a powerful consumer brand with a competitive edge that is difficult to overstate. The business has a presence in over 200 countries and territories. And 2.2 billion servings of its drinks are consumed every single day. Very few companies have found such adoption.\nIn the past five years, this leading beverage stock has produced a total return of 51% (as of Dec. 30). Where will Coca-Cola be five years from now?\nThe business won't change anytime soon Coca-Cola has been around for a very long time, and over the decades, its operations haven't really changed much. Over a five-year time horizon, investors can expect things to stay the same.\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing. The company dominates its industry, and it should continue leading the market for the foreseeable future. That's a positive attribute, as it means the business won't be affected by technological disruption or new entrants competing on its turf.\n\nThe revenue gains won't be impressive, though. Consensus analyst estimates call for sales to rise at a compound annual rate of just 3.9% between 2024 and 2027. I believe this pace will probably keep up even after this forecast period. The company's products are already ubiquitous, so there is less of an opportunity to expand.\nIts earnings power shouldn't go unnoticed. The brand strength affords the business a certain level of pricing power, and this flows to the bottom line. In the past five years, the company posted an average quarterly operating margin of 26.3%. It's hard to argue with this kind of earnings performance.\nThose huge profits help support its dividend, which currently yields 2.91%. In 2026, the board of directors should hike the quarterly payout. If this happens, which I view as a virtual certainty, it will mark the 64th straight year that they approved a dividend increase.\n\nCoca-Cola has added new brands over time There is one way that Coca-Cola might change, since it's a natural extension of its operations: its strategy of expanding its product portfolio. This is a smart move by management because it allows the business to serve the tastes of more consumers across the globe. And it adds diversification to the revenue base.\n\nStory Continues\nCoca-Cola has implemented this strategy historically via acquisitions . Most recently, it purchased Costa in 2018 for $5.1 billion. Before that, the company bought Topo Chico in 2017. There are now more than 200 different drinks under the Coca-Cola umbrella, and it wouldn't be surprising if another acquisition happens before the end of the decade.\n\nExpect past trends to continue Investors are familiar with the saying that past performance is not indicative of future results. This is something to always keep in mind when thinking about stocks and how they might do in the future. We can't simply extrapolate historical data, since companies are always evolving.\nBut with Coca-Cola, I believe it's reasonable to assume that past trends will continue. In the trailing-five-year period, the stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 , putting up a total return that's about half of the broader index's gain. There's no reason to believe it will be able to outperform the benchmark between now and the end of 2030. I expect it to lag the S&P 500.\n\nThat's because this is a mature company. Consequently, it won't suddenly report incredible revenue and profit growth. If this did happen, which I view as extremely unlikely, then there would be a high probability that the stock would do very well.\nThis muted outlook doesn't mean it's off-limits as a potential investment; it just depends on your goals. If you want outsize growth potential, then this stock should be avoided. However, if it's safety, stability, and predictability that you're after, Coca-Cola could be a worthwhile portfolio addition.\nShould you buy stock in Coca-Cola right now? Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Nicolas Maduro: From bus driver to iron-fisted leader\n\nPatrick FORT\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 7:55 AM PST 4 min read\n\nVenezuela's Nicolas Maduro, who has been seized by US special forces after more than a decade in power, ruled with an iron fist while seeking to portray himself as a humble man of the people.\nDuring months in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump, who accused him of being a drug trafficker, the 63-year-old former bus driver deflected pressure by dancing to techno music at near-daily rallies, always broadcast live, as he chanted the mantra \"No war, yes peace!\" -- in English.\n\nBut for many Venezuelans, Maduro was no kindly pacifist.\nSeven million compatriots emigrated on his watch amid allegations of arbitrary detentions, rigged trials, torture and censorship.\nThe South American country's economy collapsed, marked by four consecutive years of hyper-inflation and an 80-percent drop in GDP in a decade.\nAs he tightened his grip on power, Maduro relied increasingly on backing from a handful of international allies -- notably China, Cuba and Russia -- as well as the military, security and paramilitary forces.\nMore than 2,400 people were arrested, 28 killed and about 200 injured in a crackdown on the protests that followed his disputed election victory claim in July 2024.\nThe violence echoed previous deadly crackdowns on the opposition that he oversaw in 2014, 2017 and 2019.\n\n- 'First combatant' -\nTall with a full mustache and slicked-back graying hair, Maduro first came to power in 2013 and claimed reelection twice: in 2018 and 2024 in elections widely denounced as fraudulent.\nIn January 2025, he was sworn in for a third term that would have taken him to 18 years in power -- longer than his revolutionary hero Hugo Chavez, who spent 14 years in the presidential palace.\nMaduro served as a lawmaker, foreign minister and vice president before being chosen by Chavez as his successor three months before the socialist firebrand died of cancer in 2013.\nThe choice of Maduro, who lacks Chavez's rhetorical skills and charisma, raised eyebrows in the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV).\nHe barely scraped through on his first election in 2013.\n\nBut he fended off crisis after crisis, including US sanctions and a steep drop in oil prices that robbed Venezuela of its economic mainstay.\nIn 2018, much of the international community recognized congress speaker Juan Guaido as interim president, but his parallel government soon imploded.\nAnd then after elections in July 2024, the United States, European nations and several Latin American neighbors declared opposition figure Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia the country's rightful leader.\n\nStory Continues\nThroughout, Maduro also counted on his wife Cilia Flores, a former prosecutor seven years his senior who he refers to as \"First Combatant\" and \"Cilita.\"\nFlores was also a lawmaker who after years in Congress rose to the presidency of the National Assembly (2006–2010) later to hold much power behind the scenes in Maduro's Venezuela.\n\nTrump said Flores was seized by US special forces with her husband, and that they were being taken to New York to face federal charges after an early-morning assault on Caracas.\n- Marxist and Christian -\nIn the Venezuelan capital Caracas, Maduro's image is plastered across buildings everywhere.\nHe has worked hard at building an image of himself as an earthy man of the people -- an avowed baseball fan and a lover of salsa, showing off his dance moves on state TV, always with his wife by his side.\nBorn in Caracas, Maduro is both a professed Marxist and Christian, and as a teenager played guitar in a rock band.\nIt has been claimed he deliberately misspeaks in English so as not to be seen as high-brow.\nAs president, Maduro weathered many threats imagined and real -- including a failed explosive-laden drone attack in 2018 that wounded several soldiers.\n\nTo deflect blame for Venezuela's political and economic woes, he kept up Chavez's anti-American conspiracy theories, repeatedly accusing the United States of plotting to unseat him.\nWhile casting himself as the victim of an international plot, Maduro shuttered channels for political dissent, locking up dissidents and challengers with little regard for due process.\nHis government is under investigation for rights violations by the International Criminal Court.\nMaduro has also shown himself to be adept at realpolitik, winning an easing of US sanctions and other concessions by agreeing with the opposition to hold democratic elections in 2024.\nBut he reneged on the conditions, and some of the sanctions were quickly snapped back.\nMaduro has been a near omni-present feature in the lives of long-suffering Venezuelans, pumping his fist in regular television appearances while shouting anti-imperialist rhetoric.\nHe also appeared regularly on screen and in print as a cartoon character drawn in his image: a caped superhero named Super-Bigote (Super-Mustache) who is \"at war with imperialism.\"\nbur-mlr/sst\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy

This comparison looks at costs, returns, risk, and the quirks that could matter most for dividend-focused investors choosing between them.\nSnapshot (cost & size) Metric\nHDV\nVYM\nIssuer\nIShares\nVanguard\nExpense ratio\n0.08%\n0.06%\n1-yr return (as of 2025-12-26)\n8.1%\n12.2%\nDividend yield\n3.2%\n2.4%\nBeta\n0.48\n0.76\nAUM\n$12.0 billion\n$84.5 billion\n\nBeta measures price volatility relative to the S&P 500; beta is calculated from five-year weekly returns.

Its sector exposure leans toward financial services (21%), technology (18%), and healthcare (13%), with large stakes in Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) , JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) , and Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) . This broad approach captures a wide swath of the U.S. equity market, including some of the largest dividend payers, and may appeal to those seeking diversification.\n\nHDV, by contrast, narrows its focus to 74 stocks and tilts more toward consumer defensive (28%), energy (24%), and healthcare (17%) companies. Its largest positions are in Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) , Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) , and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) , making it more concentrated in traditional defensive and energy sectors.

However, the ETF can be appealing to investors who want less risk and volatility. This is seen in its lower max drawdown and beta. The fund delivers this through its focus on stable, less volatile sectors, such as energy and healthcare.\n\nVYM is appealing for other factors. Its much larger set of 589 holdings offers greater diversification, helping to protect from a downturn in a given sector. It also sports a far larger AUM of $84.5 billion, which provides greater liquidity compared to HDV. The lower expense ratio helps to offset the smaller dividend yield, and the ETF's exposure to the tech industry delivered a greater one-year return thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence.\nVYM is the ETF to pick for investors who value diversification, lower costs, and stronger total returns over a dividend yield. HDV is for those who prioritize the highest dividend yield with the least volatility.\nGlossary ETF: Exchange-traded fund, a basket of securities that trades on an exchange like a stock.\nDividend yield: Annual dividends per share divided by the share price, showing income produced as a percentage.\nExpense ratio: Annual fund operating costs expressed as a percentage of the fund’s average assets.\nBeta: Measure of an investment’s volatility compared with the overall market, typically the S&P 500.\nAUM: Assets under management; the total market value of all assets a fund manages.\nMax drawdown: The largest peak-to-trough decline in an investment’s value over a specific period.\nTotal return: Investment performance including price changes plus all dividends and distributions, assuming reinvestment.\nDefensive sector: Industries like consumer staples and utilities that typically hold up better during economic downturns.\nSector exposure: How a fund’s holdings are allocated across different industries or parts of the economy.\nPortfolio breadth: The number and diversity of holdings within a fund’s portfolio.\nTrading liquidity: How easily shares of a fund can be bought or sold without significantly affecting the price.\nPassively managed: Fund strategy that tracks an index instead of trying to outperform it through active stock picking.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "US military seizes Maduro in bombing raid on Venezuelan capital\n\nJavier Tovar, Andrea Tosta and Patrick Fort in Caracas, with Jim Watson in West Palm Beach and Sebastian Smith in Washington\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 7:50 AM PST 4 min read\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday that US special forces seized Venezuela's leader Nicolas Maduro during a nighttime bombing raid on the capital Caracas and were taking him to face trial in New York.\nA months-long standoff ended swiftly and violently in a high-risk operation that Trump touted as an \"amazing\" success.\n\nUS-backed opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, posted on social media: \"the hour of freedom has arrived.\"\nShe called for the opposition's candidate in the 2024 election, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, to \"immediately\" assume the presidency.\nBut the United Nations chief said he was \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected.\"\nChina, a backer of Maduro's hard-left regime, said it \"strongly condemns\" the US attack, while France warned that a solution for troubled Venezuela cannot \"be imposed from outside.\"\nCaracas residents woke to explosions and the whir of military helicopters around 2:00 am (0600 GMT). Airstrikes hit a major military base and an airbase, among other sites, for nearly an hour, AFP journalists said.\n\nThe bombing turned out to be only part of a more ambitious plan to topple 63-year-old Maduro and bring him to US soil to face narco-trafficking charges.\nA triumphant Trump told Fox News that US troops had snatched Maduro from \"a fortress\" and that no US personnel were killed, although \"a couple of guys were hit.\"\n\"I watched it, literally, like I was watching a television show,\" Trump said, expressing astonishment at \"the speed, the violence.\"\n\"It was an amazing thing,\" he said.\nWithin hours of the operation, Caracas had fallen eerily quiet, with police stationed outside public buildings and a smell of smoke drifting through the streets.\n- Maduro to New York -\nTrump said Maduro was initially extracted by helicopter and was being held on the Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship that is part of a large US naval presence in the Caribbean. From there, he will be sent to New York.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro and his wife will face the \"full wrath\" of the courts on drugs and terrorism charges.\nMaduro -- in power since 2013 after taking over from Hugo Chavez -- long accused Trump of seeking regime change in order to control Venezuela's huge oil reserves.\nTrump said the extraordinary snatching of a foreign country's leader was justified because of his claim that Venezuela is responsible for mass death from drugs in the United States.\n\nStory Continues\nWhat happens next in Venezuela remained unclear.\n\"We're making that decision now. We can't take a chance at letting somebody else run and just take over where he left, left off,\" Trump told Fox News. \"We'll be involved in it very much.\"\nThe US and numerous European governments already did not recognize Maduro's legitimacy, saying he stole elections both in 2018 and 2024.\n\nBut Trump did not say whether he wanted Machado to take over.\n- 'They're bombing!' -\nVenezuelans had been bracing for attacks as US forces, including the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, massed off the coast.\nFort Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex, situated in the south of Caracas, and Carlota airbase in the north were among the targets of the strikes.\nFrancis Pena, a 29-year-old communications professional living in eastern Caracas, told AFP that he was sleeping and his girlfriend said: \"They're bombing!\"\nLa Guaira, north of the capital, where Caracas's main airport and port are located, was also struck.\n\"I felt like (the explosions) lifted me out of bed, and I immediately thought, 'God, the day has come,' and I cried,\" Maria Eugenia Escobar, a 58-year-old resident of La Guaira, told AFP.\n\nThe defense ministry accused the United States of targeting residential areas and announced a \"massive deployment\" of military resources.\nNo casualty figures were immediately available.\n- Oil, drugs, migrants? -\nTrump has given a variety of justifications for the military build-up around Venezuela, at times stressing illegal migration, narcotics trafficking and the country's oil industry, in which US companies have long played a major role.\nHe had not openly called for regime change -- likely mindful of his nationalist political base's dislike for foreign entanglements.\nHowever, he told Fox News on Saturday that he had spoken with Maduro just last week and told him \"You have to give up. You have to surrender.\"\nSeveral members of Congress quickly questioned the legality of the operation. Trump's key ally Mike Johnson, Republican speaker in the House of Representatives, said it was \"decisive and justified.\"\n\nAs part of an escalating pressure campaign, Washington informally closed Venezuela's airspace, imposed more sanctions and ordered the seizure of tankers loaded with Venezuelan oil.\nUS forces have also carried out numerous strikes on boats in both the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since September -- targeting what Washington says are drug smugglers -- that have killed more than 100 people, according to the US military.\nAmong other international reactions, Iran, Cuba and Colombia's leftist leader Gustavo Petro condemned the attacks, while the EU's top diplomat urged restraint.

This robotic surgery pioneer gained 8% in 2025 -- underperforming the broader market. But given enough time, it could help investors become millionaires. Here's why.\nThe leader in robotic-assisted surgery Intuitive Surgical introduced its renowned da Vinci system over 25 years ago. It was the first of its kind to receive clearance in the U.S., demonstrating the company's innovative capabilities.\nSince then, the company has implemented plenty of updates to the device. It launched its fifth iteration last year, with new and improved features.\nThanks to its first-mover advantage and constant innovations, Intuitive Surgical has established itself as the leader in robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) in a wide range of procedures that would otherwise require traditional operations. The da Vinci system assists surgeons in performing minimally invasive procedures that rely on small incisions and specialized tools to achieve the desired results with minimal scars. It is cleared for urological, gynecological, and some cardiac surgeries, among other uses.\n\nStaying ahead of the competition One reason Intuitive Surgical underperformed in 2025 is that one of its peers in the medical device market, Medtronic , completed clinical trials for a competing RAS system, the Hugo, in urological procedures, and recently earned clearance in this indication. Medtronic will seek more approvals for its Hugo system, including in hernia repairs.\n\nIntuitive Surgical will face tougher competition from here on out. However, it is well equipped to handle it and still perform well over the long run for three reasons.\nFirst, it has a large list of approved uses and a significant installed base. Both are constantly growing. In the third quarter, the company had an installed base of 10,763 systems, representing a 13% year-over-year increase. And a few weeks ago, Intuitive Surgical announced regulatory approval for three new indications.\n\nStory continues\nSecond, Intuitive Surgical has a strong economic moat thanks to high switching costs. Between the price of a da Vinci system and the training required, it's far easier for hospitals to stay locked in than opt for an entirely new device.\nLastly, there is a long runway for growth in the RAS market, particularly when looking far into the future. New indications will always play a role, boosting procedure volumes over the long run.\n\nAdditionally, the RAS market is currently underpenetrated and is expected to grow consistently as the world's population ages over the next few decades. Intuitive Surgical also generates most of its revenue from instruments and accessories, which -- unlike the actual da Vinci systems -- are replaced regularly. So, it has a consistent stream of revenue from the sale of these products, which carry even higher margins. That should provide a constant boost to the company's top and bottom lines over the long run.\nBuy and stay the course For investors 30 years from retirement, for example, $30,000 can grow to $1 million over that time frame, assuming a compound annual growth rate of 12.4% -- above the market's historical average return. It's important to diversify, and there are many excellent stocks on the market. However, Intuitive Surgical can be one of the core holdings in a well-diversified portfolio designed to turn a modest sum into $1 million or more in a few decades. It's an excellent option for long-term investors.\n\nShould you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical right now?

      "Content": "The Nuclear Savings Rule: 10 Frugal Living Tips From the 1950s Era\n\nChris Adam\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 7:47 AM PST 4 min read\n\nHave you ever wished to go back to another decade for what may have been simpler times? With the Nuclear Savings Rule, you can — at least where your budget is concerned.\nThe Nuclear Savings Rule looks at 1950s spending habits. Many people of that era had lived through the Great Depression and maintained their frugal lifestyles even after it ended. The Nuclear Savings Rule carries forward some of that frugality and makes it relevant for today.\n\nHere’s a look at 10 frugal living tips from the 1950s that can stretch your budget and save you money .\n1. Live Simply You may have heard that life was just simpler back in the 1950s. With all the technology and distractions of life today, it can be a nice change of pace to unplug and get back to basics when you can. Not only will you clear your mind, but time away from the constant onslaught of marketing messages and shopping temptations can save you money at the the same time.\n\nFor You: 6 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nUp Next: 25 Creative Ways To Save Money\n2. Cook at Home One of the tips often shared about cutting expenses is eating at home instead of dining out. But that only goes so far if you frequently order in rather than cook.\n“It’s possible the internet, Pinterest and fancy cookbooks helped us complicate meal time, but cooking doesn’t have to be so fancy or convoluted,” according to the Happy Simple Mom blog.\n\n3. Plant a Vegetable Garden Perhaps your grandparents or great-grandparents grew much of their food. With the help of online how-to videos, you can try growing some of your own food as well. You could use it as a way to save money and do an activity as a family.\n4. Make Grocery Lists “Making a list of foods and ingredients you know you love helps you stay focused, and staying focused at the grocery store can help you save lots of money,” according to The New York Times.\nBack in the 1950s, making a grocery list probably meant using a pen and paper. Today, mobile tools make it easy to add to your list on the fly and have it handy for impromptu stops at the grocery store.\n\n5. Pay With Cash or Debit Consumers have more shopping and payment options than ever, but there’s still money to be saved by sticking with cash or debit. That way, you avoid interest and fees from credit cards and other payment methods.\n6. Fix Rather Than Replace In some circles, this tip may already be in fashion. Some consumers mend their belongings and then share what they’ve done on social media. While you may not want to go that route, you can save money by making some repairs instead of rushing out to buy replacements.\n\nStory Continues\n7. Hand Down Clothing Speaking of skipping replacements, you may want to look at how your family deals with hand-me-downs. You may think that was just a thing to do back in the 1950s or other decades. But it’s still popular and a good way to save money. During this back-to-school season, perhaps look at how hand-me-downs from one child to another — and maybe even a swap with friends — could help the budget.\n\n8. Recycle and Upcycle Household Items Think beyond clothes when it comes to reusing and repurposing for your household items. You could even do some research to get ideas from previous decades about new uses for things like food containers and fabric scraps.\n9. Get Rid of Your Car In some big cities, you can take advantage of excellent public transportation instead of owning your own vehicle. It can help you save money and give you time to read or catch up on the news while you ride.\n10 Enjoy Free and Low-Cost Entertainment When it comes to nuclear-style frugal living, perhaps take a look at your entertainment spending. While your family may not want to gather around the radio like in the 1950s, perhaps a board game or a streaming movie, popcorn and after-film discussion could be a cheap and memorable weekend night.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nNearly 1 in 3 Americans Hit by a Costly Holiday Scam, Norton Survey Shows -- How To Avoid This\nHere's What Retirees Wasted the Most Money On in 2025 -- and How To Avoid It in 2026\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : The Nuclear Savings Rule: 10 Frugal Living Tips From the 1950s Era\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "They Made Him HOA President, And He Took The Chance And Dismantled It. 'We Officially Have No HOA!'\n\nAdrian Volenik\nSat, January 3, 2026 at 7:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nAfter being appointed president of a homeowners association in a quiet Texas neighborhood with just four houses, one homeowner used his short time in office to do what many others only dream about: shut it down.\n\nFrom Annoying Dues To Zero Fees “We officially have no HOA!” he announced in a celebratory Reddit post that quickly gained traction. The original HOA, created in 2020, existed mainly to maintain a small park at the back of the development. That park, valued at only $3,000 and located on a floodplain, doubled as the backyard of one homeowner.\n\nDon't Miss:\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%* , which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\nThe group decided to deed the park to that homeowner with legal restrictions on how it could be used. “We will maintain access and had a lawyer draft up a deed which limits the use to personal,” the poster explained. “If they are to move, we can take it back.”\nOnce the park was no longer considered community property, the need for an HOA faded. At the time, the dues were $50 a month, but earlier they had been as high as $280 per household. The only shared space left was a narrow strip of grass that the new president mowed himself. “It adds maybe one minute to my mow,” he joked.\n\nWith no major community responsibilities left, the group chose not to renew the HOA.\nTrending: Forget Flipping Houses— This Fund Lets You Invest in Home Equity Like Wall Street Does\nNot Everyone Was Convinced The post sparked widespread discussion online, racking up over 28,000 upvotes and hundreds of comments. Some applauded the move, especially the cost savings. “Saving $3,300 a year is worth it,” one person wrote. Others echoed that HOA fees often feel like a waste, especially in small developments.\nStill, many questioned the legality. “Not ‘renewing’ the HOA doesn’t mean it just disappears,” one commenter warned. “If the HOA doesn’t exist anymore, how do you plan to take back the park area if those neighbors move?” another added.\n\nThe original poster replied with transparency. “You are correct, but honestly we don’t care,” he wrote. “They are all big lots and no one ever used [the park].” He acknowledged the neighbors who got the extra land did gain some value, but added, “We did also by removing an exorbitant HOA fee . I was a bit jealous, but it doesn't actually impact me in any negative way.”\n\nStory Continues\nSee Also: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n“Not everyone’s gain has to be your loss,” one person said, praising the cooperative spirit of the group. Others said this was a rare case where everyone got something: a little more land for one, no dues for the rest, and no meddling HOA for anyone.\n\nThe thread also drew broader frustrations with HOAs in general. “[HOAs are] just a money grab run by wannabe power-grabbing Karens ,” one homeowner vented.\nDespite the criticism, the former HOA president stood by the decision. “What a time to be alive,” he wrote.\nRead Next: Sam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\nImage: Shutterstock\nThis article They Made Him HOA President, And He Took The Chance And Dismantled It.

CES is kicking off on January 6th under the bright lights of Las Vegas, and tech editor Dan Howley is here with what to expect. Dan, tell us.\n00:15 Dan Howley\nYeah, Jared, there's going to be a number of big announcements at this year's show. The the first obviously, will probably, and biggest, be out of Nvidia. They're hosting their own press event on January 5th. CEO Jensen Wong will take the stage. He did it last year as well. They announced a number of new products, a new chip for a smaller bitesize desktop AI computer, as well as a number of different software innovations that they've really been pushing as of late. They also brought out their kind of digital army of robots. It was basically a a a video recording uh and then a little tiny robot uh care of Star Wars uh took the stage alongside of him.\n00:54 Dan Howley\nUh outside of Nvidia, we're also expecting to see AMD host their own press event with CEO Lisa Sue. Uh we'll see Intel and Qualcomm both host press events as well related to their respective chips. Uh and then overall, we should see a ton of AI. I mean, you know, the chips themselves are are, you know, obviously enough to say that AI is going to dominate, but uh you can expect to see a lot of robots, uh a lot of smart home devices. You can even see some wearables that are AI powered. And those usually, you know, so far we haven't seen anything too interesting as far as AI powered wearables outside of maybe, you know, the intelligence built into smart glasses or smart watches. There's never been a dedicated device that's really taken off. Open AI is supposedly working on one, don't expect it at CES. Uh and then finally, uh Autos. Autos have been a big part of CES as of late.\n01:54 Dan Howley\nUh they continue to do so and we'll likely see things ranging from flying cars to uh different types of boats. Uh we know that there'll be some major automakers like Hyundai on hand, uh Sony and Honda, their uh Afeela vehicle will be there as well. Uh and so it's going to be a jam-packed show, but again, I think the big takeaway is going to be from Nvidia. They're the the hottest uh company on the market right now and what they're doing in AI as well as AI from the the rest of the companies at the show.\n02:18 Speaker A\nDan, we got about 30 seconds. So I'm just going to ask you real quickly, any surprises over the last few weeks that have jumped into your attention span uh that might kind of give us a hint of what 2026 has in store for us in tech?\n02:32 Dan Howley\nYeah, I mean the the Nvidia Groc uh kind of licensing deal, non-exclusive licensing deal. Uh I think it was estimated $20 billion. That was really interesting and it just kind of shows where Nvidia sees its its future at this point, you know, making these kinds of investments and new types of chip technologies or different types of chip tech chip technologies to really hold on to the lead that it has.\n03:00 Dan Howley\nUh you know, I I think we're going to continue to see these kinds of not necessarily acquisitions, but you know, licensing agreements will hire some executives from a company, uh things along those lines. Uh they really kind of became popular in 2025 and I think we'll continue to see them through 2026. It's a a way for companies to kind of avoid the scrutiny of acquiring a company, taking it over entirely, while still getting some of that knowhow and IP.\n03:22 Speaker A\nAll right, Dan, appreciate it.

      "Content": "CES 2026: What to expect from the tech industry’s biggest show of the year\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 6:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nQCOM\n\nMETA\n\nWelcome to 2026. Now rinse out that champagne glass and pop some Advil because the tech industry’s biggest show of the year, CES, kicks off on Jan. 6 under the bright lights of Las Vegas.\nCompanies big and small will take over the famed Strip and Las Vegas Convention Center, debuting their latest and greatest offerings, and a good helping of fly-by-night products that’ll never see the light of day.\n\nWhile the show officially begins on Jan. 6, the festivities start a few days earlier with events like CES Unveiled and press conferences featuring Nvidia ( NVDA ) CEO Jensen Huang and AMD ( AMD ) CEO Lisa Su. And that means you can expect artificial intelligence to be front and center at the trade show.\nThat will include everything from AI-focused PCs to new chips. But robots are looking like they’ll steal the spotlight in 2026.\n“​Every year CES has a theme. And sometimes you don't know what it is until you get to the show, and everybody's talking about it” explained Kinsey Fabrizio, president of the Consumer Technology Association trade organization, which runs CES.\n“But we can tell you right now, robotics is going to be talked about … big time at CES.”\n\nYahoo Finance will be live and in person in Vegas bringing you all of the latest news and announcements. Here’s what we’re anticipating at CES 2026.\nWhat to expect at CES CES has become a kind of battleground for chipmakers and designers to show off their wares to the world right alongside their biggest rivals.\nLast year, Nvidia was the talk of Las Vegas when Huang held a keynote in front of a massive audience at the Michelob Ultra Arena, debuting the company's newest lineup of gaming chips, a desktop-sized AI rig, and a variety of AI software services and platforms.\nThis year, you can expect even more from the company that closed out 2025 with a $4.5 trillion market cap. Huang, who is scheduled to take the stage at 1:00 p.m. PT on Jan. 5 will likely unveil new gaming offerings, as well as a host of AI apps and capabilities.\nAMD’s Su will then host her own keynote a few hours later at 6:30 p.m. PT, giving that company’s rebuttal to Nvidia’s announcements and providing updates on its own gaming and AI products.\n\nJim Johnson, Senior vice president and GM of Intel's ( INTC ) Client Computing Group, which covers sales of the company’s chips for consumer and enterprise PCs, will also hold a keynote at CES 2026 where he’s expected to provide updates on Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3, codenamed Panther Lake, chips.\nThe processors, which Intel initially revealed in October, are the first to use the company’s highly anticipated 18A chip technology, and are a key part of its broader turnaround effort.\n\nStory Continues\nQualcomm ( QCOM ) will also be on hand at CES, with CEO Cristiano Amon set to participate in a fireside chat with Fortune’s Andrew Nusca. Qualcomm launched its Snapdragon X-series processors for Windows PCs during CES 2025 and will likely build on that momentum at this year’s event.\nEach of the chipmakers will likely provide insights into their plans to power physical AI systems, a technical term for robots, during the show.\nExpect to see humanoid robots on display, as well as a number of robotic arms, AI-powered drones, and self-driving cars scattered across Las Vegas this year, as the industry looks to rapidly advance the technology.\nSpeaking of cars, CES has become a major showcase for the auto industry’s tech ambitions, and this year will be no different. The show will likely include flying car concepts, a mainstay in recent years, as well as a variety of ways car companies are looking to capitalize on the AI trend by incorporating the technology into their vehicles’ dashboards.\n\nAI-powered wearables and fitness trackers could also make their debut at CES 2026. Those can come in the form of smart rings, glasses, or pins.

      "Content": "2 Reasons to Like QCOM (and 1 Not So Much)\n\nKayode Omotosho\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 8:04 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\nQualcomm trades at $171.30 per share and has stayed right on track with the overall market, gaining 5.5% over the last six months. At the same time, the S&P 500 has returned 9.9%.\nIs now the time to buy QCOM? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nWhy Does QCOM Stock Spark Debate? Having been at the forefront of developing the standards for cellular connectivity for over four decades, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading innovator and a fabless manufacturer of wireless technology chips used in smartphones, autos and internet of things appliances.\nTwo Positive Attributes: 1. Skyrocketing Revenue Shows Strong Momentum A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Luckily, Qualcomm’s sales grew at an impressive 15.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions.\n2. Stellar ROIC Showcases Lucrative Growth Opportunities Growth gives us insight into a company’s long-term potential, but how capital-efficient was that growth? A company’s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nQualcomm’s five-year average ROIC was 47%, placing it among the best semiconductor companies. This illustrates its management team’s ability to invest in highly profitable ventures and produce tangible results for shareholders.\nOne Reason to be Careful: Projected Revenue Growth Is Slim Forecasted revenues by Wall Street analysts signal a company’s potential. Predictions may not always be accurate, but accelerating growth typically boosts valuation multiples and stock prices while slowing growth does the opposite.\nOver the next 12 months, sell-side analysts expect Qualcomm’s revenue to rise by 3%, a deceleration versus its 15.3% annualized growth for the past five years. This projection is underwhelming and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.\n\nFinal Judgment Qualcomm’s merits more than compensate for its flaws, but at $171.30 per share (or 14.2× forward P/E), is now the time to initiate a position? See for yourself in our comprehensive research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\n\nStory Continues\nHigh-Quality Stocks for All Market Conditions If your portfolio success hinges on just 4 stocks, your wealth is built on fragile ground.

      "Content": "The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10%\n\nSam Quirke, MarketBeat\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 11:38 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nKey Points Qualcomm’s MACD just flipped bearish again, and the stock is already slipping after a strong run from April.\nA similar signal in early November was followed by a fast, double-digit drop, making this setup hard to ignore.\nThe near-term “tell” is whether buyers defend the low-$170s, or whether the stock breaks down ahead of February earnings.\nInterested in QUALCOMM Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nAfter showing many promising signs over the past quarter, shares of Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) are flashing a sudden warning signal as the new year begins. Just before Christmas, the stock’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) chart logged a bearish crossover, confirming a momentum shift that has continued into this week. The mega-cap tech stock closed just below $174 on Dec. 30, still up roughly 40% since April, but also down about 15% from the late-October surge that briefly reignited bullish enthusiasm.\nSince then, however, Qualcomm has been narrowing into a tight range, and while its long-term fundamentals remain supportive, its short-term technicals are flashing caution. What makes it all the more noteworthy is that the last time this exact setup appeared, the outcome was not kind to the bulls. Could history be about to repeat itself? Let’s jump in and take a closer look.\n\n→ Why NVIDIA’s AI Power-Play Could Drive the Next Major Rally in 2026\nWhat Qualcomm’s Bearish MACD Crossover Signals Now The MACD is a momentum indicator that tracks the relationship between two moving averages. When the shorter-term average crosses below the longer-term one, it’s regarded as a reliable signal that upside momentum is fading and that sellers are beginning to gain the upper hand. Importantly, this is not just an intraday wobble. The crossover that appeared just before Christmas has now continued and picked up pace into this week.\n\nThat matters because MACD signals tend to be more reliable when they appear after extended rallies. Qualcomm’s run since April has been one of its most sustained in years, and so this sudden divergence could be an early warning that buyers are starting to step back, rather than to continue building positions.\n→ Will the Fed Cut or Pause? These Finance Stocks Can Win Either Way\nNow, it doesn’t mean a breakdown from here is inevitable. But it does suggest that the stock is vulnerable if bulls fail to step in soon, especially given how the stock behaved the last time this happened.\nThe Last Time QCOM Flashed This Signal, Shares Dropped 10% The most recent comparison point came less than two months ago in early November. At the time, Qualcomm had also printed a bearish MACD crossover after a strong move to multi-year highs. In a move that surprised us all, what followed was a swift decline of more than 10% over the following two weeks.\n\nStory Continues\n→ The 2026 Cannabis Wildcard: How Tax Reform Could Reset Stock Valuations\nThe setup then shares several similarities with today. The stock had been moving higher into the middle of December since bottoming out from November’s correction, but in the face of increased selling pressure over the past fortnight, the bulls have been nowhere to be seen.\n\nHistory might not repeat perfectly when it comes to stocks, but it often rhymes. The point isn’t so much that Qualcomm is definitely going to fall another 10% from here; it’s that, at the very least, the stock is flashing a warning signal that is worth noting.\nWhy This Qualcomm Setup Could Play Out Differently There are also reasons not to be overly negative. Unlike early November, Qualcomm hasn’t just retreated from a multi-year high, and is actually starting to trade within a tightening range. With the longer-term uptrend still intact, it could be said to have been coiling into a pre-breakout setup over the past week, more so than starting to break down.\n\nIts fundamentals also look as strong as they have all year, with expectations building for Qualcomm to once again top the consensus in their first earnings report of 2026, due in early February. As we’ve highlighted in recent weeks, too, investor perception has been improving as the company’s diversification efforts continue to build momentum.\nEspecially when the broader equity market is in risk-on mode, this underlying narrative supports higher prices over time, even if the near-term path is choppy. That longer-term view is supported by TradeSmith’s Health Indicator, a volatility-based metric that has consistently ranked Qualcomm in the green zone for six consecutive months.\n\nWhat Bulls Must Do for Qualcomm to Start 2026 Strong Still, for Qualcomm to start 2026 on the right foot, the bulls need to reassert control soon. If the stock continues to drift lower below $172, it would significantly increase the odds of another leg down similar to November’s move.\nConversely, if buyers step in and momentum begins to turn back up, this crossover could prove to be a false alarm within a broader uptrend. Having worked hard to shake off its reputation for exasperating investors with multiple false promises, Qualcomm has earned some benefit of the doubt after its strong performance since April, but that goodwill is not unlimited.\nThe next week or two will tell a lot. A stock can coil only for so long before it has to choose a direction, one way or the other. With its fundamentals pointing higher and technicals pulling in the opposite direction, Qualcomm is approaching a moment of decision.\nThe article \" The Last Time This Happened, Qualcomm Fell 10% \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Can Intel's Investment-Driven Strategy Regain Its Competitive Edge?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 7:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nQCOM\n\nAMD\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nIntel Corporation ( INTC ) has completed a previously announced $5 billion investment from NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ), under which the latter purchased around 214.7 million shares of the former at $23.28 per share. Earlier in December, this transaction received U.S. antitrust approval from the Federal Trade Commission. This purchase gives NVIDIA roughly a 4% equity stake in Intel through a private placement of shares.\n\nThe partnership aims to tightly combine Intel’s custom-designed x86 CPUs with NVIDIA’s AI GPUs and NVLink interconnect technology to create faster, more efficient AI systems and next-generation PCs with stronger AI and graphics performance. This could help Intel remain competitive in the AI era.\nIntel had also secured $8.9 billion in funds from the U.S. government to support semiconductor manufacturing and packaging projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon in order to boost the domestic chip industry. SoftBank has also invested $2 billion, providing funds to support Intel’s restructuring and AI projects.\nIntel is constantly making efforts to bring huge investments to strengthen its balance sheet, supporting heavy spending on new factories and R&D, boosting market confidence and enabling deeper technology collaboration with firms like NVIDIA.\n\nHow Are Rivals Performing? Intel faces competition from Qualcomm Incorporated ( QCOM ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). Qualcomm recently completed its $2.4 billion acquisition of British semiconductor company Alphawave Semi to strengthen its AI, data center and high-speed connectivity technologies, boosting its competitiveness beyond smartphones. By strengthening its PC chip offerings through programs like Snapdragon X, Qualcomm can expand into new markets such as AI infrastructure, edge computing and personal computers. Qualcomm entered the AI infrastructure space by developing AI accelerators like AI200 & AI250.\n\nAMD is set to launch high-performance AI GPUs, EPYC server CPUs and full AI systems like Helios to compete with NVIDIA and provide faster, more efficient solutions for data centers and enterprises. AMD is partnering with companies like OpenAI and Oracle to expand across gaming, PCs and servers to increase revenues and stay competitive. The company continues to improve its ROCm open software stack and open hardware standards.\nINTC’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of Intel have surged 85% over the past year compared with the industry ’s growth of 34.1%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/book ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 1.5 book value, lower than 32.5 of the industry average.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nINTC’s earnings estimates for 2025 have increased 6.3% to 34 cents per share, while those for 2026 have declined 6.5% to 58 cents over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIntel stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Despite an explosive year-to-date rally, they’re going for just over 3x sales at the time of writing, versus more than 35x for Nvidia.\nWall Street Disagrees with Newman on Intel Wall Street analysts do not entirely agree with Newman’s constructive view on Intel stock, though.\nThe consensus rating on INTC shares remains at “Hold” only with the mean target of nearly $37 already in line with the price at which they are trading currently.\n\nStory Continues\nThis article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.

      "Content": "Analysts Watch QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM)’s Expanding AI Data Center Footprint\n\nRameen Kasana\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:15 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nAWEVF\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM ) is among the most undervalued tech giants to buy according to hedge funds . As of December 26, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) has a ‘Buy’ or equivalent rating from half of the analysts covering the stock. With a median price target of $200, the stock has an upside potential of 14.28%. Among the analysts bullish on the stock is Fang Boon Foo, an analyst at DBS, who maintained a ‘Buy’ rating on the company on December 5 and a price target that mirrored the consensus estimate.\n\nLater, on December 18, QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) announced the completion of its acquisition of Alphawave IP Group plc, a quarter ahead of the expected timeline. This acquisition is a testament to the company’s strategy of establishing a foothold in the data center market. CEO and co-founder of Alphawave Semi, Tony Pialis, will lead the company’s data center business.\nKārlis Dambrāns/Flickr\nThe venture aims to create a leading player in AI compute and connectivity solutions across several fast-growing markets, particularly data center applications.\nSeparately, on December 16, C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald lifted the price target on QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) to $185 from $170 and maintained a ‘Neutral’ rating. The firm’s confidence in SOX (Philadelphia Semiconductor Index) to lead the market is driven by its outperformance versus S&P by approximately 30 points in CY25, The Fly reported.\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), headquartered in California, is a digital telecommunications provider operating across three segments: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, Qualcomm Technology Licensing, and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of QCOM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\n^GSPC\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has lost 6.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $3.38 per share, indicating a change of -0.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.15 points to a change of +1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.6 indicates a change of +3.7% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $12.25 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5%. The $45.69 billion and $46.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.5% and +1%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Qualcomm reported revenues of $11.27 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10%. EPS of $3 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.43%. The EPS surprise was +4.17%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nQualcomm is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Qualcomm Shares Are Back Near Their 2021 Price—Should Investors Be Worried or Excited?\n\nSam Quirke, MarketBeat\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 5:39 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QCOM\n\nKey Points After a long reset, Qualcomm is ending the year near 2021 price levels.\nHowever, it’s hard to ignore the fact that the stock has quietly rallied more than 40% since April alone.\nAnalyst price targets suggest that the stock remains undervalued even now.\nInterested in QUALCOMM Incorporated? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nTech giant Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) is trading around $175, a level that stands out for an unexpected, and undesirable, reason.\nDespite a strong rally in recent months, the stock is finishing the year close to where it closed out 2021.\n→ Gold and Silver Exploded—Now Copper May Be the Next Big Trade\nOn the surface, that might sound uninspiring, but look a little closer, and there’s an interesting story to be found about how the market is reassessing Qualcomm as we move into 2026.\nAfter years of uneven performance and repeated false starts, Qualcomm has finally put together one of its more sustained rallies in recent memory. The stock is up more than 40% since April, yet it still sits far from the euphoric valuations enjoyed by some of its semiconductor peers.\n\n→ Netflix Is Out of Favor—and That’s Why It’s Getting Interesting\nThe market’s question heading into 2026 is straightforward: Is Qualcomm stock simply bouncing within a long range, or is it finally earning a more durable re-rating?\nQualcomm Stock Back Near 2021 Prices After a Multiyear Reset Finishing near 2021 levels does not mean Qualcomm has gone nowhere. Instead, it reflects the long reset the stock has endured.\n→ Broadcom's Insider Selling: A Big Red Flag, or Business as Usual?\nSince that period, the company has worked through smartphone cycle volatility, supply chain disruption, and shifting investor expectations around its growth profile.\n\nWhat makes the current setup different is how the current rally has unfolded. Qualcomm’s move since April has been slow, steady, and sustainable, rather than volatile and explosive. The stock’s been making higher highs and higher lows without the kind of speculative frenzy that often marks short-term tops.\nImportantly, fundamentals have been doing more of the heavy lifting throughout this time. Qualcomm has consistently beat analyst expectations in its quarterly reports, putting the pressure back on the bears to prove this is a company on the back foot—something they have been unable to do.\nFrom that perspective, still being at 2021 price levels is not as bad as it may seem at first glance. The past year has not been so much about stagnation as it has been about reinventing itself and rebuilding credibility.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalyst Price Targets Signal Re-Rating Potential Recent analyst commentary captures that balance well. Susquehanna’s reiterated Buy rating on Qualcomm last month, and their $210 price target, paints the picture of a stock that’s heavily undervalued.\nThat target points to meaningful upside and signals confidence that the company’s improving fundamentals are not yet fully reflected in the share price.\n\nWhile Cantor Fitzgerald might have taken a more cautious stance this month with their Neutral rating, considering Qualcomm is currently trading around $175, their $185 price target also suggests it’s heavily undervalued right now.\nThe split is telling, with even the more cautious voices stopping short of calling for a trend reversal. Instead, the debate has shifted to whether Qualcomm deserves to continue trading around the upper end of its recent range, or if it should push on towards all-time highs.\nWhat Must Go Right for Qualcomm in 2026 From a forward-looking perspective, the key takeaway is that Qualcomm enters 2026 from a position of strength rather than speculation. The stock is not cheap by the standards of its recent history, but it is also not priced for perfection. Trading near 2021 levels after a multi-year reset leaves a ton of room for upside if execution continues.\n\nThe next leg will likely depend on whether Qualcomm can sustain its narrative shift. Continued earnings beats and revenue diversification would support the case for this rally continuing. In that scenario, the current price could look more like a base of support than a ceiling.\nOf course, risks remain. A renewed slowdown in key markets or a change in sentiment toward semiconductors more broadly could stall progress. But unlike prior rallies, this one is being underpinned by fundamentals rather than hope.\nEnding the year where it ended 2021 is not a sign that Qualcomm has been standing still. Instead, it feels like the company is finally making serious headway with its overall transformation, and could be ready to make 2026 the year it hits a fresh all-time high.\nThe article \" Qualcomm Shares Are Back Near Their 2021 Price—Should Investors Be Worried or Excited? \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
