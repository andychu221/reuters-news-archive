Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nHearten AI to Release the World's First AI Relationship Coach with Built-In Somatic Tools\n\nHearten AI\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:25 PM PST 4 min read\n\nHearten AI integrates nervous system regulation videos directly into chat to transform how people process and heal relationship dynamics.\nHELSINKI, FI / ACCESS Newswire / December 26, 2025 / The new version of Hearten AI , now available on iOS and Android, offers a groundbreaking way to break free from toxic relationship cycles. Designed for anyone feeling trapped in recurring patterns with partners, friends, family, or colleagues, the app uses AI-assisted coaching and embedded somatic tools to help users create real emotional change. Unlike traditional therapy apps, Hearten AI isn't built for diagnosis - it's a supportive structure designed to meet people in the exact relationship difficulty they're facing, offering science-backed psychoeducation, reflective dialogue, and practical body-based exercises. The result is accessible, empathy-driven coaching without the bias or superficial advice found in generic self-help tools.\n\n\"As someone who's worked at the intersection of wellness, design thinking, and AI, my philosophy for Hearten is simple: accessible healing, personalized safety, and actionable tools,\" says founder Shanshan Gong. \"From breakup recovery to rebuilding after infidelity and shifting long-standing patterns, our roadmap is about giving people clear, guided pathways for the specific relationship challenges they are facing - not just generic advice.\"\nWho Hearten AI is for\nMany of these midlife users are not just looking for quick tips; they want to understand and actively rewire the relationship patterns that have followed them for years. They may be recovering from divorce or infidelity, juggling teenagers and aging parents, or questioning long-standing dynamics in their closest relationships. For people in this stage, a tool that only targets thoughts is not enough - they need support that reaches the nervous system, where so many of their automatic reactions and attachment patterns are stored.\n\nHearten AI's approach is grounded in growing research on the brain-body connection, which shows that emotional responses and relational habits are deeply tied to the state of the nervous system, not just to conscious thinking. Instead of asking users to simply \"think differently,\" the app is built to help them feel safer, calmer, and more regulated in the moments that matter most. This is where its embedded somatic exercises come in: short, guided practices that can be launched directly from the chat to help users downshift from fight-or-flight, reconnect with their body, and create enough internal space to choose a new response.\n\nStory Continues\nAround these tools, Hearten AI uses a framework called \"regulate, resonate, regenerate.\" First, the app helps users regulate their nervous system so they are not overwhelmed by emotion. Then it guides them to resonate more accurately with what they feel and need in a given relationship moment. Finally, it supports them in regenerating new patterns - turning insights into healthier boundaries, more honest communication, and different choices over time. By making this process available 24/7, one conversation and one somatic exercise at a time, the app aims to make meaningful change feel less like a breakthrough event and more like a series of accessible, repeatable steps.\n\nHow Hearten AI Supports Toxic Relationship Healing\nHearten AI is built for the harder side of relationship healing: breaking toxic patterns, recovering from breakups, and working through infidelity or long-standing dynamics, not just getting quick tips. It invites users to describe what happened in a difficult interaction and then guides them with structured prompts, psychoeducation, and suggestions for next steps in love, family, and work relationships.\nSomatic videos are embedded directly into the coaching chat, so users can launch short nervous-system regulation exercises at the exact moment they feel overwhelmed, shut down, or triggered. This combination of reflective conversation, science-backed guidance, and in-the-moment body-based tools turns each session into a focused mini-coaching experience that can fit into a busy day.\nThe Science Behind Somatic Relationship Coaching\nMany people stuck in toxic relationships carry unhealed attachment wounds or complex trauma from earlier in life, which show up as patterns like choosing unavailable partners, people-pleasing, or staying in one-sided relationships. These patterns live not only in thoughts but in the nervous system, which can react to conflict or intimacy as if it is still under threat.\n\nSomatic and trauma research suggests that real change comes from repeated experiences of safety and regulation, not mindset shifts alone. Hearten AI uses brief somatic exercises and just-in-time support to help users calm their system while processing painful relationship events, making it easier to practice new boundaries, communication, and choices in real time.\nWhere to Find Hearten AI\nHearten AI is available on iOS and Android .\nAbout Somabrain, the Company Behind Hearten AI\nHearten AI is developed by Somabrain, a Helsinki-based startup founded in April 2023 by relationship coach & wellness entrepreneur Shanshan Gong. Somabrain's work sits at the intersection of behavioral science, somatic practices, and AI, with a mission to make nervous-system-aware relationship support widely accessible.\n\nBefore founding Somabrain, Gong launched a web-based, gamified app in 2022 that combined somatic exercises with situational AI relationship advice, which laid the groundwork for Hearten AI's current approach. Since Somabrain's official launch, the team has focused on bringing this vision to mobile, rolling out Hearten AI on both iOS and Android so users can access somatic relationship coaching anytime, anywhere.\nMedia Contact:\nCompany: Somabrain Oy (Ltd)\nContact: Gong Shanshan\nEmail: shanshan@heartenapp.ai\nWebsite: www.heartenapp.ai\nSOURCE: Somabrain Oy (Ltd)\n\nView the original press release on ACCESS Newswire\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "What Is the Smartest Quantum Computing Stock to Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nQBTS\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Pure-play developers like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum are the hottest quantum computing stocks right now.\nBig tech giants are also exploring quantum computing in addition to their established generative artificial intelligence (AI) products.\nNvidia is quietly building a quantum AI ecosystem that stands to benefit, no matter which systems succeed in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOne of the hottest pockets of the artificial intelligence (AI) realm in 2025 was quantum computing. Shares of pure-play quantum developers such as IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum each handily trounced the S&P 500 this year.\nWhat many investors might not fully realize is that several members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are also exploring quantum computing technology alongside their existing generative AI efforts. While Alphabet , Amazon , and Microsoft have received some notoriety around their custom quantum processors, I think there's a more lucrative opportunity hiding in plain sight.\nI'll detail how Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is quietly building a full-spectrum quantum computing suite, and explain why this could be a major catalyst for the company as the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure era begins.\nNvidia is laying the foundation between quantum and accelerated computing At the moment, quantum computing is an exploratory pursuit. While some businesses are assessing how the technology may be integrated within their existing AI framework, quantum technology has little use at the enterprise level today.\nAgainst this backdrop, pure-play developers are primarily focused on research and development right now. IonQ and Rigetti specialize in gate-based approaches leveraging trapped ions and superconducting techniques. D-Wave, for its part, is more niche -- focusing on quantum annealing processes for optimization tasks.\n\nThe main takeaway is that quantum pure plays are currently engaged with the actual physics behind the creation and configuration of quantum bits -- known as qubits -- within new computing architectures.\nAs mentioned, the big three cloud providers have each designed their own quantum processors -- dubbed Willow (Alphabet), Ocelot (Amazon), and Majorana (Microsoft). While quantum computing is not a meaningful contributor to their respective businesses at this time, it's clear that big tech is fascinated by how this emerging technology may eventually impact the broader AI opportunity.\nNvidia's approach is entirely different from that of its megacap counterparts, as well as the pure plays. Instead of building its own quantum computers, Nvidia is seeking to become a bridge between the software and hardware investments necessary to build these systems.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia offers a software platform called CUDA-Q, within which developers can write applications that work across a network of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (quantum processing units). On the hardware side, Nvidia has built a high-speed interconnect called NVQLink. NVQLink represents a pathway for QPUs and GPUs to seamlessly communicate without straining latency and bandwidth.\n\nEssentially, Nvidia's decision to provide a software and hardware ecosystem allows programmers to easily test their AI workloads across a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment. This is a particularly smart move because it positions Nvidia to be a beneficiary regardless of which quantum processor designs or qubit architecture emerges as the market standard down the road.\nWill 2026 be a big year for Nvidia? Nvidia's growth trajectory is directly tied to the budgets of big tech. As the slope of the lines in the chart illustrate, AI hyperscalers are accelerating their capital expenditures (capex) -- suggesting that data center buildouts, networking equipment, and chip procurement remain high priorities.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs suggests that the hyperscalers alone will contribute nearly half a trillion dollars to AI infrastructure in 2026. While this is great news for Nvidia in the short term, AI infrastructure is expected to become a nearly $7 trillion opportunity by the end of the decade, according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a couple of key ideas. First, Nvidia appears well-positioned to benefit from rising data center spend going into next year. More importantly, however, AI infrastructure is shaping up to be a longer-term secular opportunity.\nGiven these dynamics, Nvidia could continue receiving outsized demand for its products as quantum computing becomes a more meaningful contributor to the broader AI narrative over the next several years. So while CUDA-Q and NVQLink may not yet be major contributors to Nvidia's business today relative to its core compute and networking services, I'm encouraged by the company's pursuit of quantum computing and see these products eventually becoming an important storyline in its evolution throughout the AI infrastructure chapter.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a good buy? As of this writing (Dec. 22), Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 24. Considering Nvidia's current growth in combination with Wall Street's outlook, the stock is valued quite reasonably.\nIn my eyes, quantum computing represents just another pillar supporting Nvidia's growth arc as AI continues to dominate the market. For these reasons, I think Nvidia is headed for further valuation expansion heading into 2026 and well beyond -- making it a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "'No winner': Kosovo snap poll unlikely to end damaging deadlock\n\nIsmet HAJDARI\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:19 PM PST 4 min read\n\nBefore the first vote is even cast in Kosovo's snap election on Sunday, experts predict it is unlikely to end the political crisis that has been gripping Europe's youngest country for almost a year.\nThe Balkan nation has been politically deadlocked since the inconclusive vote in February, which outgoing premier Albin Kurti's Vetevendosje (VV) party won but without enough seats to form a government.\n\nAfter months of wrangling in a stalled parliament, the caretaker prime minister is going back to the electorate in a vote that analysts say will change very little.\n\"I think that the December 28 elections will not bring any clarity,\" economist Mehmet Gjata told AFP as he predicted Kurti's party would come out on top again.\nPolitical analyst Fatime Hajdari agreed that \"chances were high\" that VV would secure the most votes, but said little else was clear.\n- Charismatic Kurti -\nIf anyone can secure a majority, Kurti, once dubbed Kosovo's Che Guevara for his radical past, has a rare record.\nHis party swept to power in 2021 in the largest electoral victory since the country's independence from Serbia in 2008, taking over 50 percent of the vote.\n\nFrom a student radical to a political prisoner, Kurti's long path to the prime ministership has made him one of the most recognisable and influential politicians in Kosovo.\nHis blend of nationalism and a reform agenda has proven popular in a country whose sovereignty is still contested by Serbia, more than two decades after its war for independence ended.\nBut Gjata says things may have changed since Kurti's last term.\n\"I'm afraid that the current political crisis will repeat itself, because VV will not get more than 50 percent of the votes,\" the economist said.\n\"We will have no winner again.\"\nThe largest opposition parties have refused to join a Kurti coalition, all but assuring a fragmented parliament.\nThe only realistic challenge to VV would be \"cooperation\" between the three major opposition parties, former foreign minister and opposition candidate Enver Hoxhaj said.\n\n\"I think that only they can offer stability,\" Hoxhaj said.\n- Popular Serb policy blamed for 'instability' -\nFor Kurti and his party, countering Serbian influence in Kosovo has long been a focus, drawing support at home but criticism abroad.\nWhen Serbian forces withdrew under NATO bombardment in 1999, it left many of its state structures in place for ethnic Serbs who live mainly in the north.\nKurti has labelled these services \"instruments of intimidation, threat and control\" and spent nearly his entire second term uprooting the system -- and angering Belgrade in the process.\n\nStory Continues\nThe resulting tensions in the north, which last flared into violence in 2023, have drawn sanctions from the European Union and caused Washington to accuse Kurti's government of increasing \"instability\".\nBut among his voters, the removal of Serbian influence remains popular, Hajdari said.\n\n\"The extension of sovereignty there is perceived by the citizens as a major success,\" Hajdari said.\nMost opposition parties avoid the issue, but the Serb List -- which contests and retains most of the ten reserved Serb seats in parliament -- regularly clashes with Kurti's agenda in the north.\nThe minor party, with close ties to Belgrade, has previously called the government's moves in the north \"ethnic cleansing\" and has said they are willing to work with other parties to keep Kurti out of power.\n- A year of 'colossal damage' -\nWithout a parliament, key international agreements have not been ratified, putting hundreds of millions of euros in assistance funds at risk.\nTwo national polls and a local election have cost one of Europe's poorest nations at least 30 million euros ($35 million) this year.\n\nOver a dozen government institutions and agencies have also been left leaderless, as the mandates of their managers expired without new ones being appointed.\nGjata said \"colossal damage\" had been done to the economy by divided lawmakers over the past months.\n\"They have put Kosovo in a state of anarchy,\" he said.\nWhile lawmakers bickered, the cost of the crisis would be felt by the Balkan nation's citizens, Hajdari warned.\n\"That is precisely why Kosovo needs a stable and functional government that would focus on development and welfare.\"\nih/al/fg\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Only junkies gathering there benefit from it now,\" nextdoor neighbour butcher Arsim Futko, 62, told AFP.\n\nFor seven years, it waited for a European Union-funded revamp, only for the money to be suddenly withdrawn with little explanation.\nNow it awaits similar repairs promised by the national government that has since been paralysed by inconclusive elections in February.\nAnd it is anyone's guess whether the new government that will come out of Sunday's snap election will keep the promise.\n\n- 'Collateral damage' -\nCinema director Ares Shporta said the cinema has become \"collateral damage\" in a broader geopolitical game after the EU hit his country with sanctions in 2023.\nThe delayed repairs \"affected our morale, it affected our lives, it affected the trust of the community in us,\" Shporta said.\n\nBrussels slapped Kosovo with sanctions over heightened tensions between the government and the ethnic Serb minority that live in parts of the country as Pristina pushed to exert more control over areas still tightly linked to Belgrade.\nCultural institutions have been among the hardest-hit sectors, as international funding dried up and local decisions were stalled by the parliamentary crisis.\nAccording to an analysis by the Kosovo think tank, the GAP Institute for Advanced Studies, sanctions have resulted in around 613 million euros ($719 million) being suspended or paused, with the cultural sector taking a hit of 15-million-euro hit.\n- 'Ground zero' -\nWith political stalemate threatening to drag on into another year, there are warnings that further funding from abroad could also be in jeopardy.\n\nSince February's election when outgoing premier Albin Kurti topped the polls but failed to win a majority, his caretaker government has been deadlocked with opposition lawmakers.\nMonths of delays, spent mostly without a parliament, meant little legislative work could be done.\nAhead of the snap election on Sunday, the government said that more than 200 million euros ($235 million) will be lost forever due to a failure to ratify international agreements.\nOnce the top beneficiary of the EU Growth Plan in the Balkans, Europe's youngest country now trails most of its neighbours, the NGO Group for Legal and Political Studies' executive director Njomza Arifi told AFP.\n\nStory Continues\n\"While some of the countries in the region have already received the second tranches, Kosovo still remains at ground zero.\"\nAlthough there have been some enthusiastic signs of easing a half of EU sanctions by January, Kurti's continued push against Serbian institutions and influence in the country's north continues to draw criticism from both Washington and Brussels.\n\n- 'On the edge' -\nAcross the river from the Lumbardhi, the funding cuts have also been felt at Dokufest, a documentary and short film festival that draws people to the region.\n\"The festival has had to make staff cuts. Unfortunately, there is a risk of further cuts if things don't change,\" Dokufest artistic director Veton Nurkollari said.\n\"Fortunately, we don't depend on just one source because we could end up in a situation where, when the tap is turned off, everything is turned off.\"\nHe said that many in the cultural sector were desperate for the upcoming government to get the sanctions lifted by ratification of the agreements that would allow EU funds to flow again.\n\"Kosovo is the only one left on the edge and without these funds.\"\nih/al/fg\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "8 million minimum wage workers are up for a raise in January. Some will hit a historic $15 milestone.\n\nJuliana Kaplan,Madison Hoff\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:16 PM PST 3 min read\n\nNineteen states will raise their minimum wages in January, affecting over 8 million workers.\nSix states will reach at least a $15 minimum wage for the first time, over double the federal $7.25 minimum.\nFor the first time, more workers will live in states with at least a $15 minimum wage than the federal minimum.\n\nFor workers in 19 states, New Year's won't just mean festivities and futile resolutions — they'll also be getting paid more as minimum wage increases kick in. For some, those raises will be historic: In six states, the minimum wage will reach at least $15 an hour for the first time.\nThe 19 states hiking wages will impact over 8 million workers, an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, found. Women, Black, and Hispanic workers are set to be disproportionately affected by the new increases, per EPI's analysis, and workers in states like Missouri and Nebraska will see their annual wages increase by nearly $1,000 on average.\nThe map below shows which states are set for a raise in January, and what those increases will be. Most January increases are due to inflation adjustments , although some are tied to legislation or ballot measures, such as in Rhode Island , where legislation set a gradual increase from $15 in 2025 to $17 by 2027. The minimum wage there will reach $16 on January 1, 2026. A few states will hike their minimum wage later this year; Florida will increase its minimum by a dollar to $15 at the end of September.\n\nThe new round of raises will hit an \"important milestone for the minimum wage movement,\" according to EPI's Sebastian Martinez Hickey.\n\"What's really distinctive is that for the first time this January, there are going to be more workers that live in a state with at least a $15 minimum wage compared to those that live in a state with the federal minimum wage, which is still $7.25,\" Hickey said.\n\nHowever, the fresh round of statewide increases means an even greater discrepancy in some local wages and the federal minimum wage . The majority of states have stepped in to increase their pay beyond the federal minimum, although 20 states still either mandate $7.25 or default to the federal line.\nYannet Lathrop, a senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, said that while the new spate of $15 minimum wages will likely be a boon for many — and reflects a long history of organizing — workers will still contend with affordability concerns.\n\"Even these wages, as good as they are, as positive as they are for workers, none of them are going to fully cover the cost of living for even single workers without families in any state or locality,\" Lathrop said. \"These workers are still going to be facing a crisis of affordability. It's just that in some places where minimum wages are going up much more, the pain of that gap between what the cost of living is and what the minimum wage is going to be a little bit better for workers.\"\n\nStory Continues\nAs states opt to hike pay on their own, a federal minimum increase still looks unlikely. Democrats failed to garner any Republican support for an effort to raise the minimum wage to $15 during President Joe Biden's term. President Donald Trump had previously opened the door to raising the wage beyond $7.25, but there has been no legislative movement toward making that a reality.\nAre you set to be affected by a minimum wage increase, or currently make the minimum wage?

      "Content": "Main contenders in Kosovo's snap election\n\nIsmet HAJDARI\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:14 PM PST 4 min read\n\nKosovo is heading for early elections Sunday after months of political deadlock and failure to form a government -- the only solution its deeply divided parties could agree on to break the stalemate.\nHere are the main contenders to be the Balkan nation's next prime minister:\n- Albin Kurti: eyeing fourth win -\n\nKosovo's caretaker prime minister, Albin Kurti, is widely seen as the unbeatable frontrunner in the race—even after a year of political paralysis during which he failed to form a coalition.\nIf he wins, it will mark the fourth consecutive time the 50-year-old left-wing leader has crossed the finish line first, securing his position at the helm of the small, landlocked country.\nKurti has left nothing to chance, pouring enormous energy into a two-week snap election campaign, travelling extensively and lobbying across the country.\nOnce nicknamed \"Che Guevara\" for his youthful radicalism, Kurti boasts long political experience rooted in Kosovo's independence movement during the war-torn 1990s and later in parliament.\nAfter a brief first term as prime minister from February to June 2020, Kurti's party, Vetevendosje (VV) -- which blends a leftist agenda with fervent nationalism -- won the 2021 snap elections with over half the vote.\n\nHe then became the first prime minister to complete a full term since Kosovo's independence. However, in February's election, his party fell short of the numbers needed to govern alone and failed to secure a coalition partner, triggering months of deadlock that ultimately led to Sunday's snap vote.\nKurti and VV still enjoy strong voter support, thanks largely to their reformist and anti-corruption platform. But if Kurti wins on Sunday, he will face intense international pressure to revive dialogue with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on normalizing relations between the two neighbours.\n- Bedri Hamza: the challenger -\nBedri Hamza, a former central bank governor and newly elected president of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), is seen as Kurti's strongest challenger.\n\nBorn out of a guerrilla movement during the war against rule from Belgrade, the PDK dominated Kosovo's political scene for years, riding the wave of wartime popularity. But its influence gradually waned as the country moved beyond the conflict.\nThe party has since reinvented itself with figures like Hamza, who blends national values with liberal economic policies championing free markets, economic growth, a stronger private sector and social protection.\nThe 62-year-old graduated from the Faculty of Economics at the University of Pristina and began his career in the late 1980s as head of accounting and finance at a lead metallurgy plant in Mitrovica.\n\nStory Continues\nMore than three decades later, Hamza returned to the ethnically divided city as mayor of its Albanian-majority south. His tenure is remembered for successfully implementing multi-ethnic projects with the Serb-majority north, including regulating the Ibar River. If elected prime minister, this experience could prove invaluable in building trust with Kosovo's Serb minority, which remains loyal to Belgrade.\n\nA prominent economist, Hamza has served as finance minister, central bank governor and has been a three-term MP.\nKnowing that in pro-American Kosovo, political ambitions often hinge on US support, Hamza's first major move after announcing his candidacy was a trip to Washington, where he met senior US officials.\nGenerally regarded as a man of integrity, Hamza declared after his election as PDK leader that the party \"is ready for victory\".\n- Lumir Abdixhiku: young pretender -\nLumir Abdixhiku is the youngest candidate for prime minister but leads the country's oldest political party, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK).\nThe 42-year-old economist was an academic focusing on tax evasion in transition economies before entering politics and served as Kosovo's infrastructure minister.\n\nAbdixhiku also spent several years as a newspaper columnist, penning the well-known \"Letters from Limbo\" column in the daily Koha Ditore.\nHe became LDK leader in 2021, just a month after the party suffered a crushing parliamentary defeat. Abdixhiku pledged reform and delivered, replacing much of its leadership with younger activists. Now the third-largest party in parliament, the LDK could play kingmaker in these elections, as both left and right seek its support for a coalition.\nAbdixhiku declared that LDK aims to \"take the leadership of Kosovo\" and offer \"a dignified and European government\" if it wins.\nih/fg\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Department stores fight TikTok and Amazon for beauty shoppers\n\nEuronews\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:06 AM PST 7 min read\n\nChristmas shopping used to mean packed department store counters with last-minute gift seekers jostling beneath twinkling lights and towering holiday displays.\nNow, Christmas spending has moved indoors, with people filling stockings from the sofa, rather than being helped by sales associates in red-and-green sweaters.\n\nIt is consumers like Quinn Kelsey who keep department store executives up at night.\nThe 38-year-old Denver resident gets makeup ideas from TikTok videos and other social media content, not from beauty counter salespeople. She uses an AI chatbot to get product recommendations that fit her budget and to see how a specific foundation or lipstick would look on her. When she buys, it is usually from Amazon.\n“I use ChatGPT as my personal beauty consultant,” Kelsey said. “Department stores? I’ll walk through one for the decor, but they’ve basically lost me unless I can get the same product-research experience there that I can get scrolling through my phone at home.”\nOnce the ultimate beauty destination, department stores lost sales and their authority to skincare and makeup trendsetters starting in the late 1990s. That was when the growth of Sephora and Ulta Beauty made shopping for cosmetics more playful and self-service.\n\nBut fast-changing consumer preferences have retailers of all types racing to outdo one another for a slice of the $129 billion (€110bn) US beauty and personal care market. The competition is fiercer than ever due to the ease of e-commerce.\nAmazon, which has slowly added premium beauty brands to its massive selection, is the nation’s largest online seller of beauty and personal care products, according to market research company Euromonitor International.\nSocial media has also provided new sources of beauty guidance. Instead of store advisers, many consumers turn to videos from influencers, beauty brand founders, or dermatologists for advice. Shoppers also turn to TikTok and Instagram for information about “dupes\" — drugstore versions of more expensive products.\n\n“Stores are more of the showroom, but the spark itself is happening in TikTok,” Jake Bjorseth, founder of the Gen-Z advertising agency Trndsttrs, said.\nTo keep up, companies with both physical and online stores are investing in upgrades to deliver an experience beauty fans like Kelsey cannot get anywhere else.\nMacy’s and Nordstrom, for example, renovated the beauty floors of their flagship New York stores to add more space, ultra-luxury brands and cutting-edge technology. At Nordstrom, customers can book an appointment to get robot-applied eyelash extensions for $170 (€145).\n\nStory Continues\nThe makeovers were launched in time for the holiday shopping season, which accounts for about one-quarter of all US “prestige” beauty sales, according to market research firm Circana.\nThe chateau experience Department stores chasing beauty sales are introducing some of Sephora's self-service features — Nordstrom has installed a “beauty bar” with brightly lit mirrors where customers can try on makeup from different counters, while trying to distinguish themselves from speciality and online rivals.\nExecutives from Macy's and Nordstrom said the latest changes were designed to create an engaging atmosphere that encourages shoppers to stay longer and spend more. The overhaul at Macy's Herald Square included comfortable seating and skin-analysis devices to support products priced at hundreds of dollars.\nIn the Parfums de Marly section, customers sample scents while wearing a virtual reality headset that immerses them in an 18th-century chateau, the French fragrance maker cites as its inspiration.\n“This is the future of beauty,” Nicolette Bosco, Macy's vice president of beauty, said, referring to the interactive technology the department store considers central to offering shoppers an elevated experience.\nThe company expects to redesign the beauty departments of 40 more stores. The facelifts are intended to draw shoppers of all ages, Macy’s Inc CEO Tony Spring said.\n\n“We’re trying very hard to take the idea of a department store and make it intimate and friendly and convenient,” he said.\nSince becoming chief executive of the department store's parent company last year, Spring has focused on reviving Macy's by targeting higher-spending customers who drive sales at Bloomingdale's and the upscale beauty retailer Bluemercury, both of which Macy's owns.\nRelated\nWhere in the world do people spend the most as online shoppers?\nAmazon deploys 2,000 robots in UK's Bolton warehouse to meet Christmas demand\nNordstrom unwrapped the reimagined beauty floor of its midtown Manhattan store in September. It includes an area where shoppers can test beauty tools such as LED light-therapy masks and a “fragrance finder” machine that provides a dry whiff of up to 60 scents.\n\nNordstrom also expanded the beauty treatment area at the New York flagship and a few other stores to include a medical spa offering Botox and dermal filler injections priced at $575 (€490) to $1,050 (€900).\nWhat is the competition up to? Sephora redefined beauty shopping by installing mirrors and disposable applicators near compact displays of both tester products and ready-to-grab items.\nThe DIY concept was in significant contrast to department store counters staffed by beauty advisers who oversaw product sampling and retrieved fresh products from locked drawers.\n\nBut even innovators have to renovate. Sephora, a division of French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, is updating its 720 stores in the US and Canada.\nThe stations where customers have their hair and makeup done are being moved to the side for greater privacy. The chain, known for long cash-register lines, plans to expedite checkouts by equipping salespeople with devices that accept card and contactless payments.\nUlta, which stocks drugstore beauty brands like Maybelline as well as high-end brands, has had in-store hair salons since its founding in 1990. It is adding ear piercing, testing robotic manicures, and plans to add robotic lash extensions, like Nordstrom’s, to its service menu next year.\nWalmart has moved into the turf of speciality retailers and department stores with products from higher-end and independent brands. The nation's largest retailer put beauty counters in 100 stores this year, where customers can try products.\n\nSocial media driving trends After working at a fashion event at Nordstrom's Manhattan flagship, Ivan Leon, a 35-year-old freelance stylist, headed to the Tom Ford fragrance counter.\nHe walked away an hour later having spent $537 (€460) on two bottles of perfume: a unisex scent named Bitter Peach and another named Vanilla Sex.\nLeon planned to wear them together, a practice known as “fragrance layering” that he heard about on social media. The Nordstrom salesperson caught his interest by suggesting Tom Ford scents could be applied in tandem.\n\n“It’s kind of cool when you combine two scents and it makes something new,” Leon said. “I think it helps the psyche and builds confidence.”\nLeon, who typically buys his fragrances online, offers department stores hope but also represents the uphill climb they face, given customers’ multidimensional shopping habits.\nTikTok is not only spawning trends like “tired girl” and “blurred skin” makeup, but is also becoming a place where users discover and buy from new brands.\nTikTok Shop, an e-commerce feature the social media platform launched in 2023, has emerged as the nation's seventh-largest online seller of beauty and personal care products, trailing only Target, according to Euromonitor.\nMacy’s and Nordstrom's online market shares are 1% and less than 0.5%, respectively, and both are declining, the market research firm said.\n\nRelated\nTikTok adds digital well-being features to help teens manage screen time and limit doomscrolling\nA new wave of DIY marketing: Small businesses take to TikTok\nAmazon, which accounts for almost half of online beauty and personal care sales, aims to replicate the in-store experience with virtual makeup try-on tools, such as Sephora's 2016 launch.\nSephora, meanwhile, unveiled in March an AI-powered online tool that uses selfies to identify potential skin concerns and make product recommendations.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "India adds 50GW renewables in 2025 with $22.32bn investment\n\nGlobalData\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:06 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIndia has reached a significant milestone in 2025 by adding 50 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity, supported by nearly Rs2tn ($22.32bn) in investment, reported PTI.\nThis expansion has raised the nation’s total non-fossil fuel capacity to around 262GW, putting India ahead of its climate commitments.\n\nNon-fossil fuel sources currently comprise half of India’s installed capacity, meeting the Paris Agreement’s 2030 goal five years ahead of schedule.\nThe country’s total installed power capacity currently stands at 510GW, including 247GW from fossil fuels and 262GW from non-fossil sources, of which renewables account for 254GW.\nUnion Minister for New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi told PTI that 2025 recorded unprecedented growth, with around 45GW of renewable capacity added from January to November, driven mainly by nearly 35GW of new solar capacity.\nHe said: “By the end of December, we will reach nearly 48-50GW. The future is sunny and will be powered by renewables,” noting that this momentum is likely to carry into 2026.\nDespite the progress, hurdles such as land acquisition, right-of-way constraints, and delays in finalising power purchase agreements (PPAs) are still limiting the rollout of new projects.\n\nIndustry projections suggest capital costs of roughly Rs 40m per megawatt (MW), implying about Rs2tn for every 50GW of additional capacity.\nAn Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) analysis estimates that India will require around Rs30.54tn in investments from 2023 to 2030 to reach the 500GW non-fossil fuel capacity target.\nSince 2014, public sector financial institutions have collectively committed about Rs10.79tn to renewable energy, including approximately Rs2.68tn in the 2024-25 fiscal year alone.\nPralhad Joshi stated that between 2014 and 2024–25, public sector banks and institutions, such as IREDA, PFC, REC, IIFCL, SIDBI, and NaBFID, have deployed around Rs10.79tn (excluding private banks) for renewable energy projects, of which about Rs2.68tn was invested in the financial year (FY) 2024-25.\n\nAccording to Vinay Rustagi, chief business officer of Premier Energies, an integrated solar cell and solar module manufacturing company, 2025 has been an exceptionally active year for the renewable sector.\nHe noted that project commissioning increased by more than 50% compared to the previous year, largely propelled by the PM Surya Ghar Yojana and the PM-KUSUM programme.\nRustagi observed that the rapid scaling of renewable capacity is creating grid imbalances, leading to power curtailment, while delays in adding transmission infrastructure are hindering project timelines, especially in Rajasthan.\n\nStory Continues\nHitachi Energy’s MD and CEO for India and South Asia, N Venu, emphasised the need to reinforce the transmission grid, speeding up the rollout of renewable energy zones, boosting energy storage, and moving from project-centric to programme-driven approaches.\nVenu added that with targeted measures in 2026, India can improve its energy security and solidify its standing in the global clean energy arena.\n\n\"India adds 50GW renewables in 2025 with $22.32bn investment\" was originally created and published by Power Technology , a GlobalData owned brand.\n\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

      "Content": "3 Reasons to Buy Nu Holdings Stock Like There's No Tomorrow\n\nCourtney Carlsen, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NU\n\nKey Points Rising smartphone adoption in Latin America supports Nu Holdings' digital-first banking model.\nNu has disrupted the traditional banking system and now has more than 110 million customers in Brazil.\nWith a huge customer base, Nu is focused on increasing profitability through cross-selling financial and other services.\nThese 10 stocks could mint the next wave of millionaires ›\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE: NU) is making waves in the fintech investment sector. Since the start of the year, the Latin American financial services company has surged 58%. The bank has done a stellar job of serving regions starved for quality, affordable banking services, leveraging its digital platform to connect with hundreds of millions of customers.\nThe company's stock performance reflects investor optimism about Nu's growth trajectory and future prospects. The bank has a large customer base to sell to and is targeting other markets ripe for disruption. Here are three reasons to invest in Nu Holdings today.\n1. Nu has seen tremendous growth in Brazil For many years, Brazilian consumers faced a concentrated and predatory banking system dominated by just five banks. The situation was so severe that credit card interest rates reached 160%, and former finance minister Paulo Guedes described it as a \"cartel.\"\nChanges paved the way for Nu's neobank model. By operating a digital-only platform, Nu challenged the traditional banking model by offering free digital accounts and credit cards with no annual fees, attracting tens of millions of customers. Today, Nu serves more than 110 million customers in Brazil, or roughly 60% of the country's adult population.\nNu currently holds multiple regulatory licenses, letting it offer products and services in payments, credit, financing, investments, and securities. However, Brazil has made regulatory changes restricting the use of the term \"bank\" by those without a banking license, so Nu is aiming to acquire a small bank in Brazil sometime next year.\n\nBeing a fully licensed bank provides legitimacy with consumers, especially in a market where trust in financial institutions is paramount. This license could also make it easier for Nu to access markets reserved for banks, thereby lowering its cost of capital.\n2. It has a huge customer base to cross-sell to Nu has a huge customer base of 127 million, and sees this as an opportunity to create value and cross-sell to those customers. It views this as a means to enhance the profitability and economics of its overall business. Nu offers a range of financial services, including lending, investments, and insurance. It also offers travel and cellular services, along with an integrated marketplace platform.\n\nStory Continues\nOne way to assess how effective Nu is at cross-selling is to look at its average revenue per active customer (ARPAC). As customers adopt more of its products, the revenue per active user climbs. In the third quarter, Nu's ARPAC was $13.40, a 20% year-over-year increase on a foreign-exchange-neutral basis. For Nu's long-term customers who have been on the platform for eight years or more, the ARPAC was $27.30 as of the second quarter.\nNu's growing ARPAC demonstrates the long-term monetization potential as its customer base grows, matures, and adopts more of its products. This is a critical component that helps Nu grow efficiently and cost-effectively.\n3. Positive trends should fuel future growth A positive trend for Nu is smartphone adoption , which is projected to reach 400 million users across Latin America. This digital-native population increasingly prefers mobile apps to physical bank branches, a trend Nu leverages through its low-cost, digital-first model.\nNu's growth in Brazil has been excellent, and the company has begun its expansion into Mexico and Colombia. These are two of the largest regions in Latin America, with significant numbers of unbanked or underbanked consumers. In Mexico, Nu has over 13 million customers, representing about 14% of the country's adult population. It is also approaching nearly 4 million customers in Colombia.\n\nNu Mexico has been approved to convert into a bank in Mexico and is currently completing the final steps. It previously operated as a Popular Financial Society (SOFIPO). Once fully authorized as a bank, it will be able to offer a broader product portfolio, including payroll accounts. It will also increase its deposit insurance coverage by 16-fold, allowing Nu to attract high-net-worth individuals.\nBut that's not all. In September, Nu Holdings applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for a charter to establish a de novo national bank in the U.S. The charter would let the company offer a range of products, including deposit accounts, credit cards, loans, and potentially digital asset custody, under a single federal regulator.\n\nNu has demonstrated excellent growth across Brazil and is making strides in Mexico and Colombia. The company is effectively leveraging its scale and cross-selling to drive efficient growth. If you're looking for an attractively priced growth stock, Nu Holdings, trading at 20 times next year's earnings, appears to be an excellent buy today.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

In fact, Bank of America has a home equity line of credit rate as low as 7.3% in some states.\n\nFind out whether now is a good time to take out a HELOC.\nHELOC rates: Monday, December 22, 2025 According to Curinos data, the average weekly HELOC rate is 7.44% . This rate is based on applicants with a minimum credit score of 780 and a maximum combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 70%.\nHomeowners have a huge amount of value tied up in their houses — nearly $36 trillion at the end of the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve. That's the largest amount of home equity on record.\nWith mortgage rates lingering just over 6%, homeowners may not want to let go of their primary mortgage anytime soon, so selling the house may not be an option. Why give up your 5%, 4% — or even 3% mortgage?\n\nAccessing some of the value locked into your house with a use-it-as-you-need-it HELOC can be an excellent alternative.\n\nHow lenders determine HELOC interest rates HELOC interest rates are different from primary mortgage rates. Second mortgage rates are based on an index rate plus a margin. That index is often the prime rate, which has just fallen to 6.75%. If a lender added 0.75% as a margin, the HELOC would have a rate of 7.50%.\nLenders have flexibility with pricing on a second mortgage product, such as a HELOC or home equity loan , so it pays to shop around. Your rate will depend on your credit score, the amount of debt you carry, and the amount of your credit line compared to the value of your home.\nAnd average national HELOC rates can include \"introductory\" rates that may only last for six months or one year. After that, your interest rate will become adjustable, likely beginning at a substantially higher rate.\nDiscover the details of how HELOC interest rates work.\nHow a HELOC works You don't have to give up your low-rate mortgage to access your home's equity. Keep your primary mortgage and consider a second mortgage , such as a home equity line of credit.\nThe best HELOC lenders offer low fees, a fixed-rate option, and generous credit lines. A HELOC allows you to easily use your home equity in any way and in any amount you choose, up to your credit line limit. Pull some out; pay it back. Repeat.\nMeanwhile, you're paying down your low-interest-rate primary mortgage.\n\nLook for introductory rates, but be aware of a rate adjustment later Today, FourLeaf Credit Union is offering a HELOC rate of 5.99% for 12 months on lines up to $500,000. That's an introductory rate that will convert to an adjustable rate later. When shopping for lenders, be aware of both rates. And as always, compare fees, repayment terms, and the minimum draw amount. The draw is the amount of money a lender requires you to initially take from your equity.\nThe power of a HELOC is tapping only what you need and leaving some of your line of credit available for future needs. You don't pay interest on what you don't borrow.\nHELOC rates today: FAQs What is a good interest rate on a HELOC right now? Rates vary so much from one lender to the next that it's hard to pin down a magic number. You may see rates from nearly 6% to as much as 18%. It really depends on your creditworthiness and how diligent a shopper you are.\nIs it a good idea to get a HELOC right now? For homeowners with low primary mortgage rates and a chunk of equity in their house, it's probably one of the best times to get a HELOC. You don't give up that great mortgage rate, and you can use the cash drawn from your equity for things like home improvements , repairs, and upgrades. Of course, you can use a HELOC for fun things too, like a vacation — if you have the discipline to pay it off promptly. A vacation is likely not worth taking on long-term debt.\nWhat is the monthly payment on a $50,000 home equity line of credit? If you withdraw the full $50,000 from a home equity line of credit and pay a 7.50% interest rate, your monthly payment during the 10-year draw period would be about $313. That sounds good, but remember that the rate is usually variable, so it changes periodically, and your payments will increase during the 20-year repayment period. A HELOC essentially becomes a 30-year loan. HELOCs are best if you borrow and repay the balance within a much shorter period.",

See our Advertiser Disclosure .\n\nBest high-yield savings interest rates today, December 22, 2025 (Earn up to 4.3% APY) Here’s a look at how today’s savings account rates stack up.\n\nCasey Bond · Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Banking\n\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nToday’s savings account rates still hover well above the national average. The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate three times in 2024 and three times in 2025. This means deposit account rates are also on the decline. It's more important than ever to ensure you're earning the highest rate possible on your savings, and a high-yield savings account could be the solution.\nThese accounts pay more interest than the typical savings account — as much as 4% APY and higher in some cases. Not sure where to find the best savings interest rates today? Read on to find out which banks have the best offers.\n\nBest savings rates today In general, high-yield savings accounts offer better interest rates than traditional savings accounts . Still, rates vary widely across financial institutions. That’s why it’s important to shop around and compare rates before opening an account.\nAs of December 22, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.3% APY. This rate is offered by SoFi.*\nAs you'll see, the majority of top savings rates come from online banks . These institutions have much lower overhead costs than traditional banks, so they can pass those savings on to customers in the form of higher rates and lower fees.\nHere is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:\n\nNational average savings account rates A high-yield savings account can be a good fit if you’re looking for a secure place to store your money and earn a competitive interest rate while maintaining liquidity. Traditional savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) have some of the highest interest rates we’ve seen in more than a decade, despite several rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Even so, the national average for these rates is fairly low compared to the top offers available.\nFor example, the average savings account rate is just 0.39%, while 1-year CDs pay 1.63%, on average, according to the FDIC. The Fed is also expected to lower rates even further in the coming months, which means now might be the last chance for savers to take advantage of today’s high rates.\n\nChoosing the best savings account for you Taking the time to compare accounts and rates from various financial institutions will help you secure the best deal available. However, interest rates aren’t the only factor to consider when choosing a savings account.\nFor example, some banks may require that you maintain a minimum balance to earn the highest advertised rate and avoid monthly fees. Other factors to evaluate include customer service options and hours, ATM and branch access, digital banking tools, and the overall financial stability of the institution. Additionally, before opening a savings account, be sure that it’s insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) — or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) if it’s held by a credit union — so your money is protected in case the institution fails.",

The FORVIA HELLA expansion and new GaN partnership both support that thesis, but do not materially change the near term risk that weaker auto demand, especially in North America and Europe, could keep margins under pressure.\n\nThe GaN power collaboration with GlobalFoundries is especially relevant here, as it ties directly into onsemi’s push into wide bandgap power for AI data centers, EVs and industrial applications. If customer adoption of these newer GaN and SiC products is slower than expected, it could compound near term revenue headwinds from exiting lower margin legacy businesses just as investors are watching utilization and earnings closely.\nYet behind the technology wins, investors should still be aware of the risk that ongoing manufacturing underutilization could continue to weigh on margins and cash generation...\nRead the full narrative on ON Semiconductor (it's free!)\nON Semiconductor’s narrative projects $7.5 billion revenue and $1.9 billion earnings by 2028.
