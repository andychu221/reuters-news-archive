      "Content": "Stock Market Today, Jan. 2: Dow Climbs After Industrials Outperform on Rotation Away From Mega Cap Tech\n\nJosh Kohn-Lindquist, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 2:45 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: ^IXIC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\nSNDK\n\nASML\n\nOn Jan. 2, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) rose 0.19% to 6,858.54 after choppy trading, the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX:^IXIC) slipped 0.03% to 23,235.63 on tech softness, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) climbed 0.66% to 48,382.38, leading blue chips higher.\nMarket movers Cyclical and industrial strength helped the Dow outperform, while the Nasdaq gave up some of its early gains. However, semiconductor stocks rallied on a persistently positive outlook for increasing demand from AI.\nWhat this means for investors The first trading day of 2026 was largely positive for investors as the old-school S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes rose, while the bleeding-edge Nasdaq index was flat. While the tech-focused Nasdaq index gave up its early gains, the semiconductor industry delivered exceptional results today with Sandisk rising 16%, ASML up 9%, and Intel moving 7% higher. These increases were tied to continued optimism surrounding the potential for increased AI spending, which could benefit these stocks.\n\nElsewhere, Tesla stock slid 3% as its vehicle deliveries fell short of expectations and BYD overtook the company as the world's largest electric vehicle seller. Last but not least, today marked the first trading day for Greg Abel at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway , following his takeover of the company from Warren Buffett after his legendary 60-year run.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nNvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $483,730 !*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $51,719 !*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $505,641 !*\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies , available when you join Stock Advisor , and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee the 3 stocks »\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 2, 2026\nJosh Kohn-Lindquist has positions in ASML and Tesla.

      "Content": "CES 2026: Nvidia, AMD, Intel, & more to make announcements\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 1:02 PM PST\n\nIn this video: AMD\n\n005380.KS\n\n005385.KS\n\n005387.KS\n\n005389.KS\n\nThe 2026 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is coming up next week in Las Vegas.\nYahoo Finance Technology Editor Dan Howley sits down with Yahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre on Market Domination to explain what investors should expect from the event and from key names like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and AMD ( AMD ).\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nIt is a new year and to kick it off in style, the Consumer Electronics show will be one of the biggest tech conferences. CES is kicking off on January 6th under the bright lights of Las Vegas, and tech editor Dan Howley is here with what to expect. Dan, tell us.\n00:15 Dan Howley\nYeah, Jared, there's going to be a number of big announcements at this year's show. The the first obviously, will probably, and biggest, be out of Nvidia. They're hosting their own press event on January 5th. CEO Jensen Wong will take the stage. He did it last year as well. They announced a number of new products, a new chip for a smaller bitesize desktop AI computer, as well as a number of different software innovations that they've really been pushing as of late. They also brought out their kind of digital army of robots. It was basically a a a video recording uh and then a little tiny robot uh care of Star Wars uh took the stage alongside of him.\n00:54 Dan Howley\nUh outside of Nvidia, we're also expecting to see AMD host their own press event with CEO Lisa Sue. Uh we'll see Intel and Qualcomm both host press events as well related to their respective chips. Uh and then overall, we should see a ton of AI. I mean, you know, the chips themselves are are, you know, obviously enough to say that AI is going to dominate, but uh you can expect to see a lot of robots, uh a lot of smart home devices. You can even see some wearables that are AI powered. And those usually, you know, so far we haven't seen anything too interesting as far as AI powered wearables outside of maybe, you know, the intelligence built into smart glasses or smart watches. There's never been a dedicated device that's really taken off. Open AI is supposedly working on one, don't expect it at CES. Uh and then finally, uh Autos. Autos have been a big part of CES as of late.\n01:54 Dan Howley\nUh they continue to do so and we'll likely see things ranging from flying cars to uh different types of boats. Uh we know that there'll be some major automakers like Hyundai on hand, uh Sony and Honda, their uh Afeela vehicle will be there as well. Uh and so it's going to be a jam-packed show, but again, I think the big takeaway is going to be from Nvidia. They're the the hottest uh company on the market right now and what they're doing in AI as well as AI from the the rest of the companies at the show.\n02:18 Speaker A\nDan, we got about 30 seconds. So I'm just going to ask you real quickly, any surprises over the last few weeks that have jumped into your attention span uh that might kind of give us a hint of what 2026 has in store for us in tech?\n02:32 Dan Howley\nYeah, I mean the the Nvidia Groc uh kind of licensing deal, non-exclusive licensing deal. Uh I think it was estimated $20 billion. That was really interesting and it just kind of shows where Nvidia sees its its future at this point, you know, making these kinds of investments and new types of chip technologies or different types of chip tech chip technologies to really hold on to the lead that it has.\n03:00 Dan Howley\nUh you know, I I think we're going to continue to see these kinds of not necessarily acquisitions, but you know, licensing agreements will hire some executives from a company, uh things along those lines. Uh they really kind of became popular in 2025 and I think we'll continue to see them through 2026. It's a a way for companies to kind of avoid the scrutiny of acquiring a company, taking it over entirely, while still getting some of that knowhow and IP.\n03:22 Speaker A\nAll right, Dan, appreciate it. We'll see you soon.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Super Micro Computer Just Launched a New AI Server. Should You Buy SMCI Stock Today?\n\nWajeeh Khan\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 12:04 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: SMCI\n\nINTC\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) shares rallied today after the Nasdaq-listed firm unveiled a new high-density, liquid-cooled blade server designed for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance compute workloads.\nDubbed the SBI-622BA-1NE12-LCC, this latest addition to the company’s SuperBlade family “is powered by dual Intel Xeon 6900 series processors,” according to its press release on Friday.\n\nMore News from Barchart After Record Runs for Western Digital and Sandisk in 2025, Consider This 1 Data Center Storage Stock for 2026\nNVDA, NKE, and CM: Bet on These 3 Stocks With Surging Unusual Options Activity for 2026 Gains\nCrowdStrike Insiders Are Offloading CRWD Stock. Should You?\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\nDespite today’s gains, SMCI stock remains down more than 50% versus its October high.\nSignificance of the AI Server Launch for SMCI Stock Supermicro’s new server delivers rack-level performance in a compact footprint, reducing cabling by a remarkable 93% and supporting up to 3TB of memory.\nInvestors cheered the announcement mostly because it positions SMCI as a key player in next-gen AI infrastructure, especially as demand for scalable, energy-efficient solutions continues to ramp in 2026.\n\nAccording to Charles Liang, the chief executive of Super Micro Computer, “this new iteration is the most core-dense SuperBlade we’ve ever created, providing customers with a scalable, efficient platform.”\nWith applications spanning finance, climate modeling, and scientific research, this new AI server strengthens the company’s competitive edge, which is why SMCI shares are pushing higher on Jan 2.\nAre Supermicro Shares Worth Owning in 2026? At a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of about 0.8x currently, SMCI stock appears priced for permanent impairment, despite clear signs of operational momentum.\nMoreover, the AI server specialist has entered 2026 with a $13 billion backlog, offering sufficient visibility into future demand, particularly across artificial intelligence and HPC verticals.\n\nIf the firm delivers on its roadmap and capitalizes on hyperscale infrastructure growth, its current valuation could prove deeply discounted.\nNote that Supermicro shares now look headed to challenge their 20-day moving average (MA) at $31.86 level, a break above which could further accelerate upward momentum in the near term.\nWhat’s the Consensus Rating on SMCI Shares? Long-term investors could also take heart in the fact that Wall Street remains bullish on Supermicro stock for 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nThe consensus rating on SMCI shares currently sits at “Moderate Buy” with the mean target of about $47 indicating potential upside of another 50% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Wajeeh Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares of server solutions provider Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) jumped 5.7% in the afternoon session after the company unveiled a new high-density server designed for demanding AI and high-performance computing workloads.\nThe new 6U SuperBlade platform featured both direct liquid and standard air cooling and utilized dual Intel Xeon 6900 Series processors. Supermicro stated this design packed more computing power into less space, allowing for up to 25,600 cores per rack, which was important as modern data centers faced power and cooling limits. The company highlighted that the system could reduce cabling by up to 93% and decrease space requirements by approximately 50% compared to traditional servers. This product launch addressed the growing need for advanced cooling solutions driven by increasingly powerful AI chips.\n\nIs now the time to buy Super Micro? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Super Micro’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 68 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 21 days ago when the stock dropped 4% on the news that investors rotated out of AI-linked high-flyers following underwhelming earnings updates from Oracle and Broadcom as the core thesis shifted from \"growth at any cost\" to \"prove the returns.\". Oracle triggered the alarm by missing revenue estimates while simultaneously hiking capital expenditures by $15 billion. This reignited fears that AI infrastructure spending is outpacing actual monetization. Broadcom compounded the anxiety; despite beating earnings, its stock fell as CFO Kirsten Spears cautioned that gross margins may come under pressure as product mix shifts further toward system-level AI sales. This sparked a macro rotation away from AI infrastructure and power plays.\nInvestors who bought $1,000 worth of Super Micro’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $9,984.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

Now rinse out that champagne glass and pop some Advil because the tech industry’s biggest show of the year, CES, kicks off on Jan. 6 under the bright lights of Las Vegas.\nCompanies big and small will take over the famed Strip and Las Vegas Convention Center, debuting their latest and greatest offerings, and a good helping of fly-by-night products that’ll never see the light of day.\n\nWhile the show officially begins on Jan. 6, the festivities start a few days earlier with events like CES Unveiled and press conferences featuring Nvidia ( NVDA ) CEO Jensen Huang and AMD ( AMD ) CEO Lisa Su. And that means you can expect artificial intelligence to be front and center at the trade show.\nThat will include everything from AI-focused PCs to new chips. But robots are looking like they’ll steal the spotlight in 2026.\n“​Every year CES has a theme. And sometimes you don't know what it is until you get to the show, and everybody's talking about it” explained Kinsey Fabrizio, president of the Consumer Technology Association trade organization, which runs CES.\n“But we can tell you right now, robotics is going to be talked about … big time at CES.”\n\nYahoo Finance will be live and in person in Vegas bringing you all of the latest news and announcements. Here’s what we’re anticipating at CES 2026.\nWhat to expect at CES CES has become a kind of battleground for chipmakers and designers to show off their wares to the world right alongside their biggest rivals.\nLast year, Nvidia was the talk of Las Vegas when Huang held a keynote in front of a massive audience at the Michelob Ultra Arena, debuting the company's newest lineup of gaming chips, a desktop-sized AI rig, and a variety of AI software services and platforms.\nThis year, you can expect even more from the company that closed out 2025 with a $4.5 trillion market cap. Huang, who is scheduled to take the stage at 1:00 p.m. PT on Jan. 5 will likely unveil new gaming offerings, as well as a host of AI apps and capabilities.\nAMD’s Su will then host her own keynote a few hours later at 6:30 p.m. PT, giving that company’s rebuttal to Nvidia’s announcements and providing updates on its own gaming and AI products.\n\nJim Johnson, Senior vice president and GM of Intel's ( INTC ) Client Computing Group, which covers sales of the company’s chips for consumer and enterprise PCs, will also hold a keynote at CES 2026 where he’s expected to provide updates on Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3, codenamed Panther Lake, chips.\nThe processors, which Intel initially revealed in October, are the first to use the company’s highly anticipated 18A chip technology, and are a key part of its broader turnaround effort.\n\nStory Continues\nQualcomm ( QCOM ) will also be on hand at CES, with CEO Cristiano Amon set to participate in a fireside chat with Fortune’s Andrew Nusca. Qualcomm launched its Snapdragon X-series processors for Windows PCs during CES 2025 and will likely build on that momentum at this year’s event.\nEach of the chipmakers will likely provide insights into their plans to power physical AI systems, a technical term for robots, during the show.\nExpect to see humanoid robots on display, as well as a number of robotic arms, AI-powered drones, and self-driving cars scattered across Las Vegas this year, as the industry looks to rapidly advance the technology.\nSpeaking of cars, CES has become a major showcase for the auto industry’s tech ambitions, and this year will be no different. The show will likely include flying car concepts, a mainstay in recent years, as well as a variety of ways car companies are looking to capitalize on the AI trend by incorporating the technology into their vehicles’ dashboards.\n\nAI-powered wearables and fitness trackers could also make their debut at CES 2026. Those can come in the form of smart rings, glasses, or pins. The smart glasses space in particular has gained plenty of attention with the launch of Meta’s ( META ) Ray-Ban Display glasses in September, and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) and Samsung planning their own smart glasses.\nApple ( AAPL ) is also reportedly looking to get into the smart glasses game, though the company eschews making an appearance at CES in favor of hosting its own highly polished events at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., throughout the year.\nNaturally, there are sure to be some outlandish products at CES 2026. Over the years, we’ve seen everything from smart toilets to forks designed to help you eat healthier foods.\nIt’s sure to be an interesting show, and Yahoo Finance will bring you all of the biggest announcements as they happen.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Can Intel Stock Replicate Its Stellar 2025 Performance This Year?\n\nSupriyo Bose\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:58 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nDespite a lackluster performance in the first half of 2025, Intel Corporation INTC stock hit a purple patch in the later stages of the year to script a remarkable turnaround. It gained 84.1% in 2025 compared with the industry’s growth of 35.9%, outperforming peers Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA. While NVIDIA stock was up 38.8%, Advanced Micro gained 77.3% over the year.\nINTC Stock Price Performance in 2025\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nINTC Rides on AI PC Gamble Intel is witnessing healthy traction in artificial intelligence (AI) PCs that have taken the market by storm. The company has previewed Intel Core Ultra series 3 processor (code-named Panther Lake) and Xeon 6+ (code-named Clearwater Forest) in third-quarter 2025. Manufactured in a new, state-of-the-art factory in Chandler, AZ, both products are built on Intel 18A, the most advanced semiconductor process in the United States. Panther Lake is designed to power a broad spectrum of consumer and commercial AI PCs, gaming devices and edge solutions. Clearwater Forest is an E-core server processor that enables business enterprises to scale workloads, reduce energy costs and power more intelligent services. While Panther Lake will be available in the broad market from January, Clearwater Forest is slated to be launched in the first half of 2026.\n\nThe company has introduced Intel Core Ultra, which features a neural processing unit that enables power-efficient AI acceleration with 2.5x better power efficiency than the previous generation. With superior GPU and CPU capabilities, it can speed up AI solutions. The company also launched the new vPro platform with an Intel Core Ultra processor that delivers enhanced power efficiency. With dedicated AI acceleration capability spread across the CPU, GPU and the new neural processing unit, it will unlock an endless new wave of AI experiences across all apps. This is likely to give healthy competition to NVIDIA and Advanced Micro’s new GPU lineups for PC gaming.\n\nCapital Infusion Spurs Growth Engine Intel has secured a $5 billion investment from NVIDIA to jointly develop cutting-edge solutions that are likely to play an integral role in the evolution of the AI infrastructure ecosystem. Leveraging the core strengths of both firms, namely NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing and Intel’s CPU technologies and x86 ecosystem, the collaboration is expected to sow the seeds of innovation through the development of state-of-the-art custom data center and PC products.\n\nIn August 2025, Softbank invested $2 billion in Intel to propel AI research and development initiatives that support digital transformation, cloud computing and next-generation infrastructure. The investment enabled Softbank to gain about 2% ownership in Intel, with the former paying $23 per share. This followed $7.86 billion in direct funding from the U.S. Department of Commerce under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act to advance critical semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. The significant capital infusions have enabled Intel to expand its manufacturing capacity to accelerate its IDM 2.0 (Integrated Device Manufacturing) strategy.\n\nStory Continues\nINTC Hurt by Persistence With Legacy Products Despite the uptrend, it appears that Intel has a lot of work to do to catch up with its rivals. While most competitors evolved with changing demand patterns, Intel fell behind others as it clung to its legacy products. For example, despite making significant inroads in AI chips, Intel lagged NVIDIA on the innovation front with the latter’s H100 and Blackwell GPUs being runaway successes. This offered a competitive advantage to NVIDIA, with leading technology companies reportedly piling up NVIDIA’s GPUs to build clusters of computers for their AI work.\n\nMoreover, Intel has been facing challenges due to the disruptive rise of over-the-top service providers in this dynamic industry. This has affected its margins. Price-sensitive competition for customer retention in the core business is expected to intensify in the coming days. An accelerated ramp-up of AI PCs has significantly affected Intel’s short-term margins, as it shifted production to its high-volume facility in Ireland, where wafer costs are typically higher. Margins were also adversely impacted by higher charges related to non-core businesses, charges associated with unused capacity and an unfavorable product mix. Competitive pricing pressure from rivals has further dented its profitability.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nU.S.-China Trade Skirmishes Impair INTC Growth Prospects China accounted for more than 29% of Intel's total revenues in 2024, making it the single largest market for the company. However, the communist nation's purported move to replace U.S.-made chips with domestic alternatives significantly affected INTC’s revenue prospects. The directive to phase out foreign chips from key telecom networks by 2027 underscores Beijing's accelerating efforts to reduce reliance on Western technology amid escalating U.S.-China trade and tariff tensions.\n\nAs Washington tightens restrictions on high-tech exports to China, Beijing has intensified its push for self-sufficiency in critical industries. This shift poses a dual challenge for Intel, as it faces potential market restrictions and increased competition from domestic chipmakers. In addition, weaker spending across consumer and enterprise markets, especially in China, resulted in elevated customer inventory levels.\n\nEstimate Revision Trend for INTC Earnings estimates for Intel for 2025 have moved down 63% to 34 cents over the past year, while the same for 2026 has declined 63.8% to 58 cents. The negative estimate revision depicts bearish sentiments for the stock.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEnd Note Intel's innovative AI solutions hold immense promise for the broader semiconductor ecosystem. By addressing the challenges of scalability, performance and interoperability, the company is paving the way for widespread AI adoption across enterprises worldwide. Management is focusing on simplifying parts of its portfolio to unlock efficiencies and create value. Significant capital infusion to revive its lost glory is likely to spur growth. All these efforts appear to resonate well, as exhibited by an uptrend in the stock price performance.\n\nHowever, the recent product launches appear “too little too late” for Intel. In addition, margin woes amid strict export restrictions, unfavorable product mix and elevated customer inventory levels weigh on its bottom line. Declining earnings estimates remain an overhang. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Intel appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they exercise caution.

      "Content": "We Asked ChatGPT What the Top-Performing Stocks of 2026 Will Be: Do Investing Experts Agree?\n\nVance Cariaga\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 5:49 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nThe stock markets have a hard act to follow in 2026 after setting record highs in 2025. As of the market close on Dec. 30, 2025, the S&P 500 was up by about 17.5% for the year, while the Nasdaq had gained 21.5% and the Dow was up 14.1%.\nWhile it’s hard to predict what’s in store for 2026, some stocks seem poised to keep pushing higher. Which ones will be the top performers in 2026? GOBankingRates asked ChatGPT — and the stocks it picked include some of the hottest names on Wall Street.\n\nHere are the top four stocks picked by ChatGPT, along with its key points about the picks and what other experts have to say .\nNvidia (NVDA) The first stock pick on ChatGPT’s list was Nvidia. Here were its strengths, risks and what to keep an eye on, per ChatGPT.\nStrengths: It’s considered a “top growth stock” thanks to its leadership in graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. “As long as data center build-out and AI compute demand continue, NVDA could benefit,” ChatGPT said.\nRisks: It has a very high valuation, and there’s also supply chain/export/competitive risk. “If AI hype slows, the multiple could contract,” ChatGPT explained.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Earnings growth, new GPU launches, data center contract pipeline and margin trends.\n\nNot everyone believes Nvidia’s momentum is sustainable. Among the skeptics is Chad Cummings, an attorney and CPA at Cummings & Cummings Law who previously worked in finance and tax with American Airlines, PwC and JPMorgan Chase.\n“The Nvidia train is running out of steam,” he told GOBankingRates. “We are advising clients to exit their positions before year-end. Its growth depends on hyperscalers continuing unsustainable data center expansion. One slowdown or energy bottleneck unravels the narrative.”\nRead More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nCheck Out: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Next up on ChatGPT’s list was Microsoft, and it cited these strengths, weaknesses and key factors to keep an eye on.\nStrengths: It’s considered a leading AI infrastructure/cloud play moving into 2026 with a “strong recurring revenue base” and “large market share in cloud, enterprise and AI tools,” per ChatGPT.\nRisks: Its stock growth could decelerate due to “valuation crowding,” meaning shares might soon be seen as overvalued.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Growth in Microsoft’s cloud computing service business, as well as continued AI product launches.\nDespite Microsoft’s robust growth and strong AI position, Cummings called the company “particularly worrisome” because of potential legal and performance problems.\n\nStory Continues\n“Embedding AI in core enterprise tools without clear indemnity invites securities fraud, employment discrimination and professional malpractice claims,” he said. “Several memes have been making the rounds on finance blogs … showing that Microsoft’s integration of AI into Excel produces comedically false mathematical results.”\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) The parent company of Google also made ChatGPT’s list. Here are some key things to note.\nStrengths: Growth in its ad/search business, along with potentially lucrative AI investments , are key strengths.\nRisks: Ad revenue could slow, while the company’s ambitious, innovation-focused Moonshot Factory business “might not pay off” in 2026.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Ad revenue trends, cloud growth and new product/AI service announcements.\n\nMany analysts remain bullish on Alphabet’s prospects. In November, Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson changed his rating from a “Hold” to a “Buy” on the stock, per TheStreet .\nHis reasoning for the upgrade was that Google has proved that its dominance isn’t going anywhere, as reported by TheStreet.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Last on the list for ChatGPT was Advanced Micro Devices. Here are some of its key strengths and risks, as well as what investors should eye in 2026.\nStrengths: It’s seen AI/data center revenue growth and recent large contract wins.\nRisks: It faces competition from companies such as Nvidia and Intel, along with “margin pressure” and “execution risk,” per ChatGPT.\nWhat to keep an eye on in 2026: Data-center GPU revenue growth and contract announcements.\n\nIn a recent analysis, The Motley Fool predicted that Advanced Micro Devices will become a trillion-dollar company by 2030. To get there, its market cap (currently about $350 billion) will have to rise by around 185% over the next four years.\nTo back up its claim, The Motley Fool pointed to a deal the company recently signed with OpenAI to deploy six gigawatts of AMD data center chips by 2030. It also praised AMD’s CPU/GPU business for PCs, which has “steadily gained market share over the past decade.”\nMore From GOBankingRates\nNearly 1 in 3 Americans Hit by a Costly Holiday Scam, Norton Survey Shows -- How To Avoid This\nHere's What Retirees Wasted the Most Money On in 2025 -- and How To Avoid It in 2026\nHow Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : We Asked ChatGPT What the Top-Performing Stocks of 2026 Will Be: Do Investing Experts Agree?\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "With 62% institutional ownership, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a favorite amongst the big guns\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 4:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nKey Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Intel's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\nThe top 25 shareholders own 42% of the company\nUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Intel Corporation ( NASDAQ:INTC ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 62% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intel, beginning with the chart below.\nView our latest analysis for Intel\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intel? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intel. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Intel, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Intel is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Intel While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Intel Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$134m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership With a 38% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Intel. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nNext Steps: It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Intel better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for Intel that you should be aware of.\nIf you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

That's the trillion-dollar question. Tech giants are building massive AI data centers on the assumption that more computing power will be necessary to train and run future AI models. Meanwhile, AI has become capable of tackling a wide range of use cases, from writing computer code to conducting in-depth research.\nThis may sound surprising, but Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) may be the smartest AI stock to buy right now if you've got $1,000. Here's why.\nTwo ways to win Intel has already failed to gain traction in the AI training market, where Nvidia 's powerful data center GPUs dominate. However, the company has two distinct ways to benefit from the AI boom, depending on which way the industry goes.\nIf AI computing continues to occur mostly in cloud data centers, Intel's foundry business can play a key role in churning out the massive number of AI chips necessary to meet demand. The company has been slow to win foundry customers, but that could change as the Intel 18A process ramps up and the Intel 14A process readies for a 2027 launch. Intel is ahead of the industry in multiple ways, including the use of backside power delivery for Intel 18A and High-NA EUV lithography for Intel 14A.\n\nHere's another possibility: AI inference, the act of running AI models, largely shifts to devices like PCs. Today, AI coding tools interface with AI models running in the cloud, incurring ongoing costs. As PCs gain more powerful AI processors and more memory, it's only a matter of time before a capable AI coding tool could run entirely locally.\nIntel's upcoming Panther Lake CPU family is expected to include increased AI processing power, but it will likely take years before a powerful AI model can run on a laptop. Still, that day will eventually come, and Intel could be a key enabler. Even if the AI data center boom fizzles out, Intel's PC business could be a big AI winner in the long run.\nIt may seem contrarian, but don't count out Intel in the AI race.\n\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

On December 29, Reuters reported that Nvidia purchased Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) shares worth $5 billion. The share price went up by around 2% after the announcement. According to the report, this move is based on Nvidia’s previous announcement in September, where the company announced that it would buy Intel’s share at $23.28 per share to support its finances to enhance production capacity.\nOn December 29, Nvidia bought 214.7 million shares of Intel at the price that was established in the September agreement. As per Reuters, the antitrust agency of the United States approved this investment.\nThat said, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has gained more than 61% over the past 6 months. However, Wall Street remains cautious with analysts’ 12-month price target reflecting around 7% upside from the current levels. Recently, on December 19, William Stein from Truist Financial reiterated a Hold rating on the stock, with a $39 price target. Earlier on December 16, Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities raised the firm’s price target from $34 to $40, while maintaining a Sell rating.\n\nAnalyst Arya of BofA noted that he improved the price target based on the growing opportunity for the company’s foundry. BofA expects Intel to secure external wins in advanced packaging and wafer design. However, the analyst cautioned that the uncertainties in the manufacturing sector continue to distort the outlook, hence the firm maintained a Sell rating.\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services worldwide. It operates through Intel Products, Intel Foundry, and All Other segments.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Is Intel Keeping a (Wonderful) Secret From the Market Regarding Its 18A Node?\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 12:53 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Intel will be the first chipmaker to use high-NA EUV lithography, giving it a potential advantage over TSMC.\nThe company has long pointed to its 14A node in 2028 as the first node in which it will use high-NA.\nHowever, there have been hints Intel may insert high-NA earlier into its 18A node, which is ramping up today.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\n\nThere's a conventional wisdom among investors that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is significantly behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , and that it will take years for the company to catch up to TSMC's technological lead -- if it ever happens at all.\nLast week, sell-side analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein said that since it took a decade to \"break\" Intel, investors shouldn't expect it to take less than 10 years to fix. Notwithstanding Intel's heavy lift turnaround really began in 2021 with the appointment of former CEO Pat Gelsinger, the turnaround may actually be closer than Rasgon expects.\nOne key element for Intel being able to leapfrog TSMC would be the earlier implementation of high-NA EUV lithography technology. While Intel has publicly stated that it won't introduce high-NA until its 14A node in 2028, there were numerous indications over the past year that Intel may in fact accelerate HNA into its current 18A manufacturing process.\n\nIf that happens, the semiconductor industry could change very quickly.\nWhat is high-NA EUV? High-NA EUV lithography is the latest and most advanced version of extreme ultraviolet lithography technology (EUV), pioneered and developed by ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) . Twenty years in the making, chipmakers first used EUV lithography in 2019, enabling the efficient production of chips with pitches as small as 7 nanometers between transistors.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Intel delayed its implementation of EUV, instead opting for double, triple, or even quadruple patterning with older DUV technology. That delay allowed TSMC to leapfrog Intel, giving the Taiwanese giant a manufacturing lead it has held to this day.\nHigh-NA is the next jump forward in this technology. HNA EUV machines can \"write\" chip patterns in a thickness of just 8nm, more precisely than the 13.5-nm light beams of low-NA EUV. Like its predecessor, the new technology enables single-patterning, higher-density chips with fewer process steps. Fewer process steps generally means higher yields than multi-patterning with older tools.\nDetermined not to repeat mistakes of the past, Intel has jumped to the front of the line as the first to implement high-NA EUV machines. Ironically, it's TSMC this time that has opted to wait to use the new technology, with TSMC management citing cost reasons.\n\nStory continues\nBut both Intel and ASML have claimed that high-NA machines are working as intended now. In early 2024, ASML's CEO took issue with critics of HNA, saying it is \"very clearly the most cost-effective solution both in logic and memory.\"\nThen at a technology conference in February 2025, Intel executive Steve Carson noted Intel already had HNA \"in production,\" and that the tool was \"more reliable\" at this stage than low-NA was at the equivalent time in the past. Carson also noted high-NA enabled Intel to do the same work with one machine and a \"single-digit\" number of process steps that it took a low-NA machine three exposures and roughly 40 processing steps. So, there appear to be clear advantages for HNA in terms of productivity, especially when one gets to leading-edge nodes that require triple-patterning on low-NA tools.\n\nNow, there are technology obstacles to using HNA tools effectively, and the tool costs about double that of a low-NA tool. Still, given the productivity enhancements, HNA lines should net out to overall cost savings when properly implemented.\nIntel has at least three HNA machines and tons of experience with HNA already Another reason Intel may be ready to use HNA EUV today is that it has already bought, installed, and utilized at least three tools it has disclosed to the public, and possibly more that it hasn't.\nIntel announced the receipt of its first HNA machine at its Oregon R&D facility in late 2023/early 2024, then announced \"first light\" on the machine in late February 2024. Intel next followed that up with the disclosure of a second HNA machine installation in August 2024 at its Oregon facility.\n\nThen, just two weeks ago in mid-December, Intel announced it had achieved \"acceptance testing\" of ASML's EXE:5200 HNA machine, the upgraded version of last year's EXE:5000 high-NA machine, which features enhanced throughput for high-volume manufacturing. Acceptance testing means Intel has the HNA machine working in the fab, meeting high-volume manufacturing benchmarks and customer specifications.\nNotably, ASML didn't start shipping the 5200 until early 2025, indicating that Intel has at least one more than the two it officially announced in 2024. In addition, Intel has not disclosed specifically where the third machine, the 5200, was installed. Notably, Intel has been preparing Fab 52 in Arizona for 18A production this year.\n\nIt's also quite possible, if not probable, that Intel has purchased even more HNA machines. In May 2024, industry publication The Elec reported that Intel had secured all of ASML's high-NA EUV production for 2024, which would encompass five to six machines. Given Intel received its first machines in late 2023, that would bring its total to six or seven.\nThis was just one unconfirmed report, and Pat Gelsinger's resignation in late 2024 may have changed this order pattern. Nevertheless, it's likely a fair bet that Intel has purchased more than the three HNA machines it has officially disclosed.\nWith so much progress, why wait until 14A? In light of all this, it's curious Intel has pointed to 14A, due out in 2028, as the point in which it will use high-NA. And it's especially curious that Intel would purchase so many HNA machines, given that this past summer, Intel disclosed that if it doesn't secure a significant external customer, it might not proceed with 14A development at all.\n\nIf Intel weren't sure it would develop 14A, and since it has pointed to 14A being the first HNA node, why would Intel buy so many expensive HNA machines, which cost $400 million each? And why would it do so when the company was already cash flow negative, to the point where the company took in dilutive equity investments this past summer?\nIntel has also already accomplished a tremendous amount of work with HNA tools. At the February tech conference I mentioned, Intel disclosed that it was processing 30,000 wafers per quarter on high-NA tools. That's a huge number of wafers to be processing for mere research and development purposes. Meanwhile, the recent disclosure of \"acceptance testing\" means that the tool has passed a formal evaluation process that determines the tool can function according to contractual specifications in a formal manufacturing setting.\n\nSince the tool appears to be working in manufacturing settings, Intel has extensive experience with it, and HNA reportedly provides material advantages, why wouldn't Intel integrate HNA into the current 18A process?\nIndications HNA may be in Intel's Fab 52 for 18A While Intel has obviously never said it would use high-NA EUV for 18A, the company has nevertheless dropped clues it would be possible to do so over the past year. Meanwhile, outsiders have begun to speculate over the possibility of high-NA machines in Fab 52.\nReporting on the aforementioned February 2025 technology conference, Reuters initially reported that Intel was developing 18A with high-NA technology; however, Intel later had Reuters correct the story to say that Intel was \"using its 18A manufacturing technology, which is scheduled for mass production with a new generation of PC chip later this year, to test the high NA tools.\"\n\nSo, Intel was at least \"testing\" high-NA on its 18A process as of February.\nThen at Intel's Foundry Direct event in April, Intel's chief technology and operations officer Naga Chandrasekaran stated that Intel had achieved \"yield parity\" between testing both low-NA multi-patterning and high-NA single-patterning on both the 18A and 14A nodes.\nMore recently in October, Intel invited technology journalists into Fab 52 for Intel's \"Tech Tour\" to show off the fab and its 18A node. While all of the journalists were under nondisclosure agreements, a vlogger for Level1Techs told his viewers that he saw \"something\" in Fab 52, asked about it, and was told by Intel to please refrain from disclosing what he saw.\nDuring this portion of the vlog, the Level1 presenter showed a video of the original HNA machine being installed in Oregon. After discussing the EUV machines he saw, without specifying the model, the presenter said, \"That's probably the extent of the detail I'm comfortable giving you.\"\n\nWhy would Intel keep this a secret? For the record, there's no evidence that Intel is using HNA EUV on 18A. But given its purported advantages, why keep it a secret if it were?\nThere could be a number of reasons. One might be the competitive advantage of keeping cards close to the vest, surprising the competition and thereby lengthening Intel's first-mover advantage with HNA. There may also be a concern over setting expectations too high for cost savings, yield, and performance with the first incarnation of the tool's use. After all, numerous rumors were circulated about Intel and 18A's progress over the past year, with many being quite negative.\n\nAdditionally, even if Intel does use high-NA tools for 18A, it may only do so on a few layers of each chip. Current leading-edge 3nm-class chips include about 20 EUV layers, and it's expected upcoming 2nm-class chips, of which 18A is a part, will see that EUV layer count jump by 30% into the mid-20s.\nMoreover, a recent short documentary about Fab 52 by CNBC appeared to show low-NA EUV tools in the fab. Therefore, even if HNA is used on 18A, it may only be for certain products, or perhaps only for a few critical layers, with the majority still handled by low-NA tools.\nThus, Intel may be wary of labeling 18A a \"high-NA\" node if most layers are still completed using low-NA tools. It's also possible that Intel may be using low-NA tools for 18A, but will actually insert HNA tools for the next variant of the node called 18AP, which is supposed to ramp later in 2026 and deliver an 8% improvement in performance-per-watt over 18A.\n\nIntel may never reveal its tool set for 18A Investors may never know whether Intel is actually using HNA tools on 18A, given the secrecy that generally accompanies semiconductor manufacturing. If Intel does choose to disclose it, next week's CES in Las Vegas could be the ideal time and place, given that Intel will formally unveil its first 18A-produced chip, called Panther Lake.\n\nNevertheless, given the company's tight-lipped posture regarding the 18A process, it may very well remain a mystery as to whether Intel is using high-NA EUV for its critical 18A node.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

This approach lowers operating costs and power consumption without compromising performance. The SuperBlade® chassis management module (CMM) provides total remote control of individual server blades, power supplies, cooling fans, and networking switches remotely. System administrators can control the maximum power consumption on a server through power capping and manage the power allocation in the SuperBlade CMM for each blade server. Remote power control capabilities to reboot and/or reset the server are available as well as remote access to the BIOS configuration and operating system console information vial SOL (Serial over LAN) or embedded KVM capabilities. Because the controller is a separate processor, all monitoring and control functions operate flawlessly regardless of CPU operation or system power-on status.\n\nStory Continues\nThe hot-swappable design also provides significant advantages for enterprises and data centers, reducing cabling by up to 93% and consuming up to 50% less space than traditional rackmount servers. These benefits not only minimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) but also facilitate efficient data center modernization.\n\nAt the heart of this SuperBlade® solution is unparalleled memory and storage flexibility. The system accommodates up to 24 DIMM slots per blade, supporting a maximum of 3TB of 6400MT/s DDR5 RDIMM or 1.5TB of 8800MT/s DDR5 MRDIMM — perfectly suited for memory-intensive applications. The robust storage options feature up to four PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSDs, two hot-swap E1.S SSDs, and two M.2 SSDs. The flexible PCIe expansion feature supports three PCIe 3.0 x16 cards – e.g., three 400G InfiniBand/Ethernet cards, or one 400G InfiniBand/Ethernet and two GPUs to provide acceleration for AI, HPC, and graphics-heavy workloads. Connectivity and acceleration further elevate SuperBlade capabilities, with two integrated 25G Ethernet switches with 100G uplinks in the back of the enclosure, ensuring reliable, high-speed networking while lowering the TCO through cable reduction.\n\nAbout Super Micro Computer, Inc.\nSupermicro (NASDAQ: SMCI) is a global leader in Application-Optimized Total IT Solutions.

      "Content": "Sleeping With the Enemy: Inside the NVIDIA-Intel Deal\n\nJeffrey Neal Johnson, MarketBeat\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 1:39 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nTSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points NVIDIA has validated Intel's manufacturing capabilities by securing a long-term agreement for advanced packaging capacity to meet global demand.\nThe new leadership at Intel has successfully improved manufacturing yields and implemented a strategy focused on operational efficiency and execution.\nGovernment support has firmly established Intel as a critical pillar of national infrastructure, driving the next generation of computing.\nInterested in Intel Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nFor over a decade, the semiconductor industry was defined by a rivalry between Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). One company dominated the Central Processing Unit (CPU) market that powered personal computers, while the other quietly built an empire in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for gaming and eventually artificial intelligence (AI). However, December 2025 marked the definitive end of that era of opposition. The geopolitical landscape of Silicon Valley was dramatically reshaped by a move that stunned Wall Street: NVIDIA finalized a $5 billion private placement investment in Intel, following regulatory approval for the deal.\nThis transaction is not a financial lifeline for a legacy giant that has struggled to find its footing; it represents a pragmatic armistice driven by the harsh realities of the AI supply chain. For investors, this deal fundamentally changes the risk profile of Intel stock.\n\n→ The Application-Layer Rotation: 3 AI Pure Plays Poised to Win in 2026\nThroughout 2024 and the first half of 2025, Intel traded at a significant discount due to bankruptcy risk. The company faced a perfect storm: removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the suspension of its dividend, and massive capital expenditures that drained its cash reserves. The stock price plummeted more than 50% from its historical highs as the market questioned whether the company could survive its own restructuring.\nNVIDIA’s capital injection answers that question definitively. By taking an equity stake, the world’s most valuable semiconductor company has signaled that Intel’s survival is necessary for the health of the entire industry. This creates a psychological and financial floor for Intel’s stock price, suggesting that the worst of the volatility may finally be in the rearview mirror.\n\n→ Why NVIDIA’s AI Power-Play Could Drive the Next Major Rally in 2026\nIt’s Not Charity, It’s Strategy To understand why this deal is a catalyst for Intel’s stock, investors must look past the headline dollar amount and focus on the underlying technology. NVIDIA did not invest $5 billion to own a piece of Intel’s legacy CPU business. It invested because it desperately needs Intel’s Advanced Packaging capacity.\n\nStory Continues\nIn early 2025, NVIDIA faced a crisis that threatened its growth trajectory. Its flagship Blackwell AI chips encountered thermal management issues; essentially, the chips were generating too much heat when packed tightly into data center racks. This problem was exacerbated by severe supply constraints at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC). TSMC struggled to expand its CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) capacity fast enough to meet global demand.\n\n→ The Lazy Way to Play NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal\nNVIDIA needed a release valve, and Intel was the only company with the infrastructure to provide it. Intel possesses two critical packaging technologies that solve these specific physical limitations:\nEMIB (Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge): This allows different chips to be connected side-by-side on a single flat package, speeding up data transfer.\nFoveros: This method stacks chips vertically, like pancakes, saving space and improving power efficiency.\nBy securing access to Intel’s packaging facilities in Arizona and Ohio, NVIDIA is hedging against future bottlenecks. For Intel shareholders, this is the ultimate proof of concept. If Intel’s manufacturing standards are rigorous enough to satisfy NVIDIA, the world's most demanding hardware client, it validates the quality of Intel Foundry Services (IFS) for the broader market. This endorsement is a marketing win, likely attracting other fabless chip designers who were previously hesitant to leave TSMC.\n\nThe Tan Turnaround: Data Over Hype While the NVIDIA deal provides the external validation, the fundamental recovery of Intel’s operations is being driven internally by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. Since taking the helm, Tan has shifted the company’s culture from one of technological optimism to data-driven realism.\nUnder the previous leadership regime, Intel often over-promised and under-delivered on its manufacturing milestones, eroding investor trust. Tan’s strategy, dubbed Radical Simplification, has focused on cutting bloated middle management and focusing entirely on factory execution.\n\nThe most critical metric for investors to watch is the yield rate, the percentage of functional chips produced on a silicon wafer. Poor yields burn cash; high yields print money.\nYield Improvement: On the critical 18A process node, yields have improved at a predictable rate of roughly 7% month-over-month throughout the latter half of 2025.\nCost Discipline: The company has successfully executed a massive cost-reduction plan, exiting low-margin businesses to preserve capital for manufacturing.\nFurthermore, the downside risk for the stock has been capped by the US government. In August 2025, the US Treasury finalized a 9.9% equity stake in Intel as part of the CHIPS Act stipulations. This is not free money; it comes with strict oversight on executive pay and stock buybacks. However, for a recovering company, this oversight is a positive factor. It ensures capital is spent on factories, not perks.\n\nBetween the US government (focused on national security) and NVIDIA (focused on supply chain security), Intel has secured two of the most powerful backers on the planet. This dual support structure drastically reduces the likelihood of a liquidity crisis.\nFrom Distressed Asset to Critical Infrastructure As we look toward 2026, the narrative for Intel has shifted from survival to utilization. The factories are built, the technology is validated, and the order book is beginning to fill. The upcoming Panther Lake consumer processors are set to ramp up production in early 2026, and NVIDIA’s packaging orders will start to significantly impact revenue shortly thereafter.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has bifurcated into a clear structure: NVIDIA designs the brains of the AI revolution, and Intel has pivoted to building the physical infrastructure required to produce them. By accepting its role as a service provider to its former rival, Intel has secured its future.\nFor investors, the current valuation represents a rare opportunity. The company has transitioned from a distressed asset with bankruptcy fears to a piece of critical infrastructure backed by the state and the industry leader. While the explosive, high-beta growth of the early AI boom may belong to NVIDIA, the steady, stabilized recovery trade belongs to Intel. With the armistice signed and the factory floors humming, the foundation for a long-term rebound is officially in place.\nThe article \" Sleeping With the Enemy: Inside the NVIDIA-Intel Deal \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The big one as I we were just talking about Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffett is out. We got P&G, Target, Walmart, Lulu Lemon, the list goes on.\n00:17 Speaker B\nWell, I think uh first of all, Warren Buffett, there's no one that can replace Warren and what he has done. He is a legend, he's done it for 60 years. But his principles are so basic that I think Greg A Abel is his successor, will carry them on, will not make major changes.\n00:42 Speaker B\nAnd I think Berkshire Hathaway's approach to investing uh will continue as it is. So I I'm optimistic about that. I think some of the uh biggest changes are going to come on the retail front.\n00:57 Speaker B\nYou see uh Walmart, uh I think Doug Mcmillan is one of the finest CEOs in the world today along with Satya Nadela at Microsoft and Jamie Diamond at City. and he's stepping down in February and John Furner's taking over.\n01:16 Speaker B\nAnd if you look at Furner, 30 years, like the ideal grooming he's been CEO of Sam's Club, he's been chief marketing officer, chief merchandising officer. He runs all the US operations.\n01:31 Speaker B\nAnd Walmart is very well positioned to continue to dominate retail including the online business. So obviously have strong competition from Amazon, but I think you'll see Walmart doing well.\n01:45 Speaker B\nThe biggest changes I predict are going to come in Target, which has had a disastrous year uh under Brian Cornell's last year. And I think under Michael Fidelki, uh he's going to return Target to its roots of competing on design and style and having unique offerings that are different from Walmart, more upscale.\n02:05 Speaker B\nCornell's taking them down a bit on a lower scale and abandoned a lot of things Target stood for when I was on the board. So I think you'll see Michael doing a terrific job in restoring uh Target. He like Furner knows the business has been in every aspect of it, and I think he'll do a very good job.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Last Call: Should You Load Up on Intel Stock Before 2025 Ends?\n\nTimothy Green, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 12:05 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nAAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nKey Points Intel stock soared in 2025.\nThe company hired a new CEO, slashed costs, and improved its balance sheet.\nLooking ahead, Intel will need to win foundry customers and overcome the impact of soaring memory chip prices.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nShares of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) soared nearly 90% in 2025 as a new CEO took the reins. The U.S. government, Nvidia , and SoftBank injected billions of dollars through equity investments, bolstering Intel's balance sheet , while layoffs and other cost-cutting measures reduced expenses.\nSeveral factors must align for Intel in 2026 for the stock to continue its rally, and the company will need to overcome a major headwind.\nFoundry, CPUs, and memory prices First and foremost, Intel needs to secure a major customer for its foundry business. Rumors have emerged that Apple is considering a version of the Intel 18A process, which would be a huge win if a deal can be worked out. Intel will also need to show tangible progress in securing customers for its upcoming Intel 14A process, which is scheduled for 2027.\n\nThose process nodes will also play a critical role in Intel's product business. Panther Lake and Nova Lake, two PC CPU families that will use the Intel 18A process, are set to launch in 2026. Intel has been losing market share to AMD for years, partly due to Intel's manufacturing edge evaporating. Intel's new manufacturing processes should at least close the gap with TSMC , AMD's manufacturing partner.\nWorking against Intel is the current state of the memory chip market. Memory chip prices are soaring as demand outstrips supply amid the AI boom, and there's little hope for relief anytime soon. This situation will push up the price of PCs, which could hurt demand and make it difficult for Intel's PC CPU business to grow in 2026.\n\nFor long-term investors, it's important to remember that the memory chip headwind is temporary. Intel's foundry represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, particularly as custom-designed chips proliferate. While Intel stock could go either way in 2026, when you zoom out, the picture looks promising.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

It's one of several big C-suite shake-ups in 2026.\n\nBrooke DiPalma · Senior Reporter\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 9:56 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TGT\n\nKO\n\nLULU\n\nWMT\n\nPEP\n\nInvesting legend and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is handing off the reins at the conglomerate he founded on Jan. 1, 2026.\nThe Oracle of Omaha is far from the only big-name executive moving away from the top spot next year, with the retail industry seeing a raft of notable shakeups at some of America's most recognizable brands.\n\nAt Walmart ( WMT ), Target ( TGT ), and Lululemon ( LULU ), among other consumer names, CEOs who have served for years are stepping down and making way for new executives.\n“The skill set required for the future is not the same as the past,” TD Cowen analyst Oliver Chen told Yahoo Finance .\nIn particular for retail, Chen added that there’s a growing need for supply chain expertise in light of President Trump’s tariffs, as well as a pulse on technology as Amazon and TikTok continue to change consumers' habits.\n“Retail is harder than ever; it is a fiercely competitive sector,\" Chen said.\nWalmart Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced in November that he will retire on Jan. 31, 2026.\nMcMillon has led the retail giant since Feb. 1, 2014. The company has reported more than four straight years of same-store sales growth.\nWalmart's market cap has risen from around $250 billion when McMillon took over to north of $800 billion today. Walmart's current US CEO, John Furner, will be the company's next CEO.\n\nTarget Target CEO Brian Cornell, who has served at the helm of the retailer for 11 years, will also retire on Feb. 1, 2026 .\nCornell's tenure has seen Target face more challenges than its larger rival, with flagging sales over the last several years resulting in sweeping executive changes at the company.\n\nCOO Michael Fiddelke, who has been with the company since 2003, will take over for Cornell, but he's already started reshaping the retailer.\nIn a memo in October, Fiddelke outlined Target's three key priorities: strengthening its retail leadership in style and design, the guest experience, and technology. That was alongside plans to eliminate 8% of corporate roles in the US. Analysts called the layoffs a necessary step in the turnaround attempt.\nThe pressure, though, is piling on Fiddelke even prior to his ascension: Activist investor Toms Capital Investment Management acquired a stake in the company last week.\nLululemon Athleisure retailer Lululemon is also getting a new CEO in 2026 . Who will take over at the top of the company remains to be seen.\nCEO Calvin McDonald joined the company in August of 2018, expanding the well-known yoga brand to other categories like running shoes and a more recent collaboration with the NFL .\n\nStory Continues\nThe company's CFO, Meghan Frank, and its chief commercial officer, André Maestrini, will serve as interim co-CEOs until a replacement for McDonald is named. Like Target, the company is also facing pressure from investors after a period of challenging sales and stock performance.\nElliott Investment Management took a $1 billion stake in the brand and is pushing for former Ralph Lauren executive Jane Nielsen to be at the helm. In late December, Lululemon founder Chip Wilson launched a proxy fight , nominating three candidates to join the board as the CEO search continues.\nMcDonald is set to leave the company at the end of January.\nOver the last five years, Lululemon stock is down almost 40%.\n\nCoca-Cola, P&G, and more The consumer leadership shakeup in 2026 will expand beyond big box retailers and one of the most notable apparel brands in the market.\nIn December, Coca-Cola ( KO ) announced that its CEO, James Quincey, would step down after nearly nine years running the company. Quincey will be replaced by the company's current COO, Henrique Braun, on March 31. During Quincey's tenure, Coke stock has outperformed rival PepsiCo ( PEP ) by about 40 percentage points.\nAt Procter & Gamble ( PG ), Shailesh Jejurikar will take over as CEO on Jan. 1 following a four-plus-year run from Jon Moeller. Jejurikar joined P&G in 1989.\nWhile Ramon Laguarta remains in PepsiCo's top role heading into 2026, the company in December announced several high-profile shifts among its leadership team, including the announcement of new CEOs for its North America and Latin America businesses. The shake-up followed its own settlement with Elliott Management , which will see PepsiCo look to clean up its product line and cut costs.\n\nIn the tech world, this year's leadership change at Intel ( INTC ) served as the most notable C-suite shift, with Lip-Bu Tan taking over after Pat Gelsinger was ousted in late 2024.\nAnd at Apple, while CEO Tim Cook remains in the top role, several of his key deputies were turned over during the second half of the year.\nBrooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The share price of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) fell around 3.54% on December 24, driven by Nvidia stopping the test run of Intel’s 18, which is a manufacturing process. The stock price has gained back 3.2% since the drop on Wednesday.\n\nIntel’s 18 is a process that makes chip-making more efficient and faster. According to a report by Bloomberg released on the same day, the investors are mainly concerned because this process, which Nvidia has halted, was expected to help Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The news has raised concerns regarding the company’s ability to push forward in this competition. Moreover, this halt comes despite Nvidia’s $5 billion investment in Intel.\nThat said, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has gained around 80% year-to-date, surpassing the S&P 500 and Nvidia’s performance. Recently, on December 22, Bank of America Securities upgraded the credit rating of the company to Overweight from Market Weight. The firm noted that the company’s lower exposure to the AI demand cycle can act as a protection from the broader AI investment overheating concerns.\n\nMoreover, the firm also raised its fiscal 2025 and 2026 EBITDA estimates by 20% and 18%. BofA sees the company’s leverage improving further in 2026, driven by improving balance sheets, strong AI-driven demand, and attractive valuation compared to its peers.\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services worldwide. It operates through Intel Products, Intel Foundry, and All Other segments.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Intel's Q4 2025 Earnings: What to Expect\n\nNeha Panjwani\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 4:55 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSanta Clara, California-based Intel Corporation (INTC) designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services worldwide. Valued at $175.2 billion by market cap, the company's major products include microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors and microcontrollers, flash memory, graphics, network and communication, systems management software, conferencing, and digital imaging products. The leading chipmaker is expected to announce its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings for 2025 in the near future.\n\nAhead of the event, analysts expect INTC to report a loss of $0.02 per share on a diluted basis, unchanged from the year-ago quarter. The company beat the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing the forecast on another occasion.\nMore News from Barchart Dear UiPath Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for January 2\nHow to Buy PYPL for a 29% Discount, or Achieve a 7% Annual Return\nApple is an Analyst Favorite, But AAPL Stock Has Been Flat - Shorting Puts Is the Best Play\nTired of missing midday reversals?

Meanwhile, its EPS is expected to rise 221.4% year over year to $0.17 in fiscal 2026.\nINTC stock has outperformed the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 16.8% gains over the past 52 weeks, with shares up 88.2% during this period. Similarly, it outperformed the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLK) 24% returns over the same time frame.\nOn Oct. 23, INTC shares closed up more than 3% after reporting its Q3 results. Its adjusted EPS of $0.23 beat Wall Street expectations of $0.01. The company’s revenue was $13.7 billion, exceeding Wall Street's $13.1 billion forecast. For Q4, INTC expects revenue in the range of $12.8 billion to $13.8 billion.\n\nAnalysts’ consensus opinion on INTC stock is cautious, with a “Hold” rating overall. Out of 42 analysts covering the stock, two advise a “Strong Buy” rating, one suggests a “Moderate Buy,” 33 give a “Hold,” one recommends a “Moderate Sell,” and five advocate a “Strong Sell.” While INTC currently trades above its mean price target of $36.74, the Street-high price target of $52 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 39.4%.\nOn the date of publication, Neha Panjwani did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Intel Stock Climbs on Strategic Nvidia Deal, Caps a Pivotal 2025\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 4:18 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nASYS\n\nNVDA\n\nIntel Corporation &rsquo;s INTC shares rose 1.7% on Tuesday, Dec. 30, amid broader market weakness, as investors responded to the completion of a high-profile investment that has been a defining theme for the chipmaker this year. The stock&rsquo;s rise on this day was driven by the recent finalization of NVIDIA Corporation &rsquo;s NVDA $5 billion purchase of Intel shares. This deal catalyzed renewed confidence in Intel&rsquo;s turnaround narrative and underscored deepening industry collaboration.\n\nIntel, part of the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, has had a transformative yet turbulent year. After years of lagging behind competitors in key growth areas such as AI accelerators and advanced manufacturing, the company&rsquo;s stock performance reflected its challenging journey. Earlier in the year, Intel&rsquo;s shares traded near multi-year lows as weaknesses in its core businesses and prolonged manufacturing delays weighed on sentiment. At various points, the stock had significantly underperformed its semiconductor peers, with substantial declines due to operational headwinds and skepticism about its ability to regain a competitive footing.\nThe narrative began to shift as Intel secured multiple capital infusions and strategic partnerships that aimed to provide both financial stability and technological relevance. Among the most notable was the announcement in September that Nvidia would invest in Intel, acquiring roughly 4% of its equity.\n\nBeyond the Nvidia deal, Intel also benefited from government support under the U.S. CHIPS Act and other funding commitments that bolstered its domestic manufacturing expansion. These developments were accompanied by progress in next-generation process technologies, including milestones toward competitive nodes and expanded foundry opportunities. Such catalysts, paired with cost discipline under new leadership, helped reshape investor expectations for the company&rsquo;s long-term prospects.\nINTC has risen 86% in 2025 and currently hovers around the $37 mark. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Amtech Systems, Inc. ASYS, a peer from the same industry, and NVDA have risen 132% and 39.7%, respectively, in the year. The industry in general has gained 37.1%. Both NVDA and ASYS currently sport a #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\n\nBottom Line As Intel heads into 2026, market attention remains focused on its ability to convert these strategic moves into tangible market share gains and sustainable growth, with the Nvidia alliance being one of the most closely watched elements of its evolving comeback story.\n\nStory Continues\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

BRK.B, AstraZeneca PLC AZN, Intel Corp. INTC, Kingsway Financial Services Inc. KFS and BK Technologies Corp. BKTI.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nTop Stock Reports for Berkshire Hathaway, AstraZeneca and Intel\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc., AstraZeneca PLC and Intel Corp., as well as two micro-cap stocks Kingsway Financial Services Inc. and BK Technologies Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility.\n\nContinued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The insurer has also started increasing its investment in Japan. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.\n\nHowever, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditures are still a headwind. Also, it remains to be seen how the behemoth fares when Greg Abel succeeds Warren Buffett as CEO of Berkshire.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>> )\n\nShares of AstraZeneca have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past six months (+33.3% vs. +28%). The company has a diverse product portfolio and a global footprint. Its key drugs like Lynparza, Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Farxiga and Fasenra should keep driving revenues, more than offsetting the loss of exclusivity of some mature brands.\n\nAstraZeneca&rsquo;s pipeline is strong, with pivotal pipeline data readouts lined up for 2026. It has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets. Backed by its new products and pipeline drugs, AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period.\n\nHowever, the impact of Part D redesign on U.S. oncology sales and the biosimilar/generic erosion of some key drugs have been key top-line headwinds in 2025.\n\n(You can read the full research report on AstraZeneca here >>> )\n\nIntel&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past six months (+63.7% vs. +17.3%). The company has received $5 billion in funding from NVIDIA to jointly develop cutting-edge solutions. It has also secured direct funding from the U.S. Department of Commerce for its commercial semiconductor manufacturing projects, which will likely pave the way for innovation and growth.\n\nIntel is undertaking various strategic decisions to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector. The Intel Core Ultra features a neural processing unit that enables power-efficient AI acceleration, with 2.5 times better power efficiency than the previous generation. Increasing complex AI workloads in data centers are driving demand for Intel Xeon 6 processors.\n\nHowever, the intensifying competition from AMD in the commercial PC market is hindering growth. High debt levels remain a concern. Growing U.S.-China geopolitical tensions are likely to impact its margins.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Intel here >>> )\n\nShares of Kingsway Financial have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+62.7% vs. +10.6%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $402.49 million is leveraging a large Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition (ETA) model opportunity as millions of Baby Boomer&ndash;owned small businesses seek succession. Its public structure, OIR model and focus on asset-light, non-cyclical businesses enable disciplined acquisitions, with six deals completed year to date versus three to five guided.\n\nKSX is scaling rapidly with strong revenue growth and emerging operating leverage as units exit J-curves, while Skilled Trades adds recurring, defensive cash flows. EBITDA run-rate is estimated to be $20.5 million&ndash;$22.5 million, supported by capital-light economics and net operating loss.\n\nNear-term margins remain pressured by acquisition ramp-up, overhead and GAAP distortion in Extended Warranty. Leverage, dilution, integration risk and plumbing concentration add risk, leaving valuation sensitive to execution.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Kingsway Financial here >>> )\n\nBK Technologies&rsquo; shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past six months (+59.7% vs. +14.6%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $278.09 million is positioned to expand its share in the $2.3 billion U.S. LMR market by targeting Tier 2 and Tier 3 public safety agencies with its P25-compliant BKR radio portfolio.\n\nThe strong adoption of the BKR 9000 and 5000 has driven double-digit revenue growth, rising federal demand and eight consecutive profitable quarters. Gross margins have expanded, driven by a favorable product mix and an asset-light manufacturing model, supporting scalable operating leverage. Early SaaS efforts via the BK ONE platform introduce long-term optionality, though monetization remains unproven.\n\nRisks include customer concentration, lumpy federal procurement cycles, software execution uncertainty, tariff exposure and the delayed BKR 9500 mobile launch. BKTI offers an attractive valuation relative to improving profitability, but execution consistency remains critical to sustaining upside.\n\n(You can read the full research report on BK Technologies here >>> )\n\nStory Continues\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Wall Street is almost unanimously bullish on the year ahead too.\nPowered by the artificial intelligence trade once again, the 2025 financial markets story might seem, on the surface, to be a rerun of what investors lived through in 2023 and 2024.\n\nShine a bit of light on the subject, however, and we see the inner workings of the market's path in 2025 spun an eventful story that won't soon be forgotten.\nDonald Trump was sworn in for a second term as president.\nThe largest company in the world lost nearly 20% of its value in a single day.\nThe S&P 500 registered its worst week since the COVID crash of 2020, crashing 10% in just two days.\nBitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hit a record high — then fell more than 30%.\nGold ( GC=F ) enjoyed its best year in two generations. The price of silver ( SI=F ) more than doubled .\nInvestors poured more than $150 billion into startups trying to ride the AI boom, while the big four hyperscalers — Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) — committed to investing over $300 billion this year in the opportunity.\n\nElon Musk's foray into government came and went, while Tesla ( TSLA ) stock ends the year near a record high and his rocket company SpaceX ( SPAX.PVT ) eyes an IPO that would value the company at $1.5 trillion in 2026 .\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took on celebrity status in the business world and beyond.\nAnd Warren Buffett will head to Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRK-B , BRK-A ) offices on Wednesday for his final day as CEO.\nWhat follows is a monthly overview of some of the biggest stories that shaped financial markets in 2025. Some are headlines we may have forgotten; others are those we never could. Let us know what we missed too.\nJanuary Jan. 20 — Donald Trump is sworn in for a second term as US president. His first hours in office see the president sign a series of executive orders , including the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which will bring Elon Musk to Washington, D.C., for the first few months of the year.\n\nAfter topping $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, bitcoin hits a record high above $109,000 in the hours before Trump's swearing in.\nJan. 21 — Joined by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI chief Sam Altman, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison in the Oval Office, Trump announces the $500 billion \"Stargate\" project to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nStory Continues\nJan. 23 — The S&P 500 closes at a record high , its first of the year, on Trump's third full day back in office.\nJan. 27 — Nvidia stock falls 17%, shedding nearly $600 billion in market value , as investors punish the chip giant after Chinese startup DeepSeek releases an AI model it says can rival those from OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) for a fraction of the cost. This sets of the first of many investor debates about the costs of the AI build-out, and brings the \" Jevons paradox \" to the attention of investors the world over.\n\nFebruary Feb. 1 — Trump's second trade war kicks off, with the president implementing tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China using authority granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). These tariffs will be delayed, altered, and face still-unresolved legal challenges throughout the year.",

      "Content": "2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 50% and 72% in 2026, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 1:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nINTC\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Some Wall Street analysts think shares of Palantir and Intel -- both of which were great investments in 2025 -- will decline sharply in 2026.\nPalantir is a recognized leader in artificial intelligence (AI) platforms and AI decisioning software, but it’s also the most expensive stock in the S&P 500 several times over.\nIntel has lost significant CPU market share in personal computers and data centers, and its revenue has declined 23% over the last three years despite the AI boom.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nIn 2025, Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) shares have added 145% and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) shares have added 88%. But certain Wall Street analysts expect the stocks to fall sharply in 2026, as detailed below:\nRishi Jaluria at RBC Capital has set Palantir Technologies with a target price of $50 per share. That implies 72% downside from its current share price of $183. Meanwhile, Brent Thill at Jefferies has set his target price at $70 per share. That implies 61% downside.\nJoseph Moore at Morgan Stanley has set Intel with a bear-case target price of $19 per share. That implies 50% downside from its current share price of $38. Meanwhile, Matt Bryson at Wedbush has set his target price at $20 per share. That implies 47% downside.\nHere's what investors should know about Palantir and Intel.\nPalantir Technologies: 72% downside implied by RBC Capital's target price Palantir develops analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) software that helps clients in the public and private sectors manage and make sense of complex data. Forrester Research has recognized the company as a leader in AI platforms and AI decisioning software, and International Data Corporation (IDC) has ranked Palantir as a leader in decision intelligence software.\n\nPalantir's revenue growth has accelerated in nine straight quarters, and the company's guidance suggests that trend could continue in the next quarter. Keith Weiss at Morgan Stanley recently commented, \"It's hard to find a better fundamental story in software than Palantir.\" But no company -- not even the most fundamentally sound company -- is worth buying at any price.\nPalantir currently trades at 115 times sales, making it more than twice as expensive as the next closest stock in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) , which is AppLovin at 44 times sales. For context, Palantir could lose 60% of its value and still be the most expensive stock in the index. That premium is unsustainable. No software company has ever maintained a price-to-sales ratio above 100 indefinitely.\n\nStory Continues\nTo be clear, Palantir shares may keep moving higher in the near term in the absence of bad news, but the stock would almost certainly crash if a sufficiently negative catalyst arises. Investors should either avoid Palantir or at least keep their positions very small. The risk-reward profile is heavily skewed toward risk.\n\nIntel: 50% downside implied by Morgan Stanley's bear-case target price Intel is the largest supplier of central processing units (CPUs) for personal computers and data center servers, meaning the company should theoretically be at the very center of the artificial intelligence boom. However, repeated missteps and manufacturing delays have left Intel behind competitors like TSMC in terms of process technology (i.e., chip manufacturing technology).\n\nMeanwhile, AMD and Arm Holdings have built increasingly powerful chips using the most advanced process nodes. Also, several hyperscalers have adopted Arm processors because they can be built to custom specifications. In turn, AMD and Arm have won substantial market share at Intel's expense in personal computers and data center servers. For context, Intel's unit share has fallen more than 35% in both markets in the past decade.\nIn 2021, Intel launched its foundry business (i.e., contract chip manufacturing) as a means of capitalizing on rising demand for advanced semiconductors. The company initially set an ambitious goal of surpassing Samsung to become the second-largest foundry by 2030, but that seems wildly optimistic at this point. Intel reportedly has just one major customer for its fledgling foundry business.\n\nOf course, bulls frequently claim Intel is on the cusp of a turnaround, but it's hard to justify that argument: Intel continues to cede market share, its foundry business has failed to win major customers, and sales actually dropped 23% in the last three years despite booming demand for AI processors. Also, Wall Street expects no sales growth in the next year.\nMeanwhile, Intel trades at 2.7 times sales, a material premium to the three-year average of 2.2 times sales. That may have something to do with the U.S. government taking a stake in the company, but that doesn't actually fix the underlying problems.\nI doubt shares will drop 50%, but the stock does not look attractive. I think investors should put their money elsewhere.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?

      "Content": "Intel Investors Just Got Great News for 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 5:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points A report states that Intel's 18A process node and production capacity could help it challenge Taiwan Semiconductor's lead in 2026.\nThe chipmaker has had healthy demand for its data center products, and it is ready to fulfill more orders in the new year thanks to its Arizona factory.\nIntel's earnings are expected to grow over the next couple of years, paving the way for potentially more upside.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\n\nInvestors in Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) will look back at 2025 with satisfaction, as the chip giant finally stepped on the gas after years of underperformance.\nThe stock has shot up 80% in 2025, with a significant chunk of its gains coming in the back half of the year thanks to a slew of favorable developments. Substantial investments by the U.S. government and SoftBank have given the company a cushion as it works on a turnaround. And Nvidia 's strategic partnership and $5 billion investment in Intel's shares have further strengthened its balance sheet.\nNow, there is another piece of good news that could help Intel stock get off to a strong start in 2026. Let's take a closer look.\nIntel could give TSMC a run for its money Intel has fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in recent years. It has been hamstrung by delays in the development of its advanced process nodes, allowing Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC for short) to pull ahead with its technology and establish a significantly strong customer base. As a result, Intel has been losing share in markets where it has been historically strong -- server and client central processing units (CPUs) -- and has missed the artificial intelligence (AI) gravy train.\n\nWith TSMC all set to move to a new process node in 2026, Intel needs to step up its game in the new year. The Taiwan company's 3-nanometer (nm) process node has been a huge hit among customers, thanks to its performance advantages and higher power efficiency when compared to what its competitors offer. The 3nm node has been used by Apple , Nvidia, AMD , and others to make chips for various applications.\nTSMC's 2nm process node, which is all set to go into mass production in 2026, is reportedly 15% more powerful and 35% more energy efficient when compared to the 3nm node. Intel, however, has an ace up its sleeve with its 18A process. Tom's Hardware, a website for tech news, reports that Intel's Fab 52 facility in Arizona is \"bigger and better equipped\" versus TSMC's Arizona operation.\n\nIntel reportedly has a production capacity of 10,000 wafer starts per month (WSPM) at that manufacturing site, and it could quadruple that number once it fully ramps up the factory's output. The company has equipped its latest Arizona fab with ASML 's most advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. On the other hand, TSMC's Arizona facility is likely to have a capacity of 20,000 WSPM once it is fully up and running with 3nm chips.\n\nStory Continues\nAlso, Intel's 18A process is reportedly superior to both TSMC's and Samsung 's equivalent process nodes in terms of performance, according to third-party estimates. Given that Intel has already started mass production of its most advanced chips in Arizona and is expected to significantly raise capacity at one part of that factory in 2026, the company should be able to meet the fast-growing demand for those chips.\n\nManagement said on its October earnings conference call that it was supply constrained and was unable to fully meet third-quarter demand. As the company increases the output of its most advanced process node, it should be able to fulfill more orders and experience stronger growth in its revenue and earnings.\nThe stock can deliver more gains in the new year The chipmaker's 12-month median price target of $40 translates to potential upside of 10% in the next year. It is easy to see why analysts are expecting limited gains from Intel in 2026 following its stellar performance this year.\nThe stock has become expensive following its recent run, trading at 606 times trailing earnings. The forward earnings multiple of 62, though significantly lower than the trailing multiple, is still on the expensive side. However, the rapid growth in Intel's earnings, driven by its cost optimization efforts, justifies the valuation.\nThe company is expected to post an adjusted profit of $0.34 per share in 2025 as compared to a loss of $0.13 per share in 2024. And it is projected to clock strong earnings growth over the next couple of years as well.\nWith new catalysts such as its partnership with Nvidia and the 18A node ramp-up, this semiconductor stock could continue to climb higher in 2026 and produce bigger gains than its 12-month median price target suggests.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?

      "Content": "Intel (INTC) Increases Despite Market Slip: Here's What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nIntel (INTC) closed the most recent trading day at $37.30, moving +1.69% from the previous trading session. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.14%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.24%.\nThe world's largest chipmaker's shares have seen a decrease of 8.32% over the last month, not keeping up with the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.2% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.94%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Intel will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $0.08, reflecting a 38.46% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $13.38 billion, down 6.2% from the year-ago period.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $0.34 per share and a revenue of $52.4 billion, signifying shifts of +361.54% and -1.32%, respectively, from the last year.\nIt's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Intel. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 11.98% higher within the past month. Right now, Intel possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn terms of valuation, Intel is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 108.68. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 34.67, so one might conclude that Intel is trading at a premium comparatively.\n\nIt's also important to note that INTC currently trades at a PEG ratio of 11.71. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. INTC's industry had an average PEG ratio of 3.99 as of yesterday's close.\nThe Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 31, finds itself in the top 13% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

      "Content": "Nvidia makes good on a key 2025 promise\n\nVuk Zdinjak\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 2:25 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nINTC\n\nNvidia ’s stock gained about 40% this year, and the company set many new projects in motion that will keep the company at the top of the artificial intelligence boom. I have analyzed the company’s long-term plans in my “ What’s next for Nvidia stock in 2026 ” article, thinking that I was done writing about the company in 2025.\n\nHowever, I was wrong, and the 8-K filing by Intel from 29 December brings more good news for Nvidia investors.\nAccording to the filing, Nvidia completed its investment in Intel for $5.0 billion, at a price per share of $23.28. Considering that Intel closed the Monday trading session at $36.68, that investment is currently a big win.\nHere's why I think Nvidia’s collaboration and investment in Intel was a vital move for the company, and what investors can expect from it.\nWhy did Nvidia invest in Intel? Nvidia’s ( NVDA ) long-term plan was to dominate all of “compute”. When the company failed to acquire ARM due to regulatory hurdles, it had to go back to the drawing board and figure out a different approach to accomplish that goal. The company’s attempt to solve this roadblock was to team up with MediaTek for the design of its ARM cores, which became part of its superchips. This worked out well for superchips, but not so great for anything that would go into consumer-oriented devices.\n\nThe long-rumored laptop chip has been delayed until late 2026, as reported by Tom's guide . While Nvidia was dealing with delays, Qualcomm launched its Snapdragon X chips for PCs, and they haven’t managed to capture any significant market share due to the lackluster experience offered by Windows on ARM (ARM), despite the AI PCs branding and Copilot promotion.\nThis sent a clear signal to Nvidia that going after the laptop market with ARM is a losing proposition. Nvidia needed x86 to win. Getting a license for x86 from Intel ( INTC ) and AMD was never going to happen.\nYes, you read that right: Nvidia would need to secure licenses from both companies. AMD actually won the architecture race many years ago when it designed the 64-bit x86 architecture. Intel and AMD have cross-licensing architecture agreements, where Intel provides AMD with the original x86 architecture license, and AMD provides Intel with the AMD64 license.\n\nRelated: Veteran analyst has blunt message on Intel stock\nLeft with no options, Nvidia began working with Intel in secret as early as 2024, well before the investment deal was announced, as reported by Tom’s Hardware .\nWhen Nvidia decided to invest in Intel, it had good reasons to do so: Since it had been working with Intel for about a year, helping Intel stay afloat was necessary for its long-term plans.\nIntel is working on a very promising manufacturing process (node), 14A, which has the potential to be a superior process. This investment will enable Nvidia to become Intel's preferred customer in its fabs, and being the first to access the best node is a significant advantage.\nA complete acquisition would have been blocked , like the ARM one. And as an accidental bonus, as the US government has invested $8.9 billion in Intel , by also investing in it, Nvidia is putting itself in good graces of President Donald Trump by following his lead.\n\nRelated: History of Nvidia: Company timeline and facts\nWhat can we expect from Intel and Nvidia's collaboration? The primary focus of the collaboration is to enable Intel’s CPUs to work with NVLink . This will result in Intel’s custom-built CPUs for Nvidia to be used in data centers - superchips, but with Intel instead of Mediatek.\n“Intel’s leading data center and client computing platforms, combined with our process technology, manufacturing, and advanced packaging capabilities, will complement NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing leadership to enable new breakthroughs for the industry,\" said Lip-Bu Tan , CEO of Intel .\n\nThe companies are also working on system-on-chips (SOCs) that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets .\n“There are 150 million laptops sold per year. We’re now creating a system-on-a-chip that fuses two processors into one giant SoC, and that will become a new class of integrated laptops that the world has never seen before,” said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang , as reported by Wired .\nMore Nvidia:\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nJim Cramer issues blunt 5-word verdict on Nvidia stock\nThis is how Nvidia keeps customers from switching\nBank of America makes a surprise call on Nvidia-backed stock\nThe planned chips and integrations are expected to take approximately 3 to 4 years to materialize. Since the companies began working in 2024, the best-case scenario would be for the first chips to launch in late 2027.\n\nAccording to Notebookcheck.net , leaks indicate that the first chip, part of the collaboration that will launch, is Serpent Lake and will feature an RTX Rubin integrated GPU.\nThis collaboration will, over time, enable more flexibility for Nvidia. When the collaboration began, it was likely too late to redesign the Feynman chips to use Intel cores instead of MediaTek cores, but we can expect the next generation after Feynman to be based on Intel. In turn, this will enable smaller superchips, such as GB10 , to be launched, but with Intel CPU cores. This will, in turn, give us the opportunity to buy small devices that can run state-of-the-art AI models, but can also run any “normal” software without issue, including games.\nThere is one dark side of this deal that I see as a consumer, and that is that Intel may slowly abandon its own GPU development efforts. If that happens, consumers are left with a duopoly of Nvidia and AMD, which is never good; it slows the pace of progress and keeps prices high.\n\nWhat are the analyst ratings for Nvidia? Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a buy rating and the target price of $275 for Nvidia stock in his research note from December 29, which was shared with me. The target price is based on 28 times his earnings estimate (price-to-earnings ratio), excluding cash for calendar year 2027, which falls within Nvidia’s historical forward-year P/E ratio range of 25 to 56.\n\nVeteran analyst Stephen Guilfoyle recently raised the price target for Nvidia stock to $235, in his article on TheStreet Pro .\nCantor Fitzgerald ranks Nvidia a top pick, with a $300 target price .\nAs for Intel, Bank of America upped its price target to $40 from $34 on December 16, citing potential for advanced packaging or wafer design wins at Intel Foundry.\nRelated: What’s next for Nvidia stock in 2026\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 30, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "As Nvidia Reportedly Snubs the Intel 18A Process, How Should You Play INTC Stock for 2026?\n\nJabran Kundi\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 12:21 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nINTC\n\nIntel’s (INTC) turnaround and manufacturing ambitions were dealt a severe blow when Nvidia (NVDA) decided to halt its trial of the 18A manufacturing technology. Touted as the technology that will help Intel turn its business around, the 18A is a 2 nm chip technology that offers superior power efficiency and chip density. Nvidia’s involvement was taken as a positive signal by many, but that optimism has faded away since this announcement.\n\nThe timing of this news is interesting in the context of Nvidia’s $5 billion investment in the company back in September. Having the backing of the largest chip designer in the world was considered a vital part of Intel’s recovery. However, investors are now finding out that this was possibly a purely financial decision, and there were no guarantees that Nvidia would either help in or promise to utilize Intel’s technologies for its manufacturing. As things stand, NVDA is clearly looking at alternatives.\nMore News from Barchart Micron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMicron Stock Stole the Show in 2025.

Unless it can figure out the answer quickly, a revival would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.\nAbout Intel Stock Intel is a leading semiconductor company that not only designs but also manufactures semiconductor chips for PCs, data centers, and other computing applications. It was founded in 1968 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.\nIntel’s stock has lost almost 18% of its value since early December, when it hit a 52-week high of $44.01. However, its YTD performance of 87% comfortably outperformed the PHLX Semiconductor Index’s 44.7% performance. Much of this happened on the back of the support provided by President Donald Trump and the U.S. government, which boosted investor confidence.\nDespite the poor stock performance in November, Intel stock is still pricing in a lot of future success and therefore looks overvalued. It continues to trade at a non-GAAP forward P/E of 106.48x, which is more than its own 5-year average of 48.17x. The company’s TTM price-to-book value ratio is nearly the same as the 5-year average of 1.63x, though. In fact, it is less than half the sector’s average, which means the stock is trading at a considerable discount to its peers. In the absence of a dividend, INTC stock still seems a risky bet, especially considering how Nvidia just pulled out of a manufacturing node that was a major part of Intel’s recovery plan.\n\nStory Continues\nIntel’s Revenue Surprised Analysts in Q3 Intel announced its Q3 2025 earnings report on Oct. 23 and surprised investors with a better-than-forecast sales number. The revenue of $13.65 billion comfortably beat estimates of $13.14 billion. In the ongoing quarter, Intel expects $13.3 billion in revenue, with an EPS of $0.08.\nOne of the most noticeable improvements in the company’s finances in Q3 was the cash flow strength. Intel was able to secure an $8.9 billion investment from the U.S. government. Another $2 billion from SoftBank (SFTBY) and a promise of $5 billion investment from Nvidia made it a great quarter for Intel in terms of cash flow. The $5 billion investment was confirmed earlier on Monday, though investors would have loved to receive it with more positive news on the 18A manufacturing front.\n\nWhat Analysts Are Saying About INTC Stock INTC is covered by 42 analysts on Wall Street. The negative sentiment around the stock continues to persist with five “Strong Sell” ratings. This is rare for semiconductor stocks, which usually tend to have no sell ratings thanks to the high-growth rates of associated technologies and industries. But Intel continues to be an exception; that’s how bad things have been for the company. The lowest price target of $20 could see the stock go to the same levels as before Donald Trump took over. The highest price target of $52 offers 44% upside, though it is quite possible investors and analysts reconsider their opinions in the coming days.\nOn the date of publication, Jabran Kundi did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Why Intel (INTC) Stock Is Up Today\n\nPetr Huřťák\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 11:15 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nWhat Happened? Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 3% in the afternoon session after the company confirmed that rival chipmaker Nvidia completed a previously announced $5 billion investment.\nThe deal, which was finalized through a regulatory filing, involved Nvidia purchasing approximately 214.8 million Intel shares at $23.28 each. This purchase gave Nvidia a stake of about 4.4% in the company. The investment provided crucial funding for Intel's turnaround efforts. The agreement also included a technology partnership, with both companies planning to co-develop advanced chips for data centers and personal computers. This collaboration aimed to combine Intel's custom processors with Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chips to create faster and more efficient systems.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $37.69, up 2.8% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Intel? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Intel’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 37 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 11 days ago when the stock gained 3.2% on the news that investor optimism around artificial intelligence fueled broad market gains.\n\nTechnology stocks with a focus on artificial intelligence once again led the market higher, boosting the Nasdaq and S&P 500. Companies at the forefront of the AI boom, such as Nvidia and Broadcom, saw significant jumps in their share prices. The rally reflects a renewed belief among investors in the transformative potential of AI technology to drive future growth and productivity. The rally was further supported by a surprise cooling in the November consumer price index (CPI) report, which triggered market pricing for additional rate cuts in the coming year. This created a more favorable environment for growth-oriented companies.\nIntel is up 86.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $37.69 per share, it is still trading 13.9% below its 52-week high of $43.76 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $773.03.\nThe 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) and Intel Corp. (INTC), as well as two micro-cap stocks Kingsway Financial Services Inc. (KFS) and BK Technologies Corp. (BKTI). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\n\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\n\nYou can see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here >>>\n\nAhead of Wall Street\n\nThe daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action. The article comes out before the market opens, attempting to make sense of that morning's economic releases and how they will affect that day's market action.

The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility.\n\nContinued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The insurer has also started increasing its investment in Japan. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.\n\nHowever, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditures are still a headwind. Also, it remains to be seen how the behemoth fares when Greg Abel succeeds Warren Buffett as CEO of Berkshire.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>> )\n\nShares of AstraZeneca have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past six months (+33.3% vs. +28%). The company has a diverse product portfolio and a global footprint. Its key drugs like Lynparza, Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Farxiga and Fasenra should keep driving revenues, more than offsetting the loss of exclusivity of some mature brands.\n\nAstraZeneca&rsquo;s pipeline is strong, with pivotal pipeline data readouts lined up for 2026. It has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets. Backed by its new products and pipeline drugs, AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period.\n\nHowever, the impact of Part D redesign on U.S. oncology sales and the biosimilar/generic erosion of some key drugs have been key top-line headwinds in 2025.\n\n(You can read the full research report on AstraZeneca here >>> )\n\nIntel&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past six months (+63.7% vs. +17.3%). The company has received $5 billion in funding from NVIDIA to jointly develop cutting-edge solutions. It has also secured direct funding from the U.S. Department of Commerce for its commercial semiconductor manufacturing projects, which will likely pave the way for innovation and growth.\n\nIntel is undertaking various strategic decisions to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector. The Intel Core Ultra features a neural processing unit that enables power-efficient AI acceleration, with 2.5 times better power efficiency than the previous generation. Increasing complex AI workloads in data centers are driving demand for Intel Xeon 6 processors.\n\nHowever, the intensifying competition from AMD in the commercial PC market is hindering growth. High debt levels remain a concern. Growing U.S.-China geopolitical tensions are likely to impact its margins.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Intel here >>> )\n\nShares of Kingsway Financial have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past year (+62.7% vs. +10.6%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $402.49 million is leveraging a large Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition (ETA) model opportunity as millions of Baby Boomer&ndash;owned small businesses seek succession. Its public structure, OIR model and focus on asset-light, non-cyclical businesses enable disciplined acquisitions, with six deals completed year to date versus three to five guided.\n\nKSX is scaling rapidly with strong revenue growth and emerging operating leverage as units exit J-curves, while Skilled Trades adds recurring, defensive cash flows. EBITDA run-rate is estimated to be $20.5 million&ndash;$22.5 million, supported by capital-light economics and net operating loss.\n\nNear-term margins remain pressured by acquisition ramp-up, overhead and GAAP distortion in Extended Warranty. Leverage, dilution, integration risk and plumbing concentration add risk, leaving valuation sensitive to execution.\n\n(You can read the full research report on Kingsway Financial here >>> )\n\nBK Technologies&rsquo; shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past six months (+59.7% vs. +14.6%). This microcap company with a market capitalization of $278.09 million is positioned to expand its share in the $2.3 billion U.S. LMR market by targeting Tier 2 and Tier 3 public safety agencies with its P25-compliant BKR radio portfolio.\n\nThe strong adoption of the BKR 9000 and 5000 has driven double-digit revenue growth, rising federal demand and eight consecutive profitable quarters. Gross margins have expanded, driven by a favorable product mix and an asset-light manufacturing model, supporting scalable operating leverage. Early SaaS efforts via the BK ONE platform introduce long-term optionality, though monetization remains unproven.\n\nRisks include customer concentration, lumpy federal procurement cycles, software execution uncertainty, tariff exposure and the delayed BKR 9500 mobile launch. BKTI offers an attractive valuation relative to improving profitability, but execution consistency remains critical to sustaining upside.\n\n(You can read the full research report on BK Technologies here >>> )\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Datadog, Inc.

Sign up now!\nAt the time of writing, Nvidia stock is up roughly 120% versus its year-to-date low set in early April.\nMizuho Explains Why Groq Deal Is Bullish for Nvidia Stock According to Vijay Rakesh – a senior Mizuho analyst – the non-exclusive licensing deal with Groq will prove a meaningful “benefit for NVDA shares in the long run.”\nThe transaction enables Nvidia to assert its prowess in AI inference, which is expected to make up as much as 80% of workloads over time.\n\nOn Monday, Rakesh maintained an “Outperform” rating on the Nasdaq-listed giant. His $245 price target indicates potential for another 32% upside from here.\nFrom a technical perspective, the AI stock is currently trading decisively above its major moving averages (MAs), reinforcing that the bullish momentum will likely sustain in 2026.\nWhy Groq Deal May Unlock Further Upside in NVDA Shares What’s also worth mentioning is that the $20 billion price tag on the Groq deal, while huge on the surface, is peanuts compared to Nvidia’s market cap.\nThis means the associated risk – both executional and to the giant’s balance sheet – is rather small.\nFor NVDA, it’s more like a “bolt-on” acquisition that strengthens its footprint in AI inference at a minimal financial risk. As Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon put it in a recent CNBC interview:\n\n“They can do a $20 billion deal on Christmas Eve with no press release, and nobody bats an eye.”\nAll in all, acquiring Groq’s assets and talent positions Nvidia shares to widen the gap with rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC).\nWhat’s the Consensus Rating on Nvidia? Note that Mizuho isn’t the only Wall Street firm that’s recommending sticking with NVDA stock heading into 2026.\nIn fact, the consensus rating on Nvidia shares remains at “Strong Buy” with the mean target of $256 indicating potential upside of more than 35% from current levels.\n\nLeer más\nOn the date of publication, Wajeeh Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The announcement finalizes a deal first announced in September that positions the world's most valuable company as a roughly 4% stakeholder in its struggling rival.\n\nThe AI chip leader purchased over 214.7 million Intel shares at $23.28 apiece in a private placement, a price that now sits 36% below Intel's recent trading levels, according to the filing.\nMore News from Barchart Micron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMicron Stock Stole the Show in 2025.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nThe transaction, which received regulatory clearance from the Federal Trade Commission earlier this month, could serve as a major financial lifeline for Intel after years of missteps and capital-intensive manufacturing expansions that have drained its resources.\nThe companies announced they will collaborate on multiple generations of custom data center and PC products, including Nvidia-designed x86 CPUs for AI infrastructure and system-on-chips combining Intel CPU cores with Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets.\n\nHowever, neither chipmaker has committed to moving Nvidia's crown-jewel GPU production away from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to Intel's contract manufacturing services.\nIs Intel Stock a Good Buy Right Now? Valued at a market cap of $175 billion, INTC stock has returned almost 90% in 2025. Despite strong demand for its legacy chip, Intel is wrestling with manufacturing bottlenecks. Intel is undershipping its 10 nm and 7 nm chips for the personal computer and server markets right now. These products still account for the bulk of Intel’s production volume.\n\nCFO John Pitzer acknowledged that supply constraints could peak in Q1 of 2026 and ease gradually over the next few months. However, it suggests that Intel is unlikely to meet demand even beyond Q1. The silver lining is that server shortages are actually worse than PC shortages, as servers carry better margins.\nMultiple factors are driving server demand for Intel:\nFirst, hyperscalers spent the last few years focused on AI infrastructure buildouts while delaying refreshes of their existing server fleets.\nSecond, these same companies are now severely power-constrained, and replacing a five-year-old server with a new one delivers 80 percent better power efficiency.\nThird, and most intriguing, the shift from large language model training to agentic AI appears to be putting unexpected demand on traditional computing infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the technology front, Intel's 18A node is advancing but remains a work in progress. The company shipped its first Panther Lake chip on schedule by year-end, though yields aren't in line with expectations.\nNew CEO Lip-Bu Tan has brought significant cultural changes since joining in March. The organization has been flattened from 11 or 12 management layers down to just five or six. Engineers now sit on the executive staff and are required to participate in customer conversations. The company has also implemented a return-to-office policy with employees back in the office four days per week.\n\nWhat Is the INTC Stock Price Target? Analysts tracking INTC stock forecast revenue to increase from $52.55 billion in 2025 to $74 billion in 2029. Investors are concerned about narrowing gross margins driven by early 18A ramp costs and pricing actions on newer products to manage tight supply. However, the company is projected to improve adjusted earnings per share from $0.34 in 2025 to $2.84 in 2030.\n\nAs Intel continues to invest in capital expenditures, its free cash outflow is expected to total $11 billion between 2025 and 2026. Notably, free cash flow is likely to improve from $640 million in 2027 to $4.32 billion in 2029. If INTC stock trades at 25x forward earnings, which is in line with its 10-year average, it could return 100% over the next three years.\nOut of the 42 analysts covering INTC stock, two recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” 33 recommend “Hold,” one recommends “Moderate Sell,” and five recommend “Strong Sell.”\nThe average INTC stock price target is $36.74, which is similar to the current price.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Can Intel's Investment-Driven Strategy Regain Its Competitive Edge?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 7:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nQCOM\n\nAMD\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nIntel Corporation ( INTC ) has completed a previously announced $5 billion investment from NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ), under which the latter purchased around 214.7 million shares of the former at $23.28 per share. Earlier in December, this transaction received U.S. antitrust approval from the Federal Trade Commission. This purchase gives NVIDIA roughly a 4% equity stake in Intel through a private placement of shares.\n\nThe partnership aims to tightly combine Intel’s custom-designed x86 CPUs with NVIDIA’s AI GPUs and NVLink interconnect technology to create faster, more efficient AI systems and next-generation PCs with stronger AI and graphics performance. This could help Intel remain competitive in the AI era.\nIntel had also secured $8.9 billion in funds from the U.S. government to support semiconductor manufacturing and packaging projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon in order to boost the domestic chip industry. SoftBank has also invested $2 billion, providing funds to support Intel’s restructuring and AI projects.\nIntel is constantly making efforts to bring huge investments to strengthen its balance sheet, supporting heavy spending on new factories and R&D, boosting market confidence and enabling deeper technology collaboration with firms like NVIDIA.\n\nHow Are Rivals Performing? Intel faces competition from Qualcomm Incorporated ( QCOM ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). Qualcomm recently completed its $2.4 billion acquisition of British semiconductor company Alphawave Semi to strengthen its AI, data center and high-speed connectivity technologies, boosting its competitiveness beyond smartphones. By strengthening its PC chip offerings through programs like Snapdragon X, Qualcomm can expand into new markets such as AI infrastructure, edge computing and personal computers. Qualcomm entered the AI infrastructure space by developing AI accelerators like AI200 & AI250.\n\nAMD is set to launch high-performance AI GPUs, EPYC server CPUs and full AI systems like Helios to compete with NVIDIA and provide faster, more efficient solutions for data centers and enterprises. AMD is partnering with companies like OpenAI and Oracle to expand across gaming, PCs and servers to increase revenues and stay competitive. The company continues to improve its ROCm open software stack and open hardware standards.\nINTC’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of Intel have surged 85% over the past year compared with the industry ’s growth of 34.1%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGoing by the price/book ratio, the company's shares currently trade at 1.5 book value, lower than 32.5 of the industry average.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nINTC’s earnings estimates for 2025 have increased 6.3% to 34 cents per share, while those for 2026 have declined 6.5% to 58 cents over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIntel stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "Content": "This Could Derail Intel's Comeback in 2026\n\nTimothy Green, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:25 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nAMD\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Intel has a strong PC roadmap for 2026, including Panther Lake and Nova Lake.\nBoth CPU families will use the cutting-edge Intel 18A manufacturing process.\nSoaring memory chip prices could force PC price hikes and limit Intel's comeback in the PC market.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nOne of the issues plaguing Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) over the past few years has been an erosion of its PC CPU market share. Past manufacturing delays forced the company to use aging process nodes while rival AMD tapped TSMC 's top-tier manufacturing technology. Intel later outsourced manufacturing for its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, but the latter was a mixed bag that rubbed reviewers and consumers the wrong way.\nAgainst this backdrop, Intel's share of the desktop and laptop CPU market has tumbled. Intel remains the market leader, but AMD controlled approximately one-third of the desktop CPU market and more than one-fifth of the laptop CPU market in the third quarter. A decade ago, this kind of progress from AMD would have been unthinkable.\n\nIn 2026, Intel could regain some of the lost market share. Panther Lake for laptops and Nova Lake for desktops look promising, and both will be built on the new Intel 18A process node. However, soaring memory chip prices will likely increase PC prices and potentially dampen demand.\nIntel's 2026 roadmap shows promise Panther Lake will be the first mass-produced chip to be manufactured using the Intel 18A process, and it is expected to begin shipping in volume in early 2026. Intel 18A moves Intel to a new type of transistor and introduces backside power delivery, a technology that can boost efficiency by moving power circuitry to the back of the chip. The Intel 18A process is the first in the industry to implement backside power delivery.\n\nNova Lake will come later in 2026 for desktops, succeeding the troubled Arrow Lake family. In the meantime, the company is rumored to be launching a refresh of Arrow Lake, although the core problems with Arrow Lake are likely to remain unresolved until Nova Lake arrives. While Nova Lake's specifications are still unclear, rumors suggest high core counts and large amounts of cache for some models, which could better compete with AMD's 3D V-Cache chips.\nLaunching a new architecture on a new process node is always a challenge, but if Panther Lake and Nova Lake deliver solid improvements in performance and efficiency, they could be big winners for Intel.\nMemory prices could be a major problem Unfortunately for Intel, its Panther Lake and Nova Lake launches coincide with a severe and escalating shortage of DRAM memory. AI data centers need both high-bandwidth memory and standard DRAM memory in copious quantities. Memory chip manufacturers have been shifting production to HBM chips while being cautious about expanding overall production, creating a shortage of DRAM chips.\n\nStory Continues\nPC prices are almost certain to rise in 2026 as OEMs grapple with rising component costs. Dell is reportedly raising commercial PC prices by 10% to 30% in response to the memory chip crisis, a move that will likely be followed by other OEMs. Businesses could slow down upgrade plans in response. On the consumer side, higher prices and configurations with less memory are likely to be the prevailing themes in 2026.\n\nBeyond the potential for higher prices to hurt overall demand for PCs, lower memory configurations could hurt Intel's AI PC push. Panther Lake laptops will feature greater AI processing power than their predecessors, but a lack of memory could hinder usability. Microsoft requires at least 16 GB of RAM for a laptop to be labeled a Copilot+ PC, for example, because AI applications require significant amounts of memory.\nSoaring memory chip prices put Intel in a tough spot. Even if Panther Lake and Nova Lake are home runs, delivering performance and efficiency that top AMD, high PC prices could spoil the party. AMD is also impacted, so Intel won't be at a relative disadvantage and could still win market share. However, the size of the market could temporarily shrink as businesses and consumers resist price increases.\n\nWith memory chip production unlikely to increase meaningfully anytime soon, and with the AI boom still going strong, Intel's PC comeback in 2026 may be weaker than it could have otherwise been.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia officially invests $5B in Intel: What's next for the chip giant?\n\nYahoo Finance Video\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST\n\nIn this video: NVDA\n\nINTC\n\nNvidia ( NVDA ) completed its purchase of $5 billion worth of Intel ( INTC ) shares as part of an agreement announced in September . Yahoo Finance Reporter Laura Bratton discusses the news, recaps Intel's wild 202 5, and what might be in store for the chip giant in 2026.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nNvidia has officially taken its $5 billion stake in Intel, carrying out a transaction announced back in September. And for more on Intel's deals, let's welcome in Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Laura.\n00:09 Laura Bratton\nHow's it going?\n00:10 Speaker A\nVery good. Walk us through it.\n00:12 Laura Bratton\nYeah, so, um, Intel said in a regulatory filing today that over um last week, it had completed the sale of 5 billion worth of shares to Nvidia. Um it was a deal that was initially announced in September and really boosted confidence in Intel. Um, the two companies are co-developing CPUs for data center servers, um and also chips for personal computers. So, um really big deal for Intel to have kind of Nvidia behind it. Um, but notably it doesn't include Intel manufacturing and that's really what investors have been waiting to see um whether Intel's manufacturing business can turn around.\n00:46 Speaker A\nNow Nvidia, that wasn't the only deal Intel struck, right, this year? What else has changed for that chipmaker?\n00:54 Laura Bratton\nYeah, a lot has changed. They have a new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, um that really bolstered kind of investor confidence in Intel because of his wide-ranging industry connections. Um Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO had undergone like a really aggressive turnaround effort and it just cost a lot of money and the manufacturing business, which opened up to outside um customers has been losing a lot of money. Um, other things that happened, the US government really big, they invested in Intel, so did Softbank. Um, and the US government investment was was a really big deal because the thought is that, you know, now Intel might have sway over trade policy. The US government could potentially pressure some of the bigger companies to use Intel's manufacturing business.\n01:40 Speaker A\nSo, and by the way, this stock, I mean, as we we should mention, it's up about 80% this year. Uh it has been just a rocket ship. Uh most analysts, by the way, on on uh maybe not surprising after a move like that. I mean, look at that stock chart. Most analysts at this point are on the sidelines. But what's ahead for Intel? Like if I'm an investor in this name, Laura, what should I be looking for in 2026? What's on the radar?\n02:05 Laura Bratton\nYeah, so, um Intel's latest manufacturing process 18A was a really big milestone for the company. Um but they didn't really get the big external customers that investors are really looking for Intel to get in order to be like, hey, this business has really, you know, turned around. Um, so that instead is being kind of used for Intel's own chips, but now they need outside customers for their upcoming manufacturing processes, 18AP and 14A.\n02:37 Speaker A\nMhm. All right, Laura, thanks so much. Appreciate it.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Despite an explosive year-to-date rally, they’re going for just over 3x sales at the time of writing, versus more than 35x for Nvidia.\nWall Street Disagrees with Newman on Intel Wall Street analysts do not entirely agree with Newman’s constructive view on Intel stock, though.\nThe consensus rating on INTC shares remains at “Hold” only with the mean target of nearly $37 already in line with the price at which they are trading currently.\n\nStory Continues\nThis article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.

Advanced Micro Devices is worth owning also because recent reports suggest it will soon resume chip shipments to China, releasing an estimated $500 million (at least) in additional revenue for 2026.\nAMD shares outperformed Nvidia by a significant margin this year – yet, they remain cheaper to own on a price-sales (P/S) basis.\n\nMore importantly, even after a meteoric rally in 2025, the AI stock has its 100-day relative strength index (RSI) set at 54 only, indicating the upward momentum is far from exhaustion.\nAll in all, AMD is an early stage story with much more room for future growth than NVDA, and that alone is a strong enough reason to stay invested.\nWhat’s the Consensus Rating on Advanced Micro Devices? Other Wall Street analysts seem to agree with Mizuho’s bullish view on Advanced Micro Devices.\nAccording to Barchart, the consensus rating on AMD stock remains at “Moderate Buy” with price targets going as high as $380, indicating potential upside of a whopping 75% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Wajeeh Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Nvidia finalizes its roughly 4%, $5 billion stake in Intel\n\nShannon Carroll\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nIntel just cashed Nvidia’s $5 billion check . Intel says it completed the share sale to Nvidia on Dec. 26 after regulatory clearance earlier this month, turning a September announcement into settled cash and issued shares — and making Nvidia’s roughly 4% stake in Intel official.\nNvidia bought 214,776,632 shares at $23.28 apiece in a private placement, a round-number infusion that landed on Intel’s balance sheet like a vote of confidence and on its reputation like a defibrillator. For months, the deal lived in that corporate purgatory where everyone speaks in the future tense and the market politely pretends it can’t hear the lawyers. Now, the cash is in — and the shares exist.\n\nNvidia was off about 1.7% in early morning trading, and Intel was relatively flat (up just over 1%). That’s what happens when a headline becomes a filing. Intel got the money. Now: It has to make the partnership feel like hardware, not hope.\nIt’s a private placement, not a public-market nibble, and Intel’s earlier filing emphasized Nvidia wasn’t getting special governance or information rights beyond what shareholders already get. The deal was conditioned on the regulatory process, and the FTC’s early-termination notice for the transaction is dated Dec. 18.\n“AI is driving a reinvention of every layer of the computing stack,” Huang said back in September at a press conference to discuss the news, which he called a “historic partnership” and a “great business opportunity” for both companies. Huang said the three architecture teams — working across the CPU architecture, as well as product lines for servers and PCs — have been developing this “fairly extensive” architecture for over a year. He added, “Today, we’re taking the next great step.”\n\nYou could feel how unthinkable this pairing once was by the way the Street talked about it. “This is truly like the Yankees and the Red Sox coming together to end their rivalry — the companies did not like each other whatsoever,” David Wagner, head of equity and a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote at the time. “[Using Intel’s fabs to make chips is] a massive step in the right direction for U.S. chip designers and breathes new life into a poorly run company for decades.”\nThis partnership didn’t happen in a vacuum. Earlier this fall, the federal government took the rare step of engineering a roughly 10% equity stake in Intel , converting lectures about industrial policy into a live experiment with an actual balance sheet. The politics were loud, the stakes louder, and the message unmistakable: In President Donald Trump’s America’s AI playbook — a CEO-style , results-first posture toward national champions — Intel is the corporate vessel for “made here” ambition. But Intel didn’t just need capital. It also needed a partner.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Intel-Nvidia partnership pitch stays the same, and the omissions stay just as loud. Intel and Nvidia have said they’ll co-develop multiple generations of products for data centers and PCs, including Nvidia-custom x86 CPUs meant to slot into Nvidia’s AI infrastructure and PC system-on-chips that combine Intel CPU cores with Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets, stitched together with NVLink. Missing, deliberately, is any promise that Nvidia’s crown-jewel GPUs will move off TSMC or that Intel will suddenly become the default factory for Nvidia’s most important silicon. The deal reads like influence and distribution, not a manufacturing surrender. A big check, not a merger.\n\nFor Intel, that’s still a win. It gets cash plus the kind of association that turns a long-suffering turnaround narrative into something procurement teams can cite without blushing. For Nvidia, this is a smoother path into the x86 universe without asking enterprises to torch their software estates — and a convenient way to look less like a solitary superpower while regulators and politicians keep peering at the AI stack like it’s critical infrastructure.\nNvidia’s check has cleared — now, Intel’s story has to.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Will Intel Shock the World in 2026?\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:38 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBF\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Intel had an 80% gain in 2025.\nBut the company's market cap is still far below its big tech peers.\nSome unexpected technology and financial successes could be in store for 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nOne of the best performers in the technology sector this year was Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , with its stock up roughly 80% in 2025. Extreme pessimism at the start of the year gave way to hope when new CEO Lip-Bu Tan was appointed to the role in March. Then hope turned to enthusiasm when the U.S. government, Softbank , and Nvidia all invested in the company in the third quarter.\n\nSkeptics may say Intel is due for a pullback in 2026, but investors should consider that Intel's market capitalization is still far below that of other AI leaders, at just $173 billion today.\nThat still leaves room for further upside if Intel can execute and regain its technology leadership. And while many analysts are skeptical this will happen, Intel may very well change the narrative in a big way next year.\nProfits are nearly certain to inflect higher Many don't really understand Intel's current financials, which is understandable. Current profits appear nonexistent; last quarter's adjusted ( non-GAAP ) EPS was a meager $0.23, likely not enough to justify the current stock price of $36.50.\nYet it seems nearly inevitable that Intel's profits will increase throughout 2026. The most direct way this will happen is by relocating more production from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) to Intel's own manufacturing fabs.\n\nThroughout former CEO Pat Gelsinger's turnaround plan, Intel had to reinvest to build its Intel 3 fab in Ireland and its 18A fab in Chandler, Arizona. During that period, Intel still produced older nodes in-house, but outsourced basically all of its leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC as its new fabs were built. As a virtual monopoly, TSMC achieved a very high gross margin of 59.5% last quarter. Meanwhile, Intel's foundry is yielding large operating losses, to the tune of $2.3 billion last quarter alone.\nBut Intel foundry's losses are entirely due to Intel having invested heavily in expensive leading-edge fabs, while having very little product running through those fabs as of yet. However, as Intel moves production back to both Intel 3, which began high-volume manufacturing in late 2024, and especially 18A, which just began high-volume manufacturing this quarter, those underutilization losses will not only reverse but should eventually turn into profits by 2027.\nSo there will be a double-positive effect of Intel beginning to utilize the fabs it has already built, while also not having to pay TSMC's huge margins.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile yields on the 18A process are currently lower than normal, according to Intel management, it's early in that node's ramp. Management remains confident yields will improve throughout next year, which should lead to steady margin increases throughout 2026.\nTechnology leadership could add even more profitability Speaking of 18A, it is still the node by which Intel believes it will meet or exceed TSMC's technology in the industry. Now, there is some debate about this, with some industry participants arguing that TSMC's 2nm remains superior.\nYet while both Intel and TSMC will be using gate-all-around transistors for the first time with their 18A and 2nm nodes, Intel will be bringing at least one technology to market ahead of TSMC: backside power.\n\nBackside power moves the power delivery wires of a semiconductor from the front of the chip to the back part of the chip. This leaves more room on the front for more transistors, which leads to better performance and efficiency.\nIn addition, while Intel has been close-lipped about the tooling for its 18A node, there is also the possibility that Intel may utilize high-NA extreme ultraviolet lithography (HNA) tools for 18A.\nHNA can \"write\" chip patterns in a thickness of just 8nm, more precisely than the 13nm light beams of low-NA EUV. If Intel implements high-NA for the 18A node, it can eliminate several processing steps that would be required by double or triple-patterning designs with LNA tools, thereby saving on other equipment lines and fab space. At a technology conference back in February, Intel noted that a high-NA machine can do the same work with a single-digit number of process steps that it took three low-NA machines and 40 steps to accomplish.\n\nNow, for the record, Intel has only stated that it will integrate HNA production into its upcoming 14A node. However, management has never explicitly ruled out the possibility of inserting the technology into 18A. Meanwhile, Intel has publicly disclosed it has already purchased at least three high-NA machines, and potentially more. Moreover, Intel just revealed two weeks ago it had completed \"acceptance testing\" for the production-grade HNA system, meaning it is manufacturing-ready. With Intel having first received HNA tools in late 2023 and the tool seemingly ready for production, it would be odd if the company doesn't use these next-gen tools until 2028's 14A.\nExternal customer announcements? Finally, in addition to improving its technology and margins for its own chips, Intel is also attempting to become a rival foundry to TSMC and break its monopoly. In fact, Intel has stated it may not even develop its next 14A node if it doesn't secure a large external customer -- although executives remain confident that this will happen.\n\nIf Intel does land an external customer for 14A, which is scheduled to enter risk production in 2027 and high-volume production in 2028, that customer win may very well be announced in 2026.\nAlready over the past month, rumors have circulated that Apple may utilize the 18AP node variant, a more refined version of 18A, for its lower-end M-series processors. Meanwhile, Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead recently wrote, \"Intel customers I've talked with who have seen this one say that 14A is the real deal.\" And GF Securities in Hong Kong recently reported Nvidia and even Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices are considering the 14A node.\nIf these rumors are already circulating in 2025, there will likely be a lot more activity surrounding external customer announcements in 2026.\n\n2026 could see the rally continue 2025 was the first stage of Intel's turnaround. The company returned to meager profitability, implemented its new 18A process, and reduced the company's bloated expense base. It attracted investment from the U.S. government and others, and new CEO Lip-Bu Tan is beginning to make his presence felt.\n\nYet 2026 could see even more tangible more breakthroughs across profitability, technology, and landing external customers. In other words, it will be another fascinating year for the most consequential U.S. chipmaker -- with potentially much more upside for the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

Just a little too much of one ingredient -- or not enough of another -- can be the difference between pastry perfection and dessert disaster.\nSimilarly, the companies that manufacture the sophisticated semiconductors capable of handling artificial intelligence (AI) applications also require meticulous levels of precision in order to sustain high-volume production of those chips. For this reason, ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is high on my buy list. The company plays a pivotal role in the semiconductor industry, and I've long recognized its stock as a compelling way to expand my AI industry exposure.\nI plan to open a position in the coming weeks, and once it's initiated, I intend to click the buy button on ASML stock again during any dips.\nASML provides a unique AI investment opportunity Designing cutting-edge semiconductors -- the wheelhouse of companies like Nvidia and AMD -- is no small feat, yet it means little unless foundries can produce those chips at scale. This is where ASML comes in.\nWhile ASML provides a variety of equipment, software, and services to enable the large-scale fabrication of microchips, the products that make it most appealing to investors are its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These machines use light at a 13.5-nanometer wavelength to print the most sophisticated chip designs on the market, making them indispensable tools for foundry operators like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel .\n\nASML is the only company capable of building EUV machines, giving it an unparalleled position in the chip industry and providing it with a robust competitive advantage over its rivals.\nKicking the tires on the company's financials provides even more reassurance It's hard to argue with the allure of ASML, as it has a technological monopoly in a niche that is vital to the tech sector. The company's fundamentals further illustrate why its stock will be worth holding for the long term as the AI industry develops.\nFor one, the company generates extremely strong cash flow. In 2024 and 2023, for example, ASML reported free cash flow of $7 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, according to Morningstar . Its results are even more impressive when stacked up against its semiconductor equipment peers, Lam Research and Applied Materials .\n\nStory Continues\nOver the past decade, ASML has consistently generated more free cash flow per share -- especially during the past two years as the AI industry has boomed.\nPair this with the fact that the company has a strong balance sheet with a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 0.14 as of its most recent financial report, and its sound financial health becomes even more apparent.\n\nForget looking to Santa, I'm gifting ASML to myself this year I was uninterested in waiting for shares of ASML to appear under the tree, so I've made a plan to buy the stock in the coming weeks to get some skin in the game, and then gradually build my position as dips occur. Should another company ever debut an EUV lithography system, I'll have to reevaluate my position. For the time being, though, I'm eager to broaden my AI sector exposure with ASML stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?

The share price moved further up on December 17, after South China Morning Post reported the company’s chair and CEO, Lisa SU met with the Chinese minister of industry and information technology.\nAccording to the report, Lisa Su affirmed the commitment to deepen its investment in China. The chief executive also noted that China will offer greater corporate opportunities for foreign enterprises, including Advanced Micro Devices.\n​This report comes as President Trump released a statement suggesting eased export control on Nvidia’s H200 chips and also indicated potential relaxation for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. This is an important update for the company as during fiscal 2024, China and Hong Kong combined generated roughly $6.2 billion in revenue for the company, thereby making it the second largest market for AMD.\n\n​That said, Wall Street also maintains a positive outlook on the stock. On December 19, Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but slightly lowered the price target from $279 to $277. On the same day, William Stein from Truist Financial also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $201.06 price target.\n​Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company that manufactures GPUs, microprocessors, and high-performance computing solutions and serves a number of high-growth industries like gaming, data centers, and AI.​\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Prediction: AMD Stock Will Jump 60% in 2026, Thanks to President Donald Trump\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 3:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points AMD was getting a nice chunk of its revenue from the Chinese market before the U.S. government's export controls took effect in April 2025.\nAMD will soon be allowed to sell advanced AI chips to Chinese customers, which should benefit AMD's business in 2026.\nThis could help AMD exceed Wall Street's growth expectations next year, which could send the stock soaring.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock clocked stellar gains in 2025, rising 78% this year as of this writing. However, recent trading suggests that some investors are booking profits. AMD stock is down 19% since hitting a 52-week high on Oct. 29.\nThis pullback could be a buying opportunity for investors looking to add a fast-growing company that's benefiting from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) . Additionally, a recent announcement by President Donald Trump, which will allow companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD, and Intel to sell their advanced AI chips to Chinese customers, is going to give AMD an additional boost in 2026.\nLet's take a closer look at AMD's catalysts for the new year and see why this stock has the potential to soar once again.\nThe Trump administration's announcement could give AMD a big shot in the arm AMD's business grew at a nice clip in 2025. It is on track to deliver $34 billion in revenue for the year, up 31% over 2024 revenue. It might have been even better, but AMD hasn't been able to sell its chips into the Chinese market since April, when the Trump administration imposed export controls on sales of advanced AI data center chips to that country.\n\nAs a result, AMD incurred an $800 million inventory charge in the second quarter. Moreover, the company lost a significant chunk of its revenue stream thanks to the Trump administration's move. That's because China accounted for nearly a quarter of AMD's 2024 revenue of $25.8 billion, or almost $6.2 billion.\nDespite the headwind, analysts expect a 20% increase in the company's earnings for 2025 to $3.97 per share. Consensus estimates suggest that AMD's earnings could jump 62% next year to $6.46 per share. I think it could end up doing much better than that.\nTake Nvidia, for example. The Trump administration now allows Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to Chinese customers. Nvidia was previously only selling its downsized H20 chips in China to comply with export regulations. Those chips were significantly cheaper and less powerful than Nvidia's flagship Hopper processor, the H200.\n\nStory Continues\nWith the change, Nvidia will likely see a significant bump in its revenue next year, even after paying the 25% tax that the administration plans to charge on sales to China. President Trump pointed out in his Truth Social post that the \"same approach will apply to AMD,\" suggesting that the company may be able to sell its high-end chips to Chinese customers.\n\nIt was earlier selling the downgraded MI308 processor to Chinese customers. It may now be able to ship its more powerful chips into that market, just like Nvidia has been allowed to. So, there is a possibility of AMD regaining the lost Chinese revenue in 2026, even with the 25% export fee.\nThat's because a full-fledged AMD data center graphics processing unit (GPU) will carry a significant premium over the nerfed MI308. This is why AMD's sales next year could turn out to be much higher than expected.\nThe stock could skyrocket in 2026 Analysts anticipate AMD's revenue to jump by 31% in 2026 to $44.6 billion. Assuming its revenue from China next year lands at 2024 levels of $6.2 billion, its top line could be somewhere around $51 billion. What's worth noting is that analysts haven't adjusted their 2026 revenue expectations for AMD following the Trump administration's rule change, suggesting that the company's potential gains from China aren't baked in just yet.\nAssuming AMD does achieve $51 billion in revenue next year and maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 11 at that time, its market cap could jump to $561 billion. That points toward a potential jump of 60% from its current market cap. So, now it would be a good time to buy this semiconductor stock following its recent pullback, as it has the potential to soar impressively in the new year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?
