      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/26592ac6-9048-3a70-bb08-c79aa60b5c1b/nvidia-finalizes-its-roughly.html",
      "Content": "Nvidia finalizes its roughly 4%, $5 billion stake in Intel\n\nShannon Carroll\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 7:59 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nIntel just cashed Nvidia’s $5 billion check . Intel says it completed the share sale to Nvidia on Dec. 26 after regulatory clearance earlier this month, turning a September announcement into settled cash and issued shares — and making Nvidia’s roughly 4% stake in Intel official.\nNvidia bought 214,776,632 shares at $23.28 apiece in a private placement, a round-number infusion that landed on Intel’s balance sheet like a vote of confidence and on its reputation like a defibrillator. For months, the deal lived in that corporate purgatory where everyone speaks in the future tense and the market politely pretends it can’t hear the lawyers. Now, the cash is in — and the shares exist.\n\nNvidia was off about 1.7% in early morning trading, and Intel was relatively flat (up just over 1%). That’s what happens when a headline becomes a filing. Intel got the money. Now: It has to make the partnership feel like hardware, not hope.\nIt’s a private placement, not a public-market nibble, and Intel’s earlier filing emphasized Nvidia wasn’t getting special governance or information rights beyond what shareholders already get. The deal was conditioned on the regulatory process, and the FTC’s early-termination notice for the transaction is dated Dec. 18.\n“AI is driving a reinvention of every layer of the computing stack,” Huang said back in September at a press conference to discuss the news, which he called a “historic partnership” and a “great business opportunity” for both companies. Huang said the three architecture teams — working across the CPU architecture, as well as product lines for servers and PCs — have been developing this “fairly extensive” architecture for over a year. He added, “Today, we’re taking the next great step.”\n\nYou could feel how unthinkable this pairing once was by the way the Street talked about it. “This is truly like the Yankees and the Red Sox coming together to end their rivalry — the companies did not like each other whatsoever,” David Wagner, head of equity and a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote at the time. “[Using Intel’s fabs to make chips is] a massive step in the right direction for U.S. chip designers and breathes new life into a poorly run company for decades.”\nThis partnership didn’t happen in a vacuum. Earlier this fall, the federal government took the rare step of engineering a roughly 10% equity stake in Intel , converting lectures about industrial policy into a live experiment with an actual balance sheet. The politics were loud, the stakes louder, and the message unmistakable: In President Donald Trump’s America’s AI playbook — a CEO-style , results-first posture toward national champions — Intel is the corporate vessel for “made here” ambition. But Intel didn’t just need capital. It also needed a partner.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Intel-Nvidia partnership pitch stays the same, and the omissions stay just as loud. Intel and Nvidia have said they’ll co-develop multiple generations of products for data centers and PCs, including Nvidia-custom x86 CPUs meant to slot into Nvidia’s AI infrastructure and PC system-on-chips that combine Intel CPU cores with Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets, stitched together with NVLink. Missing, deliberately, is any promise that Nvidia’s crown-jewel GPUs will move off TSMC or that Intel will suddenly become the default factory for Nvidia’s most important silicon. The deal reads like influence and distribution, not a manufacturing surrender. A big check, not a merger.\n\nFor Intel, that’s still a win. It gets cash plus the kind of association that turns a long-suffering turnaround narrative into something procurement teams can cite without blushing. For Nvidia, this is a smoother path into the x86 universe without asking enterprises to torch their software estates — and a convenient way to look less like a solitary superpower while regulators and politicians keep peering at the AI stack like it’s critical infrastructure.\nNvidia’s check has cleared — now, Intel’s story has to.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Will Intel Shock the World in 2026?\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 4:38 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBF\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Intel had an 80% gain in 2025.\nBut the company's market cap is still far below its big tech peers.\nSome unexpected technology and financial successes could be in store for 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nOne of the best performers in the technology sector this year was Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , with its stock up roughly 80% in 2025. Extreme pessimism at the start of the year gave way to hope when new CEO Lip-Bu Tan was appointed to the role in March. Then hope turned to enthusiasm when the U.S. government, Softbank , and Nvidia all invested in the company in the third quarter.\n\nSkeptics may say Intel is due for a pullback in 2026, but investors should consider that Intel's market capitalization is still far below that of other AI leaders, at just $173 billion today.\nThat still leaves room for further upside if Intel can execute and regain its technology leadership. And while many analysts are skeptical this will happen, Intel may very well change the narrative in a big way next year.\nProfits are nearly certain to inflect higher Many don't really understand Intel's current financials, which is understandable. Current profits appear nonexistent; last quarter's adjusted ( non-GAAP ) EPS was a meager $0.23, likely not enough to justify the current stock price of $36.50.\nYet it seems nearly inevitable that Intel's profits will increase throughout 2026. The most direct way this will happen is by relocating more production from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) to Intel's own manufacturing fabs.\n\nThroughout former CEO Pat Gelsinger's turnaround plan, Intel had to reinvest to build its Intel 3 fab in Ireland and its 18A fab in Chandler, Arizona. During that period, Intel still produced older nodes in-house, but outsourced basically all of its leading-edge chipmaking to TSMC as its new fabs were built. As a virtual monopoly, TSMC achieved a very high gross margin of 59.5% last quarter. Meanwhile, Intel's foundry is yielding large operating losses, to the tune of $2.3 billion last quarter alone.\nBut Intel foundry's losses are entirely due to Intel having invested heavily in expensive leading-edge fabs, while having very little product running through those fabs as of yet. However, as Intel moves production back to both Intel 3, which began high-volume manufacturing in late 2024, and especially 18A, which just began high-volume manufacturing this quarter, those underutilization losses will not only reverse but should eventually turn into profits by 2027.\nSo there will be a double-positive effect of Intel beginning to utilize the fabs it has already built, while also not having to pay TSMC's huge margins.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile yields on the 18A process are currently lower than normal, according to Intel management, it's early in that node's ramp. Management remains confident yields will improve throughout next year, which should lead to steady margin increases throughout 2026.\nTechnology leadership could add even more profitability Speaking of 18A, it is still the node by which Intel believes it will meet or exceed TSMC's technology in the industry. Now, there is some debate about this, with some industry participants arguing that TSMC's 2nm remains superior.\nYet while both Intel and TSMC will be using gate-all-around transistors for the first time with their 18A and 2nm nodes, Intel will be bringing at least one technology to market ahead of TSMC: backside power.\n\nBackside power moves the power delivery wires of a semiconductor from the front of the chip to the back part of the chip. This leaves more room on the front for more transistors, which leads to better performance and efficiency.\nIn addition, while Intel has been close-lipped about the tooling for its 18A node, there is also the possibility that Intel may utilize high-NA extreme ultraviolet lithography (HNA) tools for 18A.\nHNA can \"write\" chip patterns in a thickness of just 8nm, more precisely than the 13nm light beams of low-NA EUV. If Intel implements high-NA for the 18A node, it can eliminate several processing steps that would be required by double or triple-patterning designs with LNA tools, thereby saving on other equipment lines and fab space. At a technology conference back in February, Intel noted that a high-NA machine can do the same work with a single-digit number of process steps that it took three low-NA machines and 40 steps to accomplish.\n\nNow, for the record, Intel has only stated that it will integrate HNA production into its upcoming 14A node. However, management has never explicitly ruled out the possibility of inserting the technology into 18A. Meanwhile, Intel has publicly disclosed it has already purchased at least three high-NA machines, and potentially more. Moreover, Intel just revealed two weeks ago it had completed \"acceptance testing\" for the production-grade HNA system, meaning it is manufacturing-ready. With Intel having first received HNA tools in late 2023 and the tool seemingly ready for production, it would be odd if the company doesn't use these next-gen tools until 2028's 14A.\nExternal customer announcements? Finally, in addition to improving its technology and margins for its own chips, Intel is also attempting to become a rival foundry to TSMC and break its monopoly. In fact, Intel has stated it may not even develop its next 14A node if it doesn't secure a large external customer -- although executives remain confident that this will happen.\n\nIf Intel does land an external customer for 14A, which is scheduled to enter risk production in 2027 and high-volume production in 2028, that customer win may very well be announced in 2026.\nAlready over the past month, rumors have circulated that Apple may utilize the 18AP node variant, a more refined version of 18A, for its lower-end M-series processors. Meanwhile, Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead recently wrote, \"Intel customers I've talked with who have seen this one say that 14A is the real deal.\" And GF Securities in Hong Kong recently reported Nvidia and even Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices are considering the 14A node.\nIf these rumors are already circulating in 2025, there will likely be a lot more activity surrounding external customer announcements in 2026.\n\n2026 could see the rally continue 2025 was the first stage of Intel's turnaround. The company returned to meager profitability, implemented its new 18A process, and reduced the company's bloated expense base. It attracted investment from the U.S. government and others, and new CEO Lip-Bu Tan is beginning to make his presence felt.\n\nYet 2026 could see even more tangible more breakthroughs across profitability, technology, and landing external customers. In other words, it will be another fascinating year for the most consequential U.S. chipmaker -- with potentially much more upside for the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

Just a little too much of one ingredient -- or not enough of another -- can be the difference between pastry perfection and dessert disaster.\nSimilarly, the companies that manufacture the sophisticated semiconductors capable of handling artificial intelligence (AI) applications also require meticulous levels of precision in order to sustain high-volume production of those chips. For this reason, ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is high on my buy list. The company plays a pivotal role in the semiconductor industry, and I've long recognized its stock as a compelling way to expand my AI industry exposure.\nI plan to open a position in the coming weeks, and once it's initiated, I intend to click the buy button on ASML stock again during any dips.\nASML provides a unique AI investment opportunity Designing cutting-edge semiconductors -- the wheelhouse of companies like Nvidia and AMD -- is no small feat, yet it means little unless foundries can produce those chips at scale. This is where ASML comes in.\nWhile ASML provides a variety of equipment, software, and services to enable the large-scale fabrication of microchips, the products that make it most appealing to investors are its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These machines use light at a 13.5-nanometer wavelength to print the most sophisticated chip designs on the market, making them indispensable tools for foundry operators like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel .\n\nASML is the only company capable of building EUV machines, giving it an unparalleled position in the chip industry and providing it with a robust competitive advantage over its rivals.\nKicking the tires on the company's financials provides even more reassurance It's hard to argue with the allure of ASML, as it has a technological monopoly in a niche that is vital to the tech sector. The company's fundamentals further illustrate why its stock will be worth holding for the long term as the AI industry develops.\nFor one, the company generates extremely strong cash flow. In 2024 and 2023, for example, ASML reported free cash flow of $7 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, according to Morningstar . Its results are even more impressive when stacked up against its semiconductor equipment peers, Lam Research and Applied Materials .\n\nStory Continues\nOver the past decade, ASML has consistently generated more free cash flow per share -- especially during the past two years as the AI industry has boomed.\nPair this with the fact that the company has a strong balance sheet with a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 0.14 as of its most recent financial report, and its sound financial health becomes even more apparent.\n\nForget looking to Santa, I'm gifting ASML to myself this year I was uninterested in waiting for shares of ASML to appear under the tree, so I've made a plan to buy the stock in the coming weeks to get some skin in the game, and then gradually build my position as dips occur. Should another company ever debut an EUV lithography system, I'll have to reevaluate my position. For the time being, though, I'm eager to broaden my AI sector exposure with ASML stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?

The share price moved further up on December 17, after South China Morning Post reported the company’s chair and CEO, Lisa SU met with the Chinese minister of industry and information technology.\nAccording to the report, Lisa Su affirmed the commitment to deepen its investment in China. The chief executive also noted that China will offer greater corporate opportunities for foreign enterprises, including Advanced Micro Devices.\n​This report comes as President Trump released a statement suggesting eased export control on Nvidia’s H200 chips and also indicated potential relaxation for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. This is an important update for the company as during fiscal 2024, China and Hong Kong combined generated roughly $6.2 billion in revenue for the company, thereby making it the second largest market for AMD.\n\n​That said, Wall Street also maintains a positive outlook on the stock. On December 19, Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but slightly lowered the price target from $279 to $277. On the same day, William Stein from Truist Financial also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $201.06 price target.\n​Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company that manufactures GPUs, microprocessors, and high-performance computing solutions and serves a number of high-growth industries like gaming, data centers, and AI.​\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Prediction: AMD Stock Will Jump 60% in 2026, Thanks to President Donald Trump\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 3:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points AMD was getting a nice chunk of its revenue from the Chinese market before the U.S. government's export controls took effect in April 2025.\nAMD will soon be allowed to sell advanced AI chips to Chinese customers, which should benefit AMD's business in 2026.\nThis could help AMD exceed Wall Street's growth expectations next year, which could send the stock soaring.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock clocked stellar gains in 2025, rising 78% this year as of this writing. However, recent trading suggests that some investors are booking profits. AMD stock is down 19% since hitting a 52-week high on Oct. 29.\nThis pullback could be a buying opportunity for investors looking to add a fast-growing company that's benefiting from the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) . Additionally, a recent announcement by President Donald Trump, which will allow companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD, and Intel to sell their advanced AI chips to Chinese customers, is going to give AMD an additional boost in 2026.\nLet's take a closer look at AMD's catalysts for the new year and see why this stock has the potential to soar once again.\nThe Trump administration's announcement could give AMD a big shot in the arm AMD's business grew at a nice clip in 2025. It is on track to deliver $34 billion in revenue for the year, up 31% over 2024 revenue. It might have been even better, but AMD hasn't been able to sell its chips into the Chinese market since April, when the Trump administration imposed export controls on sales of advanced AI data center chips to that country.\n\nAs a result, AMD incurred an $800 million inventory charge in the second quarter. Moreover, the company lost a significant chunk of its revenue stream thanks to the Trump administration's move. That's because China accounted for nearly a quarter of AMD's 2024 revenue of $25.8 billion, or almost $6.2 billion.\nDespite the headwind, analysts expect a 20% increase in the company's earnings for 2025 to $3.97 per share. Consensus estimates suggest that AMD's earnings could jump 62% next year to $6.46 per share. I think it could end up doing much better than that.\nTake Nvidia, for example. The Trump administration now allows Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to Chinese customers. Nvidia was previously only selling its downsized H20 chips in China to comply with export regulations. Those chips were significantly cheaper and less powerful than Nvidia's flagship Hopper processor, the H200.\n\nStory Continues\nWith the change, Nvidia will likely see a significant bump in its revenue next year, even after paying the 25% tax that the administration plans to charge on sales to China. President Trump pointed out in his Truth Social post that the \"same approach will apply to AMD,\" suggesting that the company may be able to sell its high-end chips to Chinese customers.\n\nIt was earlier selling the downgraded MI308 processor to Chinese customers. It may now be able to ship its more powerful chips into that market, just like Nvidia has been allowed to. So, there is a possibility of AMD regaining the lost Chinese revenue in 2026, even with the 25% export fee.\nThat's because a full-fledged AMD data center graphics processing unit (GPU) will carry a significant premium over the nerfed MI308. This is why AMD's sales next year could turn out to be much higher than expected.\nThe stock could skyrocket in 2026 Analysts anticipate AMD's revenue to jump by 31% in 2026 to $44.6 billion. Assuming its revenue from China next year lands at 2024 levels of $6.2 billion, its top line could be somewhere around $51 billion. What's worth noting is that analysts haven't adjusted their 2026 revenue expectations for AMD following the Trump administration's rule change, suggesting that the company's potential gains from China aren't baked in just yet.\nAssuming AMD does achieve $51 billion in revenue next year and maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 11 at that time, its market cap could jump to $561 billion. That points toward a potential jump of 60% from its current market cap. So, now it would be a good time to buy this semiconductor stock following its recent pullback, as it has the potential to soar impressively in the new year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia's Groq deal underscores how the AI chip giant uses its massive balance sheet to 'maintain dominance'\n\nLaura Bratton\nUpdated Fri, December 26, 2025 at 10:33 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nGROQ.PVT\n\nMU\n\nXAAI.PVT\n\nNvidia’s ( NVDA ) licensing deal with chip startup Groq ( GROQ.PVT ) shows how the tech giant is leveraging its massive cash pile to sustain its preeminence in the AI market.\nNvidia this week said it struck a non-exclusive deal with Groq to license its technology and hired the startup’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, its president, and other employees. CNBC reported the agreement to be worth $20 billion , marking Nvidia’s largest-ever deal. (The company declined a request for comment on the figure.)\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note to clients Thursday that the Nvidia-Groq deal “appears strategic in nature for NVDA as they leverage their increasingly powerful balance sheet to maintain dominance in key areas.” Nvidia’s cash inflow climbed more than 30% from the previous year to $22 billion in its most recent quarter.\n\"This transaction is ... essentially an acquisition of Groq without being labeled one (to avoid the regulators' scrutiny),\" added Hedgeye Risk Management analysts in a note Friday.\n\nThe move is just the latest in a string of AI deals by Nvidia, the world’s first $5 trillion company . The chipmaker’s investments in AI firms span the entire market, ranging from large language model developers such as OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) and xAI ( XAAI.PVT ) to “neoclouds” like Lambda ( LAMD.PVT ) and CoreWeave ( CRWV ), which specialize in AI services and compete with its Big Tech customers.\n\nNvidia has also invested in chipmakers Intel ( INTC ) and Enfabrica. The company made a failed attempt around 2020 to acquire British chip architecture designer Arm ( ARM ).\nNvidia’s wide-ranging investments — many of them in its own customers — have led to accusations that it’s involved in circular financing schemes reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. The company has vehemently denied those claims.\nGroq, meanwhile, was looking to become one of Nvidia’s rivals.\nFounded in 2016, Groq makes LPUs (language processing units) geared toward AI inferencing and marketed as alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs (graphics processing units).\nTraining AI models involves teaching a model to learn patterns from large amounts of data, while \"inferencing\" refers to using that trained model to generate outputs. Both processes demand massive computing power from AI chips.\n\nWhile Nvidia easily dominates the chip market for AI training, some analysts argue that Nvidia could soon see greater competition in the inference space. That’s because custom chips like Google's ( GOOG ) TPUs (tensor processing units) — and arguably Groq’s chips called LPUs (language processing units) — may be better suited for certain tasks. LPUs, for instance, are faster and more energy efficient when used for certain models, utilizing a type of memory technology called SRAM within the chips. On the other hand, Nvidia GPUs rely on off-chip HBM made by companies like Micron ( MU ) and Samsung ( 005930.KS ).\n\nStory Continues\nRoss, the Groq CEO, said in a recent interview that the upstart aimed to provide chips for half the world’s AI inference computing needs — and cheaply.\n“What we want to do is we want to drive the cost of compute as close to zero as we can get it. Every year we want to make it cheaper,” he told Indian business outlet YourStory . Notably, Ross already helped create Nvidia’s greatest source of competition: The executive led the development of Google’s first-generation TPUs.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst CJ Muse said Nvidia’s \"acqui-hire\" of Groq talent and licensing of its intellectual property showed the chipmaker “is playing both offense and defense” in the AI space. Muse said the deal would allow Nvidia to take “even greater share of the inference market.”\nNvidia shares rose more than 1% Friday.\nOthers on Wall Street were more confused by Nvidia’s move and its potential $20 billion price tag. Hedgeye Risk Management analysts argued that Groq's chips are \"still unproven\" when it comes to large AI models, due to their low memory capacity.\n\"Groq's current technology is greatly limited to only a small subset of inference workloads,\" added DA Davidson analyst Alex Platt.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Intel Corporation (INTC): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\n^GSPC\n\nIntel (INTC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -1.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has gained 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nIntel is expected to post earnings of $0.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -38.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.34 points to a change of +361.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +12%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.58 indicates a change of +72.6% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.38 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -6.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $52.4 billion and $54.12 billion estimates indicate -1.3% and +3.3% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Intel reported revenues of $13.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.8%. EPS of $0.23 for the same period compares with -$0.46 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.11 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.13%. The EPS surprise was +2200%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nIntel is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Is Intel Stock a Buy Ahead of 2026?\n\nNauman Khan\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 3:48 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nU.S. policy has reshaped Intel's ( NASDAQ:INTC ) investment case, and investors now see the company as more than a chipmaker chasing short-term profits. Washington and strategic partners have poured capital into Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ), and that money changes the risk equation for the company's costly foundry pivot. The government's support gives Intel breathing room to push a capital-intensive plan that private markets might otherwise punish.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with INTC.\nIs INTC fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nIn Q3 Intel reported solid revenue and a clearer balance sheet after repaying debt and holding meaningful cash. The company keeps its foundry push front and center; that business still loses money, but leadership argues those losses will shrink as yields improve and volumes rise. Nvidia (NVDA) and SoftBank Group (SFTBY) contribute strategic capital and partnership opportunities that pair Intel's logic road map with external AI expertise.\nThe pivot carries real execution risk. Foundry losses run into the billions and management admits some nodes carry higher upfront costs and lower yields in early ramps. At the same time, capacity limits on older, profitable nodes left Intel unable to meet some demand, which complicates near-term margin recovery.\n\nPolicy backing matters. Infusion of cash by the government transforms Intel into a strategic toy, it attracts patient capital and provides company with additional runway to combat the manufacturing headaches. This does not negate the necessity of the fixes to its operations, however. Shareholders still desirous to see consistent yield increases, reduced margins, and a clearer path to foundry profitability.\nAt least, it is the crossroad between industrial policy and a risky, costly technological turnaround that Intel finds itself at now; the market would need to weigh the big picture priority versus immediate financial suffering.\nIs INTC Stock a Buy? Based on the one year price targets offered by 36 analysts, the average target price for Intel Corp is $36.79 with a high estimate of $52.00 and a low estimate of $18.00. The average target implies a upside of +1.74% from the current price of $36.16.Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Intel Corp in one year is $23.92, suggesting a downside of -33.85% from the current price of $36.16. gf value is gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. it is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and the future estimates of the business' performance.

The 10-year T-note yield rose two basis points to 4.15%.\n\nMore News from Barchart As the FDA Approves a Wegovy Pill, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold Novo Nordisk Stock?\nThis Dividend Giant Yielding 4.5% Is Wall Street’s Top Telecom Pick for 2026\nHave a MERRY Christmas With These 9 Unusually Active Options\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nIn Wednesday’s trading session, Wall Street’s three main equity benchmarks closed higher, with the S&P 500 posting a new record high. Nike (NKE) climbed over +4% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 and Dow after a regulatory filing revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook purchased 50,000 shares of the footwear maker. Also, some chip stocks advanced, with Micron Technology (MU) rising more than +3% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 and Lam Research (LRCX) gaining over +1%. In addition, Dynavax (DVAX) jumped more than +38% after Sanofi agreed to acquire the vaccine maker for about $2.2 billion. On the bearish side, Intel (INTC) fell about -0.5% after Reuters reported that Nvidia had paused a test of using Intel’s manufacturing process to make advanced chips.\n\nThe Labor Department’s report on Wednesday showed that the number of Americans filing for initial jobless claims in the past week fell by -10K to 214K, compared with the 224K expected.\nAs traders digested the latest economic data, they maintained their view that the Fed will deliver two quarter-point rate cuts next year. Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in an 84.5% probability of no rate change and a 15.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at January’s monetary policy meeting.\n“The stock market is finally starting to eke out some gains for December after a choppy few weeks, and just in time for the market’s Santa Claus rally, which we expect to take place in its typical format,” said Paul Stanley at Granite Bay Wealth Management.\nA Santa Claus rally refers to the consistent gains observed in the stock market over the final five trading days of December and the first two trading days of January. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has delivered an average return of 1.3%, posting gains 78% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial.\n\nIn other news, China’s foreign ministry said on Friday it imposed sanctions on 10 individuals and 20 U.S. defense firms, including Boeing’s St. Louis unit, over arms sales to Taiwan. The measures freeze any assets the companies and individuals hold in China and prohibit domestic organizations and individuals from doing business with them.\n\nStory Continues\nThe U.S. economic data slate is empty on Friday.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.151%, up +0.51%.\nMost major markets in Europe remain closed today for holidays.\nAsian stock markets today closed in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.10%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.68%.\n\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index reversed earlier losses and closed higher today, extending its winning streak to eight sessions. Gold mining stocks outperformed on Friday as gold prices climbed to a new record high. Steel stocks also advanced after China said on Friday it will continue to regulate crude steel output and ban the addition of illegal new capacity from 2026 to 2030. At the same time, technology stocks retreated as investors took profits following recent strong gains. Meanwhile, the benchmark index logged its strongest week in two months, and analysts expect the upward momentum to continue, supported by a strengthening yuan. The yuan posted its strongest official close in 2-1/2 years on Thursday and hovered just shy of the psychologically important 7-per-dollar level on Friday. The currency appreciation “is expected to whet foreign appetite for yuan assets, push up valuations and increase interbank liquidity,” according to Huatai Securities. In other news, Goldman Sachs Research’s Xinquan Chen said China’s central bank has hinted at potential monetary easing in the months ahead, noting that the PBOC adopted a measured easing tone in its fourth-quarter MPC meeting’s statement. In corporate news, Sichuan Swellfun Co. fell over -1% after the spirits maker denied media reports of a potential takeover by a rival firm. Investors now look ahead to China’s November industrial profits data, scheduled for release on Saturday, which will provide insight into how companies are coping with excess-capacity pressures.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher today, led by gains in technology and healthcare stocks. The benchmark index notched a second consecutive weekly gain. Government data released on Friday showed that core consumer inflation in Japan’s capital eased in December as food cost pressures moderated, but remained above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target, keeping the central bank on course for further monetary tightening. The data supports the BOJ’s view that core inflation will dip below its 2% target in the coming months as cost pressures ease, before picking up again in a more demand-driven manner that would justify further rate hikes. The BOJ is expected to raise rates in July and December of 2026, according to a research note from two members of Barclays’ FICC Research. Separate data showed that Japan’s monthly industrial output fell more than expected in November amid the continued drag from U.S. tariffs, though companies expect output to rebound soon. In addition, data showed that retail sales growth slowed in November but was roughly in line with expectations. Meanwhile, Japan’s cabinet on Friday approved a record initial budget of about $785 billion for the next fiscal year, seeking to balance Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s proactive fiscal stance with concerns over ballooning debt by capping new bond issuance. New government bond issuance will increase only marginally from this year’s 28.6 trillion yen to 29.6 trillion yen. Notably, Japan’s finance ministry will issue the smallest amount of super-long government bonds in 17 years in the next fiscal year. The issuance plan helped push super-long JGB yields lower on Friday. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +15.98% to 21.77.\n\nThe Japanese December Tokyo Core CPI rose +2.3% y/y, weaker than expectations of +2.5% y/y.\nThe Japanese November Industrial Production (preliminary) fell -2.6% m/m, weaker than expectations of -1.9% m/m.\nThe Japanese November Retail Sales rose +1.0% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.9% y/y.\nThe Japanese November Unemployment Rate was 2.6%, in line with expectations.\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nNvidia (NVDA) rose about +0.7% in pre-market trading after agreeing to a licensing deal with AI startup Groq.\nChip stocks are edging higher in pre-market trading.

But large-caps are attempting to retake the lead, in line with what we&rsquo;ve seen throughout this phenomenal multi-year bull run off the October 2022 lows.\n\nIn any case, the calendar is on the side of the bulls as we remain in the most favorable 3-month stretch of the year that spans November through January. And from a seasonal perspective, the next week of trading tends to lean quite bullish.\nThe Santa Claus Rally &ldquo;If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.&rdquo; &ndash; Yale Hirsch\nWe saw a relatively sluggish start to the Christmas-themed month, with the S&P 500 falling nearly 2% through December 17 th . But the index has come roaring back over the past week and is now up roughly 1% as of Christmas Eve.\n\nThe days surrounding the Christmas holiday have historically been some of the most bullish times of the year. Dating back to 1988, the second day before Christmas (which fell on Tuesday this year) is the most bullish, with the S&P 500 rising more than 70% of the time over the past 37 years. That trend played out again yesterday.\nIt looks like the early December weakness is setting up well for a year-end rally. Today marks the final trading day before Christmas and is also the first day of a period known as the Santa Claus Rally.\nFirst discovered by Yale Hirsch (creator of the Stock Trader&rsquo;s Almanac), the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is a seven-day period that consists of the final five trading days of the year, along with the first two trading days of the New Year. As markets are closed on Thursday for the Christmas holiday (as well as January 1 st for New Year&rsquo;s Day), today marks the first day of the SCR.\n\nSince 1950, these 7 glorious days tend to be overwhelmingly green, as the S&P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3% and is positive nearly 80% of the time. In fact, no other 7 days of the year are more likely to finish higher!\nIf these 7 days are higher, it typically bodes well for the full year. In fact, since 1950, when we have a positive return during this stretch, the S&P 500 gains an average of more than 10% the following year and is higher over 70% of the time.\n\n繼續閱讀\nYears where markets saw negative returns during the Santa Claus Rally period tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be bought at lower prices later in the year. For example, a negative SCR preceded relatively flat years like 1994, 2005 and 2015, as well as some of the worst years on record like 2008.\n\nAnd while we did see a negative return during the SCR period last year (and still registered solid gains in 2025), the early tariff tantrum provided investors the opportunity to purchase stocks on sale.\nStocks to Watch Chip giant Intel saw its stock fall roughly 2% in early trading on Wednesday, after a report suggested that Nvidia had halted a test to use Intel&rsquo;s production process to make advanced chips.\nNvidia had been in the testing phase of the so-called &ldquo;18A&rdquo; production process, which represented a potential return to manufacturing premium offerings in-house. While Intel touted the technology as a serious breakthrough, the halt raises concerns regarding the practicality of Intel&rsquo;s advanced manufacturing process.\n\nThe negative headline came just months after the two semiconductor companies announced a key collaboration back in September. Under the prior arrangement, Intel agreed to develop custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia&rsquo;s AI infrastructure platforms. In return, Nvidia pledged to invest $5 billion in Intel&rsquo;s common stock, which sent shares notably higher over the past few months. Intel is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Nvidia remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nMeanwhile, gold prices back off slightly from their staggering ascent to all-time highs. Gold producer Agnico Eagle Mines is a leader in the space and has soared more than 130% year-to-date. The company engages in the exploration and production of precious metals including gold, silver, zinc, and copper. AEM stock remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) due to favorable earnings estimate revisions.\n\nConclusion Today marks the second day of the Santa Claus Rally. As we saw, this seven-day stretch is typically positive and has shown predictive power.\nPositive seasonality represents a major tailwind for stocks. Make sure to keep an eye on how markets perform over the SCR period. From all of us here at Zacks, we wish you happy holidays and a prosperous New Year.\n\nDisclosure: Nvidia is a current holding in the Zacks Headline Trader portfolio.

      "Content": "Veteran analyst has blunt message on Intel stock\n\nVuk Zdinjak\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 9:47 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nIntel stock is trading approximately 0.52% lower at $36.16 as of the time of writing. The stock is down, due to a Reuters report stating that Nvidia has decided not to manufacture its chips using Intel’s 18A node (manufacturing process) after conducting some testing.\nIn response to this report, an Intel spokesperson told Reuters the company’s 18A node is “progressing well,” and that it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-gen node 14A.\n\nI have closely followed Intel’s moves this year, and wrote in late September about Intel engaging customers for its fabs: “Intel’s ability to attract customers depends on how the launch of its Panther Lake and Nova Lake CPUs goes.”\nGiven that both CPU lines are set to launch in 2026, at the time, I saw little chance that Nvidia would manufacture anything on Intel’s 18A node until its issues had been completely resolved. We’ll explore this in more detail later.\nVeteran analyst exiting long position in Intel Veteran analyst Stephen Guilfoyle has been long on Intel ( INTC ) for a few months.\nFollowing the news that Nvidia decided not to use Intel’s 18A node, he conducted his analysis, noting that since early August, Intel stock had developed a rising wedge pattern of bearish reversal .\nGuilfoyle offered more detail on TheStreet Pro .\n\nHe added that being long on Nvidia, AMD , Broadcom, and Intel leaves him somewhat overexposed to the space.\nWhat do other analysts think about INTC stock? According to MarketBeat , the consensus rating for Intel's stock is hold, with 20 analysts giving that rating, 6 giving a sell rating, and 5 giving a buy rating. The average target price is $38.09.\n“Importantly, we don’t expect a material improvement in the current unfavorable cost structure for Intel Foundry, given slow internal adoption of 18A node (peak capacity in 2030+) and foundry competition in the U.S.,” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote in his research note in October.\n\nHe also explained that Intel stock, trading at a 50 multiple price-to-earnings ratio estimate for calendar year 2027, is overvalued. Arya’s rating for INTC is underperform (sell equivalent), and a price target is $34, based on a 3 multiple of his enterprise value-to-sales ratio estimate for 2027, in line with the historical range of 1.7 to 4.\nWhy Nvidia chips on Intel’s 18A node weren’t going to happen Nvidia sells millions of GPU chips, and it needs a reliable manufacturing process. Even if Intel was going to cover the cost of the defective chips, that would mean the manufacturing would take much longer, depending on how bad the yield rate is.\n\nStory Continues\nIntel hasn’t disclosed yield rates for its 18A node, and its avoidance of the exact answer hints that they are not good.\n\"I would say the yields are adequate to address the supply, but they are not where we need them to be in order to drive the appropriate level of margins,” Intel CFO David Zinsner said during the Q3 earnings call .\n\nMore Tech Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\nJohn Pitzer, corporate vice president of corporate planning and investor relations at Intel, shared his thoughts at the 2025 RBC Capital Markets Global Technology, Internet, Media & Telecommunications Conference.\n“We have [said] in the past that the industry average yield improvement on a new ramp is about 7% per month, and we are now on that curve for Panther Lake, which is giving us some confidence as we launch the product this quarter,” Pitzer said, as reported by Tom’s Hardware .\n\nThe problem with Pitzer’s statement is that it isn’t clear what 7% represents. To illustrate this, let’s say that hypothetically, yields are 10% and they increase by 7% of that 10%, which gives us 10.7%. However, it could also mean that they get a 7% increase, in the sense that they go from 10% to 17%.\nHe said the dramatic increase started about seven or eight months ago, so if it were the latter case, it would mean the yields increased by approximately 56% from whatever the starting point was. If Intel’s yields hit more than 56% and are increasing by 7% per month, it wouldn’t need to keep avoiding the exact answer.\nIn addition to the yield problems, switching to a manufacturing process from another company is not a trivial task. Intel needs to have proof that the switch is worth it. The company was already focusing more on securing major contracts for its next-generation 14A node, due to the difficulties it had in attracting them to the 18A node, as reported by Reuters and Tom’s hardware in July.\nRelated: Bank of America resets Micron stock price target, rating\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 25, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump, giving Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin, Reuters\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 3:03 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nPLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 a.m. Pacific Time on Aug. 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia, AMD, OpenAI, Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\n\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the S&P 500 and Nvidia in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThe transition to Tan comes as Intel is in the middle of an announced $28 billion project to construct microchip production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany . While the factories were originally slated to begin operations this year, that has been delayed to 2030 at the earliest as Intel seeks buyers for the chips those factories are to produce .\n\nStory Continues\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 minutes in the Oval Office Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms - Walden International and Walden Catalyst - did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies, including coming to Intel's formal groundbreaking ceremony in Licking County in 2022 .\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nIntel's venture capitalist CEO Born in Malaysia to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger , and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA 'lifeline' for Intel So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

On December 16, Bank of America raised the firm’s price target on Intel to $40 from $34, while keeping an Underperform rating on the shares. The firm highlighted a growing opportunity for Intel Foundry to secure external wins in advanced packaging and wafer design. However, BofA also noted that manufacturing uncertainties continue to weigh on the outlook, requiring a more cautious stance until production consistency improves.\n\nOn December 3, Intel announced its decision to retain its Networking and Communications unit/NEX following a comprehensive strategic review. This move marks a pivot from earlier considerations of divestiture intended to stabilize the company’s balance sheet. The decision was made possible by a considerably improved financial position, according to CFO Dave Zinsner, which follows a series of massive capital injections earlier in the year, including $8.9 billion in US government funding, $5 billion from Nvidia, and $2 billion from SoftBank.\nEarlier on November 18, Intel’s John Pitzer outlined the company’s roadmap for margin recovery and market share growth. While Intel faces supply constraints expected to peak in Q1 2026, it is prioritizing cost-efficiency to counteract currently depressed data center margins. A centerpiece of this strategy is the previously mentioned $5 billion partnership with Nvidia, where Intel will produce a custom Xeon processor for data centers that Nvidia will integrate and bring to market.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services worldwide. It operates through Intel Products, Intel Foundry, and All Other segments.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) picked up 0.3% to notch its second consecutive record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( ^IXIC ) gained a bit under 0.2%.\n\nMarkets closed early on Wednesday for Christmas Eve and are off Thursday for the holiday. Wall Street's bid for a \"Santa Claus\" rally is looking hopeful after the major indexes gained for the fifth consecutive day.\nWall Street's advance over the past several sessions has come despite new economic data that only served to dampen bets for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the near term. US GDP growth stood at 4.3% in the third quarter , according to a first estimate from the government, much higher than forecast as consumer spending held up over the summer.\n\nBut the GDP data led investors to trim bets on a January rate cut from the Fed — just more than 13% now expect that outcome. Most traders, however, still expect two rate cuts by the end of next year, as the divisions that defined the central bank this year are likely to persist even with a new chair set to replace Jerome Powell by mid-year.\nInvestors got one more sign of an economy that is nominally moving in the right direction as unemployment claims fell for the second week in a row, according to data released Wednesday — even as consumer confidence continues to falter .\nElsewhere, precious metals powered ahead on Wednesday, with gold ( GC=F ) rising to an all-time high above $4,500 an ounce before paring gains. Silver ( SI=F ) also advanced to a record, while platinum ( PL=F ) reversed, shedding more than 3%. Oil ( BZ=F , CL=F ) steadied after a run-up through the last few days.\nIntel ( INTC ) managed to pare losses to a drop of around 0.5% on the day after reports that Nvidia ( NVDA ) had halted a test using Intel's fabrication process for advanced chips.\n\nLIVE 15 updates\n25 mins ago Ines Ferré\n\nGold, silver, copper steady after touching record highs as metals outperform in 2025 Gold ( GC=F ) and silver ( SI=F ) are among this year’s biggest winners, with momentum driving prices to record highs and setting up their best year since 1979.\nGold traded above $4,500 per troy ounce on Wednesday before paring gains as it notched another milestone in a year packed with more than 50 record highs.\nSilver has had an even stronger year, soaring 150% on robust industrial demand and physical shortages. The metal topped $70 on Wednesday, while futures climbed past $72 an ounce.\nMeanwhile, copper ( HG=F ) also participated in the metals rally, reaching all-time highs on supply concerns before trimming gains.\n\n56 mins ago Jake Conley\n\nDiverging spending levels continue to drive a \"K-shaped\" US economy The US consumer landscape is firmly K-shaped, and the economy is likely to continue to hold that shape into 2026, according to economic strategists.

The leak, shared by YouTube channel RedGamingTec, suggests the chip will combine Intel CPUs with Nvidia RTX graphics in a single design.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\nIs NVDA fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nSerpent Lake is expected to pair Intel's upcoming Titan Lake CPU architecture with Nvidia's RTX Rubin graphics, manufactured on TSMC's 3-nanometer process. The chip is reportedly aimed at competing with AMD's Strix Halo by delivering stronger graphics performance in high-end laptops.\nOne notable feature is memory bandwidth. The design is said to support up to 16 channels of LPDDR6 memory, a move intended to avoid bottlenecks that have limited graphics performance in competing processors.\nThe leak appears to offer the first real glimpse of what Intel and Nvidia's $5 billion partnership could produce. While Intel says it remains committed to its own Arc graphics roadmap, Serpent Lake points to deeper collaboration between the two companies, with a potential launch in late 2025 or early 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is launching a probe into the EV Maker's Model 3 compact sedans. This comes amid concerns that emergency door release controls may not be easily accessible or clearly identifiable. The focus of this investigation is on model year 2022 electric vehicles.

Let's start there, explain that. I mean, is that is that valuation, Joseph, is it is it earnings growth, positioning, explain it.\n00:27 Joseph\nI think that there have been a number of businesses in the magnificent 493 that are perceived as being uh hurt or uh compromised by the growth of AI. Valuations have gone significantly lower for a number of those companies and businesses that are just not participants in in uh the opportunity of AI have also not performed particularly well uh in that bucket of the magnificent 493. And I think in 2026, what we're going to find is that many of these companies are harnessing AI to get better, to lower their costs, to improve the velocity of introducing new products, um, and those businesses will begin to get the benefits of that uh as people recognize it. It hasn't happened uh in the last couple of years, but I think we're going to notice that in the next couple of years.\n01:29 Speaker A\nWell, what does that suggest Joseph about what do you think I do with the Mag 7 though in 2026? You know, am I avoiding those names? Am I trimming exposure? You know, do I have to be more discerning? Maybe next year, Joseph, it's more like, you know, the mag three or four.\n01:46 Joseph\nI think so. I think the Mag 7 it's tough to paint them with a broad brush because each one of them has a specific story associated with them. But I think just from a valuation perspective and the fact that they've performed so well for such a long period of time, I think that some of them will take a break, some of them will perform well, but really the opportunities for outsized returns next year are going to be outside of those seven businesses.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Uh-Oh! Did Nvidia Just Signal Problems with Intel’s Comeback?\n\nRich Duprey\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAVGO\n\nTSM\n\nQuick Read Intel ( INTC ) secured $8.9B from the U.S. government and $5B from Nvidia ( NVDA ) to revive its foundry business.\nNvidia halted testing of Intel’s 18A chip manufacturing process and stopped moving forward with production plans.\nIntel’s foundry turnaround depends on 18A attracting major customers beyond smaller deals with Microsoft and Amazon .\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIntel ( NASDAQ: INTC ) has experienced a dramatic shift in fortunes over the past year. Once viewed as a failing chipmaker losing ground to competitors like Broadcom ( NASDAQ: AVGO ), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( NYSE: TSM ), and Nvidia ( NASDAQ: NVDA ), Intel faced speculation that rivals were circling its foundry business and other assets.\nBy the middle of the year, however, Intel regained momentum through significant backing from the Trump administration, which converted CHIPS Act grants into an equity stake worth approximately $8.9 billion, or 10% of the company, making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. This was followed by a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, giving it roughly a 4% stake, as well as partnerships aimed at joint product development in data centers and PCs.\n\nThese moves indicated renewed confidence, positioning Intel as a key player in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing once again. Yet, a Reuters report today suggests a big potential setback, raising questions about whether Intel's revival is beginning to falter.\nA Promising Rebound Built on Execution Intel's recent progress has been notable, driven by strategic investments and a focus on revitalizing its core businesses. The Trump administration's equity stake provided essential capital and aligned Intel with national priorities for domestic chip production.\nWeeks later, Nvidia's $5 billion commitment further supported Intel's turnaround, with the two firms agreeing to collaborate on custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms and integrated system-on-chips for PCs. An Intel spokesperson emphasized that 18A technologies are \"progressing well.\"\n\nDespite these positive developments, the rebound has always hinged on Intel's ability to execute, particularly in its foundry business. The 18A process node has been central to its plans for regaining manufacturing leadership, as it is intended to enable high-volume production of advanced chips and attract customers.\nNvidia's Decision Raises Questions About 18A According to the Reuters article, Nvidia recently evaluated whether to manufacture its next-generation chips using Intel's 18A process but halted the testing and stopped moving forward. Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed this to Reuters, though Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nStory Continues\nThis development comes despite Nvidia's earlier investment and ongoing product collaborations, which explicitly did not include commitments to use Intel's foundry. Intel has previously noted strong interest in 18A, and the company continues to highlight progress on the node, with products like Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest ramping up toward production.\n\nThe reasons for Nvidia's decision remain unclear, but earlier reports indicated both Nvidia and Broadcom conducted tests on 18A. While testing is a standard step, not all evaluations lead to production commitments.\nIf technical or yield issues contributed to the halt, it could signal challenges for Intel in convincing major designers to shift volume from established leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel's foundry has faced scrutiny over quality and scalability before, though the company maintains that 18A is on track and sees interest shifting to the subsequent 14A node for even more advanced applications.\nBroader Implications for Intel's Foundry Strategy Winning high-profile customers has been a key goal for Intel Foundry, which has invested heavily to compete as a contract manufacturer. Deals with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) for custom chips on 18A have been announced, and Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) might go with Intel for its entry-level M-series chips in 2027, but volumes from such clients are relatively small compared to demands from AI leaders like Nvidia.\n\nNvidia halting the testing -- while not a definitive rejection -- underscores the high bar set for advanced nodes. Competitors continue to dominate high-end production, and Intel must demonstrate reliable yields and performance to secure larger commitments.\nKey Takeaway Investors should not read too much into Nvidia's decision to pause 18A testing at this stage, as qualification processes are lengthy and multifaceted. However, greater caution is warranted moving forward.\nMuch of Intel's turnaround depends on the success of the 18A process in delivering competitive manufacturing capabilities. If the node falls short of expectations in attracting major business from customers, it could complicate the company's path to foundry profitability and an overall recovery.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

There were still a couple of things that Wall Street may not have been expecting when it came to AI giants. Great Hill Capital chairman and managing member Thomas Hayes and Edward Jones senior global investment strategist Angelo Kourkafas each share one AI surprise from 2025.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThomas, what has surprised you this year on the AI trade?\n00:07 Speaker B\nWell, I I I'll tell you, Brian, it wasn't a surprise for us, but I think it was a dramatic surprise for the market and may still surprise some people when they hear it right now. The number one performing AI stock for 2025 was not Nvidia, it was Intel. Intel was up uh as of yesterday 81.4% year to date.\n00:46 Speaker A\nIntel's still around Thomas? They're still around? They they still do business?\n00:51 Speaker B\nThey still do business and the world all of the chip designers are dramatically dependent on them succeeding in developing advanced chips. And the US government is standing behind that because we don't want to be dependent exclusively on Taiwan semiconductor. So Intel was the number one chip and hyperscaler followed by AMD. So Intel was up 81%, AMD up 77%, Nvidia up 36%, not bad, but less than half of the returns of Intel. Uh Microsoft only 15%, Apple 8%, Amazon 4%. So, uh I think people were a little surprised that uh that the most popular names uh were more subdued than expected and I do think that theme is going to persist but but we'll get to that.\n01:46 Speaker A\nAngelo, hit me with a surprise. I think uh that Intel move, the fact that it is outperformed Nvidia certainly has surprised a lot of folks. What's uh what's been on your radar?\n01:57 Speaker C\nYeah, I think one thing that may surprise many of your viewers is that valuations for the tech sector are lower now than what they were at the start of the year. So basically what has happened is that earnings have been growing faster than prices. So that pushes back against all that AI bubble narrative because it is really earnings that have been doing the heavy lifting for the tech sector. And that I think is a comforting message. Yes, tech is the most expensive segment of the market, but it has been able to deliver earnings, solid earnings. And what has happened late in the year is probably a healthy pause, uh but the AI theme is likely to continue.\n02:51 Speaker A\nThese are the surprises I needed. Tom and Angelo, you have clearly brought your A game here on Christmas Eve. Tom, back to you. I think Angelo makes a very good point on on valuation. So, question to you, is AI are AI stocks still cheap then?\n03:10 Speaker B\nUh, I think that we have to be a little bit careful as we look into 2026. I think the theme is not going to be the AI stocks, it uh or the AI cost centers rather, when we think about hyperscalers and some of the chip names. The theme for 2026 and the biggest surprise is going to be AI beneficiaries. Those that are implementing the technology into their businesses to improve productivity, to improve margins and uh to to Angelo's point, uh earnings have grown, but if we look out three quarters, it's expected that the earnings growth rate of the magnificent 7 relative to the earnings growth of the un magnificent 493, we could say cost centers versus AI beneficiaries, is going to converge, meaning the unmagnificent 493's earnings growth rate will be equal to or greater than the magnificent 7 earnings growth rate by the third quarter of this year. and that's why I think we're going to see as we see in midterm election years, the indices a little bit more subdued, a little bit more choppy, a little bit more volatile because the biggest weights of the S&P 500 are probably going to take a uh breather or consolidate their gains uh as that earning growth decelerates. The other thing that we have to keep in mind here, Brian is that uh CapX as a percentage of uh operating cash flow now for the hyperscalers is uh exceeding levels of big oil. Greater than 60% of operating cash flow is now going to CAPEX and that's part of the reason that that growth rate is declining and I think we're going to see a lot of money made under the surface in individual stocks, the AI beneficiaries and maybe more subdued returns again from the AI cost centers, AKA hyperscalers and the stocks that most people are crowded into at the moment.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "TSX futures edge lower as liquidity thins ahead of Christmas break\n\nLuke Juricic\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 6:42 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPTSE\n\nDX\n\nDX-PC\n\nINTC\n\nNVDA\n\nInvesting.com -- Canadian equity futures are drifting slightly lower on Wednesday morning as market participants head to the sidelines for a holiday-shortened session. The subtle retreat follows a historic milestone for the S&P/TSX Composite, which reached a record closing high on Tuesday, fueled by a meteoric rise in the metals and mining sectors.\n\nAs of 9:05 ET, S&P/TSX 60 Futures Index Standard Futures were down 2.4 points or 0.13%, mirroring a cautious tone in global markets. Trading volumes are expected to remain exceptionally thin today, as the Toronto Stock Exchange prepares to close early at 1:00 PM ET for Christmas Eve. Analysts warn that low liquidity could amplify price swings, though many investors appear content to lock in profits after a banner year for Canadian equities.\nRecord Territory: Tuesday Recap The benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index finished Tuesday’s session up 58.63 points, or 0.18%, to settle at a new record of 32,058.73. The advance marked the fourth consecutive winning day for the index, which has now surged nearly 30% year-to-date.\nTuesday’s gains were driven almost exclusively by commodities:\n\nGold and Silver Miners: Outsized gains in the sub-indexes (up over 100% this year) continued as precious metals hit fresh peaks.\nEnergy: Resilience in crude prices provided a secondary floor for the index, even as domestic economic data surprised to the downside.\nThe bullish momentum successfully offset a disappointing report from Statistics Canada , which revealed that real GDP contracted 0.3% in October . The decline was wider than the 0.2% drop economists had anticipated, hampered by a 1.5% slump in manufacturing and a series of high-profile labor stoppages, including a nation-wide postal strike and teacher strikes in Alberta.\nGold Shatters $4,500 Barrier In a historic move on Wednesday, Gold Futures broke past the $4,500 per ounce resistance level. The yellow metal reached a peak of $4,554/oz in trade, extending a rally that has seen prices climb roughly 70% in 2025. Gold Futures now sit at $4,515.25/oz, a 0.2% gain.\nThe \"flight to safety\" is being propelled by a cocktail of geopolitical and macroeconomic factors:\n\nUS-Venezuela Tensions: Renewed friction between Washington and Caracas over oil shipments has heightened regional supply risks.\nFed Expectations: Despite robust US GDP data, investors remain firm in their belief that the Federal Reserve will pivot toward further rate cuts in 2026.\nCurrency Weakness: The US Dollar Index is hovering near 12-week lows, making dollar-denominated bullion more attractive to international buyers.\n\nStory Continues\nEnergy & Commodities Watch\nOil prices remained relatively stable on Wednesday morning. Brent Oil Futures edged up 0.14% to $62.46 per barrel, while Crude Oil WTI Futures gained 0.3% to trade at $58.55.\nSupply risks remain the primary catalyst, as the Trump administration intensifies enforcement actions against vessels linked to Venezuelan crude. While Venezuela accounts for a small fraction of global supply, the potential for wider maritime interdiction has re-introduced a significant risk premium into energy markets.\n\nTech Spotlight: Intel Slumps on Nvidia Snub In corporate news, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) saw its shares tumble 3.3% in premarket trading. The move comes following reporting from Reuters saying that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has halted testing of Intel’s \"18A\" advanced manufacturing process.\nThe 18A node is considered the linchpin of Intel’s turnaround strategy to become a premier foundry for third-party chip designers. While an Intel spokesperson maintained that the technology is \"progressing well,\" the decision by Nvidia, the world’s most valuable chipmaker, to step away from testing dealt a heavy blow to investor sentiment.\n\nLooking Ahead U.S. markets are also expected to see light activity today, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 Futures trading near flat after their own record-setting sessions on Tuesday. The New York Stock Exchange will join the TSX in an early 1:00 PM ET close today, and both will remain shuttered on Thursday for Christmas Day.\nRelated articles\nTSX futures edge lower as liquidity thins ahead of Christmas break\n17 Undervalued Small-Cap Tech Stocks Primed to Outperform in Q4\nThe 5 Best Gold Mining Stocks to Buy Now\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Intel Corp. INTC, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\nForget NVIDIA: 2 AI Stocks Crushing It in 2025 with More Upside Ahead Shares of the most sought-after tech stock on Wall Street, NVIDIA Corp. , have surged 36.6% this year amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ongoing demand for NVIDIA's CUDA software platform, along with its competitive advantage in the AI hardware market, fueled growth. Demand for NVIDIA's Blackwell chips remains strong, and the company plans to ship H200 AI chips to China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nHowever, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions remain a risk and could pose a meaningful threat to NVIDIA's future growth trajectory. NVIDIA also faces intensifying competition from rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . and Intel Corp. , as data center capital expenditures continue to rise.\nTherefore, investors may look beyond NVIDIA at stocks that have outperformed it this year and still offer upside as the AI boom continues. Notable among them are Micron Technology, Inc . and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc . whose shares have gained 228.8% and 43.6%, respectively, this year. Let's take a closer look at why these stocks are compelling buys.\nReasons to Be Bullish on Micron Strong demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips is expected to help the company deliver strong quarterly results. These chips have the inherent capacity to reduce power consumption and process large volumes of data. With AI infrastructure rapidly expanding, demand for HBM chips has accelerated.\n\nBanking on rising AI-led demand for HBM chips, Micron expects its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $13.64 billion for the fiscal first quarter, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Analysts had projected revenues of around $12.88 billion.\nMicron expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter, with its cloud memory business unit expected to perform particularly well. Micron's expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a solid 23.5%.\n\nStory Continues\nReasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai BigBear.ai's shares were adversely impacted at the beginning of the year due to the Trump administration's move to curb federal spending. Reduced funding may have affected BigBear.ai's sales, but its top-line performance is expected to improve going forward, supported by the definitive $250 million agreement to acquire Ask Sage.\n\nAsk Sage is a fast-growing generative AI platform that has seen broad adoption, with users including the U.S. Space Force and the Defense Health Agency. It is designed for secure AI deployment in restricted fields such as defense and national security, according to ir.bigbear.ai. Ask Sage serves 100,000 users across 16,000 government teams, and with its acquisition, BigBear.ai expects full-year sales to reach $125 million to $140 million.\nMoreover, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" could drive future growth for BigBear.ai, while the company's robust cash position provides ample resources to support its expansion. The company reached a significant milestone toward profitability in the third quarter, and its expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a stellar 73.1%.\n\nWhile BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Intel Shares Fall on Report Nvidia Halts Production Test\n\nJake Rudnitsky\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:14 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. shares fell in premarket trading Wednesday after a report said that Nvidia Corp. halted a test to use Intel’s production process to make advanced chips.\nNvidia recently tested the so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, Reuters reported, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nWith Mamdani, the Humble Bus Gets Its Due\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nSpokespeople for Nvidia and Intel didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies are “progressing well.”\nIntel’s shares fell about 2.3% in early trading before markets opened in New York.\nIntel recently opened a new factory at its Ocotillo site in Arizona known as Fab 52 that’s the first to go into mass production with the 18A technique. The company says it’s the most cutting edge production technology developed and deployed in the US. Intel’s push to make advanced chips domestically is an attempt to challenge the global leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and reassert American leadership in the industry.\n\nNvidia agreed to invest $5 billion into Intel in September, following the US government’s decision to take a roughly 10% stake in the company. The investment by the world’s most valuable company and a key designer of chips for the artificial intelligence boom was seen as a boost for Intel, which has struggled to stem losses and catch competitors that have surpassed it in recent years. However, the deal didn’t include a commitment for Intel to make Nvidia chips.\n18A is a bid to return to making Intel’s best offerings in-house. The technology contains two new features that Intel says are breakthroughs for the industry.\nThe first relates to transistors, the microscopic switches that give semiconductors their function. Modern chips cram tens of billions of transistors into a small area. In order to make chips more efficient and use less energy, the ability to switch these transistors on and off becomes critical.\n\nThe 18A products will be the first to have transistors made with so-called gate-all-around technology, a technique that allows finer control over this process, Intel said. That will allow for chips with more transistors — and the ability to handle growing amounts of data — that consume less power.\nThe second innovation pertains to how the chips are powered. The ultimate promise is that chips can have more transistors and be more efficient.\n\nStory Continues\n(Updates with more detail on 18A process.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAMZN\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel ( INTC ) CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\n\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ) in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft ( MSFT ) CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms — Walden International and Walden Catalyst — did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO Born in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Has Intel’s 79.8% 2025 Surge Outrun Its Fundamentals?\n\nSimply Wall St\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 6:12 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nIf you are wondering whether Intel is still a bargain after its huge run, or if the easy money has already been made, you are in the right place to unpack what the current share price really implies.\nDespite a choppy week with the stock down about 2.6%, Intel is still up roughly 5.4% over the last month and an impressive 79.8% year to date, reshaping how the market is pricing its turnaround story.\nThat surge has been fueled by renewed optimism in Intel's foundry ambitions, ongoing investments in advanced manufacturing, and growing interest in how it might benefit from AI infrastructure demand. At the same time, headlines around intensifying competition and execution risk are keeping some investors cautious, which helps explain the recent volatility.\nOn our checklist of six valuation tests, Intel currently scores a 3 out of 6 . This hints at some upside but also signals that value is not straightforward. Next, we will dig into different valuation approaches to see what the numbers say, and then finish with an even more useful way to think about Intel's true worth beyond the usual models.\n\nIntel delivered 78.2% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Semiconductor industry.\nApproach 1: Intel Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company is worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them back into today’s dollars. It is essentially a way to translate Intel’s long term cash generation into a single, present value number.\nIntel’s latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $13.7 billion in the red, highlighting the heavy investment phase the company is in. Analysts expect cash flows to recover over the next decade, with projections turning positive and reaching roughly $10.9 billion by 2035, based on a two stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model that blends analyst estimates for the early years with extrapolated growth thereafter.\n\nWhen all those future cash flows are discounted back, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of about $14.65 per share. Compared with the current market price, this implies the stock is roughly 148.2% overvalued, suggesting investors today are paying well above what the cash flow outlook supports.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Intel may be overvalued by 148.2%. Discover 908 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Intel.\n\nStory Continues\nApproach 2: Intel Price vs Sales For companies like Intel that are investing heavily and seeing earnings pressured, the price to sales ratio is often a cleaner way to compare value because it looks at what investors are paying for each dollar of revenue rather than current profits, which can be temporarily depressed.\nIn general, faster growth and lower risk justify a higher multiple, while slower growth, thinner margins, or higher uncertainty should pull a normal price to sales ratio down. Intel currently trades at about 3.24x sales, which is below the Semiconductor industry average of roughly 5.43x and well under the peer group average of around 13.19x. This suggests the market is still applying a discount to its turnaround story.\n\nSimply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Intel is 5.31x, a proprietary estimate of what a balanced price to sales multiple should be given the company’s growth outlook, profitability profile, industry, market cap and specific risks. This is more informative than a simple peer or industry comparison because it adjusts for Intel’s own fundamentals rather than assuming it should look like the average chip stock. With the actual 3.24x sitting below the 5.31x Fair Ratio, the shares screen as undervalued on this metric.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1457 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Intel Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to attach your own story about Intel’s future to hard numbers like expected revenue, earnings, margins and fair value. A Narrative on Simply Wall St connects three pieces in one place: your view of the business, the financial forecast that follows from that view, and the resulting fair value that you can compare against today’s share price to decide whether Intel looks like a buy, hold or sell. Narratives are available on the Community page and used by millions of investors, so you can quickly explore different perspectives without needing to build your own spreadsheet models. They also automatically refresh when new information comes in, such as earnings results or major news. For Intel, one investor might see a high conviction AI and foundry turnaround with a fair value closer to $52 per share. Another might focus on execution and competitive risks and anchor on a fair value nearer $16, and Narratives help you decide which view fits your own expectations.\n\nFor Intel however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Intel Narratives:\n🐂 Intel Bull Case\nFair value estimate: $37.27 per share\nImplied undervaluation vs last close: approximately 2.5%\nLong term revenue growth assumption: 5.56%\nExpects operational restructuring and portfolio focus to lift agility, profitability, and long term margins.\nSees AI products and a stronger foundry offering as key drivers of higher revenue, market share, and customer trust.\nRecognizes execution, AI transition, and macro risks, but concludes that today’s price still underestimates Intel’s recovery potential.\n🐻 Intel Bear Case\nFair value estimate: $28.47 per share\nImplied overvaluation vs last close: approximately 27.6%\nLong term revenue growth assumption: 5.9%\n\nAcknowledges Intel’s scale in PC and server CPUs and its broad exposure to the AI semiconductor opportunity.\nWarns that past manufacturing missteps and the challenge of hitting an aggressive process roadmap could limit a successful turnaround.\nFlags intense competition from AMD in CPUs and Nvidia in AI accelerators as headwinds that could keep growth and returns below what the current share price implies.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Intel?

      "Content": "Forget NVDA: 2 AI Stocks Crushing it in 2025 With More Upside Ahead\n\nTirthankar Chakraborty\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:05 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nINTC\n\nMU\n\nBBAI\n\nShares of the most sought-after tech stock on Wall Street, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, have surged 36.6% this year amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Ongoing demand for NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform, along with its competitive advantage in the AI hardware market, fueled growth. Demand for NVIDIA’s Blackwell chips remains strong, and the company plans to ship H200 AI chips to China ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nHowever, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions remain a risk and could pose a meaningful threat to NVIDIA’s future growth trajectory. NVIDIA also faces intensifying competition from rivals, including Advanced Micro Devices, Inc . AMD and Intel Corporation INTC, as data center capital expenditures continue to rise.\nTherefore, investors may look beyond NVIDIA at stocks that have outperformed it this year and still offer upside as the AI boom continues. Notable among them are Micron Technology, Inc . MU and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc . BBAI, whose shares have gained 228.8% and 43.6%, respectively, this year. Let’s take a closer look at why these stocks are compelling buys.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nReasons to Be Bullish on Micron Strong demand for Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips is expected to help the company deliver strong quarterly results. These chips have the inherent capacity to reduce power consumption and process large volumes of data. With AI infrastructure rapidly expanding, demand for HBM chips has accelerated.\n\nBanking on rising AI-led demand for HBM chips, Micron expects its revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to come in between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $13.64 billion for the fiscal first quarter, up 56.8% year over year, according to investors.micron.com. Analysts had projected revenues of around $12.88 billion.\nMicron expects earnings per share (EPS) of $8.22 to $8.62 for the fiscal second quarter, with its cloud memory business unit expected to perform particularly well. Micron’s expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a solid 23.5%.\nReasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai BigBear.ai’s shares were adversely impacted at the beginning of the year due to the Trump administration’s move to curb federal spending. Reduced funding may have affected BigBear.ai’s sales, but its top-line performance is expected to improve going forward, supported by the definitive $250 million agreement to acquire Ask Sage.\n\nAsk Sage is a fast-growing generative AI platform that has seen broad adoption, with users including the U.S. Space Force and the Defense Health Agency. It is designed for secure AI deployment in restricted fields such as defense and national security, according to ir.bigbear.ai. Ask Sage serves 100,000 users across 16,000 government teams, and with its acquisition, BigBear.ai expects full-year sales to reach $125 million to $140 million.\n\nStory Continues\nMoreover, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” could drive future growth for BigBear.ai, while the company’s robust cash position provides ample resources to support its expansion. The company reached a significant milestone toward profitability in the third quarter, and its expected earnings growth rate for the next year is a stellar 73.1%.\n\nWhile BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Micron sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "Content": "Quantum Enablers Poised for 40% Plus Growth in 2026: INTC, AVGO & TER\n\nUrmimala Biswas\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: QBTS\n\nLMT\n\nINTC\n\nAVGO\n\nIONQ\n\nThe pure quantum hardware sector, featuring companies like IonQ and D-Wave, has garnered significant attention. These firms have made tangible progress, securing government contracts, enterprise pilots and cloud integrations. Analysts characterize these pure plays as long-term prospects with growth potential but not guaranteed near-term earnings drivers for 2026.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that quantum offers no near-term investment opportunity. Instead, the more compelling path lies in quantum enablers - companies already generating revenues today by supplying the infrastructure, semiconductors, testing tools, cloud platforms and security frameworks required for quantum adoption at scale.\nSo, if the goal is to participate in quantum’s growth story with measurable financial outcomes in 2026, it makes sense to look beyond the flagship hardware makers and toward the ecosystem enabling quantum adoption today.\nHere in this article, we have discussed three such quantum computing enablers, Intel INTC, Broadcom AVGO and Teradyne TER, which are projected to report more than 40% earnings growth in 2026.\nThe Enabler Advantage: Real Revenues, Not Future Promises At present, several established semiconductor and enterprise technology companies are positioned to benefit from quantum development while being simultaneously projected to report solid earnings growth in 2026.\nAdvanced Micro Devices AMD, for example, is collaborating with IBM on hybrid high-performance computing and quantum workloads, leveraging its CPUs and accelerators within quantum-adjacent systems. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMD suggests roughly 58% earnings growth in 2026, driven primarily by data center demand rather than speculative quantum revenues.\n\nPost-Quantum Cryptography: Demand is Already Here Perhaps the most immediate quantum-linked opportunity lies in post-quantum cryptography. Governments and enterprises are racing to secure data against future quantum decryption risks, often referred to as “Q-Day.” Industry research and regulatory guidance increasingly emphasize early migration to quantum-resilient encryption standards.\n\nSEALSQ Corp. illustrates this trend. The company has commercialized secure chips with embedded post-quantum cryptography and expanded partnerships in defense and critical infrastructure, demonstrating real-world adoption rather than experimental pilots. The stock is projected to report 66.7% earnings growth in 2026.\nIn 2025, Lockheed Martin LMT advanced its role as a quantum enabler by moving quantum technologies closer to real defense applications, including a U.S. Department of Defense Innovation Unit contract to prototype a quantum-enabled inertial navigation system (QuINS) that can operate without GPS, in partnership with Q-CTRL and AOSense. The stock is projected to report 34.8% earnings growth in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\n2025 Stock Comparison of Quantum Enablers\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n3 Quantum Computing Enablers With Strong Growth Potential Intel : Its positioning as a quantum enabler rests on continued progress in scaling qubit counts and improving device performance using its legacy CMOS manufacturing infrastructure. By applying its 300 mm fabrication techniques to silicon spin qubits, Intel expects to incrementally increase qubit connectivity and fidelity, essential steps toward larger, more uniform qubit arrays while refining control and interconnect technologies. Continued collaboration with research institutions in 2026 should further accelerate collective understanding of qubit behavior and materials interface challenges, helping Intel contribute to the broader quantum ecosystem even as commercial fault-tolerant systems remain on a multi-year horizon.\n\nIntel, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, is expected to report earnings growth of 83.4% in 2026 on revenue growth of 3.3%. The stock has skyrocketed 81.4% in 2025.\nBroadcom : In 2025, Broadcom strengthened its position as a quantum enabler by embedding post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into enterprise networking and storage products, turning future quantum security risks into near-term demand. The company rolled out quantum-safe Fibre Channel and SAN solutions, including Emulex secure host bus adapters and Brocade Gen 8 Fibre Channel platforms, which integrate PQC and 256-bit encryption to protect data in motion across mission-critical infrastructure.\nIn 2026, Broadcom is positioned to benefit from rising demand for quantum-resilient infrastructure, driven by regulatory mandates such as CNSA 2.0, NIS2 and DORA and growing AI-led data center workloads, enabling quantum-linked growth without dependence on commercial quantum computers.\n\nBroadcom, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, is expected to report earnings growth of 42.5% in fiscal 2026 (ending October 2026) on revenue growth of 44.8%. The stock has gained 47.3% in 2025.\nTeradyne : In 2025, Teradyne strengthened its role as a quantum enabler by expanding its photonics and semiconductor test capabilities, highlighted by its acquisition of Quantifi Photonics, a specialist in photonic integrated circuit (PIC) testing.\nThe deal enhances Teradyne’s ability to deliver scalable PIC test solutions essential for optical interconnects used in high-performance and hybrid computing systems. Teradyne also introduced a high-volume, double-sided wafer probe test cell for silicon photonics with ficonTEC, supporting advanced electro-optical testing. These investments position Teradyne to benefit from rising demand for photonics, AI infrastructure, and high-performance computing test solutions, which underpin future quantum-adjacent ecosystems.\n\nTeradyne, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, is expected to report earnings growth of nearly 45% in 2026 on revenue growth of 22%. The stock has gained 56.7% in 2025. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Title": "Could AMD Finally Close the Gap on Nvidia AI Dominance?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/49aa4e22-9212-362e-8592-9c8a0a932cb6/could-amd-finally-close-the.html",
      "Content": "Could AMD Finally Close the Gap on Nvidia AI Dominance?\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nNVDA\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points Nvidia controls an estimated 80% of the AI accelerator market.\nExisting infrastructure and software reinforce Nvidia's dominance.\nDespite competitive challenges, AMD has earned business from key clients.\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\nThroughout its history, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has developed a reputation for closing or at least reducing the competitive gap with rivals. This was true when it challenged Intel 's supremacy in prior decades and, more recently, its clashes with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\n\nThis includes its rivalry with Nvidia in the AI accelerator market, and its upcoming releases have captured the attention of industry analysts. The question for investors is whether it is on the verge of catching up to Nvidia and ending its dominance. The more likely outcome is that AMD will narrow but not close the gap, and here's why.\nThe state of the AI accelerator market Indeed, the semiconductor industry appeared caught off guard when it became clear that Nvidia's AI accelerators powered OpenAI's game-changing GPT-4 AI platform in 2023. Nvidia was so far ahead of rivals that even now, Nvidia holds an estimated 80% of this market, according to a Susquehanna analyst.\n\nMoreover, closing the gap hinges on more than just processing power. Nvidia has its CUDA software platform, which has an army of loyal developers. That makes switching away from that architecture difficult.\nAdditionally, Nvidia offers rack-scale solutions that integrate with both its accelerators and CUDA. That presents an additional challenge to prospective competitors.\nNvidia is also growing faster. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2026, Nvidia reported 62% revenue growth. Its data center segment, which designs the accelerators and constitutes 89% of Nvidia's revenue, increased revenue by 65% during the same period.\nAMD's overall growth is also impressive, but not as rapid in either respect. In the first nine months of 2025, AMD's revenue rose by 36% year over year. Also, its data center segment makes up 46% of overall revenue, and during the period, the segment's revenue rose by 29%, slower than the overall gain.\n\nAMD's efforts to strike back Nonetheless, as bleak as that sounds, AMD bulls should remember that that is only one quarter, and data center segment growth is likely to improve along with its technology.\nDespite lagging behind, AMD has made headway in this market. The company has built strategic partnerships with OpenAI and Meta Platforms , and its accelerators support clouds for Microsoft 's Azure and Oracle 's Oracle Cloud. Moreover, Dell , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , and others have built servers with AMD's technology.\n\nStory Continues\nLooking forward, investors have focused on AMD's upcoming MI450 accelerator. The company has also claimed that the MI450 will surpass the performance of Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin accelerator.\nAdditionally, AMD relies on open-source software and can work with other tech ecosystems. That could wear away at Nvidia's software-driven competitive advantage as the industry grows.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia has struggled to keep up with demand, and AMD has traditionally sold its competing product at a lower cost. This gives companies all the more reason to consider AMD over Nvidia. Hence, if the MI450 can match or surpass the Vera Rubin, AMD could make significant competitive inroads.\nWill AMD close the gap with Nvidia? In the foreseeable future, investors should expect AMD to reduce but not completely close the competitive gap with Nvidia.\nIndeed, AMD has made significant efforts to catch up and has won business from several high-profile customers. If the MI450 matches or exceeds expectations, it could threaten AMD's dominance.\n\nUnfortunately for AMD, Nvidia is the established player in the AI accelerator market, and most companies are tied into its ecosystem. That means if AMD becomes the superior product, many of Nvidia's customers would likely be unable to switch to AMD without a tremendous disruption.\nUltimately, such conditions could be enough to stoke more rapid stock price increases for Advanced Micro Devices stock than Nvidia as the smaller company plays catch-up. However, investors should expect Nvidia to remain the leader in the AI accelerator industry for some time to come.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?
