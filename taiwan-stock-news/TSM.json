      "Content": "The Best Stocks to Buy With $1,000 for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Alphabet is considering selling its custom AI chips.\nTaiwan Semiconductor will thrive as long as AI spending stays elevated.\nAmazon is due for a comeback in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nWith 2026 quickly approaching, investors need to have a game plan for what stocks they will buy. Several interesting trends are brewing in the market, and may cause investors to think differently about how they want to invest. Still, I think some smart investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm could result in monster returns in 2026.\nThree smart stocks to buy with $1,000 right now for 2026 are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . All three of these are primed to outperform the market in 2026, making them great buys now.\nAlphabet Alphabet has been one of the best performing stocks in 2025, rising more than 60% so far. Alphabet's performance can be tied to multiple successes, including the continued dominance of its core business, Google Search; developing a leading generative AI model in Gemini; and considering selling its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to outside clients.\n\nThose are all significant developments that have answered many outstanding questions surrounding Alphabet's stock at the start of 2025, clearing the way for another successful year in 2026. Wall Street analysts expect Alphabet to grow its revenue by nearly 14% next year, which is impressive considering its business maturity. That isn't going to dramatically outperform the market, but it should be enough to propel Alphabet over the 10% threshold that many investors wish to exceed when picking individual stocks.\nAlphabet has transformed from an artificial intelligence laggard to an AI leader in 2026, and I believe that trend will continue to power the stock higher in 2026 and beyond.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Keeping up with which company is providing the best computing unit possible is exhausting. While Nvidia and its graphics processing units (GPUs) have dominated so far, other companies like Alphabet are starting to challenge its dominance. This sparring will go back and forth forever, but what won't change is where most of the chips are sourced from.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest foundry by revenue and is the primary source for high-end computing chips, such as those used in various computing units within AI data centers. As long as AI hyperscalers continue to build out their AI computing power, Taiwan Semiconductor will remain an excellent investment. With the AI hyperscalers informing investors that 2026 will be another year of record-setting capital expenditures, this thesis is on track.\n\nStory Continues\nTaiwan Semiconductor also trades for less than 23 times next year's earnings, making it the cheapest company on this list. Taiwan Semiconductor is set up for a great 2026 with all of the massive spending occurring, positioning it as a great stock to buy now.\nAmazon Amazon has had a disappointing 2025, with the stock essentially flat for the year. That's frustrating for investors, especially when stocks like Taiwan Semiconductor and Alphabet have done so well. However, this sets the stage for a comeback in 2026, especially behind the strength of its growing business units.\n\nWhile most view Amazon as an e-commerce company, that segment doesn't provide the majority of the profits. Instead, its cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services (AWS), does. In Q3, AWS generated the majority of Amazon's operating profits while growing revenue at a 20% pace. That's faster than the companywide 13% growth rate. When the most profitable business unit is also growing faster than the overall business, that's an excellent sign for investors.\nAnother area to watch is Amazon's advertising business. Amazon's ad business is the company's fastest-growing division, rising 24% in Q3. It has also grown to become a huge part of the business, allowing it to boost Amazon's margins as well.\nThe continued strength of both segments is key for 2026, and if they continue to do well, Amazon will make a comeback and be an excellent stock to buy and hold in 2026.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

You need a 'strong stomach': Dan Ives' strategy\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Julie Hyman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 11:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: PLTR\n\nCRWV\n\nAMD\n\nIVES\n\nMETA\n\nIn the AI trade, you \"can't just bet on one company,\" Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research, Dan Ives, tells Yahoo Finance, highlighting the importance of diversification for AI investors.\nWatch the video above to hear more about Ives' AI thesis and the 30 stocks in the Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF ( IVES ).\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nThere's another stock I want to ask you about, and that is CoreWeave, which as you know, has sold off pretty sharply. Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In particular, semiconductor stocks including Nvidia , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , and Broadcom were all ushered into the trillion-dollar club thanks to the AI revolution.\nAs investment in AI infrastructure continues to unfold, I think it's likely that chip stocks will remain sound investment choices. But as 2026 approaches, I see a different tech titan taking center stage: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) .\nLet's dig into how Alphabet has built an AI fortress poised to dominate the future. From there, I'll explore the company's valuation trends and make the case for why now is a great time to buy Alphabet stock hand over fist.\nIt's been a quiet three years for Alphabet...until now The AI revolution kicked off almost exactly three years ago when OpenAI commercially launched ChatGPT. ChatGPT quickly captured the imaginations of people all over the world with its ability to answer virtually any question instantly.\nThe dramatic rise in popularity among large language models (LLMs) caused some on Wall Street to pose the idea that traditional search tools like Google were headed for doom. Think of the business stakes at hand here: Why would advertisers continue paying a premium on platforms like Google and YouTube when everyone's attention was flocking to chatbots?\n\nWhile Alphabet's advertising business did show some signs of stalling, the company's cash cow remained somewhat resilient. For a couple of years, revenue from Google and YouTube wasn't as robust as it once was, but it also wasn't plummeting at an alarming rate.\nWhat many investors were overlooking, however, was Alphabet's other ventures. At the beginning of the AI revolution, Google Cloud was operating at an annual revenue run rate of about $29 billion. Meanwhile, this segment of Alphabet's business was unprofitable.\nFast forward to today, and Google Cloud is now on pace for more than $50 billion of annual sales while boasting positive operating income. What's even more interesting is that Google Cloud has won major deals with both OpenAI and Anthropic -- the two LLMs that were once seen as the ultimate existential threat to Google's relevancy.\n\nStory Continues\nBesides the success of its cloud division, Alphabet has also successfully launched its own LLM -- called Gemini. According to management, Gemini has over 650 million monthly active users (MAUs) while search queries are increasing threefold quarter over quarter.\nWhy 2026 could be epic for Gemini For most of the AI revolution, I think the consensus view around Alphabet was one of uncertainty. While not everyone bought into the extinction of Google narrative, it's fair to say that it took some time for Alphabet to prove its AI ambitions were bearing fruit.\nOne of the biggest catalysts the company has going into next year is an extension of Google Cloud through commercializing custom hardware. Specifically, Alphabet's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), known as tensor processing units (TPUs), have seen some early traction with Apple and Anthropic.\n\nWhile TPUs aren't going to dethrone Nvidia's GPU business anytime soon, I think Alphabet is on the cusp of unlocking a new wave of growth in the cloud infrastructure market that's currently dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure.\nAlphabet stock could soar to new highs next year As of this writing, Alphabet's forward price to earnings (P/E) ratio is hovering around 28 -- its highest level during the AI boom.\nNormally, I tend to stay away from momentum stocks. More times than not, by the time a company reaches a record high, it's dicey to buy the premium and expect shares to move materially higher.\nThis is a rare instance where I think the opposite is true. Alphabet's current price increase reflects two factors: An appreciation for the company's current operating performance and a bullish outlook that Alphabet will keep up its strong performance.\n\nAlphabet's ecosystem -- from search, cloud computing, consumer electronics, custom hardware, and more -- is a major differentiator compared to its mega cap peers. The company has a unique flexibility stitched into its DNA -- benefiting from AI across its various assets and subsidiaries during any market cycle. These dynamics position Alphabet as a particularly durable business for the long run.\nAs investments in AI infrastructure are expected to continue rising going into next year, I expect Alphabet to benefit from these tailwinds more so than any one singular chip designer or software developer.\nWith this in mind, I think Alphabet will continue to show signs of accelerating revenue and profit margin expansion across its entire business next year -- which should lead to even more buying from shareholders. Against this backdrop, I see Alphabet as the best opportunity in the AI landscape as 2026 approaches.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?

Reuters reported on December 17 that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is among the two stocks in the chip equipment space that Morgan Stanley is the most constructive on, with the other being Applied Materials. The firm told investors in a note that the biggest debate is AI semis for the third consecutive year, where the “index weighting is dominated by the processor names, and the (so far) insatiable appetite for compute is the most important variable to consider.”\nIn a separate development, Bank of America Securities analyst Mike Yang reaffirmed a Buy rating on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) on December 10 and set a price target of $390.\nThe rating update followed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s (NYSE:TSM) release of its November 2025 revenue report. Revenue for November 2025 on a consolidated basis reached around NT$343.61 billion, reflecting a drop of 6.5% from October 2025 and an increase of 24.5% compared to November 2024.\n\nThe company further reported that revenue for January through November of 2025 reached a total of NT$3,474.05 billion, which translates to a growth of 32.8% compared to the same period in 2024.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the largest contract semiconductor manufacturer in the world. Some of its prominent customers include semiconductor companies that outsource all or part of their chip production, including Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, Broadcom, and more.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Intel stock soared in 2025. But the chipmaker still has a long road ahead.\n\nLaura Bratton\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nSFTBY\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nSFTBF\n\nFor Intel ( INTC ), 2025 was an eventful year, but not one that necessarily changed its narrative .\nThe storied American chipmaker got a new CEO and won massive investments from the US government , Nvidia ( NVDA ), and SoftBank ( SFTBY ). Those developments helped push the stock up 86% for the year, ahead of gains for the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks and Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ). At the same time, Intel's crucial manufacturing segment still lacks a major external customer — something it needs to make the cash-bleeding business viable.\n\n\"Intel's exiting the year with some optimism that they will be a relevant chip manufacturer in the US at some point in time ... and that was definitely an uncertain statement at the start of the year,\" MorningStar analyst Brian Colello told Yahoo Finance.\nAt the same time, he noted, \"There wasn't the massive sort of deal that really establishes Intel, either, in manufacturing.\"\n\nThe company's technology is largely responsible for the digital revolution and Silicon Valley's reputation as a global innovation hub: Intel invented the world's first microprocessors, or computer chips, and the x86 architecture, a critical blueprint for designing computer chips. Its co-founder Gordon Moore created Moore's Law, a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. The company has continued to make its own computer chips, even as the rest of the industry has gone \"fabless\" — outsourcing manufacturing to firms like Taiwan's TSMC ( TSM ).\n\nBut years of missteps and poor investment decisions put Intel's manufacturing segment behind TSMC, which in turn caused its products to lose their edge to competitors. As its chips — CPUs for servers, laptops, and desktops — have lost market share to rivals AMD and Arm ( ARM ), its manufacturing business has been stripped of the scale it needs to remain viable.\nFour years of an aggressive turnaround effort by former CEO Pat Gelsinger to revive Intel's manufacturing arm by opening it to outside customers sent investors fleeing. The massive amount of spending required to reboot the foundry, along with its uncertain success, spooked Wall Street.\nThe arrival of Lip-Bu Tan , who was named chief executive in March following the board's ousting of Gelsinger in late 2024, began to renew faith in the company's potential turnaround. While Intel's strategy remains mostly unchanged under Tan, analysts explained, investors have applauded his sober tone, cost-cutting measures, and wide-ranging industry connections.\n\nStory continues\nThat tepid faith transformed into confidence when the US government made a rare $9 billion investment in the company — albeit funds Intel was supposed to get anyway from the Biden-era CHIPS Act — following Tan's tiff with President Trump over the CEO's business ties to China.\nOnshoring semiconductor manufacturing has been a focus of the US government since the pandemic highlighted the risk of a tech supply chain reliant on Taiwan. Escalating tensions with China, including the threat of a Taiwan invasion, have further intensified the sense of urgency.\n\n\"Semiconductors are not only economically important, they're actually important from a national security perspective,\" Technalysis analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \"Intel has by far the largest infrastructure in place as a true, real American company.\"\nMany critics believe the broader US turn toward state capitalism under Trump, exemplified by the Intel investment, raises questions about national security and the government's conflicting interests. But analysts say the US government's 10% stake in Intel could lead to various positive outcomes for the company, such as Intel having a say in trade policy that affects semiconductors. More importantly, the US could step in to incentivize or force a major company like Apple to use the chipmaker's foundry.\n\nA $2 billion investment from SoftBank and $5 billion from Nvidia further boosted investor sentiment on Intel stock. The cash infusion helped stem the company's steep losses as it figures out a path forward. Notably, though, the Nvidia deal didn't include an agreement for Intel's foundry business to manufacture the AI giant's chips.\n'Everything hinges on 14A' Intel's biggest potential customers for its foundry business — Nvidia, Apple ( AAPL ), and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) — are also, to some degree, competitors of its products arm and have longstanding relationships with TSMC. Not to mention, TSMC is building $165 billion worth of manufacturing capacity in the US, diminishing the geopolitical argument for those companies to use Intel to produce their chips.\nTo win those customers, Intel will need to prove that its latest generation manufacturing processes are up to snuff. The chipmaker's 18A process, a massive technological feat initially marketed to outside customers, is now being used primarily to make Intel's own products. Whether those products — Intel's upcoming Panther Lake chips for PCs and Clearwater Forest chips for data centers — succeed could help convince companies to use its next-generation processes called 18AP and 14A, analysts said.\n\nAlready, rumors have circulated that Apple could use Intel's manufacturing, specifically its 18AP process, for its lowest-end computer chips.\nIntel has 12 to 18 months to secure a big external customer for 14A in order for that process to continue as planned, BNB Paribas analyst David O'Connor estimated.\nHe called the process \"the crux of Intel being successful on the foundry business or not, or potentially even exiting manufacturing long term.\"\n\"Everything hinges on 14A and the success of that,\" O'Connor said.\nOther analysts gave longer timelines for when Intel would see a turnaround.\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said, \"It took 10 years to break it. Why would it take less than 10 years to fix it?\"\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Bluesky @laurabratton.bsky.social.

      "Content": "1 Must-Own Artificial Intelligence Stock for the Next Decade\n\nJustin Pope, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 12:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nKey Points The global semiconductor market could grow in value to $2 trillion by 2040.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing dominates the foundry industry, and produces most of the AI chips sold today.\nAlthough there may be volatility along the way, TSMC is well positioned for profitable growth over the next 10 years.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nU.N. economic experts forecast that the artificial intelligence (AI) market will grow in value to $4.8 trillion by 2033, and it's likely to grow far larger than that in the decade that follows. Along the way, it's going to produce some life-changing investment opportunities, just as the internet era did before it.\nMoreover, you don't necessarily need to succeed in predicting the next big thing to profit from it. Some AI stocks already stand out as no-brainer winners for the future.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , often referred to as TSMC, is one of them. It's arguably the ideal pick-and-shovel stock for the AI era. The company has immense growth potential and has already begun to show signs of realizing it.\nDominating a $2 trillion market opportunity It may not seem like it yet, but artificial intelligence systems are destined to be embedded in far more places than data centers. Over the coming years, we can expect AI to infiltrate many existing industries and also to create new ones. Autonomous vehicles and humanoid robotics are already on the way.\n\nThe common denominator among data centers, AI models, robots, self-driving vehicles, and the rest of that developing technology? Semiconductors, aka chips. Research from Deloitte estimates that the global semiconductor industry could grow from $627 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2030, and to $2 trillion by 2040.\nMost companies that sell chips don't actually manufacture them. Instead, they design them, but outsource production to a foundry specialist. TSMC has long been the global leader in that business, with an estimated market share of 72% as of the third quarter of 2025.\nTSMC's market share has actually increased since the AI boom began a few years ago. The company's advanced production technologies and capacity to manufacture large quantities of high-end chips give it tremendous competitive advantages over other foundries.\n\nIt also means that TSMC should capture a significant portion of the new growth that will flow into the industry as global semiconductor demand increases in the coming years.\nThe investment cycle likely isn't over yet The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical, experiencing boom and bust phases as investments in chips fluctuate and production capacity lags and then exceeds demand. You can see how TSMC's revenue growth has followed that pattern over time. It's fair to wonder how long the current AI investment cycle will last, especially as some tech companies face questions about how they will fund their ambitious data center plans.\n\nLeer más\nWhile the current AI chip cycle will eventually turn over, it doesn't seem like it's on its last legs yet.\nNvidia has touted a $500 billion order book through the end of next year for its current top-of-the-line Blackwell GPUs and the Rubin architecture chips that will succeed them next year. Some hyperscalers, such as Amazon and Alphabet , have developed their own custom AI accelerator chips. Yet TSMC manufactures them, too.\n\nIn short, regardless of which chipmaker is selling a particular AI chip, TSMC is likely to have manufactured it.\nHow to profit amid potential volatility Even if AI infrastructure investments slow, it doesn't mean long-term investors should abandon Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Despite short-term fluctuations in its growth, the company's revenue has increased by 335% over the past decade. As long as the industry continues to grow over the long term, TSMC should grow with it.\n\nThe stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28 times full-year earnings estimates. That's a compelling valuation for a company that analysts estimate will grow earnings by 28% annually over the next three to five years.\nAdmittedly, it's also possible that its earnings could be near their peak for the current investment cycle. If AI spending declines and TSMC's revenue growth slows, that will hurt the stock's valuation and share price. Rather than trying to time these things, investors who want to add TSMC to their portfolios would probably be better off using dollar-cost averaging, building their investment slowly and reducing their risk of buying at a short-term peak.\nUnless the AI megatrend completely unravels, which doesn't seem likely given the public and private sector commitments to developing AI technology, TSMC is likely to see enough growth over the next decade to make it worthwhile to ride out the inevitable peaks and valleys.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Be Worth More Than $2 Trillion by 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMETA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nBRK.A\n\nKey Points Tesla is operating in a difficult environment.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are providing computing units for the AI build-out.\nMeta Platforms' stock was slammed due to spending plans.\n10 stocks we like better than Broadcom ›\nThere are currently five stocks that have a valuation of $2 trillion or more. Outside of these five, only a handful of others are in a position to be worth $2 trillion or more in 2026: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) , Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\n\nThe next largest company is Berkshire Hathaway , which has a market cap of about $1 trillion. For that stock to double would be a huge feat, especially without Warren Buffett at the helm, so let's put it aside.\nNow we're left with Meta, Tesla, Broadcom, and TSMC. Which of these will make it to $2 trillion by the end of 2026?\nAll will beat the market if they reach $2 trillion by 2026 The largest is Meta Platforms, sitting at a $1.66 trillion valuation. The smallest is Taiwan Semiconductor at $1.49 billion. That places all four of these stocks in relatively close proximity to each other, which means the required return is fairly similar. Meta would need to rise 21% while Taiwan Semiconductor must rise 34%. Both of these potential performance figures would indicate a market-beating stock, so if any of these companies can breach the $2 trillion threshold, they will likely be great to own.\nThe $2 trillion threshold is also uncharted territory for this group. Both Meta and Broadcom have come close, but neither has crossed into the $2 trillion zone.\nI think three will make it, while one will be left out If you sort the companies by growth rates, it's clear that there's one outlier: Tesla.\nIt's no secret that Tesla is struggling in the current environment, due to electric vehicle (EV) credits ending from the U.S. government. Meanwhile, the other three are posting incredible growth rates that don't look to be slowing down anytime soon in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips in the artificial intelligence supply chain. Without its production capabilities, none of the AI computing power we know now would be possible. Demand for AI chips isn't slowing down, and Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to continue growing at a rapid 21% pace in 2026, according to Wall Street analysts. However, these analysts have consistently underestimated Taiwan Semiconductor's growth over the past few years, so don't be surprised if TSMC outperforms these expectations. Couple that with the second-cheapest valuation in this group, and Taiwan Semiconductor should reach the $2 trillion mark in 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nMeta Platforms nearly entered the $2 trillion club, but pulled back following a poorly received third-quarter earnings report. While the business's performance was incredible, investors didn't like Meta's massive spending plans. There is growing concern that Meta is overextending itself, which is why investors have started selling off the stock. However, I think Meta is just the first company to max out its cash flows being devoted to AI computing capacity, and it won't be the last. The market will come back around to Meta's stock in 2026 and will send it back to levels allowing it to reach the $2 trillion point.\n\nLast is Broadcom, which also sold off due to 2026 guidance. Wall Street wanted greater visibility into faster AI growth, and Broadcom told investors they needed to be patient. Still, Broadcom informed investors that its Q4 AI revenue was $6.5 billion, up 74% year over year, and that it projects Q1's growth to be north of 100%. Broadcom is a much larger business than just AI, and the business isn't nearly as successful in those endeavors. Still, I think sustained growth from its custom AI computing units will drive Broadcom's stock higher in 2026, allowing it to reach the $2 trillion threshold.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now? Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 1:35 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nMU\n\nAVGO\n\nAMD\n\nKey Points Nvidia stock has underperformed its peers in the semiconductor space this year.\nThe company's valuation is becoming cheaper despite its historic operating performance.\nNvidia has a number of catalysts going into 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWhen it comes to leading semiconductor stocks, investors don't need to look much further than companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing , Broadcom , Advanced Micro Devices , Micron Technology , and of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) .\nWhile Nvidia has been the headline act for much of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, shares have lagged its chip peers throughout 2025.\nAs 2026 draws closer, growth investors may be wondering if Nvidia remains a good buy , or if now is the time to rotate capital away from the world's most valuable company and seek new opportunities.\nWhat should Nvidia investors be on the lookout for in 2026? For the last three years, Wall Street's primary focus surrounding Nvidia is the performance of its data center business. This segment accounts for the bulk of Nvidia's revenue and profits, as it captures demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPU).\nThroughout the AI revolution, investors have paid close attention to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's commentary around the company's Hopper and Blackwell GPU architectures. While Blackwell remains an important catalyst for Nvidia, investors should start to pay closer attention to guidance around the upcoming Rubin chips. So far, investors have already gotten a small preview of demand for Rubin.\n\nFor instance, Huang recently noted that Nvidia has a total order backlog of around $500 billion for Blackwell, Rubin, and accompanying networking products. Of note, a portion of this revenue has already been booked, with an estimated $300 billion expected to be recognized during 2026.\nIn addition, Anthropic recently signed a $30 billion compute capacity agreement with Microsoft . As part of the deal, Anthropic will be leveraging clusters of Blackwell and Rubin chips.\nAt a macro level, Goldman Sachs estimates that hyperscalers including Microsoft, Alphabet , Amazon , and Meta Platforms will spend roughly $500 billion on AI capital expenditures (capex) next year. Taking this one step further, McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion opportunity over the next five years.\nAgainst this backdrop, investors should monitor how these secular tailwinds fueling accelerated investment in infrastructure continue to impact Nvidia, being aware that rising infrastructure will impact Nvidia well beyond its core data center operation.\n\nStory Continues\nThroughout next year and beyond, Nvidia's opportunities in adjacent markets, including next-generation CPUs and accelerated computing operating systems, should begin to come into focus as well, thanks to some savvy partnerships with Intel and Palantir Technologies .\nNvidia's valuation trends are getting interesting In the table, I've summarized Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, as of the end of each quarter over the last year.\nMetric\nCurrent\n3Q25\n2Q25\n1Q25\n4Q24\nPrice-to-sales (P/S)\n23.3\n30.2\n29.6\n20.7\n26.4\nForward price-to-earnings (P/E)\n23.4\n31.5\n57.4\n24.8\n28.1\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance.\nThere are two anomalies that stick out from the data.\nFirst, Nvidia's valuation multiples experienced notable compression during the company's first fiscal quarter of 2025 (ended April 30). This was driven by uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, as well as fear that a Chinese start-up called DeepSeek could pose a threat to U.S. dominance in the AI landscape.\n\nThe second theme that's beginning to become more noticeable is that Nvidia's P/S and forward P/E ratios are hovering around the same levels as their prior lows earlier this year. Once again, I think this contraction revolves around fear more than anything else. Specifically, investors are concerned about rising competition from AMD and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from Broadcom.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy heading into the new year? While rising competition in the chip space is a very real thing, I don't see Nvidia necessarily losing its grip anytime soon. AI infrastructure is expected to be a multitrillion-dollar market that lasts several years. Buying into the idea that the hyperscalers will migrate away from Nvidia's GPUs overnight is unrealistic.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is becoming cheaper by the day despite the company operating at historic levels and signing new deals and partnerships -- effectively broadening its total addressable market (TAM) beyond data center services and simultaneously bringing new levels of business visibility as the AI infrastructure era kicks off.\nI think now is a great time to buy the dip and capitalize on the chip king's ongoing sell-off. Investors with a long-term time horizon could use the recent depressed price action to add to a core buy-and-hold position. Given these dynamics, I see Nvidia as a no-brainer heading into the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "The Ultimate Stock to Buy for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 6:35 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points When it comes to making chips, all major computing companies turn to Taiwan Semiconductor.\nIts chip fabrication business provides the critical production capacity needed by the industry.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is launching a new technology that could solve the energy crisis.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nFinding the ultimate stock to buy for 2026 is no easy task. First, you have to address whether the stock will come from an AI-related field or not. There are growing fears of an AI bubble forming, but those fears are negated by real money being spent by the AI hyperscalers, who are racing to build out as much computing capacity as possible. I think one of the best stocks to buy for 2026 comes from this industry, and it's a key supplier.\nWhile I'll entertain an argument of whether Nvidia 's dominance is slipping, what isn't up for debate is how much is being spent on AI infrastructure. After setting records in 2025, the AI hypercalers look to be setting a new record on data center capital expenditures again in 2026. There are several companies positioned to take advantage of that buildout, but none is in a better spot than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a neutral party in the AI arms race Taiwan Semiconductor is a chip fabrication business and sells its production capacity to various companies in the chip realm. Taiwan Semiconductor is regarded as the top company in its industry, which is why nearly all of the major computing unit designers partner with Taiwan Semiconductor. It doesn't matter if the computing unit being purchased is from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , or Broadcom ; chances are, it has a chip from TSMC in it.\n\nThis places Taiwan Semiconductor in a neutral position, as it benefits from increased spending regardless of which computing unit is the most popular. The trends are clearly in favor of increased data center spending, and that trend isn't expected to slow down anytime soon.\nNvidia believes that the global data center capital expenditures will rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. Not all of that money will flow toward computing, as there are also construction and land costs to consider. AMD offered a similar projection, as they believe the compute market will be worth $1 trillion by 2030. This bodes well for Taiwan Semiconductor, as it will be providing the chips to power most of these data centers.\nHowever, one issue that may hamper the growth of the industry is power capacity. It's no secret that we could be headed for an energy shortage in the near future, and doing everything possible to consume less energy to maximize computing performance is critical.\n\nStory Continues\nTaiwan Semiconductor understands this, which is why its latest technology is focused on improving energy consumption. Its next generation of chips, 2nm (nanometer), promises to consume 25% to 30% less energy when configured for the same speed as its 3nm predecessor. That's a huge jump in efficiency, and may be what's needed to keep the AI buildout going.\n\nThese chips are entering production right now and will boost Taiwan Semiconductor's finances throughout 2026. However, Taiwan Semiconductor is also doing incredibly well right now.\nTSMC provides incredible performance at a low price In its most recent quarter, Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue rose at a 41% pace in U.S. dollar terms, placing it among the fastest-growing big tech stocks. With the AI buildout not expected to slow down anytime soon, Taiwan Semiconductor should be able to keep this growth rate up for several years.\nDespite its strong growth, the stock really doesn't have a premium price tag assigned to it.\nAt 23 times next year's earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor doesn't carry a premium price tag. It is priced lower than its peers, with AMD trading at 32 times next year's earnings, Broadcom at 25, and Nvidia at 24.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is reasonably priced and is slated to deliver impressive growth over the next few years. As a result, I think it's the ultimate stock to buy now, as it's set to benefit regardless of which computing unit the AI hyperscalers are using. All it needs to succeed is for the AI hyperscalers to continue spending heavily, and they are primed to do just that.\n\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

The company operates two primary business segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.\nOn the semiconductor side, Broadcom is the leader in custom ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) designed specifically for data center AI workloads.\n\nASICs are specialized chips built to exact specifications for hyperscalers such as Google (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN), which need massive computing power.\nThe infrastructure software segment, which includes the VMware acquisition, provides enterprise software for planning, developing, automating, managing, and securing applications across different platforms.\nWith roots in the technical heritage of AT&T/Bell Labs, Lucent, and Hewlett-Packard/Agilent, Broadcom combines more than 60 years of innovation with global scale and engineering depth. The company serves the world’s most successful tech companies by focusing on technologies that connect our world.\nCEO Hock Tan explained the strategy at the Goldman Sachs technology conference: Broadcom is laser-focused on about seven customers building large language models and racing toward what he calls “super intelligence.” These companies are collectively spending around $30 billion annually on AI compute infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nRather than pursuing thousands of enterprise customers who might spend $10 million each on merchant GPUs, Broadcom sees its biggest opportunity in providing custom chips and networking infrastructure for these hyperscalers building AI at unprecedented scale.\nWhy Did JPMorgan Upgrade Broadcom Stock? JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur pointed to the continued surge in capital expenditure by hyperscalers and the consequent rise in demand for ASIC chips as key drivers for Broadcom’s growth.\nBroadcom reported Q4 2025 revenue of $18.02 billion, up 28% year over year. The semiconductor segment jumped 35% to $11.07 billion, while the high-margin infrastructure software segment grew 19% to $6.94 billion.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, Broadcom’s revenue hit $63.9 billion, a 24% increase driven overwhelmingly by AI, which saw revenue grow 65% year-over-year to $20 billion.\nBut here’s where it gets really interesting: Broadcom forecasts its AI business will hit $8.2 billion in Q1 2026 alone, marking roughly 100% year-over-year growth. And Tan revealed that his compensation package tied to 2030 targets includes achieving AI revenue over $120 billion — a sixfold increase from the $20 billion generated in fiscal 2025.\nOne customer prospect turned into over $10 billion in orders expected in the second half of fiscal 2026—a major driver behind this is that Broadcom designs and manufactures Google’s custom TPU chips, a specialized ASIC built specifically for AI tasks rather than general-purpose computing (GPU). Google’s latest TPUv7 chip is performing better than expected and attracting major customers like Anthropic and Meta, with Anthropic alone committing to potentially 1 million units.\n\nWall Street Doubled Down Many investors have been trying to make the most of the AI trade, but when AVGO dipped over 27% in Q1 2025 — hitting a yearly low of $138 in April — that was a green light for some of Wall Street’s most famous money managers.\nThese investors spotted what Michael Burry later articulated in his new Substack: while 40%-50% of hyperscaler spending goes to Nvidia GPUs with “ever shorter product cycles,” Broadcom is positioned differently.\n\nBurry specifically named Broadcom alongside Google, Amazon, and Microsoft as “very well-funded” and capable of challenging Nvidia’s dominance.\nMajor Q1 2025 buyers included:\nJeremy Grantham (GMO): Bought over 1.5 million shares despite calling AI a bubble. His fund holds a $291 million position in Broadcom versus just $21 million in Nvidia — nearly 14x more exposure to AVGO than NVDA.\nRenaissance Technologies: Purchased over 2.4 million shares, massively increasing its stake. Regarded as the most successful hedge fund of all time, Renaissance’s bet signals strong conviction in Broadcom’s differentiated positioning.\nTwo Sigma Advisors: Bought around 2.5 million shares, bringing its total position to 3.9 million shares — the largest holding since Q3 2024 when Broadcom traded at just $159 versus Q1’s average of $211.\nBridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio): Added 280,000 shares, betting that Broadcom’s custom ASIC strategy offers structural advantages over commodity GPU manufacturers.\n\nThe stock has since recovered to around $330. While Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting hit other AI stocks, Broadcom’s $73 billion backlog of multi-year contracts with just 7-10 customers provides revenue certainty that short-cycle GPU sales can’t match.\nIs Broadcom a Buy? Broadcom stock has pulled back from December highs near $415 to around $330. If you’ve been on the sidelines, here are three bullish indicators worth considering:\n1. The structural moat is different. While Nvidia sells commodity GPUs facing shorter product cycles and growing competition, Broadcom has locked in $73 billion in backlog with just 7-10 hyperscaler customers through multi-year custom chip contracts. These aren’t off-the-shelf components that competitors can easily replicate.\n\n2. Wall Street’s smartest money doubled down. Renaissance Technologies, Jeremy Grantham, Two Sigma, and Ray Dalio all bought aggressively when the stock dipped in Q1. Grantham holds 14 times more Broadcom than Nvidia despite calling AI a bubble, betting that custom ASICs offer better risk-adjusted returns than merchant chip sales.\n3. Broadcom (mostly) dodged the Burry selloff. Michael Burry’s warnings about hyperscaler capex accounting triggered the recent tech selloff, but he specifically named Broadcom as well-positioned to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. The company’s custom chip focus sidesteps the depreciation and replacement cycle concerns hitting pure-play GPU manufacturers.\nThe stock trades at 61x earnings, but with 100% AI revenue growth and signed contracts providing multi-year visibility, Broadcom offers a differentiated AI infrastructure play built on structural advantages rather than pure momentum and hype.\nOn the date of publication, Justin Estes did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The belated November inflation reading helped, as did a jobs number that supported future rate cuts. Money continues to move into the market even as there are signs of sector rotation.\n\nHowever, the macro story remains mixed. Investors got hit with weak November housing data to end the week, which could weigh down overall sentiment.\nNext week will be a shortened trading week due to the Christmas holiday. Markets will be closed that day and close at 1:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve.\n&rarr; 3 Cheap Dividend Stocks That Can Beat Inflation and Pay You to Wait\nArticles by Thomas Hughes\nThomas Hughes reminded investors that concerns about an AI bubble may persist. However, the results from a company like Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) tell a more bullish story. The company delivered exceptional results backed by strong demand. Technical signals point to as much as 60% upside for MU stock.\n&rarr; Forget the Chips: 4 Industrial Plays for the AI Rebound\n\nA major story from this week was the Trump administration&rsquo;s reclassification of cannabis as a Schedule III drug. Earlier in the week, Hughes explained how the cannabis industry would benefit, which stocks stand to benefit, but also why upside may be limited until institutional dollars flow into the sector.\nHughes also recapped why MongoDB Inc. (NASDAQ: MDB) has been a strong performer in 2025. As Hughes noted, the company was recognized as an essential component of AI infrastructure in 2025. Bullish sentiment from analysts and institutions suggests MDB stock has room to run.\n&rarr; Nike Beats on Earnings But Struggles in China and Faces Tariffs\nArticles by Sam Quirke\nAppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is one of the best-performing and most highly shorted stocks of 2025. Sam Quirke explained this contradiction and provided support for a bull case, which could lead to a short squeeze.\n\nQuirke also looked at the ongoing drop in Nutanix Inc. (NASDAQ: NTNX), which continues after the company&rsquo;s earnings report. But Quirke explained why the report may not have been as bad as it seemed, which means NTNX stock may set up as a comeback trade.\nAfter a strong run of more than 120% since April, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock appears to be extended. However, Quirke provided investors with two reasons to believe TSLA stock may still be a bargain.\nArticles by Chris Markoch\nIf analysts are correct, inflation will make a comeback in 2026. That&rsquo;s why investors may look at dividend stocks that can outpace the rate of inflation. This week, Chris Markoch pointed investors to three high-yield dividend stocks that are less than $20 per share.\n\nStory Continues\nSticking with the inflation theme, Markoch noted that the long end of the yield curve remains stubbornly high despite the recent interest rate cuts. That could make these three finance stocks an attractive alternative to rising 10-year Treasury rates.\nBeef prices continue to be higher, and analysts believe it will be more of the same in 2026. It will take years to unwind the root problem at the core of the supply shortage. In the meantime, Markoch highlighted three steakhouse stocks that are managing the rising costs in different ways.\n\nArticles by Ryan Hasson\nOne of the most exciting headlines this week came from SpaceX, which hinted at an initial public offering (IPO) in 2026. This week, Ryan Hasson explained why Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) would be a beneficiary of a SpaceX IPO.\nThere are clear signs of sector rotation in the market. Finance stocks are seeing some of the biggest inflows of capital. Hasson highlighted the breakout in the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA: XLF) and why three of its largest components show bullish technical setups near breakout levels.\nIndustrial stocks continue to be among the top performers in 2025. Hasson highlighted three of the best industrial stock options for investors who are looking to capitalize on this growth heading into 2026.\n\nArticles by Leo Miller\nThe battle over who will buy Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) took a surprise turn when Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ: PSKY) entered the ring with an all-cash $30 per share counter bid to that made by Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX). This week, Leo Miller provided a breakdown of both bids and what investors should watch for.\nFreeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) stock is recovering from a sharp sell-off after the closure of its Grasburg mine. Miller explained the stock&rsquo;s recent rally and why the surge in copper prices, fueled by long-term tailwinds, is likely to keep FCX stock surging.\nThe flight from technology stocks has sent some stocks dropping sharply from their 52-week highs. Miller highlighted three tech stocks down 60% or more and explained why one of those stocks offers the best chance at a recovery.\n\nArticles by Nathan Reiff\nArtificial intelligence continues to spur interest in robotics stocks. Nathan Reiff explained the tailwinds that will push the sector higher and three under-the-radar robotics stocks that may not be obscure names for much longer.\nCompanies with a strong cash flow are frequently able to reward investors with share buybacks and dividends. This week, Reiff looked at three of the best cash flow stocks that should be on the radar for investors who want income to go along with future stock price growth.\nIt's the time of year when many people think about New Year&rsquo;s resolutions. For investors, that could mean looking at beaten-down stocks that are ready to reverse. That&rsquo;s what Reiff focused on in three stocks that analysts believe could see brighter days ahead in 2026.\n\nArticles by Dan Schmidt\nIt may feel like the return of the meme stocks as Upwork Inc. (NASDAQ: UPWK) has been one of the strongest performers in 2025. Dan Schmidt analyzed the surge in UPWK stock and gave investors three reasons to be bullish and two reasons to be bearish heading into the new year.\nArticles by Jeffrey Neal Johnson\nInvestors are frequently caught off guard when a stock gets separated from its story. That seemed to be the case with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM) that is down sharply after its November revenue report. But Jeffrey Neal Johnson explained why the price action is largely due to high-speed algorithmic trading, which could set up an opportunity for patient investors.\nA similar story is emerging with SuperMicro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI). The stock dropped over concerns about waning demand. However, Johnson pointed out that this looks to be a case of a stock falling in sympathy with the sector, and why SMCI stock still looks like a solid buying opportunity.\n\nAnother stock that has dropped sharply on recent news is ServiceNow Inc. (NYSE: NOW). Analysts are choking on the company&rsquo;s $7 billion acquisition of Armis. Johnson explains why the deal is a sign of strength more than weakness and is creating a rare buying opportunity in an elite software name.\nArticles by Jordan Chussler\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) stock has struggled to find a catalyst after its vaccine-fueled surge in 2020 and 2021. Jordan Chussler outlined the company&rsquo;s billion-dollar investment to push into a crowded GLP-1 weight loss market. There&rsquo;s room for more than one company to succeed, and Chussler explained why PFE stock may be worth waiting for.\nIt's ironic that Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO), which was the poster child of the excesses of the dot-com era, is in the middle of a long-term recovery fueled by AI. That irony wasn&rsquo;t lost on Chussler, who explained how the company has reinvented and repositioned itself for a new generation of investors.\nChussler also highlighted two of the tech sector&rsquo;s strongest performers in 2025, but pointed out why some analysts believe investors may want to mute their expectations for each company in 2026.\nThe article \" MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/15 - 12/19 \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "These 2 AI Giants Could Soar in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 3:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor will thrive regardless of which computing unit is being used the most.\nBroadcom's custom AI accelerators may steal some of the new workload coming online.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nNvidia has been a dominant force in the AI computing market since the AI buildout began in 2023. However, viable alternatives are starting to pop up that could challenge Nvidia's dominance. If Nvidia's empire starts to crack, two stocks could soar in its place.\nI think both are excellent buys for 2026 and are primed to soar, even if Nvidia can maintain its superiority.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) , but it doesn't manufacture them. Instead, it farms out that work to a handful of other companies. In the chip manufacturing world, that work primarily goes to Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) . Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest chip foundry by revenue , and it has achieved this position through continuous technological innovation and strong production yields.\n\nMany of Nvidia's competitors also source their chips from Taiwan Semiconductor, so if Nvidia's dominance slips, Taiwan Semiconductor will be OK. Additionally, if Nvidia maintains its incredible grip on the artificial intelligence computing market, TSMC will continue to do great. For Taiwan Semiconductor to succeed as an investment, AI hyperscalers need to continue spending at their current rate. If they do, Taiwan Semiconductor will be well-positioned to soar in 2026, as it trades at a discount to the fabless chip companies.\nThe three primary computing unit providers in the AI arms race are Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) . Nvidia is the largest of all of them, and happens to be the cheapest. But none of these three is cheaper than Taiwan Semiconductor.\nTaiwan Semiconductor trades for 29 times forward earnings. That's a hefty discount to its peers, despite benefiting from the same tailwinds pushing these other stocks higher. I think this low starting valuation will play in its favor during 2026 and will be a key reason why it outperforms Nvidia in 2026.\n\nBroadcom Broadcom is taking a different approach to the AI computing problem than its peers. Instead of creating a broad-purpose GPU like AMD or Nvidia, it's partnering directly with AI hyperscalers to build custom AI accelerators. These computing units aren't designed to handle a wide variety of workloads like a GPU is. Instead, it's designed specifically around the workload that it will see. By doing this, Broadcom can maximize performance while decreasing costs, albeit at the expense of flexibility.\n\nStory Continues\nThese computing units are surging in popularity, and Broadcom's financials reflect that. In Q4 (ending Nov. 2), its AI semiconductor revenue rose 74% year over year. For reference, Nvidia's data center division, which encompasses the GPUs primarily used for AI computing, increased revenue at a 66% pace. Broadcom is growing as a popular option to partner with, and I'd expect that trend to accelerate during 2026.\n\nHowever, Broadcom doesn't just make custom AI accelerator units. It has a whole host of other business units that develop mainframe software and hardware, virtual desktops, cybersecurity solutions, and numerous other products. These divisions slow down Broadcom's overall growth rate, as evidenced by Broadcom's net revenue only rising 28% in Q4.\nThis could be what holds Broadcom's stock back from outperforming in 2026, but if the investment community is excited about Broadcom's AI prospects, it could soar past Nvidia. For Q1, Broadcom expects AI revenue to come in at $8.2 billion -- indicating a double over last year's total. This shows that Broadcom's AI growth rate is accelerating while others are moderating. Investors love to see accelerating growth, and if there is still appetite for AI investment, Broadcom's stock could soar past Nvidia's, especially if Nvidia starts to lose market share to more of Broadcom's custom AI accelerators.\n\nI think both of these companies will do great in 2026, but I also wouldn't count Nvidia out, either. Owning all of these stocks may be a smart idea, as the AI buildout is far from over.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

It's impossible to know which companies will launch innovative features, or if 2026 will be a year of buildout. Investors only have a bit of information about what to expect in 2026, and using that tidbit to their advantage is the best that they can do.\n\nWhat piece of information can clue investors into 2026's future? Spending projections from the AI hyperscalers.\nIn 2025, this cohort set a new record for how much they spent on data center capital expenditures. Many of these companies have already informed investors that 2026 will be a year of further growth on 2025's levels . This should immediately benefit companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD , or Broadcom . But it will be difficult to know which will be the best performer in 2026. Any one of them could announce a new product or partnership that turns the AI investing world on its head.\nHowever, there's one company that will benefit regardless of which company mentioned above is in vogue in the computing world: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) . TSMC, as it is also known, manufactures nearly all of the best-performing chips possible for its clients, which include the three listed. That means TSMC is in a great position to thrive in 2026, and I think it could be the best performer.\nTSMC is primed to thrive over the next few years Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom are all fabless chip companies, which means they design the chips, but they don't manufacture them in-house. Instead, they farm that production work out to various companies, including TSMC on the chip side. TSMC has thrived on this relationship, as it allows it to sell to competitors with no repercussions. As long as there is heightened demand for chips, TSMC will continue to do well.\n\n2026 is expected to see a higher demand for chips than any year prior, so this trend is alive and well. And next year isn't expected to be the end, either. Nvidia projects that global data center capital expenditures will rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's a bold projection. But the leadership in these companies has more information than individual investors.\nDuring its Q3 earnings release, Nvidia noted that it's \"sold out\" of cloud graphics processing units (GPUs). Companies are having to place their orders years in advance for computing units that haven't been released yet. This provides Nvidia's management team with insight into multiple years' worth of growth, providing backing for its projections. While the exact dollar figure may not pan out, the direction is likely right.\n\nStory Continues\nTSMC is in a key position to provide chips for this massive market, placing it in an excellent spot to thrive. Even if Nvidia's dominance slips and a different company like AMD or Broadcom steals market share, TSMC will still maintain its role as a chip provider, allowing it to benefit regardless of which company is leading the computing unit industry.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is launching a new technology There is, however, one issue that could derail the whole buildout. Data centers consume a ton of energy. This is placing a serious strain on the power grid and could become the limiting factor in the AI buildout. TSMC recognizes this and is working with chip designers to develop next-generation chips that take on the power consumption issue. TSMC has the production capacity to handle 2-nanometer chips that consume 25% to 30% less power than their previous chip designs when configured to run at the same speed.\n\nTSMC's ability to make subsequent chip generations is targeting further power consumption improvement as well. This manufacturing ability isn't going to come cheap, and it will allow TSMC to grow its revenue at a rapid pace over the next few years, which bodes well for the stock.\nI'm not sure which chip designer will be best in 2026, but I know that TSMC is positioned to thrive regardless. This places Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing on my short list for stocks that could be the best performer in 2026, and investors might want to give serious consideration to buying now so as to capture the upside of the AI buildout without the risk of needing a single company to maintain its dominance.\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Stock-Split Watch: Is ASML Next?\n\nJeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:39 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points ASML looks like a good candidate for a stock split.\nThe company dominates the market for lithography equipment.\nIt's results have been uneven lately, but it still sees steady growth through 2030.\n10 stocks we like better than ASML ›\nInvestors love to speculate about stock splits, and one of the more obvious targets for a split has been ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) , the Netherlands-based company that is the world's only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. Those are massive, highly complex machines that chip manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor rely on to make the world's most advanced semiconductors.\n\nASML is a candidate for a stock spilt not because of its business model , but because of its share price, which is now hovering above $1,000. That puts the stock in rare company, as only 18 publicly traded companies out of more than 10,000 have a share price above $1,000.\nIn general, the higher a company's individual share price, the more likely it is to consider a stock split.\nWhat you need to know about stock splits Stock splits get a lot of attention from investors, but they don't do anything to change the fundamentals of a stock. Investors get more shares that are now worth a proportionally lower price, like cutting a pie into more pieces.\nHowever, stock splits do have an impact on the stock. First, they get attention from investors, and trading volume tends to rise around the time of the stock split. Additionally, they make individual shares cheaper, which does make them more accessible to retail investors. Companies often say they're splitting their stock to make it more affordable for employees as well.\n\nThere's also some evidence that stock splits can lead to outperformance. According to research from Bank of America , stocks tend to outperform over the next 12 months after splitting their stocks, returning around 25%. It's not clear why that is, but there are a number of possible reasons why.\nCompanies choose when to split their stocks, and they're likely to do so when they're confident that shares will continue to rise. In that sense, stock splits act as a milestone for the company as management chooses the time to reset the share price so it can climb again. Finally, there could be a self-fulfilling prophecy with stock-split stocks. If investors expect them to go up following the split, they're more likely to buy them, pushing them up just based on that expectation.\n\nWill ASML split its stock? ASML hasn't commented on a possible stock split, but that's not unusual. Typically, it's not something a company discusses before an announcement is made.\n\nStory Continues\nASML has done stock splits in the past, but they were mostly early in its history, including a 2-for-1 split in 1997, another 2-for-1 split in 1998, and a 3-for-1 split in 2000. Later, it did two reverse stock splits, an 8-for-9 reverse split in 2007 and a 77-for-100 reverse split in 2012. Reverse stock splits are typically only used by companies in distress, but ASML tied them to share buybacks and a program in 2012 that included Intel , TSMC, and Samsung taking a stake in the company.\n\nThe stock has been volatile in recent quarters as the semiconductor equipment sector hasn't gotten the same AI tailwind that chip-makers have. ASML's revenue was basically flat in the third quarter, though the company is still projecting solid growth through 2030, targeting 44 billion-60 billion euros in revenue, up about 60% from 2025.\nA stock split seems likely to happen at some point, but management may be looking for more stability before it pulls the trigger on the split. For investors, the company's monopoly in EUV machines, and its leadership in lithography is a better reason to own the stock no matter what happens with the stock split.\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now?

      "Content": "3 of the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nDavid Jagielski, CPA, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:58 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nTSM\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points The stocks listed here all have market caps of more than $1 trillion.\nThey are among the leading companies in tech, but their valuations still aren't terribly high with respect to earnings.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nAre you worried that you've missed out on the opportunity to generate a great return from artificial intelligence (AI) stocks? There are still plenty of good and reasonably priced AI stocks you can add to your portfolio today. And many of them are already large, safe, and established players in tech.\nHeading into 2026, three AI stocks that I think possess the most upside are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) . Here's why it's not too late to invest in these three tech giants.\nAlphabet It may come as a surprise to some that Alphabet is on this list. It is, after all, already one of the most valuable companies in the world. Its market cap of $3.7 trillion puts it not all that far behind the world's most valuable company, Nvidia , which is worth $4.3 trillion. Once a company gets that valuable, it becomes harder to keep the growth going.\n\nThe reason Alphabet still looks like a fantastic buy going into 2026 is that it can still go higher. For a while, investors were skeptical about its ability to continue to dominate in search, its core business, amid concerns that AI chatbots would steer users away from Google. And there may still be many skeptics out there, which is why Alphabet isn't the most valuable company in the world right now, which I believe is where it should rank given how massive its business is.\nAI has enabled Alphabet to enhance Google Search and add value for creators on YouTube. But don't forget that it also has a rapidly expanding robotaxi business in Waymo. Its cloud business is expanding, and the company is also making its own chips.\nIts operations are far more diverse than many other AI stocks out there, including Nvidia's. And yet, Alphabet's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28. That's modest in comparison to the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF where the average forward earnings multiple is just under 30. Alphabet should command a far higher premium than where it's at today, which is why, even at its current valuation, it can be a no-brainer buy heading into next year.\n\nAmazon Another obvious pick looks to be Amazon, whose valuation is $2.4 trillion, which remains firmly behind both Nvidia and Alphabet. Over the past 12 months, Amazon's stock price has actually declined by 4%. This is another example of an AI stock that may be worthy of a higher valuation.\n\nStory Continues\nThe company is known primarily for its online marketplace and its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is a terrific growth driver. But in addition to that, Amazon also has a robotaxi business of its own, Zoox. It's not as big or popular as Waymo, but its toaster-designed vehicles look sleeker and more modern and could be more ideal for operating as robotaxis.\n\nAmazon has also been expanding its same-day delivery of fresh groceries to more markets recently, which can steal some market share from rival Walmart . Amazon has done a great job of predicting and anticipating purchases on its online marketplace, and replicating that success with groceries could make that an underrated opportunity where its AI capabilities can shine and give it an advantage.\nGiven the diversification of Amazon's business and plentiful growth opportunities, this is a stock that should also be worth more; it trades at a forward P/E of 27.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing In contrast to the other tech giants listed above, there's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC as it is also known. Its business is not as diversified, and that works to its advantage. TSMC makes chips for tech companies, including Nvidia. Its low-cost operations make it difficult for Intel and other rivals to compete. The Taiwan-based company plays an important role in the AI world due to the industry's dependence on its foundry.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30, TSMC's revenue rose by 30%, and its diluted per-share profit jumped by 39%. Not only has its growth been impressive, but it has incredibly strong operating margins of around 50%.\nThe stock has rallied more than 40% this year and has a $1.5 trillion market cap. But with a forward P/E of just under 24, it's the cheapest stock on this list.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

On December 10, Mike Yang from Bank of America Securities reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $390. On the same day, Bernstein SocGen Group also reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $330 price target.\n\n​The ratings follow the company’s release of its November 2025 revenue report. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported NT$ 343.614 billion in monthly revenue, reflecting 24.5% year-over-year growth. However, the November revenue was slightly lower by 6.5% from October 2025, when the company generated NT$367.473 billion.\n​Analysts at BofA noted that this robust year-over-year growth was driven by greater than expected demand for high-end mobile chipsets and solid growth in high-performance computing and AI sectors. Moreover, the comparison also benefited from favorable foreign exchange trends. The analyst highlighted that there are concerns regarding margin compression due to investment in new technologies. However, BofA anticipates stronger pricing and a higher utilization rate to keep the margins strong.\n\n​Moreover, Bernstein SocGen Group noted that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s (NYSE:TSM) October and November revenues totaled NT$711 billion. This makes almost 71% of the company’s Q4 2025 guidance at mid-point. The firm highlighted that if the company continues to perform in a similar fashion during December, it will allow the company to exceed both the guidance midpoint and consensus estimates by 3% to 4%.\n​Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the largest contract semiconductor manufacturer in the world. Some of its prominent customers include semiconductor companies that outsource all or part of their chip production, including Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, Broadcom, and more.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

However, in 2025, it was Intel's stock that outperformed, up nearly 80% as of this writing, compared to a 40% gain for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\nLet's look at which stock is set up to outperform in 2026.\nThe case for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC for short, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry on the planet. Due to its technological expertise and scale, the company manufactures the vast majority of advanced chips, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) . It counts Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom among its top customers.\n\nIn chip manufacturing, the goal is to consistently push down node sizes, which refers to the transistor density of the chips. The more transistors that can be fit on a chip, the more powerful and energy efficient they become. However, producing advanced chips at scale is difficult, and TSMC's main competitors, including Intel and Samsung , have struggled with yields (the number of defects per wafer). Meanwhile, nearly three-quarters of its production is at 7nm nodes and below, and it is set to move to 2nm technology next year.\nGiven its position in the industry, TSMC is the go-to partner for chip designers. It works closely with companies like Nvidia to grow capacity to meet their projected demand. And, as the only foundry that can really make these advanced chips at scale with high yields, it has also garnered strong pricing power. The company is set to raise prices once again next year, while the cost of its new 2nm processing technology is forecasted to be 50% higher than its 2nm technology.\n\nTSMC is well-positioned to continue to benefit from the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout and sees AI chip demand growing by more than a 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years.\nThe case for Intel Intel stock's outperformance in 2025 wasn't really a result of its operational performance. The company has struggled to grow its revenue, and it felt a lot of gross margin pressure in the first half of the year. However, it did see a huge rebound in adjusted gross margins in Q3, with it climbing from 18% a year ago to 40%. Revenue, meanwhile, edged up 3%.\n\nStory Continues\nThe biggest reasons for Intel's gains in 2025 were from the high-profile investments others made into the company's stock. Nvidia made a $5 billion equity investment in the company, while SoftBank invested $2 billion. Meanwhile, the U.S. government made an $8.9 billion investment. These investments, along with the 51% sale of its Altera business for $5.2 billion, helped Intel end Q3 with nearly $31 billion in cash on its balance sheet.\n\nThe company will use that cash to keep building out its foundry business and advance its chip manufacturing technology. Meanwhile, it is collaborating with Nvidia on new products, including integrating its central processing units (CPUs) with Nvidia's NVLink system to allow its CPUs to communicate more quickly with Nvidia's GPUs. This would help give Intel a nice advantage in the data center CPU market, where it has been losing share to Advanced Micro Devices . Separately, Intel is also working on its own AI chips designed for inference, and it is supposedly close to a deal with SambaNova Systems to further its efforts in this area.\nThe verdict Intel's 2025 performance was largely from events that won't repeat in 2026. For the company to outperform next year, it's probably going to need to win a large foundry customer or show major progress in data center chips, either with its CPUs or GPU efforts. That makes the stock more of a wildcard.\n\nTSMC, meanwhile, is the much safer choice. The company is set to benefit from the continued AI data center buildout, and its path forward is much clearer. As such, it's my pick to outperform in 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

      "Content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nTSMWF\n\n^GSPC\n\nTSMC (TSM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this chip company have returned +2.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.5% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, to which TSMC belongs, has gained 2.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nTSMC is expected to post earnings of $2.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.13 points to a change of +43.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.17 indicates a change of +20.2% from what TSMC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for TSMC.\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of TSMC, the consensus sales estimate of $32.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $120.47 billion and $145.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +33.7% and +20.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History TSMC reported revenues of $33.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +40.8%. EPS of $2.92 for the same period compares with $1.94 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.06%. The EPS surprise was +12.74%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nTSMC is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about TSMC. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Why This AI Stock Could Outperform Nvidia Over the Next 5 Years\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 4:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Nvidia is sold out of cloud GPUs.\nAMD and Broadcom could take market share from it in the data center segment.\nAll three chipmakers outsource much of their manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has led the artificial intelligence (AI) investing sector since 2023. While 2025 hasn't been quite as good a year for its shareholders as the previous two were, the stock is still up around 30% year to date. The chipmaker is still a dominant force in the AI realm, but observers are raising the possibility that its competitors could start taking meaningful market share away from it.\nShould Nvidia start to lose its edge over the competition, it may no longer be the best AI stock to own. But over the next five years, which stock could overtake it?\nDifferent approaches to the AI computing problem Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) , which are computing units that can process many thousands of calculations in parallel. This makes them perfectly suited for tasks that require a lot of computing power and that can be broken down into many smaller tasks that can be handled independently. Most artificial intelligence workloads fall into that category. Nvidia's GPUs have been the most popular parallel processors available since before the AI infrastructure buildout started in 2023, but that may change.\n\nOne issue Nvidia is having right now is that demand is outpacing its supply. In its earnings release for its fiscal 2026 third quarter (which ended Oct. 26), CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company was \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs. While some may view this as a good problem to have, I think it's a bit of an issue. Its clients' needs for AI accelerator chips aren't going to decrease just because Nvidia can't fully supply them. Instead, they are going to look for alternative solutions.\nThat could open up the door for competing chipmakers to steal some significant market share, particularly if buyers find that the alternative products provide similar performance with lower costs. Two chipmakers that appear poised to benefit are AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) .\n\nAMD is a direct competitor to Nvidia, as it also makes GPUs. It recently forecast that it would grow its data center revenue at a 60% compound annual rate over the next five years. For reference, its data center division's revenue growth was a mere 22% during Q3. For AMD to grow as fast as predicted, it will need to eat into Nvidia's market share, which it already might be doing.\n\nStory Continues\nBroadcom is taking a different approach to the AI computing problem. Rather than designing another general-purpose GPU, it's partnering directly with hyperscalers to design custom AI computing units -- called application-specific integrated circuits -- that meet their precise needs. Among the best examples of these chips are Alphabet 's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\nTPUs and other custom AI computing units aren't designed to handle a wide variety of workloads like GPUs are. However, when these computing units only see the one type of workload that they are configured for, they can deliver higher performance at lower costs. The trade-off of lower price and higher performance for less flexibility is a no-brainer for many data center operators, and Broadcom's approach could eat into Nvidia's market share as AI workloads become more streamlined.\nThese companies have the potential to steal some of Nvidia's market share over the next five years, but all the chip designers all have one thing in common.\nTaiwan Semiconductor will rise regardless of which chip designers are winning None of these companies fabricates its computing units in-house. Instead, the \"fabless\" chipmakers outsource that work to a handful of other companies that specialize in fabrication. In the chip production realm, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) captures nearly all of the highest-end work. It's not only the largest chip manufacturer by revenue in the world, but also a leader in its ability to deliver the most advanced chips. Broadcom, AMD, and Nvidia often work with Taiwan Semiconductor for their cutting-edge chips, and that's unlikely to change in the future, as that industry is nearly impossible to disrupt.\n\nWith Nvidia projecting between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in data center infrastructure spending by 2030, all three of these fabless chip companies could have a significant market opportunity to capture. I'm not sure which will be the ultimate winner among them. Still, I know that TSMC will be a winner regardless, giving it a strong chance of outperforming Nvidia over the next five years, particularly if Nvidia loses a meaningful amount of market share to its peers.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

The DJSI World index addresses this challenge by selecting the top 10 percent of the 2,500 largest global companies, based on long-term economic, environmental, and social criteria.\n\nStrong performance supports sustainability-focused strategies\nThe historical performance of the DJSI World index illustrates the continued investor interest in sustainability-oriented approaches. From the beginning of the year to the end of October, the index gained 22.96 percent. Over longer periods, the average annual return reached 21.29 percent over three years, 15.19 percent over five years, and 12.18 percent over ten years.\nThe index has also shown relative resilience during periods of market stress. In 2022, when global equity markets experienced a broad correction, DJSI World declined by 15.6 percent, a smaller drawdown than many broader market benchmarks. This highlights the potential stabilizing role of diversified, sustainability-oriented companies within long-term portfolios.\n\nImportantly, the index is not driven solely by renewable energy or electromobility. Its strongest contributors come primarily from technology, healthcare, and industrial sectors, where innovation, efficiency, and responsible business practices increasingly go hand in hand.\nBuilding on this framework, Wonderinterest has selected and presents an overview of the ten leading companies currently included in the DJSI World, representing the highest-ranked global firms under the index's sustainability criteria.\nTop 10 Companies in the DJSI World Index\nCompany\nSector (GICS)\nMicrosoft\nInformation Technology\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)\nInformation Technology\nTencent\nCommunication Services\nAbbVie\nHealth Care\nCisco\nInformation Technology\nSAP\nInformation Technology\nSalesforce\nInformation Technology\nAbbott Laboratories\nHealthcare\nSiemens\nIndustrials\nLinde\nMaterials\n\nThe analysis details of the Top 10 Companies in the DJSI World Index were presented by Wonderinterest Trading .\nSustainability as a long-term investment theme\nThe common denominator among these companies is a clear focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and long-term sustainability.

      "Content": "These AI Stocks Could Surge in December as Momentum Builds\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 10:50 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points The AI hyperscalers are planning on spending a record amount on capital expenditures during 2026.\nNvidia and AMD are sparring for GPU supremacy.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a neutral party in the AI build-out.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nWith December rolling toward its close, there are a few stocks that I think could surge before the end of the month. While the market may be growing a bit weary of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade, the reality is that hyperscalers are going to be spending more than ever on AI computing power in 2026. This benefits a handful of companies in an outsized way, and some of those that have already been the biggest winners from that spending are positioned to keep prospering in 2026.\nThree such stocks that I think could surge to end the year are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) , and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) .\nNvidia Nvidia has been a top-performing artificial intelligence stock since the buildout began in 2023. While there have been some impressive technologies developed over the past few years, we've only scratched the surface of what generative AI is capable of. As a result, hyperscalers are planning on record-setting data center capital expenditures in 2026 after setting new spending records in 2025. Nvidia is one of the primary beneficiaries of this spending because its graphics processing units (GPUs) provide a significant chunk of the computing power that goes into these data centers.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are best in class, in part thanks to the technology stack that supports them. It continues to deliver impressive quarter after impressive quarter, and the third quarter of its fiscal 2026 (which ended Oct. 26) was no exception. Revenue rose by 63% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rose by 67%. Demand for Nvidia's GPUs was so high that CEO Jensen Huang noted that the company is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs.\nAI data center buildouts aren't expected to slow down anytime in the near future: Nvidia's management believes that by 2030, global data center capital expenditures will reach between $3 trillion and $4 trillion. Nvidia may be down a bit heading into 2026, but assuming that the expected spending will occur, it should be an excellent stock to buy now.\n\nAMD AMD hasn't had nearly as much success of Nvidia in the AI arms race. While its GPUs aren't far off in performance from Nvidia's, its supporting technology has lagged, specifically its controlling software. However, AMD has made a few acquisitions and inked some partnerships that have improved its supporting products, and management believes it can turn the company's fortunes around and make a big splash in the AI computing world.\n\nStory Continues\nOver the next five years, management believes the company can grow its data center business at a 60% compound annual growth rate. That would be a massive increase from the 22% growth that segment achieved in its most recently reported quarter. AMD will have a long way to go to prove that it is capable of delivering growth that rivals Nvidia's, but if it can, the stock should perform impressively.\n\nI think the market may start to recognize this shift in fortunes, causing AMD's stock to rise in the last few days of December.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Both Nvidia and AMD design chips, but neither manufactures them in-house. Instead, like many other \"fabless\" chipmakers, they farm that work out to several companies. In the case of the most cutting-edge chips, that work mostly falls to Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's largest chip foundry by revenue. Taiwan Semiconductor is a genius investment because it doesn't matter whether it's Nvidia, AMD, or some other designer offering the best computing solution -- the foundry is still positioned to benefit from their sales. All that really matters to Taiwan Semi is that the AI hyperscalers are spending more and more.\n\nAdmittedly, its status as a neutral player in the AI buildout can limit its overall upside. However, based on the growth projections for the AI infrastructure market, I'd be surprised if Taiwan Semiconductor weren't a top-performing stock over the next five years.\nIt's also much cheaper than the GPU designers, trading at 28 times expected forward earnings.\nI'm a huge fan of Taiwan Semiconductor and its invaluable position in the AI space, and believe the market may reward it heading into 2026.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

Shares of networking chips designer Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) jumped 3.2% in the afternoon session after positive results from peer company Micron lifted the broader semiconductor sector.\nThe strong report created a ripple effect, boosting sentiment for chip-related companies. Marvell climbed alongside other industry players, as firms connected to memory and storage saw some of the most notable gains. For instance, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, Broadcom, and Qualcomm all recorded increases. The move highlighted investor optimism across the semiconductor space, reinforcing the view that companies like Marvell, which are key to AI infrastructure, were well-positioned.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $84.30, up 3.1% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Marvell Technology? Access our full analysis report here .\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us Marvell Technology’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 42 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock dropped 3.8% on the news that reports revealed that China is moving to substitute US technology by adding domestic AI chips to its government procurement list.\n\nThis development is part of a broader \"buy local\" campaign aimed at reducing China's reliance on foreign technology, particularly from the United States, amid persistent trade and tech tensions. The Chinese government has updated its guidelines to include AI chips from homegrown companies like Huawei and Cambricon. This policy shift effectively steers government and state-affiliated buyers away from American semiconductor firms. For US chipmakers, this signals a potential loss of market share in one of the world's largest tech markets, raising concerns among investors about future revenue streams from the region.\nMarvell Technology is down 25.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $84.30 per share, it is trading 33.1% below its 52-week high of $126.06 from January 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Marvell Technology’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,774.\nWhile Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be TSMC's Stock Price in 2026\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:27 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nKey Points TSMC is sitting on solid catalysts that should allow it to crush Wall Street's expectations in 2026.\nThe healthy demand for AI chips, TSMC's capacity expansion efforts, and the potential increase in prices of its chip nodes should pave the way for robust revenue and earnings growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nAs 2025 draws to a close, those who invested in shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) at the beginning of the year would be pretty happy with their decision. After all, the foundry giant has appreciated an impressive 45% so far this year (as of Dec. 16), and that's not surprising given the robust growth in its revenue and earnings throughout the year.\nPopularly known as TSMC, the Taiwan-based company is playing a critical role in the global artificial intelligence (AI) chip market. Not surprisingly, analysts are upbeat about TSMC stock's prospects in the coming year. Let's check out the company's catalysts for 2026 and find out how much upside investors can expect from TSMC stock in the new year.\nInvestors can expect TSMC's growth to accelerate in 2026 TSMC's financial performance improved this year. The company's revenue in the first 11 months of the year jumped by 33% from the same period last year. Consensus estimates project a 48% spike in its earnings for 2025 to $10.42 per share. Those numbers will be an improvement over last year, when TSMC recorded a 36% spike in earnings on a 30% jump in revenue to just over $90 billion.\n\nAnalysts, however, expect TSMC's growth to slow down in 2026. Consensus estimates point toward a 20% increase in revenue and earnings next year. However, there is ample evidence indicating that it could ultimately perform much better than that.\nThe first major reason why TSMC's growth rate in 2026 could accelerate is its improving advanced chip packaging capacity. Equity research and brokerage firm Bernstein expects TSMC's advanced chip packaging chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity to hit 125,000 wafers per month by the end of 2026.\nThat points toward a terrific increase of around 66% from TSMC's current CoWoS capacity of 75,000 wafers. Importantly, the higher capacity that TSMC is set to bring online throughout next year is said to be fully booked out, as reported by market research firm TrendForce. This isn't surprising as the foundry giant needs to fulfill orders for AI and high-performance computing (HPC) chips from companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Amazon , MediaTek, Google, and others.\n\nStory Continues\nTSMC's customers, which also include Broadcom , Marvell , Apple , and others, have been experiencing robust demand for their devices and AI chips. Nvidia, for instance, still has a massive order backlog of around $307 billion that it needs to fulfill over the next five quarters. That's well above Nvidia's trailing-12-month revenue of $187 billion.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia has been cleared by the Trump administration to sell its advanced H200 data center graphics processing units (GPUs) to Chinese customers. This could help the chipmaker land more orders for its chips in 2026 and ensure that the additional capacity that TSMC is bringing online is indeed sold out.\nSo, the substantial increase in TSMC's advanced chipmaking capacity should translate into a much bigger jump than the 20% top-line increase that analysts forecast for next year. Another important thing worth noting is that TSMC will likely hike the prices of its various process nodes next year. TrendForce points out that TSMC could hike the prices of its advanced chip nodes, which are used for manufacturing AI chips, by 3% to 5% next month.\n\nOther estimates indicate that there may be a price hike of up to 10% for TSMC's advanced chip nodes. Also, the new 2-nanometer (nm) process node that TSMC will start producing next year is expected to carry a 10% to 20% premium over the existing flagship, the 2nm node. Therefore, it won't be surprising to see TSMC's earnings growing at a much faster pace than the 20% increase that analysts expect next year, and that could set this semiconductor stock up for terrific gains.\nHere's how much upside investors can expect next year TSMC carries a 12-month median price target of $355, according to 50 analysts covering the stock. That suggests 23% gains from current levels. However, TSMC can easily beat that median price target in 2026.\nWe have already seen why the company is on track to exceed Wall Street's revenue and earnings growth estimates for next year. Assuming its earnings jump by 40%, as compared to the consensus estimate of 20% in 2026, its bottom line could hit $14.59 per share (based on the 2025 earnings estimate of $10.42 per share).

      "Content": "Rivian CEO on self-driving, designing AI chips, and why Tesla needs more competition\n\nPras Subramanian · Senior Reporter\n更新時間 Thu, December 18, 2025 at 5:05 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: RIVN\n\nTSLA\n\nVLKAF\n\nNVDA\n\nTSM\n\nAt Rivian's ( RIVN ) Autonomy and AI Day on Dec. 11, the pure-play EV maker outlined a whole range of tech and software products, with a focus on vertical integration — meaning doing everything from end to end in-house.\nCEO RJ Scaringe launched the company's new Autonomy platform at the event — and during a trying time for the EV sector, in which so far only Tesla has achieved profitability. While Rivian has achieved gross profits in recent quarters, actual bottom-line (or net) profits have been elusive.\n\nScaringe, who founded the company in 2011, saw Rivian go public in 2021 and reach stratospheric heights of $120 a share before the stock came back down to earth, now at $18. A crucial cash infusion from Volkswagen ( VWAGY ) of nearly $6 billion via a joint venture between the two companies has given Rivian much-needed breathing room.\nThe following is a condensed version of Yahoo Finance's conversation with Scaringe, touching on the company's path toward full self-driving (FSD), or personal L4, as Rivian calls it, building in-house chips, and where the overall EV industry is headed.\nYahoo Finance: Thanks for having us here, RJ. Rivian's Autonomy platform — talk to me about the progression from where Rivian is right now to what's going to come out in the near term and its vision for the future.\nRJ Scaringe: Autonomy has been a journey for us. We followed the launch of our Gen 1 vehicles at the end of 2021. In early 2022, we realized we wanted to do a clean-sheet approach to our Autonomy platform. So we started the process on that, and that involved developing a camera platform, redesigning the compute platform, and architecting the whole system around an AI-centric approach.\n\nThat was what went into our [current] Gen 2 vehicles that we ultimately launched in the middle of 2024, and the compute relative to our Gen 1 [vehicles] increased by about 10x — that's the inference on the vehicle. When we launched that, there was 55 megapixels of cameras, an array of radars, and that began the process of building the data stream to really train this model.\nOn our Gen 3 platform, it's [built using] an in-house chip ... This is a platform that can process 5 billion pixels per second, so that's roughly 5x the best in class today. This is very, very high processing capability. And that not only raises the performance level of this platform, but it also allows us to build the model more efficiently and more quickly.\nCurrently, Rivian offers Universal Hands-Free, which is akin to GM's Supercruise, and that will be expanded to more roads. What comes next?\nIn 2026, we'll add \"point to point.\" So you can get in the car from your driveway, type the address, and it does everything, hands-free, eyes-on, etc. .... But it's still supervised.\n\n繼續閱讀\nThen the platform expands to the next big step, which is eyes-off — and eyes-off is really powerful. That's when you can start to be in the car, be on your phone, be reading a book. Essentially, your role in driving the car diminishes to nothing. You're just a passenger.\nAnd then the next step beyond that is what we call personal Level 4, which is the idea that the vehicle can completely operate on its own, even without anybody in the car. And so things like picking the kids up from school, an airport drop-off, or grabbing groceries.\n\nRead more: How to find the best luxury car insurance\nYou mentioned the custom silicon Riving is making in-house. Talk to me about why that's important for you to make that the next jump in the next few years. Why not use an off-the-shelf self-driving product like Nvidia's?\nWe made the decision years and years ago to build our entire vertical software platform in-house and not rely on tier-one suppliers for any of that content ... We then built teams of thousands of people to go put all that together. [We] spent many, many, many hundreds of millions of dollars to develop those systems. And when we've approached autonomy and our overall AI roadmap, we had a very similar view, which is this is going to be the most important technical shift in transportation, I would say, more than anything else, more than anything since the beginning of the car. And we wanted to control our own destiny...\n\nYou [also] need a partnership with someone like a TSMC, which in our case is our partner. [Although Rivian designed its chip in-house, a chipmaker is needed to actually produce the chip.] And what we're going to get is better performance, something that's very specific to vision-based robotics ... And then we needed to build this data flywheel, and so lots of offline training, that means lots of GPUs.\nI want to mention Tesla because it is doing the same thing with regard to going fully vertical. It has its own chips. It's doing its own data centers. But unlike Tesla, Rivian uses sensors as opposed to just camera vision. Do you think Rivian can meet, and even surpass, where Tesla FSD is in the next couple of years?\n\nOur goal is to be world-class. Tesla, to be clear, is a great product. They've built a really impressive platform. We're very much aligned with them on believing it needs to be a neural-net-based approach, building an end-to-end trained model that's using a fleet of vehicles, building a data flywheel that trains the model with reinforcement learning. So we really agree here.\nWe do have a different view on the benefits of a diverse set of perception modalities. In our case, still being camera-heavy, call it camera-primary. But by including radar and lidar [light detection and ranging], it allows us to turn our entire fleet into a \"ground truth\" fleet. So every vehicle on the road is very helpful in training our model. [Similar to Tesla, Rivian's EVs will send massive amounts of data collected via sensors and cameras to train its self-driving model.]\nI want to ask you about the bigger picture of the EV industry in America. The tax credit went away in Q4. How are things going for you now as a result? I've heard people talk about how the pure-play EV makers might actually benefit from this because we have fewer competitors in the market.\nI think what you postulated in your question is probably somewhat right. I think you are seeing a lot of manufacturers pull back. I think that's unfortunate. I think it'd be healthier for the auto industry if everybody was focused on electrification. I think that pullback means there's going to be less choice, which is bad for customers. But I do think because there's less choice, it means it's going to be a less competitive environment...\n\nIf you were to look at the segment of vehicles with price points that start under $50,000, there's very few highly compelling choices, and as a result of that, a single company, Tesla, has accumulated around 50% market share ... and that's not a reflection of a healthy industry. It's a reflection of an underserved market. And so if we want to see electrification go from its 8% adoption, which is what it is in the United States today, to let's say 25 or 30 or ultimately 100%, we need to have more than one great choice.\nAnd of course, I think Rivian is one of those [great choices] with our R2. I think it's going to be exceptional. The car itself is just amazing, but I hope there's others.\nPras Subramanian is Lead Auto Reporter for Yahoo Finance.

On December 10, analysts at Bernstein SocGen Group reiterated an Outperform rating and a $330 price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). The positive stance is in response to the company tracking ahead of its fourth quarter guidance and consensus estimates.\nthe-main-processor-3334336_1280\nThe company’s revenues in November were down 6.5% month over month to NT$344 billion but represented a 24.5% year-over-year increase. The year-over-year increase aligns with the 37% revenue growth over the past 12 months. The company’s revenue for October and November totaled NT$711 billion, accounting for 71% of the fourth quarter guidance.\n\nConsequently, Taiwan Semiconductor is on course to deliver fourth-quarter revenue at the upper end of its historical range. Should the momentum from the past two months persist in December, Bernstein expects the company’s Q4 revenue to exceed the midpoint of guidance and consensus estimates by 3-4%.\nThe expected revenue growth is being driven by the robust production of artificial intelligence chips for Nvidia and Broadcom. The company is also capitalizing on the strong demand for Apple’s mobile phone chips.\nAnalysts at Bank of America have already raised their price target for the stock to $360, citing a strong view of TSMC’s AI growth trajectory.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest dedicated semiconductor foundry, meaning it manufactures chips designed by other companies, rather than designing its own brands.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "What Are 3 of the Best AI Stocks to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 8:20 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points TSMC has a technological monopoly on advanced AI chip manufacturing.\nNvidia is responsible for designing critical pieces of the modern data center.\nMicrosoft can easily monetize AI by inserting it into its software ecosystem.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) is solidifying its mark in the world, it would be naive not to expect that some of today's AI-focused companies won't stand the test of time. In some cases, these companies may be too niche to remain independent and will ultimately become acquisition targets. Others simply won't survive.\nWhen I think about AI stocks I want to hold for the next decade, I look for companies that are key players in different phases of the AI pipeline. The following three companies fit that description and appear to be good long-term investments.\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) isn't an AI stock in the traditional sense, but it's one of the more important companies in the space. As the world's leading third-party semiconductor foundry, TSMC manufactures chips designed by \"fabless\" companies that don't own the facilities to produce them themselves.\n\nWhen it comes to manufacturing the types of advanced AI chips used in data centers, TSMC essentially has a monopoly . With its superior technology and efficiency, it's the go-to company, and there's not a close second.\nCompanies like Intel and Samsung also operate foundries that can deliver chips using some of the most cutting-edge process nodes, but they have issues -- such as production delays and low yields -- that make them far less reliable. Not only has this made AI chips a large part of TSMC's business, but it has also given it more pricing power.\nBoth TSMC's revenue and operating income (profit from core operations) have grown impressively over the past couple of years; however, its dominance in advanced AI chips has enabled it to grow its profits at a significantly faster pace.\n2. Nvidia Whereas TSMC is the manufacturer that brings chips to life, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the designer behind critical parts of the AI ecosystem. Its lead in the parallel processor market, in particular, is why the stock skyrocketed over the past few years, turning it into the world's most valuable public company, with a market cap of nearly $4.2 trillion.\n\nFor a time, Nvidia was known for making graphics processing units (GPUs) that were primarily used to improve the performance of video games. However, the company and other clients realized that its parallel processors were useful for other types of computing workloads, and it began to pivot its focus toward those markets. Its latest pivot came as the AI trend picked up steam, and demand soared for hardware capable of handling the massive data sets involved in that technology. Many of the data center chips used for training and operating AI systems come from Nvidia.\n\nStory Continues\nOf the $57 billion in revenue Nvidia made in the third quarter (up 62% year over year), $51.2 billion (up 66%) came from its data center segment.\nWhile Nvidia's GPUs and other hardware have gotten a lot of attention, CUDA -- its parallel computing platform and application programming interface -- has flown under the radar a bit. CUDA allows Nvidia's chips to be programmed for specific tasks, and the developers who work in AI are widely familiar with it, which adds to the company's moat. Moreover, CUDA programs only run on Nvidia chips, which further increases the switching costs associated with purchasing AI accelerator chips from competitors.\n\nOther major tech companies, including Alphabet and Amazon , have begun designing their own AI chips, often with the assistance of Broadcom; however, Nvidia has a significant head start. It will inevitably lose some market share over the next decade, but as the size of the overall AI chip market continues to grow, it should remain relatively stable.\n3. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has two major things working in its favor regarding AI. First, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud infrastructure platform in the world, and a go-to choice for many companies to build and host their own AI apps. Azure's AI capabilities have helped it close the gap a bit with segment leader Amazon Web Services.\n\nThe second major factor is that Microsoft's software portfolio comprises numerous titles and services that hundreds of millions of people use regularly, including Microsoft 365 (Excel, Word, Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.), LinkedIn, GitHub, and the Windows operating system, among others.\nThis allows Microsoft to act as a seamless AI distributor because it can easily add this new technology to software that people are already using, and then monetize it. For many corporations and individuals, paying a relatively small additional fee for Microsoft 365 Copilot is a straightforward decision. It has become another reliable revenue source for Microsoft, and it should only get better as adopting these tools becomes the norm for corporations.\n\nWhile pure-play AI companies, by definition, rely solely on this new tech for their revenues, for Microsoft, AI is more of a bonus. The company's business is well-diversified, spanning software, tech hardware, gaming, cloud computing, and professional networking. Even if the AI hype cools over the next decade, Microsoft's business will remain strong and highly profitable.\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 1.16% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.47%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 1.81%.\nShares of the chip company have appreciated by 3.22% over the course of the past month, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1%, and the S&P 500's gain of 1.03%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of TSMC will be of great interest to investors. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $2.72, signifying a 21.43% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $32.6 billion, indicating a 21.26% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $10.13 per share and revenue of $120.47 billion, indicating changes of +43.89% and +33.73%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for TSMC. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.18% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. TSMC presently features a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).\nFrom a valuation perspective, TSMC is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.33.

      "Content": "Brokers Suggest Investing in TSMC (TSM): Read This Before Placing a Bet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nWhen deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about TSMC (TSM).\n\nTSMC currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for TSM Check price target & stock forecast for TSMC here>>>\nThe ABR suggests buying TSMC, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near-term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory Continues\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs TSM a Good Investment? In terms of earnings estimate revisions for TSMC, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.2% over the past month to $10.13.\nAnalysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for TSMC. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for TSMC with a grain of salt.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 17)\n\nJoel South\nWed, December 17, 2025 at 6:25 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nTM\n\nTOYOF\n\nTSM\n\nShares of Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) have retreated 3.4% in the past week, as it announced the acquisition of SchedMD and a partnership with Mistral AI, and in the wake of the White House approving sales of H200 chips to certain Chinese customers. Meanwhile, insiders continue to sell shares. Nvidia’s stock is 22.8% higher than six months ago, outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in that time.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points U.S.-China trade relations have presented headwinds, but Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) is also the dominant AI chipmaker in the market, and the company’s profitability remains strong.\nHere is a look at where Nvidia stock could be headed for the rest of this year and into the next.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNote that gains for the chipmaker in that time have helped wipe away the steep drop the stock suffered early in 2025, after it reported it would take a $5.5 billion charge tied to the H20 chip export restrictions to China. While some analysts have raised price targets, others caution about ongoing headwinds due to uncertainty surrounding future U.S.-China trade relations and the potential for stricter regulations. The third-quarter report was stellar on the top and bottom lines due to strong growth in the data center segment.\nDespite its challenges, the company's pivot to U.S. AI infrastructure investments signals resilience. With analysts eyeing robust data center demand, 24/7 Wall St. here explores whether Nvidia can sustain its recovery and drive further growth.\n\nWhy Invest in Nvidia? Nvidia faces significant hurdles as it navigates U.S.-China trade restrictions and intense market expectations. In the first quarter, export controls on its H20 AI chip—which had been designed specifically to circumvent export restrictions on advanced technology to China—led to the substantial write-down noted above. Analysts believed the ban could result in a $9 billion revenue hit. Some $700 million would affect fiscal first-quarter results, with the remaining $8 billion spread across the second and third quarters.\n\nU.S. tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures also threatened supply chain costs, particularly for components sourced globally, while competition from Huawei’s Ascend chips grows. These factors had analysts warning of margin pressure. Yet, Nvidia's profitability remains robust. The company has reportedly raised prices 10% to 15% on some of its most popular GPUs as a result of the tariffs. Gaming processor prices jumped 5% to 10%, while it hiked high-end AI GPUs as much as 15% to account for surging manufacturing costs and to keep its earnings stable.\n\nStory Continues\nYet investments in U.S. AI infrastructure, supported by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's $165 billion Arizona fab expansion, bolster Nvidia's supply chains and are backed by its $37.6 billion cash reserve.\nCEO Huang announced during his recent trip to South Korea that Nvidia will supply more than 260,000 advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to South Korean firms, including Samsung and Hyundai Motor. He believes AI has reached a \"virtuous cycle\" where improvements in the models lead to more investment, which in turn leads to further improvement and investment. He also expressed hope that trade talks between the U.S. and China might lead to a change in policy that allows Nvidia to resume sales of state-of-the-art chips in China. As mentioned, the U.S. president has now allowed the company to sell its advanced H200 AI chips to China.\n\nThe AI market is projected to grow at a 37% CAGR through 2030, according to Grand View Research. This supports Nvidia’s $170 billion fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, a 30% increase over the $130.5 billion it generated in 2025.\nNvidia as a Company In its third-quarter earnings report, Nvidia revenue totaled a record $57.01 billion, including $51.2 billion from its data center division. The total was up 66% year over year, largely fueled by the voracious demand for its AI chips.\nThe chipmaker invested $3.2 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, expanding Blackwell accelerator production and AI infrastructure. The company's capex has spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion to meet hyperscaler demand.\n\nU.S.-China trade restrictions still pose risks, even with the seeming thaw, tariffs could raise costs, which would explain the price hikes reportedly implemented. A 36% operating expense increase to $5.8 billion for R&D offset Nvidia's adjusted operating income of $37.8 billion.\nYet, Nvidia's growth is not solely tied to data centers. The company expanded its automotive segment, with a 32% year-over-year increase to $592 million, driven by partnerships with Toyota and Aurora Innovation for autonomous vehicles. This diversifies Nvidia's portfolio amid tariff uncertainties.\nNvidia has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of $65 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook exceeded analysts' consensus projection.\nNvidia as a Stock This has been a rollercoaster year for Nvidia shareholders. The stock dropped to a 52-week low of $86.62 in April. After an announced pause in U.S.-China tariffs and the first-quarter results, the share price recovered. It hit an all-time high of $212.19 in October, which had the company's market cap briefly over $5 trillion.\n\nWhile some insiders have been selling shares, analyst sentiment remains bullish. Of 64 analysts who cover the stock, 60 recommend buying shares, 11 of them with Strong Buy ratings. Their consensus one-year price target is $250.93, which signals over 41% upside potential from its current price. Targets range from $140 to $352 per share.\nCitigroup, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and others recently maintained their Buy-equivalent ratings. Evercore ISI has the street-high target price. It cited accelerating revenue growth, strong demand for Blackwell chips, an improving supply chain, and a significant pipeline. Yet, renowned investor Michael Burry is bearish on Nvidia.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$140.00\n−21.2%\nMedian\n$250.93\n41.2%\nHigh\n$352.00\n98.1%\n\nNvidia's AI dominance, 93% data center growth, and automotive partnerships with Toyota positioned the company for gains in 2025. However, tariff risks and DeepSeek’s competitive AI models require caution. The AI market's growth and the chipmaker's $47 billion second-quarter revenue position Nvidia to achieve its $170 billion full-year revenue target, while its cash buffer and Stargate Project role offer stability. Still, valuation concerns linger. Nvidia is a buy for growth-oriented investors, but others should use caution.\n\n24/7 Wall St.'s 2026 year-end price target for Nvidia is $300.14 per share, which would be a 68.9% gain. That estimate accounts for tariff risks, competition from DeepSeek, and potential Blackwell supply constraints. It also reflects Nvidia's AI dominance and second-quarter 2026 revenue guidance.\nTime to Sell Nvidia Stock as Michael Burry Takes Aim?\n\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Why Taiwan Semiconductor's 6.5% Dip Could Be a Smart Buy\n\nJeffrey Neal Johnson, MarketBeat\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 3:39 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nAAPL\n\nTSMWF\n\nKey Points TSMC saw a discrepancy between seasonal inventory adjustments and massive YOY growth, which triggered a compelling entry point for long-term investors.\nHigh-performance computing has overtaken mobile as the primary revenue driver for the company, signaling a permanent shift toward structural growth in AI.\nManagement has signaled strong confidence in future cash flows by pre-announcing a dividend increase, underscoring the durability of the business model.\nInterested in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nThe stock market is often described as a weighing machine in the long run, but a voting machine in the short run. In today's high-speed trading environment, that voting machine is frequently run by algorithms that react instantly to headlines, often without understanding the context.\nThis dynamic appears to be the primary driver behind the recent movement in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC). Following the release of the company's November revenue report on Dec. 10, the stock has pulled back approximately 6%, currently trading near the $287 level.\n→ Rivian’s Autonomy Bombshell Changes Everything—Even Its Valuation\nThe trigger for this sell-off was a specific data point from the revenue report: November revenue declined 6.5% from October, coming in at approximately 343.61 billion New Taiwan dollars (NT$), or roughly $10.93 billion.\n\nTo a computer program or a nervous day trader, a month-over-month drop looks like a warning that momentum is slowing.\n→ ServiceNow’s $7 Billion Gamble: Panic or Opportunity?\nHowever, for a rational investor willing to look past the daily volatility, the picture is entirely different. While the monthly number dipped, the year-over-year (YOY) performance tells the real story. Compared to November 2024, revenue surged by an impressive 24.5%.\nThis divergence between short-term trading signals and long-term fundamentals has created a potential disconnect between TSMC’s stock price and its true strength. The miss that the market is worried about is likely a false alarm, while the long-term growth story remains one of the strongest in the technology sector.\n\n→ 3 Companies Turning Big Cash Flow Into Bigger Shareholder Gains\nDoing the Math: Why the Miss Is a Myth To understand why the recent selling is irrational, investors simply need to perform a basic check of the company’s own financial guidance. On the previous earnings call, management projected fourth-quarter revenue to range from $32.2 billion to $33.4 billion. In local currency, this translates to approximately NT$1 trillion.\n\nStory Continues\nWe now have two-thirds of the data for the quarter, and the math is overwhelmingly positive.\nOctober Performance: The company posted record-breaking revenue.\nNovember Performance: Despite the dip, the company brought in NT$343.61 billion (approximately $10.93 billion).\nThe Running Total: The combined revenue for October and November stands at NT$711.09 billion (approximately $22.64 billion).\n\nThis total puts TSMC in a commanding position heading into year-end. To hit the upper end of their guidance range, the company only needs to generate roughly NT$300 billion (about $9.55 billion) in December.\nContext is key here. TSMC has consistently posted monthly revenue well above NT$300 billion (roughly $9.55 billion) in recent months. Therefore, hitting the top end of the guidance, or even beating it, is not just possible; it is probable. The miss in November was not a sign of failure. It was simply a mathematical result of October being a tough act to follow.\nStructural vs. Seasonal: The Two Engines of Growth If the company is on track, why did revenue drop from October to November? The answer lies in understanding the difference between seasonal cycles and structural growth.\nTSMC powers two main ecosystems: consumer electronics (smartphones/PCs) and high-performance computing (AI data centers).\nThe Seasonal Engine (Smartphones): This sector is dictated by the calendar. Companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) rush to stock up on chips in September and October to ensure they have enough iPhones for the holiday shopping season. By November, that inventory build-up naturally cools down. The 6.5% monthly decline is likely just a reflection of this normal seasonal pattern.\nThe Structural Engine (AI): This sector is driven by a technological revolution. Data centers are being built and upgraded year-round, regardless of holiday shopping trends.\n\nIn the third-quarter earnings report, TSMC revealed a critical shift: High-Performance Computing (HPC) now accounts for 57% of total revenue. This means the AI engine is now larger and more important than the smartphone engine. While the mobile market wobbles with the seasons, the AI market is accelerating structurally. The dominant revenue driver is no longer the phone in a consumer's pocket, but the massive server farms powering the future of the global economy.\nA Dividend Signal You Can't Ignore Revenue figures tell us what happened in the past, but dividends tell us what management expects for the future. In the semiconductor industry, building factories is costly. When companies fear a downturn, they hoard cash to protect their balance sheets. They almost never promise to pay shareholders more.\n\nTSMC is sending a very different signal. The stock recently traded ex-dividend on Dec. 11, but the real news is the forward outlook. Management has signaled an intention to increase the dividend to approximately 97 cents per share, payable in April 2026.\nThis pre-announced hike is a definitive vote of confidence. It suggests that the executives who see the internal order books expect strong, sustainable cash flows to continue well into next year.\nFrom a valuation standpoint, the recent pullback has created a window of opportunity. The stock is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 29.5.\nGross Margins: 59.5% (The company keeps nearly 60 cents of profit on every dollar of sales).\nRevenue Growth: Exceeding 30% year-to-date.\n\nTypically, high-growth monopolies with margins this high command a premium valuation significantly higher than 30 times earnings. The current price reflects a rare disparity between the stock's price and the quality of the business.\nOpportunity Knocks: A Tactical Entry Point The stock market's reaction to the November revenue report appears to be a classic case of short-term thinking overpowering long-term analysis. The 6.5% monthly drop is a backward-looking, seasonal blip. The 24.5% YOY growth is the forward-looking reality.\nFor investors, this disconnect offers a clear tactical advantage. The stock is currently trading near $287. This is significantly below the average analyst price target of $355, suggesting a potential upside of more than 23%.\nThe AI supercycle is not stalling; it is maturing. TSMC remains the toll road for that growth. For those looking to add exposure to the world's most important manufacturing company, this seasonal dip represents a compelling entry point.\nThe article \" Why Taiwan Semiconductor's 6.5% Dip Could Be a Smart Buy \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "This AI Chip Stock Could Be the Real Winner as Data Center Demand Explodes in 2026\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 12:10 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Spending on data centers is expected to increase by billions in the coming years.\nTSMC is the go-to company for manufacturing advanced AI chips used in data centers.\nIts stock is reasonably priced compared to top artificial intelligence chip designers.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nIf you said that artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the tech world by storm, you'd probably be underselling it. It seems it has consumed every tech-related conversation and caused pivots for many companies in the industry.\nThe AI boom has been multifaceted. You have consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT that have driven much of its mainstream popularity, massive investments in data centers and cloud infrastructure, and high-performance hardware companies like Nvidia that supply many critical pieces that power data centers.\nThe data center portion of it seems to be on the earlier end of what many are expecting (or, rather, hoping) it can be. Many companies -- especially hyperscalers like Alphabet , Amazon , and Microsoft -- have committed to spending billions to build them out in the next year and beyond.\nAlthough there are many moving parts to these anticipated data center build-outs, one company in particular stands to gain a lot: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , also known as TSMC. Here's why.\nThe importance of data centers in AI For AI to work on the scale we see today, it must be trained on tons of data -- and that's putting it lightly. This data can't be stored in traditional ways, either. It must be stored in data centers that can process massive amounts of information at high speeds and supply the electricity that's needed to power them 24/7. Some estimates say an AI query uses 10 times as much electricity as a standard Google search.\n\nData centers' importance to training and scaling AI is why we've seen an explosion in spending related to them. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has said that he anticipates companies spending $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030 on building out this AI infrastructure. This spending should trickle down, and at the beginning of the AI supply chain, TSMC will be waiting.\nWhy TSMC stands out as the real potential winner Companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices , Alphabet, and Amazon design the AI chips used in data centers. However, every single one of them relies on TSMC to manufacture the chips and bring them to life. If we're using cars as a comparison, those companies are the designers and brands, but TSMC is the factory that actually builds the engines.\n\nStory Continues\nThere's a good reason for that, too. No company compares to TSMC's efficiency and scale, which is why its market share on advanced AI chips is well into the upper-90% range. Samsung and Intel both manufacture chips, but neither comes close to TSMC.\nThe reliance on TSMC for its AI chip manufacturing has also begun to show in its financials. In the third quarter, high-performance computing (HPC) accounted for 57% of TSMC's $33.1 billion in revenue. Three years ago, in Q3 2022, HPC was only 39% of TSMC's revenue.\n\nBefore HPC, smartphones accounted for most of TSMC's revenue. This new shift in demand works in TSMC's favor because smartphones tend to be more about consumer upgrade cycles, while AI chips are poised to be sustained investments.\nPlaying into the hands of the electricity-conscious tech companies TSMC's moat is already wide, but one thing that's furthering its advantage is that its chips are not only faster, but also more power-efficient. Its new A14 manufacturing process is expected to produce chips that are 15% faster and use 30% less power. That should be music to data center operators' ears because it could noticeably reduce energy consumption.\n\nAside from the original build-out, maintaining a data center costs companies millions annually. Being able to run it with more power-efficient chips could mean meaningful savings.\nTSMC seems to be fairly priced For a company operating in a virtual monopoly, TSMC's stock isn't as expensive as one might expect it to be. At the time of this writing, it's trading at 28 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months. That's much cheaper than companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom , while still delivering strong earnings growth.\nThere's no doubt that TSMC stands to gain from the projected data center build-outs. However, even if plans change (such as companies reducing their anticipated spending), TSMC remains a great investment because its business is vital to virtually all technology, not just the AI boom. It's a stock I personally plan to hold for the long haul.\n\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "How Investors May Respond To KLA (KLAC) Analyst Upgrades Tied To AI‑Driven Chipmaking Demand\n\nSimply Wall St\nTue, December 16, 2025 at 12:06 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: KLAC\n\nTSM\n\nIn recent days, KLA has attracted a wave of analyst upgrades and bullish research highlighting its leadership in process control and advanced packaging for AI and high‑bandwidth memory manufacturing. These views build on KLA’s strong cash generation and capital returns, as well as industry forecasts for higher wafer fab equipment spending supported by leading customers like TSMC and DRAM makers.\nWhat stands out is how multiple firms now frame KLA as a critical enabler of the AI infrastructure buildout, with its tools becoming more essential as chip designs grow more complex and process control intensity rises across both leading‑edge logic and memory fabs.\nNext, we’ll examine how this growing analyst conviction around AI‑driven semiconductor equipment demand could influence KLA’s existing investment narrative.\n\nThe end of cancer? These 29 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early identification of life changing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.\nKLA Investment Narrative Recap To own KLA, you need to believe that AI, high‑bandwidth memory and advanced packaging will keep pushing process control spending higher, and that KLA can defend its margin profile despite tariffs, export controls and rising R&D. The recent wave of analyst upgrades reinforces AI as the key near term catalyst but does not materially change the biggest risk, which remains potential disruption or slower spending in major markets such as China.\n\nJefferies’ upgrade to Buy with a US$1,500 price target, tied to expectations for an AI driven wafer fab equipment uplift from the second half of 2026, directly connects to KLA’s exposure to leading edge logic, memory and advanced packaging. That call, alongside Morgan Stanley’s steady but rising WFE forecasts and KLA’s record US$1,066.0 million quarterly cash flow, supports the view that AI infrastructure spending could offset some volatility from normalizing backlogs and more cyclical demand.\nYet behind this optimism, investors should be aware that KLA’s heavy reliance on AI linked capex could become a vulnerability if...\nRead the full narrative on KLA (it's free!)\nKLA's narrative projects $14.8 billion revenue and $5.3 billion earnings by 2028.\n\nUncover how KLA's forecasts yield a $1297 fair value , a 6% upside to its current price.\nExploring Other Perspectives Six fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$633 to US$1,297 per share, showing how far apart individual views can be. Against this, KLA’s dependence on sustained AI and advanced packaging capex highlights why it may help to compare several of these perspectives before deciding how its growth story fits into your own expectations.\n\nStory Continues\nExplore 6 other fair value estimates on KLA - why the stock might be worth 48% less than the current price!\nBuild Your Own KLA Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?

      "Title": "Does TSMC’s AI Chip Surge Still Offer Value After Its Massive Multi Year Rally?",
      "URL": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-tsmc-ai-chip-surge-001519939.html",
      "Content": "Does TSMC’s AI Chip Surge Still Offer Value After Its Massive Multi Year Rally?\n\nSimply Wall St\nMon, December 15, 2025 at 4:15 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nWondering if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is still a smart buy after its massive run, or if the easy money has already been made? You are not alone, and that is exactly what this breakdown is going to unpack.\nThe stock has cooled off slightly in the last week with a -4.7% move, but it is still up 1.0% over 30 days, 42.7% year to date and 43.8% over the past year, with a 292.2% gain over three years and 193.1% over five years.\nThose moves have come as TSM has cemented its role as the go-to manufacturer for leading-edge chips used in AI data centers, smartphones and high-performance computing, while global demand for advanced semiconductors has stayed robust despite macro uncertainty. Investors are also paying close attention to ongoing US-China tech tensions and TSM's progress on new fabs in the US and Japan, which both add excitement and new execution risks to the story.\nOn our valuation checks, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing scores a 3/6 valuation score , suggesting it looks undervalued on some metrics but not all, which makes it a useful case for comparing different valuation approaches and, later on, exploring a more complete way to think about its worth.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing delivered 43.8% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Semiconductor industry.\nApproach 1: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a business is worth today by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and discounting those cash flows back to the present. For Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the model uses a 2 stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach based on cash flow projections.\n\nThe latest twelve month free cash flow is about NT$802.4 Billion, and analysts expect this to keep growing as demand for advanced chips remains strong. By 2029, free cash flow is projected to reach roughly NT$2.4 Trillion, with further gains extrapolated by Simply Wall St out to 2035 as growth gradually slows from today’s elevated levels.\nWhen all these future cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of about $216.49 per share. Compared with the current share price, this implies the stock is around 32.9% overvalued on a pure cash flow basis, suggesting a lot of optimism is already priced in.\nResult: OVERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing may be overvalued by 32.9%. Discover 908 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.\n\nStory Continues\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\nApproach 2: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Price vs Earnings For a mature, consistently profitable business like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the price to earnings, or PE, ratio is a useful way to gauge what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of current earnings. In general, companies with faster and more reliable earnings growth, and lower perceived risk, tend to justify a higher PE, while slower growth or greater uncertainty usually calls for a lower, more conservative multiple.\n\nTSM currently trades on a PE of about 23.9x, well below both the semiconductor industry average of roughly 37.0x and the broader peer group average of around 60.8x. On the surface, that discount might suggest the stock is attractively priced, but simple comparisons can be misleading because they ignore company specific factors like growth outlook, margins and risk profile.\nTo address this, Simply Wall St uses a proprietary Fair Ratio, which estimates what a more appropriate multiple should be after considering TSM’s earnings growth, profitability, industry, market cap and risk factors. For TSM, this Fair Ratio is 37.6x, materially above the current 23.9x. This indicates that, given its fundamentals, the market may not be fully recognizing its earnings power.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1447 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. On Simply Wall St this takes the form of Narratives, which are simple, story driven snapshots where investors connect their view of a company’s future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast, and then to a Fair Value that can be compared against today’s share price to decide whether to buy, hold or sell. Narratives are available on the Community page and are designed to be easy and accessible. They dynamically update as new information like earnings, guidance or major news comes in. For Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, for example, one optimistic Narrative might assume rapid AI driven growth, resilient margins and a Fair Value of around $310 per share. A more cautious Narrative could factor in geopolitical risk, margin pressure from overseas fabs and a much lower Fair Value. By comparing where price sits relative to each Narrative’s Fair Value, you can quickly see which story you believe and what that implies for your next move.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing?
