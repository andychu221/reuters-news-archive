Discovery ( WBD ) is expected to reject Paramount Skydance's ( PSKY ) latest hostile takeover bid, Nike ( NKE ) shares gaining on CEO Elliott Hill purchase of $1 million in the company's stock, and Reuters reporting that Nvidia ( NVDA ) has asked Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSM ) to ramp up AI chip production to help with H200 orders.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nLet's hit some Yahoo Finance's trending tickers. We're watching Warner Brothers Discovery, Nike and Nvidia. First up, WBD.\n00:05 Speaker A\nThe media giant is reportedly set to reject Paramount's latest takeover bid next week after the board's upcoming meeting.\n00:11 Speaker A\nParamount recently took its bid hostile and made changes to sweeten its offer, including guaranteeing a backstop from Oracle billionaire CEO Larry Ellison, but it didn't raise the $30 per share price tag, which is higher than the Netflix deal.\n00:22 Speaker A\nNext, Nike. Shares are rising ahead of the opening bell, thanks to another insider stock buy, just days after a long time uh board director Tim Cook snapped up the beaten-down stock.\n00:32 Speaker A\nNike CEO Elliot Hill is also jumping in. According to a regulatory filing, he'll purchase roughly $1 million worth of Nike shares.\n00:41 Speaker A\nIt's Hill's first open market purchase of uh stock since taking over as CEO in October 2024.\n00:47 Speaker A\nFinally, Nvidia. The chip giant reportedly seeing strong demand for its H2 chips from Chinese tech companies and, according to Reuters, the company has approached Taiwan Semiconductor to ramp up production.\n00:56 Speaker A\nThe report says Nvidia has got on orders for 2 million chips, but only has an inventory of 700,000.\n1:02 Speaker A\nBut there's still a big risk for Nvidia. Despite the high demand, Beijing still has to approve any shipments of H200 chips, which hasn't happened yet.\n\n條款 及 私隱政策\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI Weekly: Meta wants Manus, AI investors want more in 2026\n\nReuters Videos\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 3:48 AM PST\n\nIn this video: META\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nSTORY: From Meta's plans for Manus... to the AI outlook for investors in 2026. This is AI Weekly. :: AI Weekly Meta has said it will buy Chinese-founded startup Manus as the tech giant accelerates efforts to integrate advanced AI across its platforms. Financial terms were not released, but a source told Reuters the deal values Manus at between $2 billion and $3 billion. Manus went viral early this year on X after it released what it claimed was the world's first general AI agent, capable of making decisions and executing tasks autonomously with less prompting than ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The company was cheered by Chinese state television, with commentators calling it China's next DeepSeek. Nvidia is reportedly scrambling to meet strong demand for its H200 artificial intelligence chips from Chinese technology companies. And according to sources, has approached contract manufacturer TSMC to ramp up production. They added that Chinese tech firms have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips for 2026, while Nvidia currently holds just 700,000 units in stock. SoftBank Group said it completed a $41 billion investment in OpenAI. The move is one of the largest-ever private funding rounds that would give the Japanese firm a stake of about 11% in the ChatGPT maker. Artificial intelligence software developer Eliza Labs has ended its lawsuit accusing billionaire Elon Musk’s X Corp of extracting valuable information from the company before launching copycat AI products. A federal judge in Texas dismissed the case, after Eliza Labs and X said that they agreed to dismissal with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be refiled. X had denied wrongdoing. And as global markets closed out the year, they remained buoyed by strong fundamentals and rising capital flows into growth markets, amplified by an AI-driven investment boom. And that is expected to continue into 2026 as investors keep channelling capital into AI-linked infrastructure, foundries and supply chains. As well as betting on growth from data centers, advanced chip making, and next-generation computing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) the Best New Stock from David Tepper’s Portfolio?\n\nHamna Asim\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 2:25 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: AMD\n\nSSNLF\n\nTSM\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the new stocks David Tepper has bought . As of December 29, the average price target for AMD suggests an upside of 34%; however, the Street high indicates an upside of 77%. In Q3 2025, David Tepper purchased 950,000 shares of AMD valued at $153.70 million, making it the billionaire’s largest new position during Q3. Since December 15, the market has been abuzz with speculation that Samsung could potentially strike a deal with AMD to provide 2nm AI chips. This comes in light of the N-2 rule likely hindering Taiwan Semiconductor from manufacturing its most complicated nodes abroad. Reports suggest that Samsung’s Executive Chairman, Lee Jae-yong, had a meeting with AMD CEO Lisa Su as well as other Big Tech executives, to discuss the company’s foundry business and consequent business arrangements. The 2nm chipsets could power AMD's CPUs in the future, and a deal with Samsung could be closed in January 2026.\nPhoto by JESHOOTS.COM on Unsplash Separately, Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Advanced Micro Devices on December 15, with a $280 price target, representing 33% upside from current levels. Overall, Wall Street analysts had a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock. Piper remained optimistic about AMD’s short- and mid-term drivers, particularly noting the company’s ability to meet technical targets such as the MI300 series ramp and technical progress for the MI400 series rollout. Analysts also expect further sales growth this year. The firm also told investors that AMD is putting notable resources into the Helios rack, which is slated for release in mid-2026. The company intends to widen its clientele beyond OpenAI, even though part of its new business is expected from that partnership. Piper Sandler noted that AMD’s finances seem to be sorted, and it can fund its development plans. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Exclusive: Nvidia sounds out TSMC on new H200 chip order as China demand jumps, sources say\n\nReuters\nUpdated Wed, December 31, 2025 at 3:10 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nDec 31 (Reuters) - Nvidia ( NVDA ) is scrambling to meet strong demand for its H200 artificial intelligence chips from Chinese technology companies and has approached contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co ( TSM ) to ramp up production, sources said.\nChinese technology companies have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips for 2026, while Nvidia currently holds ​just 700,000 units in stock, two of the people said.\n\nThe exact additional volume Nvidia intends to order from TSMC remains unclear, they said. A third source said Nvidia has asked ‌TSMC to begin production of the additional chips, and work is expected to start in the second quarter of 2026.\nThe moves raise concerns over whether there could be further tightening in global AI chip supplies as Nvidia now has ‌to strike the right balance between meeting robust Chinese demand and addressing constrained supplies elsewhere.\n\nThey could also intensify risks for Nvidia, as Beijing has yet to greenlight any shipments of H200 chips. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump only recently allowed exports of the H200 to China.\nThe talks between Nvidia and TSMC and details of the Chinese demand have not been reported before. The pricing has also not been reported earlier - Nvidia has decided which H200 variants it will offer to Chinese clients and price them around $27,000 per chip, the sources said.\n\nNvidia said in response to a request for comment that it ⁠continuously manages its supply chain.\n\"Licensed sales of the H200 to authorised ‌customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"China is a highly competitive market with rapidly growing local chip suppliers. Blocking all U.S. exports undercut our national and economic security and only benefited foreign competition.\"\nTSMC declined to comment and ‍China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters spoke to five people for this story, who declined to be named as the discussions are private.\nThe potential order would mark a significant expansion of H200 production at a time when Nvidia has been focused on ramping up its newer Blackwell and upcoming Rubin chip lines. The H200, part of Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper architecture, uses ​TSMC's 4-nanometer manufacturing process.\nNvidia plans to fulfil initial orders from existing stock with the first batch of H200 chips expected to arrive before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, Reuters ‌reported earlier this month.\n\nStory continues\nCHINESE TECH GIANTS DRIVE DEMAND The bulk of the orders of over 2 million chips for 2026 has come from major Chinese internet companies, which view the H200 as a significant upgrade over chips currently available to them, two of the people said.\nOf Nvidia's current 700,000-unit inventory, around 100,000 are GH200 Grace Hopper superchips, which combine Nvidia's Grace CPU with the Hopper GPU architecture, while the remainder are standalone H200 chips, one of them said.\n\nBoth variants will be offered to Chinese clients, the person said.\nWhile Nvidia has indicated a pricing ballpark to the Chinese customers, it would vary based on purchase volume and specific customer arrangements, said two of the people.\nAn eight-chip module is expected to cost around 1.5 million yuan, making it slightly more expensive than the ⁠now-unavailable H20 module, which previously sold for around 1.2 million yuan, they said.\nHowever, given that the H200 delivers ​roughly six times the performance of the H20 - a downgraded chip Nvidia designed specifically for the Chinese market that ​was later blocked by Beijing from being shipped into China - the sources said Chinese internet firms view the pricing as attractive.\nThe price also represents a roughly 15% discount compared to grey-market alternatives, which currently retail at over 1.75 million yuan, according to the sources.\n\nByteDance plans to spend about 100 billion yuan on ‍Nvidia's chips in 2026, up from roughly 85 billion ⁠yuan in 2025, if China allows H200 sales, the South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday, citing sources.\nREGULATORY UNCERTAINTY PERSISTS The planned shipments follow Trump's decision earlier this month to allow H200 sales to China with a 25% fee, reversing the Biden administration's ban on advanced AI chip exports to China.\nHowever, Chinese officials are still deciding whether to allow ⁠H200 imports amid concerns that access to advanced foreign chips could slow development of the domestic AI semiconductor industry.\nBut they have not signaled immediate opposition. While Chinese chipmakers have managed to come up with products that rival the H20 ‌in performance, there are not yet any equivalents of the H200.\nOne proposal under consideration would require bundling each H200 purchase with a certain ratio of domestically produced ‌chips, Reuters previously reported.\n(Reporting by Liam Mo, Wen-Yee Lee and Brenda Goh; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Exclusive-Nvidia sounds out TSMC on new H200 chip order as China demand jumps, sources say\n\nReuters\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 11:44 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nDec 31 (Reuters) - Nvidia is scrambling to meet strong demand for its H200 artificial intelligence chips from Chinese technology companies and has approached contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to ramp up production, sources said.\nChinese technology companies have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips for 2026, while Nvidia currently holds ​just 700,000 units in stock, two of the people said.\n\nThe exact additional volume Nvidia intends to order from TSMC remains unclear, they said. A third source said Nvidia has asked ‌TSMC to begin production of the additional chips, and work is expected to start in the second quarter of 2026.\nThe moves raise concerns over whether there could be further tightening in global AI chip supplies as Nvidia now has ‌to strike the right balance between meeting robust Chinese demand and addressing constrained supplies elsewhere.\nThey could also intensify risks for Nvidia, as Beijing has yet to greenlight any shipments of H200 chips. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump only recently allowed exports of the H200 to China.\nThe talks between Nvidia and TSMC and details of the Chinese demand have not been reported before. The pricing has also not been reported earlier - Nvidia has decided which H200 variants it will offer to Chinese clients and price them around $27,000 per chip, the sources said.\n\nNvidia said in response to a request for comment that it ⁠continuously manages its supply chain.\n\"Licensed sales of the H200 to authorised ‌customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"China is a highly competitive market with rapidly growing local chip suppliers. Blocking all U.S. exports undercut our national and economic security and only benefited foreign competition.\"\nTSMC declined to comment and ‍China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters spoke to five people for this story, who declined to be named as the discussions are private.\nThe potential order would mark a significant expansion of H200 production at a time when Nvidia has been focused on ramping up its newer Blackwell and upcoming Rubin chip lines. The H200, part of Nvidia's previous-generation Hopper architecture, uses ​TSMC's 4-nanometer manufacturing process.\nNvidia plans to fulfil initial orders from existing stock with the first batch of H200 chips expected to arrive before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, Reuters ‌reported earlier this month.\n\nStory Continues\nCHINESE TECH GIANTS DRIVE DEMAND\nThe bulk of the orders of over 2 million chips for 2026 has come from major Chinese internet companies, which view the H200 as a significant upgrade over chips currently available to them, two of the people said.\nOf Nvidia's current 700,000-unit inventory, around 100,000 are GH200 Grace Hopper superchips, which combine Nvidia's Grace CPU with the Hopper GPU architecture, while the remainder are standalone H200 chips, one of them said.\n\nBoth variants will be offered to Chinese clients, the person said.\nWhile Nvidia has indicated a pricing ballpark to the Chinese customers, it would vary based on purchase volume and specific customer arrangements, said two of the people.\nAn eight-chip module is expected to cost around 1.5 million yuan, making it slightly more expensive than the ⁠now-unavailable H20 module, which previously sold for around 1.2 million yuan, they said.\nHowever, given that the H200 delivers ​roughly six times the performance of the H20 - a downgraded chip Nvidia designed specifically for the Chinese market that ​was later blocked by Beijing from being shipped into China - the sources said Chinese internet firms view the pricing as attractive.\nThe price also represents a roughly 15% discount compared to grey-market alternatives, which currently retail at over 1.75 million yuan, according to the sources.\n\nByteDance plans to spend about 100 billion yuan on ‍Nvidia's chips in 2026, up from roughly 85 billion ⁠yuan in 2025, if China allows H200 sales, the South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday, citing sources.\nREGULATORY UNCERTAINTY PERSISTS\nThe planned shipments follow Trump's decision earlier this month to allow H200 sales to China with a 25% fee, reversing the Biden administration's ban on advanced AI chip exports to China.\nHowever, Chinese officials are still deciding whether to allow ⁠H200 imports amid concerns that access to advanced foreign chips could slow development of the domestic AI semiconductor industry.\nBut they have not signaled immediate opposition. While Chinese chipmakers have managed to come up with products that rival the H20 ‌in performance, there are not yet any equivalents of the H200.\nOne proposal under consideration would require bundling each H200 purchase with a certain ratio of domestically produced ‌chips, Reuters previously reported.\n(Reporting by Liam Mo, Wen-Yee Lee and Brenda Goh; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Nvidia and Apple are among firms pouring many billions of dollars into chips, servers and data centres.\nAI-related spending is soaring worldwide, and is expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion by 2025, according to US research firm Gartner, and over $2 trillion in 2026 -- nearly two percent of global GDP.\nTaiwan's dominance of the chip industry has long been seen as a \"silicon shield\" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China -- which claims the island is part of its sovereign territory -- and an incentive for the United States to defend it.\nBut the threat of a Chinese attack has fuelled concerns about potential disruptions to global supply chains and has increased pressure for more chip production beyond Taiwan's shores.\n\nChinese fighter jets and warships encircled Taiwan during live-fire drills this week aimed at simulating a blockade of the democratic island's key ports and assaults on maritime targets.\nTaipei, which slammed the two-day war games as \"highly provocative and reckless\", said the manoeuvre failed to impose a blockade on the island.\nTSMC has invested in chip fabrication facilities in the United States, Japan and Germany to meet soaring demand for semiconductors, which have become the lifeblood of the global economy.\nBut in an interview with AFP this month, Taiwanese Deputy Foreign Minister Francois Chih-chung Wu said the island planned to keep making the \"most advanced\" chips on home soil and remain \"indispensable\" to the global semiconductor industry.\njoy-amj/abs\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Nvidia vs. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing: What's the Better Buy?\n\nManali Pradhan, CFA, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 1:55 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Nvidia boasts exceptional multiyear revenue visibility.\nTSMC is the clear leader in advanced chip manufacturing.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) are key players at different points along the artificial intelligence (AI) value chain. While Nvidia is the leading designer of the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to handle most AI workloads, TSMC is the global leader in fabricating and packaging advanced logic and memory chips.\nBoth have benefited from the AI megatrend -- but which of these companies looks like a better long-term stock buy from here?\nNvidia Nvidia has visibility into nearly $500 billion in combined Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of 2025 through the end of calendar 2026, of which $150 billion has already been shipped. The company's networking business is also generating multibillion-dollar revenues, with its proprietary high-speed GPU interconnect NVLink, high-performance networking standard InfiniBand, and the AI-optimized Ethernet platform Spectrum-X becoming integral parts of AI deployments worldwide.\n\nProduction of Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin platform is also on schedule to ramp up in the second half of 2026; those platforms, which will combine its new Vera CPU with its Rubin GPU, will support cloud, enterprise, robotics, and physical AI workloads.\nHowever, Nvidia depends extensively on TSMC's ability to manufacture chips using the most advanced process nodes. Also, while President Donald Trump recently loosened some of the trade restrictions he had imposed that were preventing Nvidia from selling AI-optimized chips to Chinese companies, it is still prohibited from selling its most advanced chips to that market.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSMC now earns a bulk of its revenue from producing advanced chips (7-nanometer and below), which are used heavily to handle high-performance computing workloads. The company is advancing its 2-nanometer (N2) process node toward volume production and recently highlighted its plans to start producing chips using its performance-enhanced N2P variant in 2026.\n\nTSMC is also working on its even more feature-dense and power-efficient A16 process node, with volume production scheduled for the second half of 2026.\nAdditionally, TSMC plans to scale its monthly Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) advanced packaging capacity from current levels of 75,000 to 80,000 wafers to as high as 120,000 to 130,000 wafers by the end of 2026, directly addressing the major bottleneck constraining chip shipments.\n\nStory Continues\nYet the geopolitical risks faced by Taiwan cannot be ignored by TSMC investors.\nHence, I must conclude that Nvidia is better suited for long-term investors focused on upside potential, while TSMC may be a good pick for investors who would prefer a more resilient stock.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia Just Officially Bought $5 Billion Worth of Intel Stock. Should You Buy INTC Too?\n\nAditya Raghunath\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 9:58 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nNvidia (NVDA) has completed its $5 billion equity investment in Intel (INTC), the semiconductor giant confirmed in a filing on Monday. The announcement finalizes a deal first announced in September that positions the world's most valuable company as a roughly 4% stakeholder in its struggling rival.\n\nThe AI chip leader purchased over 214.7 million Intel shares at $23.28 apiece in a private placement, a price that now sits 36% below Intel's recent trading levels, according to the filing.\nMore News from Barchart Micron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMicron Stock Stole the Show in 2025.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nThe transaction, which received regulatory clearance from the Federal Trade Commission earlier this month, could serve as a major financial lifeline for Intel after years of missteps and capital-intensive manufacturing expansions that have drained its resources.\nThe companies announced they will collaborate on multiple generations of custom data center and PC products, including Nvidia-designed x86 CPUs for AI infrastructure and system-on-chips combining Intel CPU cores with Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets.\n\nHowever, neither chipmaker has committed to moving Nvidia's crown-jewel GPU production away from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to Intel's contract manufacturing services.\nIs Intel Stock a Good Buy Right Now? Valued at a market cap of $175 billion, INTC stock has returned almost 90% in 2025. Despite strong demand for its legacy chip, Intel is wrestling with manufacturing bottlenecks. Intel is undershipping its 10 nm and 7 nm chips for the personal computer and server markets right now. These products still account for the bulk of Intel’s production volume.\n\nCFO John Pitzer acknowledged that supply constraints could peak in Q1 of 2026 and ease gradually over the next few months. However, it suggests that Intel is unlikely to meet demand even beyond Q1. The silver lining is that server shortages are actually worse than PC shortages, as servers carry better margins.\nMultiple factors are driving server demand for Intel:\nFirst, hyperscalers spent the last few years focused on AI infrastructure buildouts while delaying refreshes of their existing server fleets.\nSecond, these same companies are now severely power-constrained, and replacing a five-year-old server with a new one delivers 80 percent better power efficiency.\nThird, and most intriguing, the shift from large language model training to agentic AI appears to be putting unexpected demand on traditional computing infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the technology front, Intel's 18A node is advancing but remains a work in progress. The company shipped its first Panther Lake chip on schedule by year-end, though yields aren't in line with expectations.\nNew CEO Lip-Bu Tan has brought significant cultural changes since joining in March. The organization has been flattened from 11 or 12 management layers down to just five or six. Engineers now sit on the executive staff and are required to participate in customer conversations. The company has also implemented a return-to-office policy with employees back in the office four days per week.\n\nWhat Is the INTC Stock Price Target? Analysts tracking INTC stock forecast revenue to increase from $52.55 billion in 2025 to $74 billion in 2029. Investors are concerned about narrowing gross margins driven by early 18A ramp costs and pricing actions on newer products to manage tight supply. However, the company is projected to improve adjusted earnings per share from $0.34 in 2025 to $2.84 in 2030.\n\nAs Intel continues to invest in capital expenditures, its free cash outflow is expected to total $11 billion between 2025 and 2026. Notably, free cash flow is likely to improve from $640 million in 2027 to $4.32 billion in 2029. If INTC stock trades at 25x forward earnings, which is in line with its 10-year average, it could return 100% over the next three years.\nOut of the 42 analysts covering INTC stock, two recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” 33 recommend “Hold,” one recommends “Moderate Sell,” and five recommend “Strong Sell.”\nThe average INTC stock price target is $36.74, which is similar to the current price.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "This Could Derail Intel's Comeback in 2026\n\nTimothy Green, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:25 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nAMD\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Intel has a strong PC roadmap for 2026, including Panther Lake and Nova Lake.\nBoth CPU families will use the cutting-edge Intel 18A manufacturing process.\nSoaring memory chip prices could force PC price hikes and limit Intel's comeback in the PC market.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nOne of the issues plaguing Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) over the past few years has been an erosion of its PC CPU market share. Past manufacturing delays forced the company to use aging process nodes while rival AMD tapped TSMC 's top-tier manufacturing technology. Intel later outsourced manufacturing for its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, but the latter was a mixed bag that rubbed reviewers and consumers the wrong way.\nAgainst this backdrop, Intel's share of the desktop and laptop CPU market has tumbled. Intel remains the market leader, but AMD controlled approximately one-third of the desktop CPU market and more than one-fifth of the laptop CPU market in the third quarter. A decade ago, this kind of progress from AMD would have been unthinkable.\n\nIn 2026, Intel could regain some of the lost market share. Panther Lake for laptops and Nova Lake for desktops look promising, and both will be built on the new Intel 18A process node. However, soaring memory chip prices will likely increase PC prices and potentially dampen demand.\nIntel's 2026 roadmap shows promise Panther Lake will be the first mass-produced chip to be manufactured using the Intel 18A process, and it is expected to begin shipping in volume in early 2026. Intel 18A moves Intel to a new type of transistor and introduces backside power delivery, a technology that can boost efficiency by moving power circuitry to the back of the chip. The Intel 18A process is the first in the industry to implement backside power delivery.\n\nNova Lake will come later in 2026 for desktops, succeeding the troubled Arrow Lake family. In the meantime, the company is rumored to be launching a refresh of Arrow Lake, although the core problems with Arrow Lake are likely to remain unresolved until Nova Lake arrives. While Nova Lake's specifications are still unclear, rumors suggest high core counts and large amounts of cache for some models, which could better compete with AMD's 3D V-Cache chips.\nLaunching a new architecture on a new process node is always a challenge, but if Panther Lake and Nova Lake deliver solid improvements in performance and efficiency, they could be big winners for Intel.\nMemory prices could be a major problem Unfortunately for Intel, its Panther Lake and Nova Lake launches coincide with a severe and escalating shortage of DRAM memory. AI data centers need both high-bandwidth memory and standard DRAM memory in copious quantities. Memory chip manufacturers have been shifting production to HBM chips while being cautious about expanding overall production, creating a shortage of DRAM chips.\n\nStory Continues\nPC prices are almost certain to rise in 2026 as OEMs grapple with rising component costs. Dell is reportedly raising commercial PC prices by 10% to 30% in response to the memory chip crisis, a move that will likely be followed by other OEMs. Businesses could slow down upgrade plans in response. On the consumer side, higher prices and configurations with less memory are likely to be the prevailing themes in 2026.\n\nBeyond the potential for higher prices to hurt overall demand for PCs, lower memory configurations could hurt Intel's AI PC push. Panther Lake laptops will feature greater AI processing power than their predecessors, but a lack of memory could hinder usability. Microsoft requires at least 16 GB of RAM for a laptop to be labeled a Copilot+ PC, for example, because AI applications require significant amounts of memory.\nSoaring memory chip prices put Intel in a tough spot. Even if Panther Lake and Nova Lake are home runs, delivering performance and efficiency that top AMD, high PC prices could spoil the party. AMD is also impacted, so Intel won't be at a relative disadvantage and could still win market share. However, the size of the market could temporarily shrink as businesses and consumers resist price increases.\n\nWith memory chip production unlikely to increase meaningfully anytime soon, and with the AI boom still going strong, Intel's PC comeback in 2026 may be weaker than it could have otherwise been.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nTSMWF\n\n^GSPC\n\nTSMC (TSM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this chip company have returned +4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, to which TSMC belongs, has gained 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nTSMC is expected to post earnings of $2.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.17 points to a change of +44.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.2 indicates a change of +20% from what TSMC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, TSMC is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of TSMC, the consensus sales estimate of $32.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $121 billion and $146.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +34.3% and +20.8%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History TSMC reported revenues of $33.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +40.8%. EPS of $2.92 for the same period compares with $1.94 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.06%. The EPS surprise was +12.74%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTSMC is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about TSMC. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sign up now!\nVersus their pandemic high, however, Intel shares remain down some 50%, suggesting persistent structural and executions risks continue to weigh on sentiment.\nWhat to Expect From Intel Stock in 2026 The latest setback for INTC stock came from Nvidia (NVDA) that’s reportedly scrapped plans of producing its advanced chips using Intel’s 18A node.\nStill, Daniel Newman – the chief executive of Futurum Group – believes the longer term bull case remains intact for one simple reason: Taiwan Semi (TSM) just “can’t produce enough chips.”\n\nThe unprecedented AI-driven demand is making big names like Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM), and even AMD (AMD) explore alternatives, reinforcing Intel’s role as an auxiliary capacity provider.\nAnd since demand is truly explosive, being only an adjunct resource for the semiconductor space may prove sufficient in driving Intel stock higher in 2026, he told CNBC in a recent interview.\nINTC Shares Remain Inexpensive to Own Newman doesn’t see NVDA news as a major setback for Intel shares since Lip-Bu Tan had already broadcast that the initial ramp-up of the firm’s 18A node is optimized for and dedicated to its own internal products.\nAccording to him, the real inflection point for Intel will be its upcoming “14A” process, expected to enter volume production in 2028.\n\n“This is the one where rubber meets the road for companies like Nvidia, Apple, and others.”\nFrom a valuation perspective, INTC shares are just as attractive. Despite an explosive year-to-date rally, they’re going for just over 3x sales at the time of writing, versus more than 35x for Nvidia.\nWall Street Disagrees with Newman on Intel Wall Street analysts do not entirely agree with Newman’s constructive view on Intel stock, though.\nThe consensus rating on INTC shares remains at “Hold” only with the mean target of nearly $37 already in line with the price at which they are trading currently.\n\nStory continues\nThis article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.

      "Content": "1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock I'd Buy on Every Dip and Never Sell\n\nScott Levine, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nTSM\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points Semiconductor makers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel rely on sophisticated equipment to produce chips at scale.\nA profound competitive advantage is a great sign that a company's stock may be worth purchasing.\nStrong free cash flows and low debt-to-equity ratios are green lights when I'm investigating potential stock buys.\n10 stocks we like better than ASML ›\n\nUnlike chefs, who can prepare savory meals without precisely measuring ingredients, pastry chefs require exactness when crafting their sweet treats. Just a little too much of one ingredient -- or not enough of another -- can be the difference between pastry perfection and dessert disaster.\nSimilarly, the companies that manufacture the sophisticated semiconductors capable of handling artificial intelligence (AI) applications also require meticulous levels of precision in order to sustain high-volume production of those chips. For this reason, ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is high on my buy list. The company plays a pivotal role in the semiconductor industry, and I've long recognized its stock as a compelling way to expand my AI industry exposure.\nI plan to open a position in the coming weeks, and once it's initiated, I intend to click the buy button on ASML stock again during any dips.\nASML provides a unique AI investment opportunity Designing cutting-edge semiconductors -- the wheelhouse of companies like Nvidia and AMD -- is no small feat, yet it means little unless foundries can produce those chips at scale. This is where ASML comes in.\nWhile ASML provides a variety of equipment, software, and services to enable the large-scale fabrication of microchips, the products that make it most appealing to investors are its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These machines use light at a 13.5-nanometer wavelength to print the most sophisticated chip designs on the market, making them indispensable tools for foundry operators like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel .\n\nASML is the only company capable of building EUV machines, giving it an unparalleled position in the chip industry and providing it with a robust competitive advantage over its rivals.\nKicking the tires on the company's financials provides even more reassurance It's hard to argue with the allure of ASML, as it has a technological monopoly in a niche that is vital to the tech sector. The company's fundamentals further illustrate why its stock will be worth holding for the long term as the AI industry develops.\nFor one, the company generates extremely strong cash flow. In 2024 and 2023, for example, ASML reported free cash flow of $7 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, according to Morningstar . Its results are even more impressive when stacked up against its semiconductor equipment peers, Lam Research and Applied Materials .\n\nStory Continues\nOver the past decade, ASML has consistently generated more free cash flow per share -- especially during the past two years as the AI industry has boomed.\nPair this with the fact that the company has a strong balance sheet with a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 0.14 as of its most recent financial report, and its sound financial health becomes even more apparent.\n\nForget looking to Santa, I'm gifting ASML to myself this year I was uninterested in waiting for shares of ASML to appear under the tree, so I've made a plan to buy the stock in the coming weeks to get some skin in the game, and then gradually build my position as dips occur. Should another company ever debut an EUV lithography system, I'll have to reevaluate my position. For the time being, though, I'm eager to broaden my AI sector exposure with ASML stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now? Before you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

Its largest positions are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Tencent Holdings, and Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) , and the fund’s 20.8-year track record makes it one of the oldest in the space. No leverage, currency hedge, or ESG overlays are present.\n\nEEM is a bit more concentrated, holding 1,215 stocks with similar sector tilts: technology (27%), financial services (22%), and consumer cyclical (12%). Its portfolio is anchored by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Tencent Holdings, and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNL.F) , so the top holdings and sector exposures are closely aligned with VWO. Neither fund includes notable structural quirks.\nFor more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link .\nWhat this means for investors The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) and Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) offer similar exposure to emerging markets, considering the similarity in sector weighting and that their top two stocks are identical. However, performance will differ due to the differences in overall holdings.\n\nStory continues\nEEM includes stocks from South Korea, which is why Samsung is among its largest holdings, while VWO does not since the latter doesn't classify the country as an emerging market.\nConsequently, EEM's performance over the past year was significantly stronger than VWO's. Investors weighing which ETF to consider would have to decide if exposure to South Korean companies is important to them.\n\nOtherwise, VWO looks like the more compelling ETF. Its assets under management are much larger than EEM's, and this gives the ETF far greater liquidity. In addition, its substantially lower expense ratio means it's less costly for investors. VWO also offers a better dividend yield, adding to the gains investors can achieve with this ETF.\nGlossary Expense ratio: The annual fee, expressed as a percentage, that a fund charges to cover operating costs.\nDividend yield: The annual dividends paid by a fund, shown as a percentage of its current price.\nBeta: A measure of a fund’s volatility compared to the overall stock market, typically the S&P 500.\nAUM (Assets Under Management): The total market value of all assets managed by a fund.\nMax drawdown: The largest percentage drop from a fund’s peak value to its lowest point over a specific period.\nTotal return: The investment’s price change plus all dividends and distributions, assuming those payouts are reinvested.\nEmerging markets: Countries with developing economies and financial markets that are growing but not yet fully mature.\nSector tilt: When a fund has a higher allocation to certain industry sectors compared to a benchmark or the market.\nConcentration: The degree to which a fund’s assets are invested in a small number of holdings or sectors.\nLeverage: The use of borrowed money to increase potential investment returns, which also increases risk.\nCurrency hedge: A strategy to reduce the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on investment returns.\nESG overlays: Additional investment criteria that consider environmental, social, and governance factors when selecting securities.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "What Is the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 8:36 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Chip designers such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom serve as the backbone of generative AI development.\nWhile chip designers steal the spotlight, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is playing a hugely important supporting role in the background.\nAs demand for AI chips and data centers accelerates, Taiwan Semi is poised for explosive long-term growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nFor the last three years, investing in semiconductor stocks has proven to be a profitable decision given the critical role chips play in the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Companies such as Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices , Broadcom , and Micron Technology have been some of the biggest contributors to the semiconductor industry throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nFlying under the radar is another chip company whose storyline seems muted compared to its peers. That's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , the pick-and-shovel specialist of the chip realm.\nLet's dive into Taiwan Semi's increasingly important role for the future of AI and assess why the stock looks like a no-brainer buying opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon.\nHow does Taiwan Semiconductor benefit from AI? Throughout the AI revolution, hyperscalers such as Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and OpenAI have collectively poured hundreds of billions of dollars into AI-related capital expenditures (capex) -- namely, chips and networking gear for data centers.\nOn the surface, this is great news for the likes of Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. But underneath the surface, it's even better news for Taiwan Semi. Why is that?\n\nTSMC is the largest chip manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue. While Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom design the most-in demand GPUs and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) on the planet, each of these giants relies heavily on Taiwan Semi's cutting-edge fabrication processes.\nIn other words, if Nvidia and its competitors represent the body of the car moving the AI narrative forward, TSMC holds the keys to the ignition.\nTSMC's growth is off the charts Over the last year, Taiwan Semi's revenue has been growing strongly thanks to ongoing demand for AI accelerators. What's interesting to point out is that the company's revenue trajectory is actually steepening. This is largely driven by rising demand for Nvidia's and AMD's next-generation Rubin and MI400 Series chips, as well as increasing investment in custom hardware from cloud infrastructure providers.\n\nStory Continues\nThe more subtle aspect from the financial picture above is Taiwan Semi's expanding profitability profile. Given its near-70% market share, TSMC is able to command enormous pricing power relative to competitors like Intel or Samsung .\nAgainst this backdrop, Taiwan Semi's gross margin is widening -- with excess cash flowing straight to the bottom line. The company is making the most of this new wave of capital by expanding its geographic footprint -- building additional foundries in Arizona, Germany, and Japan.\n\nIs Taiwan Semi stock a good buy right now? At the moment, TSMC boasts a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28.4 -- hovering near its highest level during the AI revolution. If you were to base your investment decision purely off of this metric, you may think Taiwan Semi is overvalued.\nSmart investors understand that TSMC's premium valuation could be warranted, though. McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion market through 2030 -- with the majority of spend allocated toward refining AI workloads.\nIn essence, building out AI-equipped data centers is expected to accelerate throughout the rest of the decade as training and inferencing models becomes more sophisticated and demanding. This is great news for TSMC as it paves the way for long-run visibility across the business.\n\nThe AI infrastructure chapter is still in its early innings. Over the course of the next several years, Taiwan Semi is positioned to benefit from the secular tailwind of rising investment in infrastructure both domestically and abroad.\nTaking this one step further, physical applications such as autonomous systems and robotics are yet to be deployed in a commercial sense. Looking beyond into the 2030s, these use cases are expected to drive additional trillions in economic value.\nShould they achieve some form of adoption and set the stage for the next wave of AI, Taiwan Semi has the potential to benefit immensely beyond where AI stands today -- building large language models (LLMs) and other software-based applications.\nWhen you consider the bigger picture and begin to think longer-term, TSMC's growth potential relative to its valuation looks compelling. So while the stock may not appear dirt cheap at first glance, I think there is ample room for meaningful valuation expansion over the course of the next decade -- making the stock a no-brainer buy right now in my eyes.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "These 4 Billionaires All Have 1 Genius AI Stock in Common, and It's Set to Skyrocket in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor is a broader way to play the AI buildout trend.\nData center capital expenditures are expected to rise through at least 2030.\nChip designers have one thing in common: they all turn to Taiwan Semiconductor.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nLooking at what stocks billionaire hedge fund managers own can be a smart investment strategy. While blindly following their trades isn't a smart move because of information delay, seeing what stocks they all have in common may reveal some great insights to investors.\n\nThe reason for the information delay is due to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements. Any money manager with more than $100 million in assets must report end-of-quarter holdings to the SEC. Then, that information is made available to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . So, if you see that your favorite fund manager bought a position in a hot AI stock, they may have done it months ago.\nThe key is to find fund managers who don't make massive trades every quarter on a single position. Instead, they add or trim as necessary to manage their risk. One stock that popped up in multiple funds I follow is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , also known as TSMC. It's a huge holding in many portfolios, and I think it's set to skyrocket in 2026 as artificial intelligence demand ramps up.\nTaiwan Semiconductor plays a key role in the AI realm The four billionaires who all own shares of Taiwan Semiconductor are:\nChase Coleman at Tiger Global Management (4% of portfolio)\nSteve Mandel at Lone Pine Capital (6.2% of portfolio)\nDavid Tepper at Appaloosa Management (4% of portfolio)\nDaniel Loeb at Third Point (3.7% of portfolio)\nClearly, these four billionaires are very bullish on Taiwan Semiconductor's prospects, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out why.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine whose computing units are the best at any given time. For most of the AI arms race, Nvidia and its leading graphics processing units (GPUs) have dominated this conversation. However, rising competition from Advanced Micro Devices and custom AI accelerators from Broadcom has made this analysis more difficult.\nBut all three of these companies have one thing in common: They get most of their chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. This places TSMC in the ultimate neutral position, as it is supplying chips to competitors. So, as long as there are massive data center buildouts ongoing to develop generative AI technologies, Taiwan Semiconductor will be in an excellent position.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia informed investors that it expects global data center capital expenditures to total $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030 -- a huge expansion from 2025's $600 billion. That's total capital expenditures, which is far broader than just computing. AMD offered a similar projection, estimating that computing will be a $1 trillion market opportunity by 2030.\n\nThis bodes well for one of the key providers of chips in the world, making it no surprise that these four billionaires own shares.\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a buy now? As mentioned above, the information we have on the ownership of Taiwan Semiconductor among the four billionaires is old information. All we know is that they owned shares on Sept. 30. Since then, TSMC's stock has basically been flat, up around 3%. This likely means they still own the shares, as there haven't been any huge drops.\nFurthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is reasonably valued heading into 2026.\nAt 23 times 2026 earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor isn't all that expensive compared to its peers. Factor in its critical position and monster growth that's expected to persist for several years after 2026, and Taiwan Semiconductor looks like one of the best buys in the market.\nI think investors should follow these four billionaires' lead and take a hefty position in Taiwan Semiconductor. It's a critical company, and with massive spending expected to occur over the next five years, it's well-positioned to be a huge winner and could skyrocket in 2026 as a result.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

While you may not have $50,000 sitting around, any sum of money is a great amount to get started with, especially if you have access to fractional shares in your brokerage account.\nI think these three stocks make for excellent starting positions and are slated to provide market-beating returns in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor It's no secret that AI companies are dumping billions of dollars into artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. This isn't expected to slow anytime soon, and there are few better stocks to capitalize on this enormous buildout than Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) . Taiwan Semiconductor provides most chips to various computing providers, making it a great way to invest in the trend without having to determine who the ultimate winner will be.\n\nIt's also developing some innovative technology. Its 2nm (nanometer) chips are entering production right now, and consume 25% to 30% less power than the previous 3nm generation when configured to run at the same speed. Since energy availability is becoming a key concern in the AI buildout, this innovation is a welcome one.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a top way to play the AI buildout, as data center construction is expected to accelerate in 2026 and beyond.\nAlphabet At the start of the year, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was an unpopular stock pick. There were questions surrounding the dominance of the Google Search engine, it was behind in generative AI technology, and was facing a court case that threatened to break up the company if it went the wrong way. All three of these questions were answered in 2025, and all of them were positive.\n\nThis allowed Alphabet to become one of the most successful investments of 2025, as its stock has risen more than 60% so far this year. So, if Alphabet did so well in 2025, why is it a great stock for 2026?\nAfter all of the questions surrounding Alphabet's stock disappeared, the market is free to value Alphabet's stock like the dominant business it is. Advertising revenue was strong in Q3, with its base Google Search engine revenue rising 15% year over year in Q3. Its cloud computing business is also thriving, with revenue rising 34% year over year.\nThis allows Alphabet to focus on being a winner in the AI revolution, and its latest Gemini model is one step closer to that reality. Alphabet is going to be a successful company in 2026, and its recent track record tells me that it's a great stock to own.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is on the opposite end of the performance spectrum. While Alphabet has soared, Amazon's stock has lagged behind the market, rising about 6%. However, a poor 2025 is setting the stage for a big comeback in 2026. Amazon's business is doing incredibly well, with revenue rising 13% in Q3.\n\nThe biggest sign of Amazon's potential is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division, accelerating its growth for the first time in years during Q3. AWS has much higher margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business, and accounts for 66% of operating profit while contributing just 18% of revenue. So, if AWS' growth is accelerating, it's a great sign for Amazon.\nAnother positive sign is Amazon's valuation. Part of the reason Amazon's stock didn't perform well in 2025 is that it was growing into the high valuation it held at the start of the year. It is now trading at a reasonable level (when valued using operating profits), and I think now is a great time to invest in Amazon's stock.\nAmazon is due for a comeback in 2026, and I think it's one of the best investments you can make now.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "5 Incredible Growth Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 1:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SOFI\n\nMELI\n\nLMND\n\nTSM\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points SoFi, MercadoLibre, and Lemonade are disrupting traditional financial services with technology.\nOn is developing its brand globally and gaining a loyal following.\nTaiwan Semiconductor has huge tailwinds in AI development.\n10 stocks we like better than SoFi Technologies ›\nAs the year comes to a close, it's been another double-digit gain for the S&P 500 , which is up almost 18% in 2025. The index is up about 80% during the past three years alone, demonstrating why investing in the S&P 500 is such a compelling thesis.\n\nHowever, you can bring it up a notch by investing in top growth stocks in 2026. There's no way to know whether the market can keep climbing this year and next, but over time, it grows much more often than it contracts. SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) , MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) , On Holding (NYSE: ONON) , Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) , and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) can supercharge your portfolio this year, but more importantly, they all have incredible long-term opportunities.\n1. SoFi: Disruptive banking SoFi is a digital bank that's attracting new customers at a fast pace. Not only is it growing quickly, but revenue growth accelerated in the 2025 third quarter to 38% year over year. That's a phenomenal rate for any company, especially a bank, which is typically slow-growing as an industry.\nIt's a classic fintech company , combining traditional financial services with technology. These are the kinds of services that used to take up a lot of time and visits to bank branches that are now doable with the swipe of a finger. SoFi's niche is its simple-to-use app that's a game changer, and it's one-stop shop approach that makes total financial management available in one place.\n\nSoFi stock is up 79% this year (as of Dec. 26), and it could soar higher in 2026 and beyond.\n2. MercadoLibre: Tech powerhouse MercadoLibre is the leading e-commerce company in Latin America, holding its own against direct competition from Amazon and other global names. Its region is notably underpenetrated, giving it a long runway as it changes the retail narrative. It has also launched complementary fintech services that serve to create a diversified ecosystem of products. That gives it a dominant position and an edge in a growing market.\n\nIt's still in high-growth mode, with a 49% year-over-year sales increase (currency neutral) in the third quarter. It's balancing investments in its future with staying comfortably profitable, and it's constantly rolling out new features to attract customers and simplify the buying process. It has a huge growth runway for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory Continues\n3. On: The new name in premium activewear On is a fast-growing activewear brand that's gaining a loyal following. It sells premium products and competes with companies like Nike and Lululemon Athletica , and it's growing much faster than either of them. Its premium pricing leads to high gross margins, and its affluent consumer base is more resilient when under economic pressure.\n\nThe brand is still working its way around the world, developing brand awareness, and it's fairly small as compared with its peers. That gives it more room to expand as it builds its business, and it could skyrocket in 2026 and much longer.\n4. Lemonade: Insurance technology Lemonade is a disruptive insurance powerhouse, offering digital services and using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to offer a better product. It has been attracting customers at a rapid pace since launching, but its algorithms are finally working well enough to move toward profitability. From here, management envisions the model becoming extremely efficient and profitable as the company continues to increase revenue.\n\nAfter years of investor disappointment, Lemonade stock is up nearly 450% during the past three years. However, it's expecting to become profitable on an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) basis in 2026, and it could climb even higher.\n5. Taiwan Semiconductor: Underpinning AI development Nvidia and hyperscalers like Amazon and Alphabet may get the most attention for their developments in AI, but Taiwan Semiconductor plays a key role in making it happen. It manufactures the chips that are used for AI production, and it's the largest company of its kind. Since it makes chips for all kinds of applications, it's not limited by whatever the trend of the day is, and it can drive tech development in any area, giving it continued growth opportunities.\n\nHowever, for the sake of a 2026 discussion, it has potent tailwinds as hyperscalers increase AI spend and demand picks up for chips from many of its clients.

      "Content": "4 Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:33 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MELI\n\nMSFT\n\nTSM\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points MercadoLibre is a leader in e-commerce and fintech.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are making waves with their respective AI innovations.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the top chip manufacturer in the world.\n10 stocks we like better than MercadoLibre ›\nInvesting for the long term requires a disciplined and resilient mindset to navigate the inherent volatility of the stock market. Managing the psychology behind your investment decisions is as crucial as selecting the right investments.\n\nThe market price of a stock is often driven by short-term emotions and news, while its true value is tied to the underlying company's long-term earning power and assets. A strong mindset allows you to view temporary price drops as potential buying opportunities for quality assets, not reasons to panic.\nLikewise, if you're focused on the long-term picture, you can select quality businesses with robust fundamentals that make sense as part of your portfolio without being swayed by short-term market volatility. If you have cash to invest in the stock market right now, here are four stocks to consider buying and holding for at least five years.\n1. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is the clear e-commerce leader across over a dozen countries in Latin America, including major markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. It has a significant competitive advantage over global players like Amazon due to its established presence, brand recognition, and deep understanding of local market needs.\n\nThe company operates a vast tech ecosystem, including its e-commerce marketplace connecting buyers and sellers, which is powered by its integrated fintech arm Mercado Pago, its robust logistics business Mercado Envíos, and advertising services. It's worth noting that Mercado Pago has grown into a full digital financial services platform (e.g., payments, credit, savings, investments) that serves the region's large unbanked population and has created a sticky user base with high monetization potential.\nThe company is consistently profitable and boasts impressive growth metrics. In Q3 2025, it reported a 39% year-over-year revenue increase. Total net revenue reached $7.4 billion. Total payment volume reached $71 billion, up 41% year over year, and gross merchandise volume rose to $16.5 billion, a 28% year-over-year spike.\n\nRobust e-commerce performance in core markets like Brazil and Mexico bolstered MercadoLibre's quarterly performance. And, the number of successful items sold grew by 39% year over year to 635 million. If you want to invest in an e-commerce and fintech giant operating outside the U.S., MercadoLibre is a profitable and compelling leader to consider.\n\nStory continues\n2. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) managed to effectively monetize generative AI faster than most peers by integrating it across its entire tech stack. AI services accounted for roughly 15 percentage points of the total Azure revenue growth in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026. Over 70% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot, which has created a high-margin recurring revenue stream.\n\nThe company is investing heavily in AI capacity, and its capital expenditures have exceeded $30 billion per quarter to meet surging demand. Azure remains a primary catalyst for the business's long-term value and consistently delivers high growth even on a massive revenue base. For the full fiscal year 2025, Microsoft's annual revenue surpassed $281 billion, growing by 15% from the prior year. Azure revenue was more than $75 billion, a 34% increase year over year. Azure holds approximately 20% of the global cloud market.\nMicrosoft maintains one of the strongest balance sheets in the corporate world, which supports its consistent returns to investors. It's one of only two U.S. companies with a perfect AAA credit rating (that's higher than the U.S. government). The company generated over $100 billion in net income in fiscal 2025, so it continues to have massive flexibility for R&D and acquisitions.\n\nMicrosoft has raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years and regularly repurchases billions in stock (it returned almost $11 billion to shareholders in the most recent quarter alone through dividends and share repurchases). Management and analysts have set ambitious targets for the next five years. CEO Satya Nadella aims to exceed $500 billion in annual revenue by 2030, nearly double its current scale.\n3. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is deeply integrating powerful AI models like Gemini across its massive ecosystem (e.g, Search, YouTube, Cloud). AI improves its search relevance, makes YouTube more engaging, and personalizes user experiences, which in turn can drive better engagement and more ad dollars. Instead of cannibalizing search, Alphabet's new tools like AI summaries are increasing ad impressions and conversions, and expanding its commercial pathways in search.\n\nAlphabet is also leveraging its custom TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) semiconductor chips to compete in cloud infrastructure. While historically the company had reserved most TPUs for in-house use and cloud services, it has recently begun selling some directly to third parties in specific bilateral deals. These include major AI clients like Anthropic as Alphabet creates a new high-margin revenue stream.\nAlphabet's TPUs are revolutionary, particularly because they are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) purpose-built for the core mathematical operations of deep learning applications. This specialized design provides significant advantages in performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness at scale compared to the more general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). Revenue from TPUs is a key driver of the overall Google Cloud segment's growth, which generated robust Q3 2025 revenue of $15.2 billion, a 34% year-over-year increase.\n\nAnalysts from firms like Morgan Stanley project that expanded external sales could add billions in new revenue to Alphabet's top line in the coming years (an estimated $13 billion for every 500,000 units sold by 2027). AI could also unlock opportunities in robotics (Waymo), healthcare, and enterprise solutions outside of Alphabet's traditional advertising and cloud businesses. Alphabet's strong balance sheet with substantial cash and low debt, and a generous history of providing enviable returns to shareholders, are icing on the cake for long-term investors in this storied business.\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) or TSMC is the undisputed leader in semiconductor manufacturing and controls roughly 70% of the global foundry market. Unlike investing in a single chip designer, holding TSMC can allow investors to profit regardless of who wins the AI race. And the reality is that there will likely be many winners as the AI revolution heats up.\n\nThe demand for AI computing power is soaring, and only a few companies possess the capabilities to design the required chips. All major AI players -- including Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom -- rely on TSMC to build their most advanced chips. The company produces at least 90% of the world's most advanced chips, which has created a massive technological moat that competitors like Intel and Samsung are currently struggling to bridge.\nManagement expects AI-related revenue to grow at a more than 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. TSMC had a very strong Q3 2025 financially and beat expectations with both record profits and revenue. Substantial and growing demand for AI chips and high-performance computing (HPC) drove revenue up over 30% year over year. Net income surged 40% year over year, and TSMC's gross margin improved to 59.5%.\n\nTSMC is aggressively expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of Taiwan. The company has committed $165 billion to build six advanced fabs in Arizona, with the first already being in volume production. Additional major investments are underway in Japan and Germany, and management aims to have 30% of its most advanced capacity located outside Taiwan by 2028. Shares are up about 40% year to date, and it may be wise to scoop some up before the business soars higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?

      "Content": "If I Could Only Buy and Hold a Single Stock, This Would Be It.\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 12:50 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor is a key part of the AI buildout.\nNew chip technology is launching in 2026.\nThe stock isn't that expensive for its vital position.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nSelecting a single stock to buy and hold isn't an easy task. It's also a terrible investing strategy. However, I think it's a good exercise for investors to go through to understand what they are most confident in, then position their portfolios accordingly.\nFor me, the best stock to buy and hold is one that is set up to win in the current market environment, with little worry of disruption. I think that Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) fits the bill, and I've got a few reasons why that's the case.\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor will be the ultimate winner of the AI buildout Companies are spending billions of dollars on artificial intelligence infrastructure, and are tripping over themselves to build data centers . They seemingly cannot get the computing power online fast enough to meet demand. There is also a bottleneck in computing, but while Nvidia 's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been the most widely used computing hardware, that dominance is coming into question.\n\nI believe Taiwan Semiconductor will be the ultimate winner in AI, as it provides chips for most computing units. While it has some competition, Taiwan Semiconductor has the best technology and the most production capacity, giving it an edge over some of its peers.\nBeing a neutral party in the AI race will pay off for Taiwan Semiconductor, as it's expected to continue growing as long as data center capital expenditures continue rising.\n2. Data center capital expenditures are expected to continue growing Many investors have balked at some of Nvidia's long-term projections, but most of those projections have come true. Its latest guidance is even more extreme, but Nvidia has more knowledge about the situation than many individual investors do. It projects that global data center capital expenditures will rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. That's huge growth from the $600 billion expected in 2025, and Taiwan Semiconductor will be a key provider of the chips used to realize this growth.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor's new technology addresses key concerns Taiwan Semiconductor is known for consistently introducing new chip technology, and 2026 will be no exception. Its latest chip generation, 2 nanometers (nm), is currently entering production and features some incredible improvements that clients have been clamoring for.\n\nStory Continues\nThe AI buildout may be slowed by the limited availability of energy. There are a few ways to alleviate this problem, and one of them is to make more energy-efficient hardware. Taiwan Semiconductor has accepted this challenge, and its new 2nm chips consume 25% to 30% less power than previous generation 3nm chips when configured to run at the same speed. These chips will be crucial in securing the next wave of AI growth, and with even more energy-efficient chips in development, Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to provide the advancements AI hyperscalers need to complete their build-out.\n\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor's stock doesn't carry a large premium Many of the AI hyperscalers trade for an expensive price tag, but Taiwan Semiconductor is an exception.\nAt 23 times 2026 earnings, it's not priced at that high a premium compared to some of its peers. It's also expected to continue its rapid growth beyond 2026, so the price you pay now is well worth it.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key part of the AI buildout, and its chips power many of the devices used to create generative AI today. Its competition is far enough behind that Taiwan Semiconductor doesn't need to worry about losing its leadership role as long as it continues to innovate. It's my top stock to buy and hold now, and I'm confident in its ability to crush the market in 2026.\n\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "One Avantis ETF Beat Vanguard’s Biggest Funds in 2025 and Could Keep Running in 2026\n\nMichael Williams\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 7:08 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: VOO\n\nIEMG\n\nAVEM\n\nVTI\n\nTSM\n\nQuick Read AVEM returned 35% in 2025 and beat VOO and VTI by roughly 17 percentage points.\nThe fund holds $15.1B in assets with 6.35% in Taiwan Semiconductor.\nDollar weakness drove 2025 outperformance. A 9% dollar decline boosted emerging market returns.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF ( NYSEARCA:AVEM ) delivered a 35% return in 2025, outperforming Vanguard's largest funds and signaling emerging markets might finally be having their moment. With $15.1 billion in assets and concentrated bets on Asian technology and financials, the fund beat both Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ( NYSEARCA:VOO ) and Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF ( NYSEARCA:VTI ) by roughly 17 percentage points. The question is whether 2026 brings more gains or if the rally has run its course.\nThis infographic details the Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (AVEM), outlining its operational framework, ideal investor use cases, and a comprehensive list of its pros and cons for the 2025-2026 period.\nThe Big Picture: Dollar Weakness and China's Stabilization The most important macro factor for AVEM in 2026 is dollar strength. When the dollar weakens, as it did through much of 2025 with a 9% decline, emerging market assets become more attractive. Dollar-denominated debt gets cheaper to service, capital flows back into developing economies, and local currency returns improve for U.S. investors.\n\nWatch the dollar index weekly. If it breaks above recent highs and stays there, AVEM's momentum could stall regardless of individual company performance. Continued dollar weakness provides tailwinds. The Federal Reserve's rate decisions matter, but so do trade policy shifts and global growth expectations. Monitor monthly Federal Reserve policy statements and quarterly GDP reports from major emerging economies, particularly China and India.\nChina's economic trajectory is the second critical variable. With heavy exposure to Chinese tech giants like Tencent and Alibaba, plus significant positions in Chinese banks, AVEM rises and falls with Beijing's policy decisions. The government's recent pivot toward supporting the private sector and stimulus measures helped fuel 2025's gains. If that support continues or accelerates in 2026, AVEM benefits. If Beijing tightens or geopolitical tensions escalate, the fund faces headwinds.\n\nWhat's Under the Hood: Semiconductors and the Taiwan Risk AVEM's largest holding is Taiwan Semiconductor ( NYSE:TSM ) at 6.35% of the portfolio. Add Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and MediaTek, and semiconductor exposure dominates returns. This concentration delivered spectacular results in 2025 as AI chip demand surged, but creates vulnerability. If the semiconductor cycle turns or supply chain disruptions emerge, AVEM will feel it immediately.\n\nStory Continues\nThe more subtle risk is geographic. Taiwan represents a significant portion of holdings, creating geopolitical exposure that doesn't exist in broad U.S. market funds. Watch for any escalation in cross-strait tensions or changes in U.S.-China tech policy that could impact semiconductor companies. TSM's Arizona expansion reduces some risk over time, but the concentration remains meaningful.\n\nCheck the fund's monthly holdings file on the Avantis website to track any shifts in semiconductor weighting. The fund employs active management within its systematic framework, so position sizes can change based on valuations and market conditions.\nConsider IEMG for Simpler, Cheaper Exposure The iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF ( NYSEARCA:IEMG ) offers a straightforward alternative. With $117 billion in assets versus AVEM's $15.1 billion, IEMG provides significantly deeper liquidity. Its 0.09% expense ratio undercuts AVEM's 0.33% fee by a wide margin, and its pure index approach eliminates the active management overlay that Avantis employs.\n\nAVEM tilts toward smaller companies and undervalued stocks, while IEMG tracks the broader market-cap weighted index. In 2025, AVEM's approach paid off. Whether that continues depends on whether value and size factors keep working in emerging markets or if the largest companies reassert dominance.\nFor 2026, the key question is whether dollar weakness persists and whether AVEM's semiconductor-heavy positioning continues to capture AI-driven growth or becomes a source of volatility.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has a Third of His Portfolio in These 6 Incredible AI Stocks Poised to Dominate in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Laffont is a huge believer in the artificial intelligence (AI) investment trend.\nNvidia and TSMC are slated to thrive due to increased data center spending in 2026.\nThe AI hyperscalers all have strong core businesses to fund their AI buildouts.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nChecking up on what billionaire hedge fund managers have in their portfolios can be a smart idea for investors. This information is publicly released 45 days after a quarter ends through a Form 13F . While this doesn't give up-to-date information on what these hedge fund managers are doing, it at least informs investors on some potential solid stock picks.\n\nOne billionaire I follow is Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management. He has had some incredible success, and after examining some of his top portfolio holdings, it's clear he's bullish on artificial intelligence (AI). About a third of his portfolio is invested in six monster AI stocks, and I think each of these should be owned by individual investors in 2026.\nAll six stocks look primed to excel in 2026 The six AI-focused holdings Coatue Management has are:\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) (7.3% of portfolio)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) (5.9% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manucturing (NYSE: TSM) (5.5% of portfolio)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) (4.7% of portfolio)\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) (4.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (4.3% of portfolio)\n\nAltogether, that adds up to 32.2%, or about a third of total portfolio assets. However, he also has exposure to other AI investments in his portfolio; these are just some of the largest ones. It's clear that this billionaire believes that these six will do well in 2026, and I think he's right on track.\nThe AI buildout is far from over Infrastructure players like Nvidia are set to do well in 2026. The demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) is insatiable, as the AI hyperscalers are looking to get as much computing power online as fast as possible. Nvidia told investors during its Q3 earnings release that it is \"sold out\" of cloud GPUs because demand is so high. This bodes well for anyone in this industry, including Taiwan Semiconductor, which is a major chip supplier to Nvidia.\n\nAI buildouts are expected to persist for many years. Nvidia expects global 2025 data center capital expenditures to reach $600 billion. However, that figure is expected to rise to $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030.\nIf that pans out, businesses like Taiwan Semiconductor and Nvidia make for incredible purchases right now. Combine that with the fact that each of these stocks is down a bit from its all-time high, and each seems like a smart purchase.\n\nStory Continues\nMoving to the AI hyperscalers, companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are all spending a ton of money on AI computing capacity. While investors may be getting a bit fed up with these expensive capital expenditures, all four believe that this investment is necessary to stay relevant in the future.\n\nOf these four, Meta may be the most intriguing. Meta's stock fell hard after Q3 earnings. While its growth and profitability were great, investors took issue with management's spending plans for 2026. As a result, the stock plummeted, and it's now the cheapest of these six when valued using next year's earnings.\nAt 21.8 times next year's earnings, Meta is priced about the same level as the S&P 500 index. With Meta expected to deliver market-beating growth, it seems like a no-brainer investment.\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft all operate leading cloud computing platforms. These will be long-term winners, as clients continue to need more and more computing capacity as generative AI workloads become more common. Furthermore, each of these companies also has its own generative AI model or has deep partnerships with one of the major players. This places them in a great position to succeed not only in 2026, but also in the years after.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont has positioned his portfolio wisely to take advantage of the massive AI buildout. I think investors should do the same, and these six are a great place to start.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

(NYSE: TSM) have nearly tripled in value over the past five years, turning a $1,000 investment into $2,800 at the time of writing. The growing demand for data center infrastructure presents a significant opportunity for TSMC, as high-performance computing chips currently account for the majority of its revenue.\nDespite the stock's strong run over the past few years, its valuation still allows for substantial upside over the next five years.\nGrowth at a reasonable price Analysts expect the company's earnings per share to grow at a 22% annualized rate over the next few years. The stock's valuation reflects the company's recent momentum, with the shares trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30. However, this valuation does not fully account for future earnings growth, as the P/E multiple drops to 23 on 2026 earnings estimates.\n\nTSMC's third-quarter earnings per share jumped 39% year over year, reflecting its competitive moat in making the most powerful chips for other semiconductor companies. Management expects revenue from artificial intelligence (AI) chips to grow at a compound annual rate of over 40% through 2029.\nThis is a business with a long history of delivering above-average returns for shareholders. This is why it is a bullish sign that management is investing to expand its global manufacturing footprint, supporting demand. CEO C.C. Wei described the demand for AI chips as \"insane\" last quarter, which may also signal that investors are still underestimating the growth opportunity ahead.\nWith robust earnings growth and investments in expanding manufacturing capacity, Taiwan Semiconductor stock remains an excellent buy for investors seeking to outperform the market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: ASML vs. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nWill Healy, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nKey Points ASML's equipment is essential to producing the world's most advanced semiconductors.\nTSMC has effectively leveraged ASML's equipment to produce the world's most advanced chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nASML (NASDAQ: ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) (NYSE: TSM) are arguably the two most essential artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the hardware space. TSMC is well known for being the foundry of choice for Nvidia , Apple , and other top semiconductor companies.\n\nHowever, TSMC's success is not possible without ASML. It uses the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines built by ASML to manufacture the world's most advanced chips.\nThis creates a harder job for investors trying to discern which stock is more likely to make the highest long-term gains. Although both companies are critical to this process, investors need to take a closer look to see which is the more suitable stock for them to own.\nThe case for ASML Investors should remember one thing about ASML. Despite ASML's importance, only a tiny client base is interested in its EUV machines, which can cost as much as $400 million each. Worse, political concerns bar what equipment it can sell to countries like China, further adding to that limitation.\nNonetheless, companies such as Samsung and Intel are among the companies buying EUV machines. Additionally, ASML operates in the deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) market. Although the market has more competitors, it also allows it to earn business from foundry companies that produce other types of chips.\n\nFurthermore, such costly equipment needs periodic maintenance. With that, the Netherlands-based company runs a thriving maintenance business that accounts for more than one-third of ASML's revenue.\nAmid the growth in AI, its machines are more in demand, so much so that ASML earned almost 23 billion euros ($27 billion) in revenue in the first nine months of 2025, a yearly increase of 21%.\nAlso, ASML limited expense growth, leading to a net income of 6.8 billion euros ($7.9 billion), a 39% rise from year-ago levels. With the rising profits, the stock is up by almost 50% over the last year.\nInvestors should also note the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. While that is above the S&P 500\naverage of 31, it closely approximates the company's average over the last five years. Considering the demand in AI, such a valuation is unlikely to deter investors from bidding the stock price higher over time.\n\nWhy investors might consider TSMC However, with a larger client base, investors might find TSMC stock more appealing. They might also like its dominance.\n\nStory Continues\nAs mentioned, TSMC makes the world's most advanced chips. While companies like Samsung and Intel have attempted to compete, TSMC's dominant market share continues to grow. As of the second quarter of 2025, that market share reached 70%, giving the company a tremendous competitive advantage.\nThis arguably makes TSMC's biggest threat operating in Taiwan, an island that has dealt with periodic threats of an invasion by China. Since Chinese companies also depend on its chips, the threat could be overblown. Still, it was concerning enough that Warren Buffett reversed a decision by his lieutenants to invest Berkshire Hathaway 's capital in the company.\n\nThat threat has not stopped TSMC's growth. The $87 billion in revenue TSMC earned in the first nine months of 2025 rose 36% compared to the same period last year.\nAlso, like with ASML, expenses grew more slowly than revenue. Still, with other comprehensive losses weighing on the bottom line, its comprehensive income of $35 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 increased by 30% year over year. If not including those losses, net income would have grown by 52%.\nAmid the rising demand and income, TSMC stock is up by almost 50% over the last year. Also, with a 30 P/E ratio, it is cheaper than ASML and trades at a valuation that closely matches the S&P 500 average.\nStill, TSMC has tended to trade at a discount, and for that reason, it is above its average earnings multiple of 25 over the last five years. That makes it unclear whether TSMC is a better bargain, or whether investors feel the geopolitical concerns justify the discounted multiples of the past.\n\nASML or TSMC? Considering these similarities, investors will likely win by choosing either or both stocks. However, choosing between the two probably comes down to risk tolerances.\nTSMC offers similar revenue and stock price growth at a lower valuation. Hence, if one is comfortable with the geopolitical risk, it might make sense to lean more toward TSMC.\n\nConversely, if one feels as Buffett does about the geopolitical concerns, ASML is probably the more suitable choice, as most of its manufacturing takes place far away from geopolitical hotbeds.\nUltimately, investors have the choice between two critical AI hardware stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market. Thus, this is one case where they should assess their risk tolerances and act accordingly.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

One thing all those items have in common is that they rely on semiconductors (chips) to function properly.\nIf you dig deeper into what those chips have in common, they were likely manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC). TSMC is by far the world's leading chip manufacturer, and that's the reason why I'm loading up on the stock to hold forever.\nMuch of the physical tech world begins with TSMC TSMC operates on the foundry model. Instead of manufacturing chips for general sale, it manufactures chips on order to meet the specific needs of other companies.\nFor example, Apple would design the chips it needs for its latest iPhone, Nvidia designs the chips for its GPUs , and Amazon will design chips for its cloud servers. In all those situations, TSMC is often the company that brings these blueprints to physical life.\n\nManufacturing chips with the precision, reliability, and consistency of TSMC isn't easy for even the most tech-forward companies in the world. It requires tens of billions of dollars in investment, tons of specialized engineers, and world-class plants, which is why companies would rather rely on TSMC to do it than make the investments to build their own (less effective) plants or spend on the engineering talent.\nA monopoly on AI chips When it comes to manufacturing chips for items like smartphones or computers, TSMC holds a commanding market share. However, when it comes to manufacturing artificial intelligence (AI) chips, TSMC is essentially the only game in town. Its market share is well into the upper-90% range.\nAs tech companies (especially hyperscalers) commit to spending more on building out their AI infrastructure, TSMC will be a natural beneficiary. It won't supply the systems that fills data centers, but it will undoubtedly supply the chips those machines we built around.\nThis reliance on TSMC has boded well for its finances in recent years, too. Its high-performance computing (HPC) segment, which includes its AI chips, accounted for 57% of its $33.1 billion in revenue in the third quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nMaybe more noteworthy, though, is how TSMC's leadership position has given it pricing power that has strengthened its margins. In the third quarter, its gross margins increased from 57.8% to 59.5%, and its operating margins increased from 47.5% to 50.6%.\nRegardless of how beneficial AI chips have been to TSMC's business over the past couple of years, the company is far from dependent on them; they're just a massive plus.\nTSMC has a strongstrong foothold inmanufacturing for virtually all major tech companies, which makes it a stock I'm comfortable holding for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

Once viewed as a failing chipmaker losing ground to competitors like Broadcom ( NASDAQ: AVGO ), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( NYSE: TSM ), and Nvidia ( NASDAQ: NVDA ), Intel faced speculation that rivals were circling its foundry business and other assets.\nBy the middle of the year, however, Intel regained momentum through significant backing from the Trump administration, which converted CHIPS Act grants into an equity stake worth approximately $8.9 billion, or 10% of the company, making the U.S. government its largest shareholder. This was followed by a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, giving it roughly a 4% stake, as well as partnerships aimed at joint product development in data centers and PCs.\n\nThese moves indicated renewed confidence, positioning Intel as a key player in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing once again. Yet, a Reuters report today suggests a big potential setback, raising questions about whether Intel's revival is beginning to falter.\nA Promising Rebound Built on Execution Intel's recent progress has been notable, driven by strategic investments and a focus on revitalizing its core businesses. The Trump administration's equity stake provided essential capital and aligned Intel with national priorities for domestic chip production.\nWeeks later, Nvidia's $5 billion commitment further supported Intel's turnaround, with the two firms agreeing to collaborate on custom x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms and integrated system-on-chips for PCs. An Intel spokesperson emphasized that 18A technologies are \"progressing well.\"\n\nDespite these positive developments, the rebound has always hinged on Intel's ability to execute, particularly in its foundry business. The 18A process node has been central to its plans for regaining manufacturing leadership, as it is intended to enable high-volume production of advanced chips and attract customers.\nNvidia's Decision Raises Questions About 18A According to the Reuters article, Nvidia recently evaluated whether to manufacture its next-generation chips using Intel's 18A process but halted the testing and stopped moving forward. Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed this to Reuters, though Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nStory Continues\nThis development comes despite Nvidia's earlier investment and ongoing product collaborations, which explicitly did not include commitments to use Intel's foundry. Intel has previously noted strong interest in 18A, and the company continues to highlight progress on the node, with products like Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest ramping up toward production.\n\nThe reasons for Nvidia's decision remain unclear, but earlier reports indicated both Nvidia and Broadcom conducted tests on 18A. While testing is a standard step, not all evaluations lead to production commitments.\nIf technical or yield issues contributed to the halt, it could signal challenges for Intel in convincing major designers to shift volume from established leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor. Intel's foundry has faced scrutiny over quality and scalability before, though the company maintains that 18A is on track and sees interest shifting to the subsequent 14A node for even more advanced applications.\nBroader Implications for Intel's Foundry Strategy Winning high-profile customers has been a key goal for Intel Foundry, which has invested heavily to compete as a contract manufacturer. Deals with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) for custom chips on 18A have been announced, and Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) might go with Intel for its entry-level M-series chips in 2027, but volumes from such clients are relatively small compared to demands from AI leaders like Nvidia.\n\nNvidia halting the testing -- while not a definitive rejection -- underscores the high bar set for advanced nodes. Competitors continue to dominate high-end production, and Intel must demonstrate reliable yields and performance to secure larger commitments.\nKey Takeaway Investors should not read too much into Nvidia's decision to pause 18A testing at this stage, as qualification processes are lengthy and multifaceted. However, greater caution is warranted moving forward.\nMuch of Intel's turnaround depends on the success of the 18A process in delivering competitive manufacturing capabilities. If the node falls short of expectations in attracting major business from customers, it could complicate the company's path to foundry profitability and an overall recovery.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nLeo Sun, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:51 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nASML\n\nKey Points Nvidia’s chips are still the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush.\nTSMC manufactures Nvidia’s chips with its best-in-breed foundries.\nASML’s lithography systems enable TSMC to produce those chips.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe artificial intelligence ( AI ) market has expanded rapidly over the past decade as more powerful chips and generative AI platforms have entered the market. Those AI services became practical tools that could quickly crunch, analyze, and predict trends for businesses and mainstream users.\n\nThe AI market could grow at a CAGR of 30.6% from 2026 to 2033, according to Grand View Research, as more organizations use AI to automate, accelerate, and optimize their operations. To capitalize on this expansion, investors should consider buying and holding these three top tech stocks for the next decade and beyond: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , TSMC (NYSE: TSM) , and ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) .\nNvidia Nvidia is the world's top producer of discrete GPUs for data centers, which are used to process complex AI tasks. Most of the top AI companies -- including OpenAI, Meta , and Microsoft -- use its GPUs. It also locks in those clients with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a proprietary programming platform for its own chips.\n\nAs the producer of the best picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, Nvidia still has plenty of room to grow. It might face tougher competition from AMD 's cheaper GPUs, first-party AI chips from some of its top customers, and other types of AI accelerators -- but its first-mover edge, best-in-breed reputation, and sticky ecosystem will fuel its long-term growth. Tighter export curbs could throttle its shipments to China over the next few years, but it can offset that pressure with its growth in the U.S., Europe, and other Asian markets.\nFrom fiscal 2025 (which ended in January) to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings per share ( EPS ) to grow at a CAGR of 46% and 29%, respectively. Even though its stock has already soared nearly 23,000% over the past decade, it still looks reasonably valued at 25 times next year's earnings. Therefore, Nvidia should remain one of the simplest ways to profit from the AI boom over the next decade.\n\nTSMC Nvidia outsources the production of its top-tier GPUs to TSMC, the world's largest and most advanced contract chipmaker. TSMC is the only foundry capable of manufacturing Nvidia's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips.\nTSMC also produces chips for other leading fabless chipmakers like AMD, Apple , and Qualcomm . It manufactures its most advanced chips in Taiwan, which is exposed to potential trade and military conflicts with China; however, it has been mitigating this risk by building more plants in the U.S., Europe, and Japan.\n\nStory Continues\nIn its latest quarter, TSMC generated 57% of its revenue from the high-performance computing (HPC) market, which includes Nvidia's data center GPUs. That segment is driving its near-term growth and reducing its dependence on the cyclical PC, smartphone, and automotive markets.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect TSMC's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 24% and 27%, respectively, as the AI market expands and its more cyclical markets stabilize. Those are strong growth rates for a stock that trades at 19 times next year's earnings, and it will remain a linchpin of the expanding semiconductor sector for the foreseeable future.\n\nASML TSMC couldn't manufacture its chips without the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML. ASML is the world's leading producer of lithography systems, which optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which produce the smallest and most densely packed chips.\n\nASML perfected its EUV technology over the past two decades, and the high costs of producing those massive systems prevented its potential competitors from gaining any ground. Its EUV systems currently cost $200-$400 million, require multiple planes and trucks to ship, and must be reassembled at the foundries by its own teams.\nASML's monopolization of that market makes it another linchpin of the semiconductor sector, and the world's most advanced AI chips couldn't exist without its cutting-edge technology. The export curbs against China (where it's barred from selling its higher-end systems) are throttling its near-term sales, but its growth across other regions should offset that pressure.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 18%, respectively, as it ramps up its shipments of its latest \"high-NA\" EUV systems for manufacturing even smaller and denser chips. Its stock isn't a bargain at 35 times next year's earnings, but its scale, guaranteed long-term growth, and pricing power justify that higher valuation.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?
