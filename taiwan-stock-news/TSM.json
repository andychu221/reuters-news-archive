On December 29, Reuters reported that Nvidia has purchased Intel shares worth $5 billion, carrying out a transaction ‌announced in September.\nThe AI chipmaker had announced back then that it would pay $23.28 per share for Intel ⁠common stock, buying over 214.7 million Intel shares at the price set out in the agreement, as per Monday's filing. The deal forms part of a broader strategic agreement to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers.\nThe share purchase comes just a week after Reuters reported that Nvidia Corp. has halted a test to use Intel’s advanced 18A manufacturing process to make advanced chips. The AI chipmaker tested the so-called 18A process but stopped moving forward, the report said.\nInvestors had been closely watching Intel's advanced 18A as a milestone that could help the company compete more directly with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in advanced chip manufacturing. However, the halt now raises concerns about the company’s ability to regain ground in the foundry race.\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures, and sells computer products and technologies, delivering data storage, computer, networking, and communications platforms.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "The Top Stocks to Buy With $50,000 for 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 11:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor is a key supplier in the AI buildout.\nAmazon's financial success largely depends on the performance of its cloud computing wing.\nAlphabet is emerging as a generative AI leader.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nIf you've got $50,000 that you're looking to invest during 2026, I've got a few stocks that you should consider. Even if you don't have that much to deploy, smaller investments in these three stocks would allow retail investors to benefit from where the market looks to be heading. Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) all have strong chances to outperform in 2026.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of the high-end chips being deployed in the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout. Without its foundry capabilities, we wouldn't have the AI tech that we know today.\nThe investment thesis for Taiwan Semiconductor is fairly simple: Over time, the world will use more chips and more advanced ones. The truth of that premise is fairly obvious if you look at the trends in the tech sector's spending forecasts.\n\nAll of the AI hyperscalers set new records on capital expenditures in 2025, and all of them have said they expect to break those capex records in 2026. This money is being used to purchase land, build data centers, and fill them with the cutting-edge computing hardware required to handle generative AI workloads. Because it is the world's largest third-party foundry operator, Taiwan Semiconductor is manufacturing a major share of the chips going into those data centers, and that hardware isn't cheap.\nEvery time a new data center is constructed, TSMC gets a slice of the spending. With the data center buildout expected to accelerate in 2026 and beyond, Taiwan Semiconductor makes for a strong investment.\nAmazon Amazon is one of those companies constructing data centers for its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the most popular cloud computing option. It's also a major client of Taiwan Semiconductor through some of the chips that it purchases.\nAWS provides 66% of Amazon's total operating profits, so as AWS goes, so goes Amazon.\n\nFortunately for Amazon shareholders, AWS grew revenue at a 20% clip during Q3 -- its fastest rate in several years. With AWS growing rapidly and established as a critical partner for many AI-focused businesses, I think Amazon will be a great stock to invest in during 2026.\nAlphabet Alphabet shares had an incredible 2025, rising by around 65%. That performance isn't likely to be repeated in 2026, as part of it came as the result of the stock starting the year undervalued due to a cluster of concerns.\n\nStory Continues\nNow, it's trading at 30 times forward earnings, a valuation in line with its peers. This means the bulk of Alphabet's stock performance from here will be driven by its business growth, which is trending upward. In Q3, Alphabet reported a strong performance across the board. Revenue rose 16% year over year, and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 35%.\n\nEven Google Search, the most mature part of Alphabet's business, experienced revenue growth of 15%. This indicates how strong the advertising market is, and as long as that market stays healthy, I have no reason to doubt that Alphabet will be a profitable stock pick in 2026.\nFurthermore, Alphabet has emerged as a leader in the AI realm, thanks to its popular large language model, Gemini. If Alphabet can continue to push boundaries and innovate, it will have a unique cost advantage. Alphabet can afford to keep prices on its models low to beat the competition, which may allow it to become the dominant AI model over the long term. We won't have a clear answer about how that will play out anytime soon, but it's a trend to keep an eye on.\n\nThough it won't repeat 2025's performance in 2026, Alphabet still looks like one of the top stocks to buy right now.\nShould you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

The record date for the distribution is January 16, 2026, and the payable date is January 30, 2026. The Fund will trade ex-distribution on January 16, 2026.\n\nAlthough the Fund seeks to pay a distribution at a rate that is representative of net investment income actually earned, a portion of each distribution may be treated as paid from sources other than net investment income, including, to the extent permitted by law, short-term capital gain, long-term capital gain, or return of capital. As required by Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a notice will be distributed to shareholders in the event that a portion of a monthly distribution is derived from sources other than undistributed net investment income. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of these distributions will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during its fiscal year and will be made after the Fund’s year end. The Fund will send to investors a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will define how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Angel Oak does not provide tax advice; shareholders should consult their tax advisor. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with \"yield\" or \"income.\"\n\nABOUT FINS\nLed by Angel Oak’s experienced financial services team, FINS invests predominantly in U.S. financial sector debt as well as selective opportunities across financial sector preferred and common equity. Under normal circumstances, at least 50% of FINS’ portfolio is publicly rated investment grade or, if unrated, judged to be of investment grade quality by Angel Oak Capital Advisors.\nABOUT ANGEL OAK CAPITAL ADVISORS, LLC\nAngel Oak Capital Advisors is an investment management firm focused on providing compelling fixed-income investment solutions to its clients.

      "Content": "5 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 12:05 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMETA\n\nCRM\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are benefiting from the AI infrastructure boom.\nMeta and Pinterest are social media stocks that are seeing their revenue driven by AI.\nSalesforce has a big AI agent opportunity, helped by its acquisition of Informatica.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTechnology stocks have been leading the market higher the past few years, but that doesn't mean there still aren't good values out there. Let's look at five cheap tech stocks to buy right now.\n\nNvidia While Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock isn't often associated with being cheap, it trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of just 25 times next year's analyst estimates. For a company that just grew its revenue by 62% last quarter and continues to see insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) , that's a bargain.\n\nSpending on artificial intelligence (AI) just continues to climb, and Nvidia remains in the best position to capture it. It has about a 90% market share in the GPU market, and its CUDA software platform, which is where most foundational AI code has been written, gives it a wide moat. And the company has shown it is ready to go on the offensive following a few recent acquisitions and partnerships.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing With a forward P/E of less than 24, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is another top tech bargain. The company saw its revenue soar 41% last quarter, and it is projecting that demand for AI chips will continue to grow at a more than 40% compound annual rate over the next few years.\nAs the only company that can manufacture advanced chips at scale with few defects, TSMC is in a prime position to benefit from the strong continued demand for GPUs and other AI chips. The company is working closely with chip designers on their semiconductor road maps to expand capacity to meet the increasing demand. And it has strong pricing power that will continue to drive revenue growth as well.\n\nMeta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the cheapest of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, trading at a forward P/E of just 22. However, the company has been a strong grower, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\nMeta's growth is being driven by AI, which it is using to both attract new users and keep people on its sites longer by feeding them more of the content they are interested in. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better ad campaigns and improve targeting.\nLast quarter, this led to a 14% jump in ad impressions and a 10% rise in ad prices. The company has just started gradually introducing ads to its WhatsApp messaging platform and its 3 billion users, as well as on its newest platform, Threads. This should help drive growth in the coming years.\n\nStory Continues\nSalesforce With a forward P/E of just above 20, shares of Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) are inexpensive for a solidly growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) company with recurring revenue and high gross margins. Meanwhile, the company has the potential to become an AI winner.\nIts acquisition of Informatica, whose platform gathers data from a variety of sources and creates a single record, helps position it as a central source for a company's data from which AI agents can then act. This is an important piece of the puzzle with AI agents, which should help its solution continue to gain traction.\n\nLast quarter, annual recurring revenue for its AI agent platform surged 330% to $540 million. And this is really just the beginning of what could become an enormous opportunity.\nPinterest With a forward P/E just above 13, Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is not only cheap, but its stock is also in the bargain bin. Last quarter, its revenue climbed 17%, while it grew its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization by 24%.\nThe company has been seeing strong growth in users and average revenue per user in international markets, while it has transformed its site into an AI-powered shoppable discovery platform. Its Performance Plus ad suite is helping advertisers create better campaigns and get better returns on their spending.\n\nUsers are increasingly drawn to Pinterest's platform to shop by the AI features it has introduced, such as visual search and virtual clothes try-ons. Its enhancements on both the front and back ends should continue to drive growth.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Why ASML Stock Popped Today\n\nJosh Kohn-Lindquist, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 10:26 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points ASML received a major price target upgrade from Aletheia Capital on Friday.\nThe investment firm believes there may be 30% upside in ASML's stock over the next year.\nASML continues to dominate the lithography industry and stands to benefit from TSMC's expansion plans.\n10 stocks we like better than ASML ›\n\nShares of industry-leading lithography specialist, ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) , are up 9% as of noon Friday. The catalyst for this surge stems from Aletheia Capital issuing a rare stock rating reversal from \"sell\" to \"buy,\" alongside a doubling of its price target for the stock from $750 to $1,500. Compared to ASML's current trading level, this new price target represents 30% upside.\nASML: Powering the Magnificent 7 ASML holds a dominant share of the deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography industry and a quasi-monopoly in the bleeding-edge extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography niche, making it one of the most important companies in the world today -- particularly in the semiconductor chain. Lithography is the near-magic process of etching infinitesimal patterns onto silicon wafers to be used in the world's most advanced semiconductor chips -- and ASML's equipment leads the way.\nWhile the company may not be a household name, I'd argue that it certainly passes the snap test. If these products disappeared overnight, the Magnificent Seven would be immediately hindered, and many of its AI ambitions would become unachievable, or at the very least, delayed. ASML's importance to the Magnificent Seven and its interconnectedness within the broader semiconductor industry rhymes with Aletheia Capital's reasoning for raising its outlook on the stock.\n\nAletheia notes that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's plans to expand its manufacturing capacity by 40% to 50% in 2027 will be a key catalyst for ASML, as the company will be one of the leading suppliers of this growth. Furthermore, the investment firm believes EUV growth will accelerate to 60% to 70% by 2027 as ASML capitalizes on the AI boom.\nWhile ASML trades at a lofty 38 times forward earnings, its lithography dominance and growth potential seem to outweigh this slight premium.\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now? Before you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "2 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 6:45 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Nvidia remains well positioned to benefit from the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure buildout.\nTSMC has become an invaluable player in the semiconductor space.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe biggest trend driving the market right now is artificial intelligence (AI) , and with the game-changing technology still in its early innings, there's no reason to think this won't continue over the next decade.\nLet's look at two leading AI stocks to buy and hold for the next decade.\n1. Nvidia The biggest AI winner thus far has been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and the company is still one of the best positioned to benefit over the next decade. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of AI infrastructure, holding an approximate 90% share in the space. However, Nvidia isn't sitting still, as seen by two recent important acquisitions.\n\nIts recent acquisition of SchedMD, the developer of Slurm, only widens its software moat. Slurm is an open-source software platform that's used to orchestrate AI chips, and while Nvidia will keep it open source, by controlling the platform, it can ensure that its chips will be managed the most efficiently using the platform.\nThe company also made a smart deal for Groq, where it signed a technology license and will bring on the bulk of its employees. Groq was founded by the makers of Alphabet' s popular Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and has developed a chip designed specifically for AI inference called language processing units (LPUs). Nvidia will be able to tightly integrate these chips with its software and networking system to better take on the inference market, where cost-per inference becomes a much more important factor.\n\nNvidia's position in the AI data center market stems from the ecosystem it has built around its chips. Its CUDA software platform is where all early AI foundational code was written, and today, the libraries and tools built on top of CUDA to optimize its chips for AI workloads create a huge moat, especially when it comes to large language model (LLM) training. In addition, its proprietary NVLink interconnect system enables its chips to function as a single, powerful unit, discouraging the mixing and matching of chips in AI clusters.\nOverall, Nvidia is set to continue to reap the rewards from the ongoing AI race and data center buildout that is likely to continue well into the future.\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Another company uniquely positioned to benefit from the ongoing AI data center buildout is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) . TSMC is the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world and has a tight grip on making advanced chips, like GPUs.\n\nStory Continues\nMaking advanced chips is a difficult process, and Nvidia's competitors have struggled to manufacture advanced chips with high yields at scale. In fact, Reuters recently reported that Nvidia decided, after testing, not to go forward with using Intel's 18A production process. Rival Samsung , meanwhile, after struggling with yields, has turned its focus more toward high-bandwidth memory chips, a market that TSMC does not participate in directly.\n\nThis has made TSMC arguably one of the most important companies in the AI value chain, as without it, chip designers like Nvidia would not be able to produce their chips at scale. As such, TSMC has become a valued partner, working closely with advanced chipmakers to help them shrink the nodes of their chips and increase capacity to meet soaring demand.\nThe company sees AI chip demand increasing at an over 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years, and it has also been raising prices for its services. This includes a nice price hike scheduled for 2026.\nOverall, TSMC is one of the best-positioned companies to benefit from the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout. Meanwhile, it is set to win no matter which chipmakers gain share over the next decade.\n\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Stock a Buy for 2026?\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nFri, January 2, 2026 at 3:35 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a key supplier for the AI hyperscalers.\nWall Street expects the chip foundry to produce 21% revenue growth next year.\nThe stock is valued at the low end of where the big tech companies normally trade.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) has been a top stock to own over the last few years, and 2025 was no exception. Its stock rose more than 50% in 2025, making it a top performer in its space. But after such a strong year, is the semiconductor foundry worth owning in 2026?\nLet's take a look at Taiwan Semiconductor's prospects and determine if it can continue its outperformance or if investors should move on from the stock.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a key supplier in a growing industry Taiwan Semiconductor is well-positioned to take advantage of all of the artificial intelligence spending that's ongoing. The company is a neutral party in the chip realm, as it makes chips for companies like Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices , and Broadcom . These three are competing for computing market share, but source most of their chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. So, as long as the AI hyperscalers continue to spend heavily on data centers , it will be in a good spot.\n\nFortunately for Taiwan Semiconductor, the AI computing market is massive. AMD believes that the global computer market will be worth around $1 trillion by 2030. Nvidia offered a similar projection for 2030, as it believes global data center capital expenditures (which include compute and other expenses) will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030. Companies with the most knowledge about what's coming all project huge growth over the next few years, which bodes well for Taiwan Semiconductor.\nWall Street analysts project that Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue growth in 2026 will be 21% in New Taiwan dollars. That growth rate could be higher or lower in U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates, but projections that Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue will rise around 20% next year are a safe bet. That's impressive performance from any company, let alone one that has a market cap of nearly $1.6 trillion.\n\nAs long as Taiwan Semiconductor's valuation is reasonable, that growth can translate directly to stock price appreciation. If the stock is reasonably valued, then it's one well worth buying.\nTaiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its big tech peers If we compare Taiwan Semiconductor's stock to some other big tech companies, it's clear that it trades at a discount.\n\nStory Continues\nAt 24 times next year's earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor has the lowest valuation of the major tech companies outside of Meta Platforms . While this doesn't make Taiwan Semiconductor's stock necessarily cheap, I think it's reasonably valued.\nBecause Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is at a fair price for its market position and performance, it looks like a great candidate to buy for 2026. Furthermore, because it is slated to grow at an above-market-average pace (the S&P 500 usually grows at a 10% rate), Taiwan Semiconductor is expected to outperform the market once again in 2026.\n\nAs a result, this a stock that every investor should consider adding to their portfolio in 2026, as long as you're not already too exposed to the AI trade. There are multiple companies involved in this area, and it's easy to get overleveraged to this sector. However, it's also the primary place where the largest tech companies are spending their money, so having increased exposure to this sector isn't a bad thing either.\nI'd expect Taiwan Semiconductor to be one of the best-performing stocks from the cohort compared above in 2026. The only thing that may derail its performance is if the AI hyperscalers start to pull back on spending. I don't see that happening for many years, so I think Taiwan Semiconductor is both a safe investment and a strong one for 2026.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "5 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 1:35 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: LMND\n\nNVDA\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Nvidia, Amazon, and Alphabet all have strong AI moats in different ways that give them an edge over the competition.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the backbone of AI creation and is trading at an excellent price.\nLemonade is expecting to reach adjusted EBITDA breakeven in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has driven the market to the tune of an 81% gain over the past three years. The eight most highly valued companies in the world are all AI companies, and it looks like many of them are just getting started.\nWill 2026 be another winning year for AI, or is the bubble about to burst?\nSince there's no way to know, you can feel comfortable buying great AI stocks to gain exposure to the massive potential, but make sure your portfolio is well-diversified with other stocks, too. If you're looking for a top AI stock, here are five great recommendations.\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is a foundry, which means the company produces the semiconductors that its clients design. It's not developing the AI of the future but plays a key role in making it happen. On top of that, TSMC produces chips for all kinds of companies and technology, and that diversification gives it multiple growth drivers.\n\nEven though TSMC is a well-established industry giant, it's still reporting high growth. In the 2025 third quarter, sales were up 41% year over year, driven by smartphones and autonomous vehicles. The company is also highly profitable, with a gross margin of 59.5% in the third quarter, up from 57.8% last year, and an operating margin of 50.6%, up from 47.5% last year.\nTrading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 31, TSMC stock looks very attractive today, and AI tailwinds should push it even higher in 2026.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is mostly known for its Google internet search engine, which has around 90% of global market share. That's an incredible moat, and it's a self-reinforcing moat. More searches give it more data, which the company uses to provide improved products and a better search experience.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is monetizing its user base with a robust advertising business. It uses AI in multiple ways to both increase user engagement with its ecosystem -- making it more attractive to advertisers -- and refine algorithms to get ads in front of the right people. It also offers its Gemini large-language models (LLM) for personal and business use.\nHowever, Alphabet is a lot more than Google these days, with many segments, including YouTube and Android, that diversify its business and make it an excellent stock to own for the long term. It also trades at 31 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is a great entry point.\n\nStory Continues\n3. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the largest cloud services provider in the world, with almost a third of the global market. That gives it an edge in the space, and it's working hard to keep its dominant position.\nCEO Andy Jassy is always talking about the shift from on-premises spend to the cloud and sees a huge change happening over the next 10 to 20 years. That's a long growth runway for Amazon.\n\nThe company plans to spend more than $125 billion on AI development in 2026, more than any other rival hyperscaler. Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth accelerated in the third quarter to more than 20% year over year, and at its size, that's an impressive feat.\nAI is a huge growth driver for Amazon today but the company has a varied business that makes it a strong bet for long-term growth. Amazon stock trades at an attractive P/E ratio of 33, giving it extra room to expand in 2026.\n4. Nvidia Nvidia 's (NASDAQ: NVDA) growth may be slowing, and as more companies enter the AI development race, it's facing stiffer competition. But there's no question that it has built up a formidable AI platform, with a large array of vertically integrated products its clients are invested in, giving it a leg up on newer options. The company is not letting up on innovation and keeps launching new products with even better technology to protect its moat and industry dominance.\n\nRight now, Nvidia stock is expensive, trading at 47 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is why the stock will fall if growth begins to decelerate. However, the company is a profit machine, and analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) to more than triple through 2028. Nvidia tends to beat on the bottom line, and if it can continue to demonstrate high growth and soaring profits, it should keep beating the market in 2026.\n5. Lemonade Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) is a different type of AI company. It's an insurance company first but has used AI and machine learning from the ground up to create a better system for pricing and handling insurance claims. It has attracted young customers from inception who appreciate its digital technology, and as it becomes more well-known, it's onboarding millions of new customers for all kinds of policies.\n\nThe company has reported strong sales growth from the beginning, and growth has been accelerating. In-force premium, its top-line metric, was up 30% year over year in the third quarter. As its algorithms improve and it scales, Lemonade is also heading toward profitability, and management is expecting to hit adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) breakeven this year. If it does, expect the stock to soar much higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

Renner\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 1:02 PM PST 3 min read\n\nSimone asked \"The Ramsey Show\" how to respond after her parents pushed her to take on a $30,000 car loan.\nShe called from Buffalo, New York, saying she was graduating with a computer science degree and has accepted a job paying $100,000 a year, with a $10,000 signing bonus.\nThe 22-year-old added that she wanted to use the signing bonus to buy a less expensive car with cash, while her parents preferred that she finance a more expensive vehicle. She also asked how to use her income in a way that prepares her for the future.\n\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla?

He added that earning that level of income at her age places her in a position to make her own financial decisions and that adulthood changes how parental input applies.\nSimone said she had not thought about the situation that way and acknowledged that her parents' opinions still influence her decisions.\nWhen Parental Advice Becomes Optional Ramsey said this stage can be difficult for parents, as relationships change when children are fully grown. He encouraged Simone to remain respectful and appreciative while recognizing that her parents no longer make decisions on her behalf.\n\"It would be nice to have their approval, but sometimes they may choose to withhold that approval,\" Ramsey said.\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\nSimone said her parents had previously expected a different path for her, including career options that would have led to lower income levels. Ramsey backed her decision to pursue computer science and said independence does not require disrespecting family.\nThe $30,000 Question Returning to the car discussion, Ramsey said taking on a large auto loan early in a career can reduce flexibility, even with strong income. He supported Simone's plan to buy a modest car with cash and move up later if she chooses.\n\"I want her to just do it and then inform them later,\" co-host Ken Coleman said, addressing the timing of the decision.\n\nSee Also: Have $100k+ to invest?

The floral masterpiece depicted Star Princess sailing through Alaska's natural breath-taking beauty, marking the highly anticipated inaugural 2026 Alaska season for the cruise line's newest ship.\nDazzling millions of viewers and thousands of bystanders as Star Princess \"cruised\" down the 5½‑mile parade route on Colorado Blvd., the finely detailed ship shimmered with silverleaf protea, coconut, blue statice, and lunaria—florals that beautifully evoked the icy glow of Alaska's coastal waters.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the natural beauty of Alaska, the design for Star Princess' float extended this immersive artistry by incorporating textures and tones reminiscent of rugged coastlines and breathtaking regional scenery. The float featured spectacular animation, with Alaskan wildlife coming to life through gentle movement – from whales rising from icy waters to curious sea otters, soaring eagles, a bear clutching salmon, and a wild moose standing proudly amid the landscape. Rich floral details – most notably Blue Tweedia, symbolizing the Alaska state flower, the Forget‑Me‑Not – further brought the scene to life, seamlessly connecting the float's intricate craftsmanship with the spirit and essence of Alaska.\nDesigned and built by Artistic Entertainment Services, the float also featured spectacular animation that brought Alaska's wildlife to life, stretching approximately 55 feet long and 21 feet high, and adorned with more than 300,000 flowers and natural materials.\n\n\"What better way to welcome the new year than on the world-famous Rose Parade stage, celebrating the breathtaking beauty of Alaska and the debut of our remarkable new ship, Star Princess ,\" said Marie Lee, Princess Cruises Chief Marketing Officer. \"Our float pays homage not only to our passionate Princess crew who bring Alaska voyages to life, but also to the local Alaskans – the storytellers, guides, artists, naturalists, and communities – who welcome our guests each season and make every journey extraordinary.\"\nMarie Lee continued by saying \"This year's 'The Magic in Teamwork' theme perfectly reflects who we are: an extraordinary team dedicated to delivering unforgettable travel experiences that inspire joy, connection, and moments worth retelling.\"\n\nStory Continues\nTo honor \"The Magic in Teamwork\" theme, and to pay tribute to the 25,000 crew members and teammates worldwide who deliver incredible cruise vacations, four Princess teammates rode on the float, two from Princess' shoreside offices and two crew members.\nAdditionally, 12 performers danced their way down Colorado Blvd. to a reimagined version of \"The Love Boat\" theme song in a nostalgic nod to Princess' ocean-going, co-starring role on the beloved television show credited with introducing millions of viewers to the concept of a cruise vacation.\n\nPrincess Cruises \"Together in the Magic of Alaska\" Float Florals\nGlaciers rendered in crushed white chrysanthemums, rice, and iridescent everlasting; accented with cool blue tones, Alaska was brought to life through immersive floral artistry.\nSurrounded by whales, layered blues and whites - iris, hydrangea, dendrobium orchids, ocean mums, and gypsophila - created the movement and depth of Alaskan waterways. Wildlife included moose and bears crafted from natural fibers such as palm fiber, cornsilk, grasses, and seeds for realistic texture, while a majestic eagle stood as a symbolic centerpiece honoring Princess Cruises' spirit of discovery.\nTowering 21-foot trees of pine and spruce formed an authentic forest backdrop, combining live greenery with structured forms. Additional ferns, grasses, and accent florals provide softness, texture, and seamless color transitions throughout the design.\nThe design featured authentic Alaskan florals, including blue tweedia, delphinium, larkspur, yarrow, asters, campanula, and astilbe to complete the landscape, drawing inspiration from the state's wildflower meadows, tundra, and coastal beauty for a lush and unforgettable representation of Alaska.\n\nPrincess showcased its second Sphere Class ship – a 177,800-ton vessel designed to host 4,300 guests. Highlights of the float include The Dome, a next-generation relaxation and entertainment space perched atop the ship, and the striking sphere-shaped Piazza, the architectural centerpiece featuring dramatic curves, floor-to-ceiling windows, and sweeping ocean vistas.\nAs the #1 cruise line in Alaska, Princess Cruises' upcoming 2026 season is its biggest ever, highlighted by the debut of Star Princess . The expanded program features eight ships, 180 departures, and 19 destinations, offering travelers an unparalleled selection of Alaska adventures by sea or by both land and sea.

      "Content": "Shriro Holdings' (ASX:SHM) Returns Have Hit A Wall\n\nSimply Wall St\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 12:47 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: SHM.AX\n\nWhat are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Although, when we looked at Shriro Holdings ( ASX:SHM ), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Shriro Holdings is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.17 = AU$8.0m ÷ (AU$64m - AU$16m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025) .\nSo, Shriro Holdings has an ROCE of 17%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 19% generated by the Consumer Durables industry.\nSee our latest analysis for Shriro Holdings\nHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Shriro Holdings' ROCE against it's prior returns. If you're interested in investigating Shriro Holdings' past further, check out this free graph covering Shriro Holdings' past earnings, revenue and cash flow .\n\nHow Are Returns Trending? We've noticed that although returns on capital are flat over the last five years, the amount of capital employed in the business has fallen 34% in that same period. This indicates to us that assets are being sold and thus the business is likely shrinking, which you'll remember isn't the typical ingredients for an up-and-coming multi-bagger. So if this trend continues, don't be surprised if the business is smaller in a few years time.\n\nThe Key Takeaway It's a shame to see that Shriro Holdings is effectively shrinking in terms of its capital base. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 75% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.\nIf you want to know some of the risks facing Shriro Holdings we've found 2 warning signs (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nStory continues\nFor those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

      "Content": "Costco upgrades perks for members amid slowing growth\n\nDaniel Kline\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 12:47 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: COST\n\n“The most important item we sell is the membership card,” Costco CEO Ron Vachris told Fortune in an April interview\nCostco has steadily added to its membership base.\n\"Revenue from membership fees increased 5% to $4.8 billion, and our membership base grew to nearly 137 million cardholders, with a 90% renewal rate,\" the chain shared in its 2024 annual report .\n\nThe chain raised its membership fees in September, 2024.\n\"In July, we announced our first membership fee increase in seven years, increasing our Gold Star Membership by $5 and our Executive Membership by $10. We are committed to investing these incremental membership fees to provide a better experience for members and employees,\" the chain shared.\nMembership fees matter to Costco because it generates roughly 60-70% of its operating profits from them.\n\"This model generates predictable, high-margin income primarily from membership fees, which account for a significant portion of its operating profit, insulating the company from the volatility of discretionary spending,\" The Inyo Register shared .\nNow, membership growth has slowed, and Costco has taken some steps to address that.\n\nCostco sees slowing membership growth During Costco's first-quarter earnings call , Wells Fargo Analyst Edward Kelly asked about the chain's membership.\n\"You've had remarkable growth over the last few years. Model has obviously resonated. And 5% this quarter is still very good. But it has slowed a little over the last few quarters. I was wondering if you could just maybe discuss what you're seeing there,\" he asked.\n\nCFO Gary Millerchip was clear in his answer.\n\"In general, we've been really pleased with the results that we've seen in the quarter with the new members and the younger population that we're recruiting, the acceleration in upgrades and overall growth that you mentioned just over 5% and exec up 9%. So we're pleased with the results that we've seen overall,\" he added.\nMillerchip did note that Costco has seen some weakness in membership growth.\n\"I think your point is accurate that if you look at the year-over-year growth, it has slowed a little bit from where it's been over the last couple of years. And I think some of that is just starting to cycle some strong growth in the last year or so. But we still feel really good about the health of the membership growth,\" he added.\n\nCostco membership is a good value Having been a Costco member in the past, it’s easy to see the value: savings on gas and regular purchases alone often cover the $60 membership.\nBack in 2019, I calculated the value of a Costco membership just for gas. Using 10 gallons a week at the average $2.67 per gallon, Costco’s $0.18 discount per gallon adds up to about $94 a year. Even this simple example shows that, for some, a membership pays for itself.”\nCostco makes changes to improve membership Despite modest fee increases and slowing growth, Costco memberships continue to deliver strong value to members.\nCostco has worked to steadily improve the value of its membership. That's something Millerchip also talked about during the call.\n\"And then we're committed to continuing to improve the value of the membership. We've made obviously some major changes recently with the extended opening hours and the Instacart benefits and 5% gas on the credit card,\" he said.\n\nThat's not going to stop, according to the CFO.\nMore Retail:\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\"We'll continue to look for ways to add greater membership value. So I think it's accurate to say that it's a little bit slower than it has been, but we feel good about the momentum and the opportunity to continue to grow,\" he added.\nA number of retail analysts believe that a Costco membership offers value even after the price increase.\nAnalysts see value of Costco membership \"The Costco brand is so valuable to customers that they would pay significantly more for the privilege of brand ownership. When I look around the very sorry retail brand category Costco stands out (like IKEA) in actually owning an important brand. Discovery, fun and feeling smart ARE the Costco brand. How valuable is that? To quote MasterCard from years ago: Priceless,\" Brain Trust member Tom Dougherty wrote on Retailwire .\n\nHis colleague Zel Bianco echoed those sentiments.\n\"The price/value at Costco is excellent, and for my money, I think they are doing a good job,\" he shared.\nLee Kent, another Brain Trust member, agreed.\n\"Being a long-time member and fan of Costco, I have not really thought much about the fee and what I get for it. On the other hand, I do know that I would pay more for Costco than for Sam’s or BJs. Why? The quality is there, and the staff are friendly, helpful, and an added value,\" he posted.\nRelated: Yet another furniture retailer hits Chapter 11 bankruptcy on NYE\n=\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Jan 1, 2026, where it first appeared in the Retail section.

      "Content": "Maresca leaves Chelsea after just 18 months in charge\n\nAFP\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 12:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nEnzo Maresca left his role as Chelsea head coach on Thursday after just 18 months in charge, the Premier League club announced.\nThe Italian's exit from Stamford Bridge comes with the club fifth in the Premier League table -- 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal -- with one win in their last seven top-flight games.\n\n\"Chelsea Football Club and head coach Enzo Maresca have parted company,\" said a club statement.\nSpeculation about Maresca's position increased during Chelsea's poor run of recent results amid reports of a worsening relationship between the coach and the club's hierarchy.\n\"With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football, Enzo and the club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track,\" Chelsea added.\nUnder-21s head coach Calum McFarlane is expected to take charge of Sunday's trip to Manchester City.\nLiam Rosenior, the head coach of French club Strasbourg, owned by Chelsea's parent company BlueCo -- a consortium headed up by US billionaire businessman Todd Boehly -- is the leading candidate to replace Maresca despite the 41-year-old's lack of Premier League experience.\n\nMaresca did not attend the post-match press conference following a frantic 2-2 draw with Bournemouth on Tuesday, although his absence was attributed to illness.\nThe draw meant Chelsea had dropped 13 points at home from winning positions this season -- the bulk of the 15-point deficit between the Blues and Arsenal.\nHis decision to substitute Cole Palmer just after the hour mark during the Bournemouth game was booed by Chelsea fans.\nMaresca has stood by comments made on December 13 after a league win at home to Everton when he said many people at Chelsea \"didn't support me and the team\".\nHe repeatedly refused to clarify the comments, although he insisted they were not an attack on the club's supporters.\nThe 45-year-old said the days leading up to the 2-0 victory over Everton were \"the worst 48 hours\" of his time at Chelsea.\n\nMaresca's stock at Chelsea was high after the Blues beat Barcelona 3-0 in the Champions League in November.\n- Man City talks -\nBut damaging defeats by Leeds, Atalanta and Villa increased the pressure on the Blues boss.\nMaresca had also been linked as a potential successor to Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola should he end his decade-long stay at the Etihad Stadium at the end of the season.\nIt has been reported that Maresca twice informed Chelsea of talks with City, where he previously worked as one of Guardiola's assistants, as his contract required him to reveal negotiations with other clubs.\n\nStory Continues\nChelsea sit 13th in the Champions League table and are likely to miss out on direct qualification for the last 16 via a top-eight finish.\nBut they have progressed to the semi-finals of the League Cup, where they will face Arsenal over two legs.\nMaresca's contract had been due to run until the summer of 2029, with a club option of a further year.\nChelsea won the UEFA Conference League and the Club World Cup in 2025 and Maresca also led them back into the Champions League via a fourth-placed finish in the Premier League in his only full season in charge.\n\"Thank you for everything, mister, and to your staff. For the work and the trust from day one, and for the memories,\" Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella posted on social media alongside pictures of the Spain international with Maresca.\nkca-jdg/smg/nf/bsp\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

It's an excellent opportunity for a fresh start, which means new ideas for your stock portfolio.\nAlthough the calendar is turning a page, artificial intelligence (AI) remains a hot theme for 2026, just as it has been for most of the past few years. Despite immense hype and soaring share prices, some AI stocks still represent compelling value today.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , also known as TSMC, was no slouch in 2025. The stock rose by more than 50%. Yet, it may still be the best AI stock to buy in January. Here's why shares could continue heading higher.\nGobbling up market share in the AI era Everything electronic, from data centers for AI to your smartphone, uses microchips. Many companies that sell them, such as Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices , design them and outsource the manufacturing to companies called foundries, which have the expertise and equipment to build them.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest foundry, and to say that it dominates its industry could somehow be an understatement. According to estimates from Counterpoint Research, TSMC's market share (by revenue) of the global foundry market was approximately 72% at the end of the third quarter. Samsung was the closest competitor at just 7%.\n\nPerhaps what's more impressive is that despite surging demand for AI chips, TSMC has actually increased its market share amid this AI investment cycle. Its share was 65% midway through 2024.\nManufacturing chips is a complicated task. Given the money at stake -- there are hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into AI -- chip companies are flocking to TSMC's scale, equipment, and proprietary processes.\nNo other company can build as many high-end chips as quickly as this one can. They are the sure thing, and that has value.\nNvidia's Rubin chip is arriving soon The top AI company, Nvidia, has partnered closely with TSMC for its graphics processing units (GPUs), including its Hopper architecture and its successor, Blackwell. Naturally, innovation continues, and its Rubin architecture is next in line, set to arrive on the market in 2026.\n\nStory continues\nTSMC is building Rubin using its advanced 3-nanometer process, to achieve higher performance with less power consumption. Nvidia recently touted a $500 billion order backlog -- meaning that a company with $187 billion in sales over the past four quarters is poised to continue its impressive growth trajectory.\nNvidia's AI success is affecting TSMC, whose own revenue growth has accelerated dramatically over the past few years. In fact, Nvidia has challenged Apple as TSMC's largest customer at this point.\nFantastic growth at a compelling price Barring an unexpected widespread collapse in AI spending, Nvidia's huge backlog is likely to help propel TSMC's business to new heights as those orders flow through its foundries. Fortunately for investors, there appears to be room for the stock to continue its ascent.\nIts price-to-earnings ratio is just under 30 times TSMC's full-2025 earnings estimates. While that may seem high, the company is likely to continue growing rapidly, as discussed above. Analysts estimate that it will increase earnings by an average of nearly 29% annually over the next three to five years.\n\nUsing the price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) to compare TSMC's growth rate to its valuation, its ratio of roughly 1 signals the stock is very attractive at its current price. I am often willing to pay up for a PEG ratio of about 2 to 2.5 for a high-quality stock, and TSMC certainly meets that standard as the world's leading chip foundry.\nSo even if TSMC's growth falls a bit short of analyst estimates, investors still have a good chance of achieving strong returns over the long term. The company's mission-critical role in the AI boom gives the stock a relatively high floor with enough upside to make it a leading investment idea heading into January.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?

      "Content": "Is Intel Keeping a (Wonderful) Secret From the Market Regarding Its 18A Node?\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nThu, January 1, 2026 at 12:53 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Intel will be the first chipmaker to use high-NA EUV lithography, giving it a potential advantage over TSMC.\nThe company has long pointed to its 14A node in 2028 as the first node in which it will use high-NA.\nHowever, there have been hints Intel may insert high-NA earlier into its 18A node, which is ramping up today.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\n\nThere's a conventional wisdom among investors that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is significantly behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , and that it will take years for the company to catch up to TSMC's technological lead -- if it ever happens at all.\nLast week, sell-side analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein said that since it took a decade to \"break\" Intel, investors shouldn't expect it to take less than 10 years to fix. Notwithstanding Intel's heavy lift turnaround really began in 2021 with the appointment of former CEO Pat Gelsinger, the turnaround may actually be closer than Rasgon expects.\nOne key element for Intel being able to leapfrog TSMC would be the earlier implementation of high-NA EUV lithography technology. While Intel has publicly stated that it won't introduce high-NA until its 14A node in 2028, there were numerous indications over the past year that Intel may in fact accelerate HNA into its current 18A manufacturing process.\n\nIf that happens, the semiconductor industry could change very quickly.\nWhat is high-NA EUV? High-NA EUV lithography is the latest and most advanced version of extreme ultraviolet lithography technology (EUV), pioneered and developed by ASML Holdings (NASDAQ: ASML) . Twenty years in the making, chipmakers first used EUV lithography in 2019, enabling the efficient production of chips with pitches as small as 7 nanometers between transistors.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Intel delayed its implementation of EUV, instead opting for double, triple, or even quadruple patterning with older DUV technology. That delay allowed TSMC to leapfrog Intel, giving the Taiwanese giant a manufacturing lead it has held to this day.\nHigh-NA is the next jump forward in this technology. HNA EUV machines can \"write\" chip patterns in a thickness of just 8nm, more precisely than the 13.5-nm light beams of low-NA EUV. Like its predecessor, the new technology enables single-patterning, higher-density chips with fewer process steps. Fewer process steps generally means higher yields than multi-patterning with older tools.\nDetermined not to repeat mistakes of the past, Intel has jumped to the front of the line as the first to implement high-NA EUV machines. Ironically, it's TSMC this time that has opted to wait to use the new technology, with TSMC management citing cost reasons.\n\nStory continues\nBut both Intel and ASML have claimed that high-NA machines are working as intended now. In early 2024, ASML's CEO took issue with critics of HNA, saying it is \"very clearly the most cost-effective solution both in logic and memory.\"\nThen at a technology conference in February 2025, Intel executive Steve Carson noted Intel already had HNA \"in production,\" and that the tool was \"more reliable\" at this stage than low-NA was at the equivalent time in the past. Carson also noted high-NA enabled Intel to do the same work with one machine and a \"single-digit\" number of process steps that it took a low-NA machine three exposures and roughly 40 processing steps. So, there appear to be clear advantages for HNA in terms of productivity, especially when one gets to leading-edge nodes that require triple-patterning on low-NA tools.\n\nNow, there are technology obstacles to using HNA tools effectively, and the tool costs about double that of a low-NA tool. Still, given the productivity enhancements, HNA lines should net out to overall cost savings when properly implemented.\nIntel has at least three HNA machines and tons of experience with HNA already Another reason Intel may be ready to use HNA EUV today is that it has already bought, installed, and utilized at least three tools it has disclosed to the public, and possibly more that it hasn't.\nIntel announced the receipt of its first HNA machine at its Oregon R&D facility in late 2023/early 2024, then announced \"first light\" on the machine in late February 2024. Intel next followed that up with the disclosure of a second HNA machine installation in August 2024 at its Oregon facility.\n\nThen, just two weeks ago in mid-December, Intel announced it had achieved \"acceptance testing\" of ASML's EXE:5200 HNA machine, the upgraded version of last year's EXE:5000 high-NA machine, which features enhanced throughput for high-volume manufacturing. Acceptance testing means Intel has the HNA machine working in the fab, meeting high-volume manufacturing benchmarks and customer specifications.\nNotably, ASML didn't start shipping the 5200 until early 2025, indicating that Intel has at least one more than the two it officially announced in 2024. In addition, Intel has not disclosed specifically where the third machine, the 5200, was installed. Notably, Intel has been preparing Fab 52 in Arizona for 18A production this year.\n\nIt's also quite possible, if not probable, that Intel has purchased even more HNA machines. In May 2024, industry publication The Elec reported that Intel had secured all of ASML's high-NA EUV production for 2024, which would encompass five to six machines. Given Intel received its first machines in late 2023, that would bring its total to six or seven.\nThis was just one unconfirmed report, and Pat Gelsinger's resignation in late 2024 may have changed this order pattern. Nevertheless, it's likely a fair bet that Intel has purchased more than the three HNA machines it has officially disclosed.\nWith so much progress, why wait until 14A? In light of all this, it's curious Intel has pointed to 14A, due out in 2028, as the point in which it will use high-NA. And it's especially curious that Intel would purchase so many HNA machines, given that this past summer, Intel disclosed that if it doesn't secure a significant external customer, it might not proceed with 14A development at all.\n\nIf Intel weren't sure it would develop 14A, and since it has pointed to 14A being the first HNA node, why would Intel buy so many expensive HNA machines, which cost $400 million each? And why would it do so when the company was already cash flow negative, to the point where the company took in dilutive equity investments this past summer?\nIntel has also already accomplished a tremendous amount of work with HNA tools. At the February tech conference I mentioned, Intel disclosed that it was processing 30,000 wafers per quarter on high-NA tools. That's a huge number of wafers to be processing for mere research and development purposes. Meanwhile, the recent disclosure of \"acceptance testing\" means that the tool has passed a formal evaluation process that determines the tool can function according to contractual specifications in a formal manufacturing setting.\n\nSince the tool appears to be working in manufacturing settings, Intel has extensive experience with it, and HNA reportedly provides material advantages, why wouldn't Intel integrate HNA into the current 18A process?\nIndications HNA may be in Intel's Fab 52 for 18A While Intel has obviously never said it would use high-NA EUV for 18A, the company has nevertheless dropped clues it would be possible to do so over the past year. Meanwhile, outsiders have begun to speculate over the possibility of high-NA machines in Fab 52.\nReporting on the aforementioned February 2025 technology conference, Reuters initially reported that Intel was developing 18A with high-NA technology; however, Intel later had Reuters correct the story to say that Intel was \"using its 18A manufacturing technology, which is scheduled for mass production with a new generation of PC chip later this year, to test the high NA tools.\"\n\nSo, Intel was at least \"testing\" high-NA on its 18A process as of February.\nThen at Intel's Foundry Direct event in April, Intel's chief technology and operations officer Naga Chandrasekaran stated that Intel had achieved \"yield parity\" between testing both low-NA multi-patterning and high-NA single-patterning on both the 18A and 14A nodes.\nMore recently in October, Intel invited technology journalists into Fab 52 for Intel's \"Tech Tour\" to show off the fab and its 18A node. While all of the journalists were under nondisclosure agreements, a vlogger for Level1Techs told his viewers that he saw \"something\" in Fab 52, asked about it, and was told by Intel to please refrain from disclosing what he saw.\nDuring this portion of the vlog, the Level1 presenter showed a video of the original HNA machine being installed in Oregon. After discussing the EUV machines he saw, without specifying the model, the presenter said, \"That's probably the extent of the detail I'm comfortable giving you.\"\n\nWhy would Intel keep this a secret? For the record, there's no evidence that Intel is using HNA EUV on 18A. But given its purported advantages, why keep it a secret if it were?\nThere could be a number of reasons. One might be the competitive advantage of keeping cards close to the vest, surprising the competition and thereby lengthening Intel's first-mover advantage with HNA. There may also be a concern over setting expectations too high for cost savings, yield, and performance with the first incarnation of the tool's use. After all, numerous rumors were circulated about Intel and 18A's progress over the past year, with many being quite negative.\n\nAdditionally, even if Intel does use high-NA tools for 18A, it may only do so on a few layers of each chip. Current leading-edge 3nm-class chips include about 20 EUV layers, and it's expected upcoming 2nm-class chips, of which 18A is a part, will see that EUV layer count jump by 30% into the mid-20s.\nMoreover, a recent short documentary about Fab 52 by CNBC appeared to show low-NA EUV tools in the fab. Therefore, even if HNA is used on 18A, it may only be for certain products, or perhaps only for a few critical layers, with the majority still handled by low-NA tools.\nThus, Intel may be wary of labeling 18A a \"high-NA\" node if most layers are still completed using low-NA tools. It's also possible that Intel may be using low-NA tools for 18A, but will actually insert HNA tools for the next variant of the node called 18AP, which is supposed to ramp later in 2026 and deliver an 8% improvement in performance-per-watt over 18A.\n\nIntel may never reveal its tool set for 18A Investors may never know whether Intel is actually using HNA tools on 18A, given the secrecy that generally accompanies semiconductor manufacturing. If Intel does choose to disclose it, next week's CES in Las Vegas could be the ideal time and place, given that Intel will formally unveil its first 18A-produced chip, called Panther Lake.\n\nNevertheless, given the company's tight-lipped posture regarding the 18A process, it may very well remain a mystery as to whether Intel is using high-NA EUV for its critical 18A node.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

      "Content": "Retail investors account for 36% of Tolu Minerals Limited's (ASX:TOK) ownership, while institutions account for 25%\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:40 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TOLUF\n\nKey Insights The considerable ownership by retail investors in Tolu Minerals indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\n51% of the business is held by the top 12 shareholders\nInsiders have been selling lately\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nA look at the shareholders of Tolu Minerals Limited ( ASX:TOK ) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 36% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nInstitutions, on the other hand, account for 25% of the company's stockholders. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Tolu Minerals.\nView our latest analysis for Tolu Minerals\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Tolu Minerals? Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nTolu Minerals already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Tolu Minerals, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Tolu Minerals. Our data shows that ASA Gold and Precious Metals Limited is the largest shareholder with 9.6% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.1% and 5.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Furthermore, CEO Christopher Muller is the owner of 0.8% of the company's shares.\n\nLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 12 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.\n\nStory Continues\nInsider Ownership Of Tolu Minerals The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Tolu Minerals Limited. It has a market capitalization of just AU$342m, and insiders have AU$53m worth of shares in their own names. We would say this shows alignment with shareholders, but it is worth noting that the company is still quite small; some insiders may have founded the business. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership With a 36% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Tolu Minerals. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nPrivate Company Ownership Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 24%, of the company's shares. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.\n\nNext Steps: While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 4 warning signs with Tolu Minerals (at least 3 which are significant) , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, backed by strong financial data.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

      "Content": "ReadyTech Holdings Limited's (ASX:RDY) top owners are private equity firms with 30% stake, while 25% is held by institutions\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:32 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: RDY.AX\n\nKey Insights Significant control over ReadyTech Holdings by private equity firms implies that the general public has more power to influence management and governance-related decisions\nThe top 4 shareholders own 54% of the company\n25% of ReadyTech Holdings is held by Institutions\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nA look at the shareholders of ReadyTech Holdings Limited ( ASX:RDY ) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 30% to be precise, is private equity firms. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nInstitutions, on the other hand, account for 25% of the company's stockholders. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of ReadyTech Holdings.\nSee our latest analysis for ReadyTech Holdings\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ReadyTech Holdings? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in ReadyTech Holdings. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at ReadyTech Holdings' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nOur data indicates that hedge funds own 5.0% of ReadyTech Holdings. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. Our data shows that Pemba Capital Partners Pty Limited is the largest shareholder with 30% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 14% and 5.1% of the stock. In addition, we found that Marc Washbourne, the CEO has 3.6% of the shares allocated to their name.\nOn looking further, we found that 54% of the shares are owned by the top 4 shareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the decisions of the company.\n\nStory Continues\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nInsider Ownership Of ReadyTech Holdings The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nWe can report that insiders do own shares in ReadyTech Holdings Limited. As individuals, the insiders collectively own AU$17m worth of the AU$303m company. Some would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. But it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership With a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over ReadyTech Holdings. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nPrivate Equity Ownership With an ownership of 30%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Sometimes we see private equity stick around for the long term, but generally speaking they have a shorter investment horizon and -- as the name suggests -- don't invest in public companies much. After some time they may look to sell and redeploy capital elsewhere.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership We can see that Private Companies own 11%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.\n\nNext Steps: While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\nI always like to check for a history of revenue growth .

      "Content": "Paul Krugman Says Trump's Policies Hurting MAGA's Small Business Base, Economist Warns America Moved Rapidly Toward 'Crony Capitalism'\n\nVishaal Sanjay\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 3 min read\n\nSmall business owners, long considered the core of President Donald Trump’s political base, are now increasingly feeling the brunt of his policies during his second term in office, according to economist Paul Krugman .\n2025 Was A ‘Miserable Year’ For Small Businesses In his newsletter on Monday, Krugman stated that the small business community, which had celebrated Trump’s return to the White House, had a “miserable” year in 2025, and warned that “2026 will be worse.”\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist cited research that showed “the experience of being a small business owner leads people to adopt conservative views on government regulation,” but he said these expectations have since collided with policy reality over the past year.\n\nDon't Miss:\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it ?\n7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\nKrugman said the combined impact of Trump's tariffs and immigration enforcement has created significant operational strain for small business owners.\n“High tariffs have been a body blow” to companies dependent on imported products, he said, adding that “mass arrests of immigrants have also been highly disruptive for businesses, such as construction contractors, that depend on foreign-born workers.”\nWhile these pressures affect all companies, Krugman said large corporations have been better positioned to adapt by finding new suppliers, exploiting trade agreement exemptions and leveraging political influence.\n\n“Under Trump, the United States has moved rapidly toward crony capitalism,” Krugman said, citing the example of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) receiving exemptions on its smartphone imports from India, despite punitive tariffs on the country’s other exports.\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\nSmall businesses, on the other hand, cannot get such preferential exemptions based on their political connections, Krugman said.\nThis pressure is now being compounded by rising health care costs, Krugman said, while noting that “almost half of the adults receiving health insurance via the government-run exchanges” either own or work for small businesses, which means the expiration of federal subsidies has had an outsized impact.\n\nSmall Businesses And Exporters Hit By Tariffs There have been several stories recently, covering small businesses that became unsustainable and were even driven to bankruptcy following Trump’s tariffs on India and China.\n\nStory Continues\nSee Also: Missed Tesla? EnergyX Is Tackling the Next $200 Billion Opportunity — Lithium\nOwners have railed against skyrocketing input costs, canceled contracts and looming bankruptcies, while increasingly contrasting former President Ronald Reagan's pro-trade legacy with the tariff-heavy direction of Trump and the modern Republican Party.\n\nAccording to former U.S. Trade Representative Roy Kirk , the chaos surrounding Trump’s tariff policies is doing great harm to small businesses and even exporters.\n“Over 90% of US exporters are small businesses and family-owned businesses. And this is just driving them nuts trying to figure out what the rules of the road are going to be,” he said.\nRead Next: Have $100k+ to invest?

This year’s lineup includes a mix of musical performances, celebrity hosts and live countdowns designed to carry audiences into the new year.

      "Content": "Prediction: This Will Be the Next AI Stock That Berkshire Hathaway Buys\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 7:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: BRK.A\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Warren Buffett retired at the end of 2025, and Greg Abel will take his place in 2026.\nAmazon stock might be back on the menu for Berkshire, but there are a few caveats.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nWith legendary CEO Warren Buffett's time complete with Berkshire Hathaway , many investors are wondering where the company will go under the direction of new CEO Greg Abel. Buffett and Berkshire have been staunch value investors for multiple decades, but could this transition indicate a shift in investment philosophy?\nI wouldn't be surprised if Berkshire becomes more aggressive with Abel at the helm, and maybe invests in an artificial intelligence (AI) stock or two. But which one will it buy?\nBerkshire already owns some AI stocks The number of companies that fall under the artificial intelligence investing umbrella is quite large. There are software applications, facilitators, hardware plays, or even infrastructure, including energy companies. Berkshire already owns a few stocks that I'd consider AI plays, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Berkshire added Alphabet to its portfolio during Q3 2025, and this recent addition has already made it a ton of money.\n\nThe next AI stock Berkshire may purchase could be one it already owns, and I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon is one of the next stocks it adds to. Berkshire first took a stake in Amazon in 2019 and has added to that position over time, but hasn't purchased any Amazon shares in a while. Berkshire owns an even 10 million shares of Amazon, which sounds like a ton. However, Amazon is only a 0.8% stake in Berkshire's investment portfolio. With Amazon being an undersize portion of Berkshire's portfolio compared to the outsize returns it could generate, it makes sense that the conglomerate may elect to add shares in 2026.\nAfter a so-so start to 2025, Amazon is really starting to gain momentum in the second half of 2025. Net sales rose 13% year over year to $180 billion, with recent high growth rates in several of its key business units. Amazon Web Services (AWS, its cloud computing segment) and advertising services each posted the best growth in multiple quarters. This is key, as both of these business units have much greater operating margins than other commerce-focused business units.\nIn Q3, AWS made up 66% of Amazon's total operating profit despite only generating 18% of total sales. With AWS' growth reaccelerating and it projected to continue that strength into 2026, that bodes well for Amazon's profit picture.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon doesn't break out the advertising service's operating margin as it does with AWS. Still, if you look at other advertising-focused businesses like Alphabet and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , it's clear that this business unit likely has operating margins in the 30% to 40% range, which is far higher than the whole company's operating margin.\nContinued success of these two business units is key for Amazon, but is it enough for Berkshire to warrant purchasing shares?\nOne of the possible minds behind the first Amazon purchase is gone Buffett wasn't the only portfolio manager at Berkshire Hathaway. Todd Combs and Ted Weschler also had some purchasing power, and they were known to purchase more tech-focused investments than Buffett did. Todd Combs is no longer a part of Berkshire, as he accepted a position at JPMorgan Chase . If Combs was the original purchaser of Amazon shares, this may not bode well for Amazon's future inclusion in Berkshire's investment portfolio. But if it was Ted Weschler, it may be on his shopping list.\n\nOne of Berkshire's core investment philosophies is to buy great companies at good prices. Most investors would agree that Amazon is a great company, but what's a good price?\nThe best metric to value Amazon's stock is the operating price-to-earnings ratio. The standard P/E ratio isn't a great measure for Amazon, as it has a significant investment portfolio whose gains and losses can cause its diluted earnings per share (EPS) metric to rise and fall, even if Amazon didn't sell any of its investments. By this metric, Amazon is the cheapest it has been in some time.\nWith Amazon trading at the bottom end of its recent range and expected to have a strong 2026, I wouldn't be surprised if Berkshire decides to add some more Amazon shares to its portfolio. Time will tell where Greg Abel wants to lead this business, but I'd be shocked if he didn't start spending some of the cash Buffett piled up during his last few years as CEO.\n\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Why the Market Dipped But TSMC (TSM) Gained Today\n\nZacks Equity Research\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nTSMWF\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\nIn the latest close session, TSMC (TSM) was up +1.44% at $303.89. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.74%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.63%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.76%.\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the chip company had gained 2.56% outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.14% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.79%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of TSMC will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.72, indicating a 21.43% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $32.6 billion, indicating a 21.26% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $10.17 per share and revenue of $121 billion. These totals would mark changes of +44.46% and +34.32%, respectively, from last year.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for TSMC. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.21% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Right now, TSMC possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nLooking at its valuation, TSMC is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 29.47. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 29.47, which means TSMC is trading at no noticeable deviation to the group.\n\nMeanwhile, TSM's PEG ratio is currently 1.03. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.03 as trading concluded yesterday.\nThe Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 108, positioning it in the top 44% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Sleeping With the Enemy: Inside the NVIDIA-Intel Deal\n\nJeffrey Neal Johnson, MarketBeat\nWed, December 31, 2025 at 1:39 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nTSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points NVIDIA has validated Intel's manufacturing capabilities by securing a long-term agreement for advanced packaging capacity to meet global demand.\nThe new leadership at Intel has successfully improved manufacturing yields and implemented a strategy focused on operational efficiency and execution.\nGovernment support has firmly established Intel as a critical pillar of national infrastructure, driving the next generation of computing.\nInterested in Intel Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nFor over a decade, the semiconductor industry was defined by a rivalry between Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA). One company dominated the Central Processing Unit (CPU) market that powered personal computers, while the other quietly built an empire in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for gaming and eventually artificial intelligence (AI). However, December 2025 marked the definitive end of that era of opposition. The geopolitical landscape of Silicon Valley was dramatically reshaped by a move that stunned Wall Street: NVIDIA finalized a $5 billion private placement investment in Intel, following regulatory approval for the deal.\nThis transaction is not a financial lifeline for a legacy giant that has struggled to find its footing; it represents a pragmatic armistice driven by the harsh realities of the AI supply chain. For investors, this deal fundamentally changes the risk profile of Intel stock.\n\n→ The Application-Layer Rotation: 3 AI Pure Plays Poised to Win in 2026\nThroughout 2024 and the first half of 2025, Intel traded at a significant discount due to bankruptcy risk. The company faced a perfect storm: removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the suspension of its dividend, and massive capital expenditures that drained its cash reserves. The stock price plummeted more than 50% from its historical highs as the market questioned whether the company could survive its own restructuring.\nNVIDIA’s capital injection answers that question definitively. By taking an equity stake, the world’s most valuable semiconductor company has signaled that Intel’s survival is necessary for the health of the entire industry. This creates a psychological and financial floor for Intel’s stock price, suggesting that the worst of the volatility may finally be in the rearview mirror.\n\n→ Why NVIDIA’s AI Power-Play Could Drive the Next Major Rally in 2026\nIt’s Not Charity, It’s Strategy To understand why this deal is a catalyst for Intel’s stock, investors must look past the headline dollar amount and focus on the underlying technology. NVIDIA did not invest $5 billion to own a piece of Intel’s legacy CPU business. It invested because it desperately needs Intel’s Advanced Packaging capacity.\n\nStory Continues\nIn early 2025, NVIDIA faced a crisis that threatened its growth trajectory. Its flagship Blackwell AI chips encountered thermal management issues; essentially, the chips were generating too much heat when packed tightly into data center racks. This problem was exacerbated by severe supply constraints at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC). TSMC struggled to expand its CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) capacity fast enough to meet global demand.\n\n→ The Lazy Way to Play NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal\nNVIDIA needed a release valve, and Intel was the only company with the infrastructure to provide it. Intel possesses two critical packaging technologies that solve these specific physical limitations:\nEMIB (Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge): This allows different chips to be connected side-by-side on a single flat package, speeding up data transfer.\nFoveros: This method stacks chips vertically, like pancakes, saving space and improving power efficiency.\nBy securing access to Intel’s packaging facilities in Arizona and Ohio, NVIDIA is hedging against future bottlenecks. For Intel shareholders, this is the ultimate proof of concept. If Intel’s manufacturing standards are rigorous enough to satisfy NVIDIA, the world's most demanding hardware client, it validates the quality of Intel Foundry Services (IFS) for the broader market. This endorsement is a marketing win, likely attracting other fabless chip designers who were previously hesitant to leave TSMC.\n\nThe Tan Turnaround: Data Over Hype While the NVIDIA deal provides the external validation, the fundamental recovery of Intel’s operations is being driven internally by CEO Lip-Bu Tan. Since taking the helm, Tan has shifted the company’s culture from one of technological optimism to data-driven realism.\nUnder the previous leadership regime, Intel often over-promised and under-delivered on its manufacturing milestones, eroding investor trust. Tan’s strategy, dubbed Radical Simplification, has focused on cutting bloated middle management and focusing entirely on factory execution.\n\nThe most critical metric for investors to watch is the yield rate, the percentage of functional chips produced on a silicon wafer. Poor yields burn cash; high yields print money.\nYield Improvement: On the critical 18A process node, yields have improved at a predictable rate of roughly 7% month-over-month throughout the latter half of 2025.\nCost Discipline: The company has successfully executed a massive cost-reduction plan, exiting low-margin businesses to preserve capital for manufacturing.\nFurthermore, the downside risk for the stock has been capped by the US government. In August 2025, the US Treasury finalized a 9.9% equity stake in Intel as part of the CHIPS Act stipulations. This is not free money; it comes with strict oversight on executive pay and stock buybacks. However, for a recovering company, this oversight is a positive factor. It ensures capital is spent on factories, not perks.\n\nBetween the US government (focused on national security) and NVIDIA (focused on supply chain security), Intel has secured two of the most powerful backers on the planet. This dual support structure drastically reduces the likelihood of a liquidity crisis.\nFrom Distressed Asset to Critical Infrastructure As we look toward 2026, the narrative for Intel has shifted from survival to utilization. The factories are built, the technology is validated, and the order book is beginning to fill. The upcoming Panther Lake consumer processors are set to ramp up production in early 2026, and NVIDIA’s packaging orders will start to significantly impact revenue shortly thereafter.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has bifurcated into a clear structure: NVIDIA designs the brains of the AI revolution, and Intel has pivoted to building the physical infrastructure required to produce them. By accepting its role as a service provider to its former rival, Intel has secured its future.\nFor investors, the current valuation represents a rare opportunity. The company has transitioned from a distressed asset with bankruptcy fears to a piece of critical infrastructure backed by the state and the industry leader. While the explosive, high-beta growth of the early AI boom may belong to NVIDIA, the steady, stabilized recovery trade belongs to Intel. With the armistice signed and the factory floors humming, the foundation for a long-term rebound is officially in place.\nThe article \" Sleeping With the Enemy: Inside the NVIDIA-Intel Deal \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The share price of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) fell around 3.54% on December 24, driven by Nvidia stopping the test run of Intel’s 18, which is a manufacturing process. The stock price has gained back 3.2% since the drop on Wednesday.\n\nIntel’s 18 is a process that makes chip-making more efficient and faster. According to a report by Bloomberg released on the same day, the investors are mainly concerned because this process, which Nvidia has halted, was expected to help Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The news has raised concerns regarding the company’s ability to push forward in this competition. Moreover, this halt comes despite Nvidia’s $5 billion investment in Intel.\nThat said, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has gained around 80% year-to-date, surpassing the S&P 500 and Nvidia’s performance. Recently, on December 22, Bank of America Securities upgraded the credit rating of the company to Overweight from Market Weight. The firm noted that the company’s lower exposure to the AI demand cycle can act as a protection from the broader AI investment overheating concerns.\n\nMoreover, the firm also raised its fiscal 2025 and 2026 EBITDA estimates by 20% and 18%. BofA sees the company’s leverage improving further in 2026, driven by improving balance sheets, strong AI-driven demand, and attractive valuation compared to its peers.\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services worldwide.

Ltd. (NYSE: TSM ) is one of the best stocks for the next decade . Wall Street analysts continue to be bullish on TSMC.\nEarlier on December 7, Bernstein raised the firm’s price target on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) to $330 from $290 with an Outperform rating. The firm highlighted that TSMC is ramping up its Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate capacity to 125,000 wafers per month by the end of 2026. While an increase, Bernstein noted that this capacity will barely suffice to meet the demand for Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell and Rubin chip architectures through 2025 and 2026, leaving little room for additional projects.\nLater on December 10, the analysts at Bernstein SocGen Group reaffirmed their Outperform rating and $330 price target for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) and noted that the firm is currently outpacing both its own fourth-quarter guidance and market consensus. This optimism follows a strong November revenue report, where TSMC recorded NT$344 billion, which marked a significant 24.5% increase year-over-year.\n\nThe company’s strategic importance in the AI ecosystem continues to attract bullish sentiment across Wall Street. Beyond Bernstein’s target, BofA raised its own price objective to $360, citing TSMC’s clear trajectory in the AI sector. With production ramping up for next-gen AI accelerators and the latest mobile processors, TSMC remains the primary gateway for the hardware required to power global high-performance computing.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Sources cited by the report said Chinese technology companies have placed orders totaling around 2 million H200 GPUs, while Nvidia currently has roughly 700,000 units available, including about 100,000 GH200 Grace Hopper CPU-GPU combinations, with the remainder being H200 GPUs. While the exact scale of any additional production remains unclear, one source indicated that talks have already taken place and manufacturing could possibly begin as early as the second quarter of 2026.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PFE.\nIs TSM fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe return of Nvidia's higher-end chips could be welcomed by Chinese technology firms navigating supply constraints. Separately, the South China Morning Post reported that ByteDance intends to spend about $14 billion on Nvidia GPUs in 2026 to support its computing needs. At the same time, Tencent ( TCEHY ) reportedly has access to Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs through a third party in Japan, while Alibaba ( NYSE:BABA ) has placed orders with AMD ( NASDAQ:AMD ) for some of its MI308 AI accelerators, underscoring how major Chinese players are diversifying sourcing strategies for advanced AI hardware.\nPolicy developments could still influence how much of this demand ultimately converts into shipments. Earlier this month, President Trump said he had approved the sale of Nvidia's H200 GPUs to China while requesting a 25% cut of the sales, adding that similar terms would apply to competitors including AMD and Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ). China has not yet decided whether to allow imports of the H200 GPUs, and prior media reports have suggested authorities could limit them over concerns about domestic semiconductor development. Nvidia has already been approved to export its H20 chips, a less powerful China-specific version, after agreeing in August to pay the U.S. government 15% of related revenue, although China has restricted access to those H20 chips.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

This is AI Weekly. :: AI Weekly Meta has said it will buy Chinese-founded startup Manus as the tech giant accelerates efforts to integrate advanced AI across its platforms. Financial terms were not released, but a source told Reuters the deal values Manus at between $2 billion and $3 billion. Manus went viral early this year on X after it released what it claimed was the world's first general AI agent, capable of making decisions and executing tasks autonomously with less prompting than ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The company was cheered by Chinese state television, with commentators calling it China's next DeepSeek. Nvidia is reportedly scrambling to meet strong demand for its H200 artificial intelligence chips from Chinese technology companies. And according to sources, has approached contract manufacturer TSMC to ramp up production. They added that Chinese tech firms have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips for 2026, while Nvidia currently holds just 700,000 units in stock. SoftBank Group said it completed a $41 billion investment in OpenAI. The move is one of the largest-ever private funding rounds that would give the Japanese firm a stake of about 11% in the ChatGPT maker. Artificial intelligence software developer Eliza Labs has ended its lawsuit accusing billionaire Elon Musk’s X Corp of extracting valuable information from the company before launching copycat AI products. A federal judge in Texas dismissed the case, after Eliza Labs and X said that they agreed to dismissal with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be refiled. X had denied wrongdoing. And as global markets closed out the year, they remained buoyed by strong fundamentals and rising capital flows into growth markets, amplified by an AI-driven investment boom. And that is expected to continue into 2026 as investors keep channelling capital into AI-linked infrastructure, foundries and supply chains. As well as betting on growth from data centers, advanced chip making, and next-generation computing.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

In Q3 2025, David Tepper purchased 950,000 shares of AMD valued at $153.70 million, making it the billionaire’s largest new position during Q3. Since December 15, the market has been abuzz with speculation that Samsung could potentially strike a deal with AMD to provide 2nm AI chips. This comes in light of the N-2 rule likely hindering Taiwan Semiconductor from manufacturing its most complicated nodes abroad. Reports suggest that Samsung’s Executive Chairman, Lee Jae-yong, had a meeting with AMD CEO Lisa Su as well as other Big Tech executives, to discuss the company’s foundry business and consequent business arrangements. The 2nm chipsets could power AMD's CPUs in the future, and a deal with Samsung could be closed in January 2026.\nPhoto by JESHOOTS.COM on Unsplash Separately, Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Advanced Micro Devices on December 15, with a $280 price target, representing 33% upside from current levels. Overall, Wall Street analysts had a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock. Piper remained optimistic about AMD’s short- and mid-term drivers, particularly noting the company’s ability to meet technical targets such as the MI300 series ramp and technical progress for the MI400 series rollout. Analysts also expect further sales growth this year. The firm also told investors that AMD is putting notable resources into the Helios rack, which is slated for release in mid-2026. The company intends to widen its clientele beyond OpenAI, even though part of its new business is expected from that partnership. Piper Sandler noted that AMD’s finances seem to be sorted, and it can fund its development plans. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Nvidia and Apple are among firms pouring many billions of dollars into chips, servers and data centres.\nAI-related spending is soaring worldwide, and is expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion by 2025, according to US research firm Gartner, and over $2 trillion in 2026 -- nearly two percent of global GDP.\nTaiwan's dominance of the chip industry has long been seen as a \"silicon shield\" protecting it from an invasion or blockade by China -- which claims the island is part of its sovereign territory -- and an incentive for the United States to defend it.\nBut the threat of a Chinese attack has fuelled concerns about potential disruptions to global supply chains and has increased pressure for more chip production beyond Taiwan's shores.\n\nChinese fighter jets and warships encircled Taiwan during live-fire drills this week aimed at simulating a blockade of the democratic island's key ports and assaults on maritime targets.\nTaipei, which slammed the two-day war games as \"highly provocative and reckless\", said the manoeuvre failed to impose a blockade on the island.\nTSMC has invested in chip fabrication facilities in the United States, Japan and Germany to meet soaring demand for semiconductors, which have become the lifeblood of the global economy.\nBut in an interview with AFP this month, Taiwanese Deputy Foreign Minister Francois Chih-chung Wu said the island planned to keep making the \"most advanced\" chips on home soil and remain \"indispensable\" to the global semiconductor industry.\njoy-amj/abs\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

While Nvidia is the leading designer of the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to handle most AI workloads, TSMC is the global leader in fabricating and packaging advanced logic and memory chips.\nBoth have benefited from the AI megatrend -- but which of these companies looks like a better long-term stock buy from here?\nNvidia Nvidia has visibility into nearly $500 billion in combined Blackwell and Rubin revenue from the start of 2025 through the end of calendar 2026, of which $150 billion has already been shipped. The company's networking business is also generating multibillion-dollar revenues, with its proprietary high-speed GPU interconnect NVLink, high-performance networking standard InfiniBand, and the AI-optimized Ethernet platform Spectrum-X becoming integral parts of AI deployments worldwide.\n\nProduction of Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin platform is also on schedule to ramp up in the second half of 2026; those platforms, which will combine its new Vera CPU with its Rubin GPU, will support cloud, enterprise, robotics, and physical AI workloads.\nHowever, Nvidia depends extensively on TSMC's ability to manufacture chips using the most advanced process nodes. Also, while President Donald Trump recently loosened some of the trade restrictions he had imposed that were preventing Nvidia from selling AI-optimized chips to Chinese companies, it is still prohibited from selling its most advanced chips to that market.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSMC now earns a bulk of its revenue from producing advanced chips (7-nanometer and below), which are used heavily to handle high-performance computing workloads. The company is advancing its 2-nanometer (N2) process node toward volume production and recently highlighted its plans to start producing chips using its performance-enhanced N2P variant in 2026.\n\nTSMC is also working on its even more feature-dense and power-efficient A16 process node, with volume production scheduled for the second half of 2026.\nAdditionally, TSMC plans to scale its monthly Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS) advanced packaging capacity from current levels of 75,000 to 80,000 wafers to as high as 120,000 to 130,000 wafers by the end of 2026, directly addressing the major bottleneck constraining chip shipments.\n\nStory Continues\nYet the geopolitical risks faced by Taiwan cannot be ignored by TSMC investors.\nHence, I must conclude that Nvidia is better suited for long-term investors focused on upside potential, while TSMC may be a good pick for investors who would prefer a more resilient stock.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?

      "Content": "Nvidia Just Officially Bought $5 Billion Worth of Intel Stock. Should You Buy INTC Too?\n\nAditya Raghunath\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 9:58 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nTSM\n\nNVDA\n\nNvidia (NVDA) has completed its $5 billion equity investment in Intel (INTC), the semiconductor giant confirmed in a filing on Monday. The announcement finalizes a deal first announced in September that positions the world's most valuable company as a roughly 4% stakeholder in its struggling rival.\n\nThe AI chip leader purchased over 214.7 million Intel shares at $23.28 apiece in a private placement, a price that now sits 36% below Intel's recent trading levels, according to the filing.\nMore News from Barchart Micron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMicron Stock Stole the Show in 2025.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else.\nThe transaction, which received regulatory clearance from the Federal Trade Commission earlier this month, could serve as a major financial lifeline for Intel after years of missteps and capital-intensive manufacturing expansions that have drained its resources.\nThe companies announced they will collaborate on multiple generations of custom data center and PC products, including Nvidia-designed x86 CPUs for AI infrastructure and system-on-chips combining Intel CPU cores with Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets.\n\nHowever, neither chipmaker has committed to moving Nvidia's crown-jewel GPU production away from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) to Intel's contract manufacturing services.\nIs Intel Stock a Good Buy Right Now? Valued at a market cap of $175 billion, INTC stock has returned almost 90% in 2025. Despite strong demand for its legacy chip, Intel is wrestling with manufacturing bottlenecks. Intel is undershipping its 10 nm and 7 nm chips for the personal computer and server markets right now. These products still account for the bulk of Intel’s production volume.\n\nCFO John Pitzer acknowledged that supply constraints could peak in Q1 of 2026 and ease gradually over the next few months. However, it suggests that Intel is unlikely to meet demand even beyond Q1. The silver lining is that server shortages are actually worse than PC shortages, as servers carry better margins.\nMultiple factors are driving server demand for Intel:\nFirst, hyperscalers spent the last few years focused on AI infrastructure buildouts while delaying refreshes of their existing server fleets.\nSecond, these same companies are now severely power-constrained, and replacing a five-year-old server with a new one delivers 80 percent better power efficiency.\nThird, and most intriguing, the shift from large language model training to agentic AI appears to be putting unexpected demand on traditional computing infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the technology front, Intel's 18A node is advancing but remains a work in progress. The company shipped its first Panther Lake chip on schedule by year-end, though yields aren't in line with expectations.\nNew CEO Lip-Bu Tan has brought significant cultural changes since joining in March. The organization has been flattened from 11 or 12 management layers down to just five or six. Engineers now sit on the executive staff and are required to participate in customer conversations. The company has also implemented a return-to-office policy with employees back in the office four days per week.\n\nWhat Is the INTC Stock Price Target? Analysts tracking INTC stock forecast revenue to increase from $52.55 billion in 2025 to $74 billion in 2029. Investors are concerned about narrowing gross margins driven by early 18A ramp costs and pricing actions on newer products to manage tight supply. However, the company is projected to improve adjusted earnings per share from $0.34 in 2025 to $2.84 in 2030.\n\nAs Intel continues to invest in capital expenditures, its free cash outflow is expected to total $11 billion between 2025 and 2026. Notably, free cash flow is likely to improve from $640 million in 2027 to $4.32 billion in 2029. If INTC stock trades at 25x forward earnings, which is in line with its 10-year average, it could return 100% over the next three years.\nOut of the 42 analysts covering INTC stock, two recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” 33 recommend “Hold,” one recommends “Moderate Sell,” and five recommend “Strong Sell.”\nThe average INTC stock price target is $36.74, which is similar to the current price.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "This Could Derail Intel's Comeback in 2026\n\nTimothy Green, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:25 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nAMD\n\nTSM\n\nKey Points Intel has a strong PC roadmap for 2026, including Panther Lake and Nova Lake.\nBoth CPU families will use the cutting-edge Intel 18A manufacturing process.\nSoaring memory chip prices could force PC price hikes and limit Intel's comeback in the PC market.\n10 stocks we like better than Intel ›\nOne of the issues plaguing Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) over the past few years has been an erosion of its PC CPU market share. Past manufacturing delays forced the company to use aging process nodes while rival AMD tapped TSMC 's top-tier manufacturing technology. Intel later outsourced manufacturing for its Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake chips, but the latter was a mixed bag that rubbed reviewers and consumers the wrong way.\nAgainst this backdrop, Intel's share of the desktop and laptop CPU market has tumbled. Intel remains the market leader, but AMD controlled approximately one-third of the desktop CPU market and more than one-fifth of the laptop CPU market in the third quarter. A decade ago, this kind of progress from AMD would have been unthinkable.\n\nIn 2026, Intel could regain some of the lost market share. Panther Lake for laptops and Nova Lake for desktops look promising, and both will be built on the new Intel 18A process node. However, soaring memory chip prices will likely increase PC prices and potentially dampen demand.\nIntel's 2026 roadmap shows promise Panther Lake will be the first mass-produced chip to be manufactured using the Intel 18A process, and it is expected to begin shipping in volume in early 2026. Intel 18A moves Intel to a new type of transistor and introduces backside power delivery, a technology that can boost efficiency by moving power circuitry to the back of the chip. The Intel 18A process is the first in the industry to implement backside power delivery.\n\nNova Lake will come later in 2026 for desktops, succeeding the troubled Arrow Lake family. In the meantime, the company is rumored to be launching a refresh of Arrow Lake, although the core problems with Arrow Lake are likely to remain unresolved until Nova Lake arrives. While Nova Lake's specifications are still unclear, rumors suggest high core counts and large amounts of cache for some models, which could better compete with AMD's 3D V-Cache chips.\nLaunching a new architecture on a new process node is always a challenge, but if Panther Lake and Nova Lake deliver solid improvements in performance and efficiency, they could be big winners for Intel.\nMemory prices could be a major problem Unfortunately for Intel, its Panther Lake and Nova Lake launches coincide with a severe and escalating shortage of DRAM memory. AI data centers need both high-bandwidth memory and standard DRAM memory in copious quantities. Memory chip manufacturers have been shifting production to HBM chips while being cautious about expanding overall production, creating a shortage of DRAM chips.\n\nStory Continues\nPC prices are almost certain to rise in 2026 as OEMs grapple with rising component costs. Dell is reportedly raising commercial PC prices by 10% to 30% in response to the memory chip crisis, a move that will likely be followed by other OEMs. Businesses could slow down upgrade plans in response. On the consumer side, higher prices and configurations with less memory are likely to be the prevailing themes in 2026.\n\nBeyond the potential for higher prices to hurt overall demand for PCs, lower memory configurations could hurt Intel's AI PC push. Panther Lake laptops will feature greater AI processing power than their predecessors, but a lack of memory could hinder usability. Microsoft requires at least 16 GB of RAM for a laptop to be labeled a Copilot+ PC, for example, because AI applications require significant amounts of memory.\nSoaring memory chip prices put Intel in a tough spot. Even if Panther Lake and Nova Lake are home runs, delivering performance and efficiency that top AMD, high PC prices could spoil the party. AMD is also impacted, so Intel won't be at a relative disadvantage and could still win market share. However, the size of the market could temporarily shrink as businesses and consumers resist price increases.\n\nWith memory chip production unlikely to increase meaningfully anytime soon, and with the AI boom still going strong, Intel's PC comeback in 2026 may be weaker than it could have otherwise been.\nShould you buy stock in Intel right now?

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nTue, December 30, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nTSMWF\n\n^GSPC\n\nTSMC (TSM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this chip company have returned +4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, to which TSMC belongs, has gained 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nTSMC is expected to post earnings of $2.72 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.17 points to a change of +44.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.2 indicates a change of +20% from what TSMC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, TSMC is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of TSMC, the consensus sales estimate of $32.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +21.3%. The $121 billion and $146.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +34.3% and +20.8%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History TSMC reported revenues of $33.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +40.8%. EPS of $2.92 for the same period compares with $1.94 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.06%. The EPS surprise was +12.74%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTSMC is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about TSMC. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock I'd Buy on Every Dip and Never Sell\n\nScott Levine, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:52 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ASML\n\nTSM\n\nINTC\n\nKey Points Semiconductor makers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel rely on sophisticated equipment to produce chips at scale.\nA profound competitive advantage is a great sign that a company's stock may be worth purchasing.\nStrong free cash flows and low debt-to-equity ratios are green lights when I'm investigating potential stock buys.\n10 stocks we like better than ASML ›\n\nUnlike chefs, who can prepare savory meals without precisely measuring ingredients, pastry chefs require exactness when crafting their sweet treats. Just a little too much of one ingredient -- or not enough of another -- can be the difference between pastry perfection and dessert disaster.\nSimilarly, the companies that manufacture the sophisticated semiconductors capable of handling artificial intelligence (AI) applications also require meticulous levels of precision in order to sustain high-volume production of those chips. For this reason, ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is high on my buy list. The company plays a pivotal role in the semiconductor industry, and I've long recognized its stock as a compelling way to expand my AI industry exposure.\nI plan to open a position in the coming weeks, and once it's initiated, I intend to click the buy button on ASML stock again during any dips.\nASML provides a unique AI investment opportunity Designing cutting-edge semiconductors -- the wheelhouse of companies like Nvidia and AMD -- is no small feat, yet it means little unless foundries can produce those chips at scale. This is where ASML comes in.\nWhile ASML provides a variety of equipment, software, and services to enable the large-scale fabrication of microchips, the products that make it most appealing to investors are its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These machines use light at a 13.5-nanometer wavelength to print the most sophisticated chip designs on the market, making them indispensable tools for foundry operators like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel .\n\nASML is the only company capable of building EUV machines, giving it an unparalleled position in the chip industry and providing it with a robust competitive advantage over its rivals.\nKicking the tires on the company's financials provides even more reassurance It's hard to argue with the allure of ASML, as it has a technological monopoly in a niche that is vital to the tech sector. The company's fundamentals further illustrate why its stock will be worth holding for the long term as the AI industry develops.\nFor one, the company generates extremely strong cash flow. In 2024 and 2023, for example, ASML reported free cash flow of $7 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, according to Morningstar . Its results are even more impressive when stacked up against its semiconductor equipment peers, Lam Research and Applied Materials .\n\nStory Continues\nOver the past decade, ASML has consistently generated more free cash flow per share -- especially during the past two years as the AI industry has boomed.\nPair this with the fact that the company has a strong balance sheet with a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 0.14 as of its most recent financial report, and its sound financial health becomes even more apparent.\n\nForget looking to Santa, I'm gifting ASML to myself this year I was uninterested in waiting for shares of ASML to appear under the tree, so I've made a plan to buy the stock in the coming weeks to get some skin in the game, and then gradually build my position as dips occur. Should another company ever debut an EUV lithography system, I'll have to reevaluate my position. For the time being, though, I'm eager to broaden my AI sector exposure with ASML stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ASML right now? Before you buy stock in ASML, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ASML wasn’t one of them.

This comparison unpacks key differences in cost, performance, risk, and portfolio makeup to help long-term investors weigh which emerging markets ETF may appeal to their needs.\nSnapshot (cost & size) Metric\nEEM\nVWO\nIssuer\nIShares\nVanguard\nExpense ratio\n0.72%\n0.07%\n1-yr return (as of Dec. 18, 2025)\n26.8%\n19.0%\nDividend yield\n2.2%\n2.8%\nBeta\n0.99\n0.88\nAUM\n$20.5 billion\n$141.2 billion\n\nBeta measures price volatility relative to the S&P 500; beta is calculated from five-year weekly returns.

Its largest positions are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Tencent Holdings, and Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) , and the fund’s 20.8-year track record makes it one of the oldest in the space. No leverage, currency hedge, or ESG overlays are present.\n\nEEM is a bit more concentrated, holding 1,215 stocks with similar sector tilts: technology (27%), financial services (22%), and consumer cyclical (12%). Its portfolio is anchored by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Tencent Holdings, and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNL.F) , so the top holdings and sector exposures are closely aligned with VWO. Neither fund includes notable structural quirks.\nFor more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link .\nWhat this means for investors The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) and Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) offer similar exposure to emerging markets, considering the similarity in sector weighting and that their top two stocks are identical. However, performance will differ due to the differences in overall holdings.\n\nStory continues\nEEM includes stocks from South Korea, which is why Samsung is among its largest holdings, while VWO does not since the latter doesn't classify the country as an emerging market.\nConsequently, EEM's performance over the past year was significantly stronger than VWO's. Investors weighing which ETF to consider would have to decide if exposure to South Korean companies is important to them.\n\nOtherwise, VWO looks like the more compelling ETF. Its assets under management are much larger than EEM's, and this gives the ETF far greater liquidity. In addition, its substantially lower expense ratio means it's less costly for investors. VWO also offers a better dividend yield, adding to the gains investors can achieve with this ETF.\nGlossary Expense ratio: The annual fee, expressed as a percentage, that a fund charges to cover operating costs.\nDividend yield: The annual dividends paid by a fund, shown as a percentage of its current price.\nBeta: A measure of a fund’s volatility compared to the overall stock market, typically the S&P 500.\nAUM (Assets Under Management): The total market value of all assets managed by a fund.\nMax drawdown: The largest percentage drop from a fund’s peak value to its lowest point over a specific period.\nTotal return: The investment’s price change plus all dividends and distributions, assuming those payouts are reinvested.\nEmerging markets: Countries with developing economies and financial markets that are growing but not yet fully mature.\nSector tilt: When a fund has a higher allocation to certain industry sectors compared to a benchmark or the market.\nConcentration: The degree to which a fund’s assets are invested in a small number of holdings or sectors.\nLeverage: The use of borrowed money to increase potential investment returns, which also increases risk.\nCurrency hedge: A strategy to reduce the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on investment returns.\nESG overlays: Additional investment criteria that consider environmental, social, and governance factors when selecting securities.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "What Is the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Hold for the Next 10 Years?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 8:36 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nAVGO\n\nMU\n\nKey Points Chip designers such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom serve as the backbone of generative AI development.\nWhile chip designers steal the spotlight, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is playing a hugely important supporting role in the background.\nAs demand for AI chips and data centers accelerates, Taiwan Semi is poised for explosive long-term growth.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\n\nFor the last three years, investing in semiconductor stocks has proven to be a profitable decision given the critical role chips play in the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Companies such as Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices , Broadcom , and Micron Technology have been some of the biggest contributors to the semiconductor industry throughout the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nFlying under the radar is another chip company whose storyline seems muted compared to its peers. That's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , the pick-and-shovel specialist of the chip realm.\nLet's dive into Taiwan Semi's increasingly important role for the future of AI and assess why the stock looks like a no-brainer buying opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon.\nHow does Taiwan Semiconductor benefit from AI? Throughout the AI revolution, hyperscalers such as Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and OpenAI have collectively poured hundreds of billions of dollars into AI-related capital expenditures (capex) -- namely, chips and networking gear for data centers.\nOn the surface, this is great news for the likes of Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom. But underneath the surface, it's even better news for Taiwan Semi. Why is that?\n\nTSMC is the largest chip manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue. While Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom design the most-in demand GPUs and custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) on the planet, each of these giants relies heavily on Taiwan Semi's cutting-edge fabrication processes.\nIn other words, if Nvidia and its competitors represent the body of the car moving the AI narrative forward, TSMC holds the keys to the ignition.\nTSMC's growth is off the charts Over the last year, Taiwan Semi's revenue has been growing strongly thanks to ongoing demand for AI accelerators. What's interesting to point out is that the company's revenue trajectory is actually steepening. This is largely driven by rising demand for Nvidia's and AMD's next-generation Rubin and MI400 Series chips, as well as increasing investment in custom hardware from cloud infrastructure providers.\n\nStory Continues\nThe more subtle aspect from the financial picture above is Taiwan Semi's expanding profitability profile. Given its near-70% market share, TSMC is able to command enormous pricing power relative to competitors like Intel or Samsung .\nAgainst this backdrop, Taiwan Semi's gross margin is widening -- with excess cash flowing straight to the bottom line. The company is making the most of this new wave of capital by expanding its geographic footprint -- building additional foundries in Arizona, Germany, and Japan.\n\nIs Taiwan Semi stock a good buy right now? At the moment, TSMC boasts a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28.4 -- hovering near its highest level during the AI revolution. If you were to base your investment decision purely off of this metric, you may think Taiwan Semi is overvalued.\nSmart investors understand that TSMC's premium valuation could be warranted, though. McKinsey & Company is forecasting AI infrastructure to be a $7 trillion market through 2030 -- with the majority of spend allocated toward refining AI workloads.\nIn essence, building out AI-equipped data centers is expected to accelerate throughout the rest of the decade as training and inferencing models becomes more sophisticated and demanding. This is great news for TSMC as it paves the way for long-run visibility across the business.\n\nThe AI infrastructure chapter is still in its early innings. Over the course of the next several years, Taiwan Semi is positioned to benefit from the secular tailwind of rising investment in infrastructure both domestically and abroad.\nTaking this one step further, physical applications such as autonomous systems and robotics are yet to be deployed in a commercial sense. Looking beyond into the 2030s, these use cases are expected to drive additional trillions in economic value.\nShould they achieve some form of adoption and set the stage for the next wave of AI, Taiwan Semi has the potential to benefit immensely beyond where AI stands today -- building large language models (LLMs) and other software-based applications.\nWhen you consider the bigger picture and begin to think longer-term, TSMC's growth potential relative to its valuation looks compelling. So while the stock may not appear dirt cheap at first glance, I think there is ample room for meaningful valuation expansion over the course of the next decade -- making the stock a no-brainer buy right now in my eyes.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "These 4 Billionaires All Have 1 Genius AI Stock in Common, and It's Set to Skyrocket in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 4:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSM\n\nNVDA\n\nKey Points Taiwan Semiconductor is a broader way to play the AI buildout trend.\nData center capital expenditures are expected to rise through at least 2030.\nChip designers have one thing in common: they all turn to Taiwan Semiconductor.\n10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›\nLooking at what stocks billionaire hedge fund managers own can be a smart investment strategy. While blindly following their trades isn't a smart move because of information delay, seeing what stocks they all have in common may reveal some great insights to investors.\n\nThe reason for the information delay is due to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements. Any money manager with more than $100 million in assets must report end-of-quarter holdings to the SEC. Then, that information is made available to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . So, if you see that your favorite fund manager bought a position in a hot AI stock, they may have done it months ago.\nThe key is to find fund managers who don't make massive trades every quarter on a single position. Instead, they add or trim as necessary to manage their risk. One stock that popped up in multiple funds I follow is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) , also known as TSMC. It's a huge holding in many portfolios, and I think it's set to skyrocket in 2026 as artificial intelligence demand ramps up.\nTaiwan Semiconductor plays a key role in the AI realm The four billionaires who all own shares of Taiwan Semiconductor are:\nChase Coleman at Tiger Global Management (4% of portfolio)\nSteve Mandel at Lone Pine Capital (6.2% of portfolio)\nDavid Tepper at Appaloosa Management (4% of portfolio)\nDaniel Loeb at Third Point (3.7% of portfolio)\nClearly, these four billionaires are very bullish on Taiwan Semiconductor's prospects, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out why.\n\nIt can be difficult to determine whose computing units are the best at any given time. For most of the AI arms race, Nvidia and its leading graphics processing units (GPUs) have dominated this conversation. However, rising competition from Advanced Micro Devices and custom AI accelerators from Broadcom has made this analysis more difficult.\nBut all three of these companies have one thing in common: They get most of their chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. This places TSMC in the ultimate neutral position, as it is supplying chips to competitors. So, as long as there are massive data center buildouts ongoing to develop generative AI technologies, Taiwan Semiconductor will be in an excellent position.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia informed investors that it expects global data center capital expenditures to total $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030 -- a huge expansion from 2025's $600 billion. That's total capital expenditures, which is far broader than just computing. AMD offered a similar projection, estimating that computing will be a $1 trillion market opportunity by 2030.\n\nThis bodes well for one of the key providers of chips in the world, making it no surprise that these four billionaires own shares.\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a buy now? As mentioned above, the information we have on the ownership of Taiwan Semiconductor among the four billionaires is old information. All we know is that they owned shares on Sept. 30. Since then, TSMC's stock has basically been flat, up around 3%. This likely means they still own the shares, as there haven't been any huge drops.\nFurthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is reasonably valued heading into 2026.\nAt 23 times 2026 earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor isn't all that expensive compared to its peers. Factor in its critical position and monster growth that's expected to persist for several years after 2026, and Taiwan Semiconductor looks like one of the best buys in the market.\nI think investors should follow these four billionaires' lead and take a hefty position in Taiwan Semiconductor. It's a critical company, and with massive spending expected to occur over the next five years, it's well-positioned to be a huge winner and could skyrocket in 2026 as a result.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now? Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

Taiwan Semiconductor provides most chips to various computing providers, making it a great way to invest in the trend without having to determine who the ultimate winner will be.\n\nIt's also developing some innovative technology. Its 2nm (nanometer) chips are entering production right now, and consume 25% to 30% less power than the previous 3nm generation when configured to run at the same speed. Since energy availability is becoming a key concern in the AI buildout, this innovation is a welcome one.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is a top way to play the AI buildout, as data center construction is expected to accelerate in 2026 and beyond.\nAlphabet At the start of the year, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was an unpopular stock pick. There were questions surrounding the dominance of the Google Search engine, it was behind in generative AI technology, and was facing a court case that threatened to break up the company if it went the wrong way. All three of these questions were answered in 2025, and all of them were positive.\n\nThis allowed Alphabet to become one of the most successful investments of 2025, as its stock has risen more than 60% so far this year. So, if Alphabet did so well in 2025, why is it a great stock for 2026?\nAfter all of the questions surrounding Alphabet's stock disappeared, the market is free to value Alphabet's stock like the dominant business it is. Advertising revenue was strong in Q3, with its base Google Search engine revenue rising 15% year over year in Q3. Its cloud computing business is also thriving, with revenue rising 34% year over year.\nThis allows Alphabet to focus on being a winner in the AI revolution, and its latest Gemini model is one step closer to that reality. Alphabet is going to be a successful company in 2026, and its recent track record tells me that it's a great stock to own.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is on the opposite end of the performance spectrum. While Alphabet has soared, Amazon's stock has lagged behind the market, rising about 6%. However, a poor 2025 is setting the stage for a big comeback in 2026. Amazon's business is doing incredibly well, with revenue rising 13% in Q3.\n\nThe biggest sign of Amazon's potential is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division, accelerating its growth for the first time in years during Q3. AWS has much higher margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business, and accounts for 66% of operating profit while contributing just 18% of revenue. So, if AWS' growth is accelerating, it's a great sign for Amazon.\nAnother positive sign is Amazon's valuation. Part of the reason Amazon's stock didn't perform well in 2025 is that it was growing into the high valuation it held at the start of the year. It is now trading at a reasonable level (when valued using operating profits), and I think now is a great time to invest in Amazon's stock.\nAmazon is due for a comeback in 2026, and I think it's one of the best investments you can make now.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "5 Incredible Growth Stocks to Buy for 2026\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 1:20 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: SOFI\n\nMELI\n\nLMND\n\nTSM\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points SoFi, MercadoLibre, and Lemonade are disrupting traditional financial services with technology.\nOn is developing its brand globally and gaining a loyal following.\nTaiwan Semiconductor has huge tailwinds in AI development.\n10 stocks we like better than SoFi Technologies ›\nAs the year comes to a close, it's been another double-digit gain for the S&P 500 , which is up almost 18% in 2025. The index is up about 80% during the past three years alone, demonstrating why investing in the S&P 500 is such a compelling thesis.\n\nHowever, you can bring it up a notch by investing in top growth stocks in 2026. There's no way to know whether the market can keep climbing this year and next, but over time, it grows much more often than it contracts. SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) , MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) , On Holding (NYSE: ONON) , Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) , and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) can supercharge your portfolio this year, but more importantly, they all have incredible long-term opportunities.\n1. SoFi: Disruptive banking SoFi is a digital bank that's attracting new customers at a fast pace. Not only is it growing quickly, but revenue growth accelerated in the 2025 third quarter to 38% year over year. That's a phenomenal rate for any company, especially a bank, which is typically slow-growing as an industry.\nIt's a classic fintech company , combining traditional financial services with technology. These are the kinds of services that used to take up a lot of time and visits to bank branches that are now doable with the swipe of a finger. SoFi's niche is its simple-to-use app that's a game changer, and it's one-stop shop approach that makes total financial management available in one place.\n\nSoFi stock is up 79% this year (as of Dec. 26), and it could soar higher in 2026 and beyond.\n2. MercadoLibre: Tech powerhouse MercadoLibre is the leading e-commerce company in Latin America, holding its own against direct competition from Amazon and other global names. Its region is notably underpenetrated, giving it a long runway as it changes the retail narrative. It has also launched complementary fintech services that serve to create a diversified ecosystem of products. That gives it a dominant position and an edge in a growing market.\n\nIt's still in high-growth mode, with a 49% year-over-year sales increase (currency neutral) in the third quarter. It's balancing investments in its future with staying comfortably profitable, and it's constantly rolling out new features to attract customers and simplify the buying process. It has a huge growth runway for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory Continues\n3. On: The new name in premium activewear On is a fast-growing activewear brand that's gaining a loyal following. It sells premium products and competes with companies like Nike and Lululemon Athletica , and it's growing much faster than either of them. Its premium pricing leads to high gross margins, and its affluent consumer base is more resilient when under economic pressure.\n\nThe brand is still working its way around the world, developing brand awareness, and it's fairly small as compared with its peers. That gives it more room to expand as it builds its business, and it could skyrocket in 2026 and much longer.\n4. Lemonade: Insurance technology Lemonade is a disruptive insurance powerhouse, offering digital services and using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to offer a better product. It has been attracting customers at a rapid pace since launching, but its algorithms are finally working well enough to move toward profitability. From here, management envisions the model becoming extremely efficient and profitable as the company continues to increase revenue.\n\nAfter years of investor disappointment, Lemonade stock is up nearly 450% during the past three years. However, it's expecting to become profitable on an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) basis in 2026, and it could climb even higher.\n5. Taiwan Semiconductor: Underpinning AI development Nvidia and hyperscalers like Amazon and Alphabet may get the most attention for their developments in AI, but Taiwan Semiconductor plays a key role in making it happen. It manufactures the chips that are used for AI production, and it's the largest company of its kind. Since it makes chips for all kinds of applications, it's not limited by whatever the trend of the day is, and it can drive tech development in any area, giving it continued growth opportunities.\n\nHowever, for the sake of a 2026 discussion, it has potent tailwinds as hyperscalers increase AI spend and demand picks up for chips from many of its clients. Expect Taiwan Semi to enjoy more high gains in the coming year and longer.\nShould you buy stock in SoFi Technologies right now?
