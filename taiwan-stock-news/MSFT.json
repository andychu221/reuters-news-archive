      "Content": "BTIG Initiates ServiceNow (NOW) with Buy Rating on Expanding AI Platform\n\nVardah Gill\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:48 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: NOW\n\nMSFT\n\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE: NOW ) is included among the 12 Best Long Term US Stocks to Buy Now .\nPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on Unsplash\nOn December 17, BTIG initiated coverage of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with a Buy rating and a $1,000 price target.\nThe firm points to how far the platform has come since the launch of Now Assist two years ago. What started as an AI feature has grown into a broader system where humans and AI agents work side by side. ServiceNow now offers an AI Control Tower to handle oversight and governance, and it is working closely with Microsoft to run agent-based AI workflows across the entire enterprise. BTIG’s upside case assumes ServiceNow keeps operating above the Rule of 50. That includes revenue growth in the high teens and free cash flow growth in the mid-20% range.\n\nIn other news, Bloomberg reported that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is in advanced discussions to acquire cybersecurity startup Armis. The company was last valued at $6.1 billion, and the deal could reach around $7 billion, which would make it ServiceNow’s largest acquisition to date. The report cited people familiar with the talks, who said the discussions are private. The transaction could be announced as soon as this week, though it is not guaranteed to close. Neither Armis nor ServiceNow responded to a request for comment from CNBC.\nArmis focuses on securing and managing internet-connected devices, helping organizations protect against cyber risks. Just over a month ago, the company raised $435 million in new funding and said it plans to pursue an IPO over time.\n\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides a cloud-based platform that helps organizations automate and manage digital workflows across IT, HR, customer service, and other business functions.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Microsoft (MSFT) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) closed the most recent trading day at $483.84, moving +1.62% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.79%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.38%.\nThe stock of software maker has fallen by 2.26% in the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.85% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Microsoft in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $3.86, marking a 19.5% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $80.16 billion, up 15.12% from the year-ago period.\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $15.59 per share and a revenue of $325.15 billion, representing changes of +14.3% and +15.42%, respectively, from the prior year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Microsoft. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.19% higher. Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn terms of valuation, Microsoft is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 30.55. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 23.55 for its industry.\n\nWe can additionally observe that MSFT currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.81. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.82.\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 74, putting it in the top 30% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nTo follow MSFT in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Jefferies Says IonQ Stock Can Double Over the Next 12 Months. Should You Buy It Here?\n\nAditya Raghunath\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nJefferies just launched coverage of the quantum computing sector with a bullish call, sending IonQ (IONQ) shares surging. The firm slapped a $100 price target on IONQ stock, implying roughly 110% upside from current levels, while initiating with a “Buy” rating.\nIonQ develops trapped-ion quantum computers designed to solve complex problems across business, society, and scientific research. Founded on 25 years of academic research, the company uses ionized atoms to perform longer, more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors than competing quantum systems.\n\nMore News from Barchart Cathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock. Should You?\nIs Cathie Wood Jumping Ship on Tesla Stock?\nBroadcom Stock Is Up 120% in the Past Year. This Analyst Thinks It Is One of the Highest-Quality Stocks to Buy for the Next Year Too.\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nIonQ is the first quantum hardware provider integrated with all major cloud platforms, offering accessible quantum computing through partnerships with Amazon's (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, and Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google Cloud for applications in chemistry, medicine, finance, and logistics optimization.\nAnalyst Kevin Garrigan expects IonQ to benefit from powerful ecosystem tailwinds driving quantum computing adoption. The company's trapped-ion architecture differentiates in coherence, fidelity, and native all-to-all connectivity, technical advantages that matter as the technology matures.\nIonQ's roadmap targets fault-tolerant quantum computing with integrated 256 qubits by 2026, scaling to 10,000 physical qubits and 800 logical qubits in 2027, and ultimately 2 million physical qubits with 80,000 logical qubits by 2030.\n\nIs IONQ Stock a Good Buy Right Now? IonQ delivered a stunning third quarter, solidifying its position as the dominant force in quantum computing. It reported revenue of almost $40 million, beating its guidance by 37% and growing 222% year-over-year (YoY).\nThe Q3 results showcased IonQ's expanding quantum platform strategy, encompassing computing, networking, sensing, and cybersecurity capabilities that no competitor can match.\n\nIonQ's fifth-generation Tempo system achieved an algorithmic qubit score of 64, creating a computational space 36 quadrillion times larger than IBM's (IBM) leading commercial system. More significantly, the company demonstrated a world-record 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity, meaning IonQ has hit every key technical milestone needed for full fault tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\nIonQ's acquisition spree is proving transformative. The Oxford Ionics deal closed during the quarter, bringing Electronic Qubit Control technology that leverages standard semiconductor fabrication.\nThis matters enormously because IonQ can now manufacture quantum chips using mature 128-nanometer nodes at existing foundries rather than building custom infrastructure that would cost billions. The bill of materials for a 2-million-qubit machine comes in at under $30 million, much lower than competitors.\n\nVector Atomic's addition expands IonQ's total addressable market into quantum sensing for positioning, navigation, and timing applications critical to defense customers. With quantum key distribution capabilities from the ID Quantique acquisition, IonQ can now bid on massive Golden Dome-style infrastructure projects that require integrated quantum solutions.\nThe business is rapidly globalizing, with international revenue accounting for 30% of total sales, up from nearly zero a year ago. Government and enterprise partnerships validate commercial viability, while the company expands beyond pure compute into quantum networking and sensing applications.\nWhat Is the IONQ Stock Price Target? Guidance for full-year 2025 revenue increased to $106 million to $110 million, breaking historical seasonality patterns as fourth-quarter revenue is expected to exceed the third quarter.\nThe company's 256-qubit system launches in 2026, followed by a roadmap that reaches 80,000 logical qubits by 2030, compared with IBM's stated target of just 2,000 logical qubits by 2033.\n\nAnalysts tracking the quantum computing stock forecast revenue to increase from $108.5 million in 2025 to $746 million in 2029. Despite this significant top-line growth, IONQ is expected to remain unprofitable. Over the next four years, its free cash outflow is projected to surpass $1.2 billion.\nIonQ raised $2 billion in October at $93 per share, bringing the pro forma cash balance to $3.5 billion with zero debt. This war chest positions the company to continue aggressive investment in maintaining what management describes as a five-year technical lead over competitors.\nIONQ stock has been volatile, down about 40% from October highs alongside the broader quantum computing selloff. Yet Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish, with 75% of analysts recommending IonQ.\nOut of the 13 analysts covering IONQ stock, eight recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” and four recommend “Hold.” The average IONQ stock price target is $75.50, above the current price of $47.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

A $750 billion valuation would represent about a 50% increase from its reported $500 billion valuation in October.\nSeparate reports suggest OpenAI is also broadening its partnerships. The ChatGPT maker is said to be raising at least $10 billion from Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and exploring the use of Amazon's AI chips, signaling diversification beyond its close relationship with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ).\nThe push for fresh capital comes as AI infrastructure costs keep rising, even as OpenAI generates billions in revenue.

According to purchase orders reviewed by Bloomberg, the company has sold more than 700,000 ChatGPT licenses to around 35 public universities, giving students and faculty broad access to the tool. Usage data from 20 campuses shows ChatGPT was called more than 14 million times in September, with average users turning to it 176 times that month for writing, research, and data analysis. While private university data is not publicly disclosed, OpenAI says it has sold well over one million licenses globally to colleges, suggesting overall penetration could be meaningfully higher.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with ARES.\nIs NFLX fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nPricing dynamics appear to be central to this momentum, especially when compared with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ). Universities reviewed by Bloomberg are paying a few dollars per user per month for bulk ChatGPT access, a sharp discount to the $20 per month typically charged to smaller educational users and far below corporate pricing. By contrast, Microsoft's Copilot has often been quoted at around $30 per user per month at many campuses, prompting some schools to limit licenses largely to faculty, though Microsoft has since announced a reduced academic price of about $18 per month. At California State University, administrators evaluated multiple tools and selected ChatGPT as the cheapest and most familiar option, agreeing to pay OpenAI $15 million per year to cover roughly 500,000 students and staff. Even at schools deeply embedded in Microsoft software, internal documents suggest ChatGPT usage can exceed Copilot, with Google's Gemini sometimes also seeing stronger engagement.\n\nCompetition for the education market remains active and unsettled. Google is offering its Gemini Pro assistant free for a year to college students and has promoted adoption across universities and large school districts, while Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) continues to use education discounts to cultivate long-term loyalty. Policymakers are also stepping in, with the Trump administration recently announcing new federal grant priorities, including a $50 million pool aimed at expanding AI access in higher education. At the same time, concerns about educational impact persist. Netflix ( NASDAQ:NFLX ) Chairman Reed Hastings has donated $50 million to Bowdoin College to study how AI affects teaching and learning, reflecting unease that institutions may be moving quickly to adopt AI tools without clear evidence of improved outcomes. How OpenAI's early campus lead ultimately translates into durable preference among future workers may depend on how rivals adjust pricing, access, and integration in the years ahead.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Best AI ETF Picks for 2026\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Quantum computing is an exciting theme, but one that's going to take some time to play out.\nInvestors should consider a broad spectrum of names beyond just the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nThe three ETFs below offer a range of options for investors to gain exposure to the AI sector.\n10 stocks we like better than Defiance Quantum ETF ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is already well on its way to being the biggest technological revolution since the internet -- and it's still in the early innings.\nWhile names such as Nvidia , Microsoft , OpenAI , and Alphabet have emerged as the \"faces\" of AI, there are plenty of potential winners throughout the sector. Infrastructure builders, enterprise software creators, application developers, and cloud providers all play an integral part to the ecosystem. AI is far more than just semiconductor manufacturers.\nThat's why when it comes to investing in AI, it may be better to just buy the theme instead of trying to pick individual winners. Some of the biggest returns so far have been delivered by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. But stretched valuations, evidence of slowing momentum, and questions surrounding whether all the AI development spending will be worth it are beginning to plague some companies.\nAn ETF that can maintain exposure to some of those megacap names but look beyond them for additional opportunities may be the way to play it in 2026. Here are the three artificial intelligence ETFs that I'm favoring as we head into the new year.\n1. Defiance Quantum ETF If you're interested in true futuristic tech, quantum computing is probably for you. If artificial intelligence is the next revolution, quantum is the rocket that could really propel it to the next level.\nQuantum computing involves developing the technology for processing and calculating at speeds far beyond what traditional computers can do today. It has potential applications in technology, medicine, energy, finance, scientific discovery, and more.\n\nThe Defiance Quantum ETF (NASDAQ: QTUM) invests in companies at the forefront of quantum development. Top holdings right now include Tower Semiconductor , Rigetti Computing , Teradyne , Coherent , and Micron Technology .\nThe only Magnificent Seven name among the top 10 holdings is Alphabet, and it only comes in at No. 10, with a weight of 1.8%. So there's good diversification here relative to the broader tech sector and the equity market in general.\nQuantum is a little more niche and a lot more appropriate for a long-term holding than traditional AI stocks. It may be years before quantum becomes anything close to having mainstream applications, so it should be considered an investment in potential more than concrete current results.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF The Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AIQ) looks more like a traditional big tech ETF, but it's careful to include companies of all sizes and from all around the world. In that way, it's designed to be a more inclusive and comprehensive take on AI investing.\nThe fund's index starts by grouping companies in two categories:\n\nAI developers: Includes product and services developers and users, as well as companies that offer AI solutions as a service to customers.\nAI and big data analytics: Semiconductor, storage, and/or hardware manufacturers, as well as quantum computing developers.\nA minimum \"exposure score\" is required for inclusion. Qualifying components are weighted by market cap.\nAIQ is a nice middle ground between big and small companies, although it definitely tilts toward large caps. The AI exposure requirement is a nice way to build the portfolio and ensure that the fund is more of a pure AI play than just a generic megacap tech fund.\n3. Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) describes itself as the world's first generative AI ETF. It's unique in that it's the only actively managed fund among the three, which is advantageous in such a rapidly evolving space. But it also leans more toward the megacap names.\n\nTop holdings currently include Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms , and Palantir . Amazon , Broadcom , and Advanced Micro Devices also reside in the top 10, so there's very much a Nasdaq-100 index feel to this fund.\nIf you're looking for a straightforward, more \"conservative\" way to invest in AI, CHAT might not be a bad choice. You get the heavy large-cap exposure without a lot of the risk that comes from investing in newer or emerging names.\nShould you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF right now? Before you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Defiance Quantum ETF wasn’t one of them.

With the addition of support for VMware ESXi hypervisors, Windows, Linux and macOS environments, Arms Cyber becomes the first software vendor to offer a unified ransomware defense from a single platform.\n\nThe launch of Arms Cyber’s cross-hypervisor capabilities comes as ransomware operators increasingly target virtualization infrastructure to maximize impact. According to Microsoft, incidents targeting ESXi hypervisors have more than doubled over the past three years, with threat actors recognizing that a single compromised hypervisor can encrypt dozens of virtual machines simultaneously, paralyzing entire enterprises with devastating efficiency. For example, in April, the DragonForce ransomware attack targeting major UK retailers encrypted VMware ESXi hypervisors at Marks & Spencer, halting online sales for over 46 days and resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in profit losses and market value.\nRansomware Meets Its Match with Cross-Hypervisor Support\n\nArms Cyber takes a unique approach to solving this problem. Upon initial access, attackers using LOTL techniques establish patterns that deviate from normal operating procedures. Arms Cyber’s zero trust policies build off these deviation requirements to reinforce more effective prevention. Intruders also rely on reliable information about their target, and static environments offer an ideal landscape for gathering such data. Integrating Arms Cyber’s anti-ransomware platform at various layers introduces a level of diversity and dynamism, making it nearly impossible for attackers to gain the actionable intelligence they need about their target.\nWith the addition of support for VMware, Windows, Linux and macOS environments, Arms Cyber is securing the virtualization layer where attacks often hide. The new release hardens remote access with multi-factor authentication, blocks malicious executables with application filtering and process controls, and enforces network and file access lockdowns across the hypervisor environment. Decoy files provide early detection, while AI-powered response halts attacks with over 98% efficacy, automates file rollback, and removes attacker persistence. The platform deploys easily on VMware ESXi, Nutanix, XenServer, Citrix Hypervisor, Proxmox, RHEV, and KVM, requires no kernel modifications, and runs with a minimal footprint and performance impact.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout Arms Cyber\nArms Cyber delivers a revolutionary approach to defeat attacks others miss through a three-part strategy: Conceal, Deceive, and Restore — powered by stealth. By adding stealth to an organization’s existing security posture, we keep critical data invisible to attackers, detect threats before they cause serious damage, and enable rapid recovery without compromise. The outcome: no ransom payouts, no public breaches, no costly downtime.\nCONTACT: Kevin Wolf TGPR kevin@tgprllc.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: MSFT ) co-founder, Bill Gates ‘ massive wealth, and what it could have been, had he not conformed to conventional wealth planning norms.\nBill Gates Could Have Been ‘World’s First Trillionaire’ On Wednesday, in a post on X, investor Michael Arouet highlighted the current top 10 richest people in the world, a list that no longer includes the Microsoft co-founder but does feature former CEO Steve Ballmer at No. 8, with an estimated net worth of $166 billion.\nThis comes after being ranked as the world’s wealthiest person by Forbes magazine for 18 of the 24 years between 1995 and 2017.\n\nDon't Miss:\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n$100k+ in investable assets?

(NYSE: BRK ) (NYSE: BRK ) CEO, Warren Buffett , who asked him to diversify his holdings.\nAccording to Arouet, if Gates hadn’t listened to Buffett, he would now be “the world's first trillionaire, worth twice as much as Elon.”\nAs Microsoft shares continue to soar, and its market capitalization is now at $3.6 trillion, Gates’ net worth would have stood at a staggering $1.5 trillion if he had retained all of his shares in the company and hadn’t embarked on the massive philanthropic journey with his ex-wife, Melinda Gates .\nTo be fair, it's difficult to fault Buffett for that advice.

      "Content": "How will the stock market perform in 2026? Wall Street pros weigh in.\n\nMary Cunningham\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.\nThe S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17— a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.\nThe key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an AI bubble percolate?\n\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"\nOther forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.\nWhat will drive stocks in 2026?\nSeveral catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.\n\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"\nThe AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.\nAnother area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers .\n\nStory Continues\nGrowth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.\n\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.\n\nAdam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.\nStill, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.\n\nIs my money safe?\nThe biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.\nAI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with earnings growth from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.\n\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.\nAmid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.\n\nIn its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.\nCrisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped . The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.\n\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"\nStill, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.\n\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.\nWhat to expect from Trump's address to the nation\nMore details emerge about Rob Reiner and wife Michele's killings\nNew surveillance video shows Nick Reiner before his arrest\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Microsoft Looks Like a “Table Pounder” After Dipping on AI Worries\n\nJoey Frenette\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nQuick Read Microsoft stock is down over 12% from recent highs amid AI spending concerns and competition from Google’s Gemini 3.0.\nThe company denied reports of reduced AI sales quotas following an article from The Information.\nMicrosoft has its own AI team led by Mustafa Suleyman and can reduce OpenAI dependence through Azure and its MAI model.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIf you've been waiting for an opportunity to pick up shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on the cheap amid broad AI and tech jitters, here's your chance. The stock has been beaten down in recent months, now off more than 12% from its recent all-time highs. And while the still seemingly frothy 33.89 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple doesn't seem to suggest Microsoft shares are a \"table pounder,\" I do think that the premier hyperscaler remains one of the best bets of the Magnificent Seven.\nOf course, its close ties to OpenAI used to be a positive. Nowadays, it's a negative, with ChatGPT losing a bit of ground in the AI race to the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), which has seemingly caught up with the release of its well-received Gemini 3.0 model.\n\nBut just because Google Gemini and the hardware running behind the scenes (Google TPUs) are having their moment, it does not mean we should start treating OpenAI as a laggard. Is the AI innovator behind ChatGPT a bit heavy on the debt, with more than a handful of circular deals?\nAI spending fears are weighing on the hyperscalers, Microsoft included Sure, but just because we've got reminders of the internet bubble and dot-com bust does not mean we're in for an exact repeat. Of course, heavy debt loads and extreme spending might be a concern for many. And circular dealmaking in the AI scene makes things a tad trickier and perhaps scarier for those with AI bubble fears.\n\nHowever, I think the big question is whether or not the AI efforts are going to pay off. If they do, leverage might work out heavily in the AI titan's favor in a big-time way. Of course, it's hard to tell how the AI frenzy ends, when it will end, and if the pain will be as bad as the dot-com bust. Either way, I think investors might wish to treat Microsoft as more than just an OpenAI proxy.\nAt the end of the day, Microsoft has been making its own investments to lessen its dependence on ChatGPT. Even if a worst-case scenario happens and OpenAI runs into a bit of financial trouble at some point down the road while giving up more ground to rival AI models, Microsoft can go its own way.\n\nStory Continues\nOpenAI aside, Microsoft has plenty of its own AI firepower Azure is the star of the show, and Microsoft can swap out the model running behind the scenes with another one, including its own (think the MAI model). With a powerful, arguably one of the most powerful, AI teams in the world, headed by a genius in Mustafa Suleyman, I'd argue that Microsoft's own AI dream team is worth the premium price tag.\n\nEither way, Microsoft has more than one racer in the AI race, and that improves the enterprise software behemoth's chances of having a winner on the road to AGI (artificial general intelligence).\nEither way, I think far too many investors are doubting OpenAI. But with the release of GPT-5.2, it's clear that OpenAI is a hungry company that's willing to do whatever it takes to keep that AI ball rolling. If anything, I'd argue that Gemini 3.0 and the \"code red\" it gave OpenAI is a good thing. It might be the nudge the firm needs to sprint that much faster.\nIn any case, I continue to view OpenAI as a massive positive for Microsoft that the market will appreciate again, perhaps in due time, or after the release of GPT-6, which one has to think will be smoother and far more impressive than the launch of GPT-5.\n\nWhat about jitters over that report on lower AI sales quotas? Finally, there's renewed anxiety that Microsoft's AI sales will miss the mark following a report from The Information that some divisions reduced their sales growth quotas.\nThe company has since denied the report, but, nevertheless, it seems like the investor unease has stuck around. If a future quarter proves sales jitters are unwarranted, perhaps Microsoft stock is unfairly sold off right here. In any case, I think 2026 could be a huge year for AI monetization, and few firms, I think, are better prepared than Microsoft.\n\nWhether we're talking about the OpenAI worries, broad bubble fears, or The Information report, I think there's too much negativity in Microsoft stock right here. And that might make its stock one of the bigger \"table pounders\" for the new year.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms.\nMicrosoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) lost 0.03% over the past five trading sessions after losing 0.27% the five prior. That brings MSFT's year-to-date gain to 13.75%, including a more than 3r4% gain since its year-to-date low on April 8.\nWhen the Magnificent Seven member reported FY 2026 Q1 earnings on Oct. 29, shares fell despite beating on EPS and revenue. The company announced earnings of $3.72 per share versus analysts' expectations of $3.67, and quarterly revenue of $77.67 billion versus analysts' expectations of $75.33 billion.\nOn Oct. 1, the company announced that it was increasing its Xbox Game Pass subscription by 50%. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft saw more than 8% of revenue derived from its gaming segment, which now boasts 50 million monthly active subscribers and nearly $5 billion in YoY revenue.\n\nMicrosoft's decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth.\nWhy Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) AWS.\nIn June, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 39% in FY25 Q4, driven by AI services.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect the company's capex to remain elevated to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth.\n\nTariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year.\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft's AI and cloud momentum.\n\nMicrosoft As a Stock Broadly, 34 Wall Street analysts' remain bullish, with 32 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a \"Buy\" rating, two assigning it a \"Hold\" rating and none assigning it a \"Sell\" rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating. Wall Street's price targets cover a significant range, spanning $500 per share on the low end to $700 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $632.22, which represents 32.78% potential upside from today's share price.\nInstitutional ownership currently stands at 73.74%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\n%Change From Current Price\nLow\n$500\n5.01%\nMedian\n$632.22\n32.17%\nHigh\n$700\n47.02%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s strong Azure revenue growth positions it for cloud and AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger.\n\n24/7 Wall St. ’s year-end price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying upside potential of 18.38% from the stock's current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and FY26 Q1 revenue guidance, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

While expenditure hurt near-term optimism, cloud revenue grew strongly. Azure revenue increased 28% year over year, indicating sustained demand for cloud and AI services.\nMicrosoft also revealed a 50% rise in commercial outstanding performance commitments to approximately $400 billion. Rising capital intensity is mitigated by the expanding backlog, which increases revenue visibility.\nThe firm generates substantial cash flow from its cloud computing, corporate software, productivity tools, and gaming business strategy. Microsoft's balance sheet strength is an advantage as companies expand in AI, investors say.\nTechnical support at recent lows suggests modest downside danger, say market participants.

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided. The report also discusses market trends, drivers of the leading Cloud service providers' capex growth during the quarter, and the outlook for the next year.

      "Content": "Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.: Why the Mag 7 needs to 'recalibrate'\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is concentrated primarily in the top ten technology stocks, according to Barclays.\nPNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati, Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré , and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss the market's concentration in tech and whether it's time for investors to start selling the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat I mentioned at the top about how much concentration risk there is in the S&P 500. What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
