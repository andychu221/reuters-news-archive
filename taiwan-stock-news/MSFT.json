      "Content": "CEO Satya Nadella Is Doubling Down on AI at Microsoft. Does That Make MSFT Stock a Buy Here?\n\nSubhasree Kar\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 7:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nIn a bold move that is reshaping the future of one of the world’s most valuable companies, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella is doubling down on artificial intelligence (AI), betting that the next era of tech dominance will be won by those who build the platforms, infrastructure, and cloud services that power AI at scale. From investing tens of billions of dollars in hyperscale AI data centers and strategic partnerships to embedding AI across core products, Nadella has signaled that AI is no longer just one of Microsoft’s growth vectors; it’s the company’s central strategic thrust.\n\nSatya Nadella has become deeply hands-on with the company’s AI push, actively engaging with top engineers and closely reviewing product performance. He now runs intensive weekly meetings, issues direct product mandates, and has shifted focus away from other executive duties to act as Microsoft’s most influential product leader.\nMore News from Barchart Super Micro Computer Stock Tumbles, But Investors are Piling into Its Call Options - Time to Buy SMCI?\nA $61 Billion Reason to Buy Amazon Stock for 2026\nRKLB Stock Bullish Diagonal Trade Targets a Price of $85 by January 16th\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nAmid rising competitive and financial pressure in AI, Nadella is also accelerating talent recruitment, personally courting elite researchers from OpenAI and Google DeepMind, signaling that he views this moment as pivotal for Microsoft’s long-term success.\nWhile MSFT is trading near record valuations, does Nadella’s AI bet make Microsoft stock a buy today?\nAbout Microsoft Stock Headquartered in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft Corporation is a global technology leader known for its expansive portfolio that spans software, cloud computing, AI, gaming, and enterprise solutions. Microsoft has evolved from a dominant operating system provider into a powerhouse across multiple tech verticals. The company boasts a market cap of approximately $3.6 trillion, reflecting its heavyweight status.\n\nMicrosoft’s stock price performance over the recent period reflects both the company’s underlying growth momentum and broader market dynamics. Owing to robust cloud revenue and early leadership in AI, MSFT shares climbed to record levels in 2025, hitting a 52-week high of $555.45, reached on July 31, underscoring robust investor confidence in its strategic direction.\nHowever, Microsoft’s performance has not been a straight line upward. Periods of consolidation and pullbacks have emerged as investors reacted to shifts in macroeconomic conditions, and the broad technology sector, which has periodically weighed on high-growth names. The stock is down 13.8% from the high reached in July.\n\nStory Continues\nDespite the pullback, the stock has delivered returns of 15.8% year-to-date (YTD) and 11% over the past year. The overall optimism stems from expectations that the company’s massive investments in cloud capacity and AI tools like Copilot and Azure AI will translate into accelerated revenue growth in future periods.\nMicrosoft’s valuation has commanded a premium, with analyst price targets pointing to continued optimism about future earnings power. It is currently trading at 30.58 times forward earnings, higher than many of its industry peers.\nSolid Q1 Performance Microsoft reported its fiscal first quarter 2026 results on Oct. 29, after the market closed. In this quarter, the company delivered $77.7 billion in revenue, representing an 18% year-over-year (YOY) increase, comfortably above analysts’ expectations.\nTotal operating income also showed robust growth, climbing 24% YOY, while non-GAAP EPS rose 23% to $4.13, underscoring continued margin strength even as Microsoft scales its AI and cloud infrastructure and beating the consensus estimate.\n\nCloud revenue played a leading role, with the Microsoft Cloud segment up 26% YOY to $49.1 billion, and Azure and other cloud services growing an impressive 40%, highlighting strong ongoing demand for AI-enabled enterprise services. Commercial remaining performance obligations jumped 51% to $392 billion, signaling heightened multi-year customer commitments.\nHowever, investors were reminded that substantial capital expenditures of $34.9 billion in Q1 are being deployed to expand AI capacity and data-center footprint, a factor that tempered the stock’s immediate reaction despite the earnings beat. The stock declined 2.9% on Oct. 30.\nManagement outlined expectations for second quarter FY2026 revenue of between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, implying continued double-digit growth, and maintained that demand for cloud and AI products would remain solid.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic as they predict EPS to be around $15.86 for fiscal 2026, up 16.3% YOY, and surge another 15.6% annually to $18.33 in fiscal 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Microsoft Stock? On Dec. 22, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reaffirmed his “Outperform” rating on Microsoft and maintained his $625 price target, signaling continued confidence in the stock’s upside and long-term growth outlook.\nAlso, DA Davidson reaffirmed a “Buy” rating on Microsoft with a $650 price target. The firm continues to view Microsoft as its top mega-cap pick, citing durable financial strength, and confidence in its long-term AI positioning.\n\nOverall, MSFT has a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, 39 advise a “Strong Buy,” five suggest a “Moderate Buy,” and the remaining four analysts are on the sidelines, giving it a “Hold” rating.\nThe average analyst price target for MSFT is $629.23, indicating a potential upside of 29.1%. Meanwhile, the street-high target price of $700 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 43.4%.\nOn the date of publication, Subhasree Kar did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nJordan Rosenfeld\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is not just infiltrating everyday lives; it has been the driving force behind stock market gains for the past two years. From chipmakers to software, anything tied to AI has surged. But investors are starting to wonder what happens if the momentum slows and the market decides AI valuations have gone too far. While no one can predict the future, I asked ChatGPT to look more deeply into the history of stock market bubbles and what might happen if the AI bubble were to burst.\n\nHere are its predictions.\nA Sharp Repricing of AI Stocks A correction in AI stocks would not just be another bad day for tech, ChatGPT warned. Because a handful of companies, including Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, now make up such a large percentage of the S&P 500, their movements shape the entire market.\nIf the market decides these large AI players are overvalued, those big company stocks will be the first to see a rapid decline as well as any company heavily tied to AI infrastructure, ChatGPT said.\n\nBecause these companies now make up a huge share of the market, a correction in even a handful of them could lead to a fall in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. This could lead to an environment similar to the dot-com bubble burst of the early 2000s.\nLearn More: I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Middle Class\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nA Broader Market Correction If the AI market trend reverses, the entire stock market index would likely follow, ChatGPT said. We could be looking at a broad correction of 10% to 20% if sentiment turns and investors begin to question AI revenue projections.\nNot all sectors would be hit equally, however. What tends to happen during sector slowdowns is that investors rotate their money into other areas like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples, ChatGPT noted. That means companies with steady earnings and predictable cash flows tend to look attractive. Thus, investors with diversified portfolios would be less affected than those concentrated in a single theme.\n\nStartup Valuations Could Cool Fast The ripple effects of an AI market correction would also have an impact on startups. Venture funding has been pouring into AI startups with the assumption that adoption will keep accelerating, ChatGPT said. If the market “gets skittish,” these valuations could fall as quickly as public tech stocks. That means less hiring, more consolidation and a good chance that many AI startups might fail.\n\nStory Continues\nLarger companies with strong balance sheets would likely scoop up talent or intellectual property, however, again similar to what happened after the dot-com bust. For workers and entrepreneurs, this could hit hard.\nWill an Economic Crisis Be Coming? The good news for investors is that a complete collapse similar to 2000 or 2008 is much less likely. Many AI companies today generate revenue that’s grounded in other profitable business products or services outside of AI. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon have the funds and the services to withstand a downturn . In the dot-com era, many companies going public had no profits or even customers. ChatGPT said “the fundamentals today are stronger.”\n\nHow Likely Is an AI Bubble To Burst? While an economic crisis is not likely coming, a sharp correction in AI stocks is more likely than not, ChatGPT said. It pointed out that “high-growth sectors tend to overshoot,” and the enthusiasm around AI has created valuations that may be more speculative than accurate in certain areas. A moderate pullback of 15% to 30% in leading AI names would not be surprising.\n\nIt did say that a complete bubble collapse is less likely, however. AI already has real commercial value, and early gains are showing up across industries. Just like the early days of the smartphone, there may be volatility, but the long-term trajectory remains positive.\nWhat Investors Should Focus On Now Everyday investors should expect volatility. The smartest bet is to keep a diversified portfolio , balanced allocation and long-term time horizon to have the best protections.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n10 Kirkland Products Costco Quietly Raised Prices on -- and Where To Buy Instead\n5 Reliable Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Winter 2025\n9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Dan Ives Loves This Under-the-Radar AI Stock for 2026\n\nNauman Khan\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nWhen investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, individuals tend to focus on the large, mega-cap stocks that are all the rage, yet the next wave of AI may more comfortably benefit smaller infrastructure businesses. As capital shifts from model development to deployment, people are demanding more cloud capacity, superior compute power, and AI-ready data centers, making the demand hot.\n\nOne quietly notable name that has been catching Wall Street's eye is Nebius (NBIS). Wedbush analyst Dan Ives just listed NBIS as his top AI infrastructure pick for 2026, arguing the company’s positioning and tech make it a likely acquisition target for a hyperscaler such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), or Amazon (AMZN).\nMore News from Barchart Super Micro Computer Stock Tumbles, But Investors are Piling into Its Call Options - Time to Buy SMCI?\nA $61 Billion Reason to Buy Amazon Stock for 2026\nRKLB Stock Bullish Diagonal Trade Targets a Price of $85 by January 16th\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nFor investors looking beyond the obvious AI leaders, here’s a closer look at why NBIS is drawing bullish attention heading into 2026.\nAbout NBIS Stock Based in Amsterdam, Nebius provides full-stack cloud and GPU-accelerated AI infrastructure across Europe and North America. It builds sustainable data centers and rents AI‑optimized compute clusters with liquid cooling and high‑power GPUs to hyperscalers and enterprises. The company emerged from a restructuring of the former Yandex infrastructure business and now combines its core AI cloud service with subsidiaries in autonomous vehicles and education technology.\n\nValued at around $23 billion by market cap, NBIS stock has been stellar this year. After languishing post-restructuring, the shares rallied over the summer, in part when Nvidia (NVDA) disclosed a stake in the company, peaking above $140 by October. A surge in new contracts with tech giants, such as Microsoft and Meta (META), further fueled investor enthusiasm. Until now, Nebius has gained roughly 225% year-to-date (YTD), despite a pullback from the recent high.\nThat performance comes with clear trade-offs. Nebius now trades at valuation levels that leave little room for error. Its trailing price-to-sales multiple sits in the mid-50s, far above the sector median, which trades closer to 4x, and its own 5-year historical average, which sits at 24x.\nIn short, the market is pricing Nebius as a future cornerstone of AI infrastructure. That may prove correct, but it also means any slowdown in contract growth, pricing pressure, or capital-spending misstep could weigh heavily on the stock. At today’s levels, execution matters as much as vision.\n\nStory Continues\nImpact of Ives’ Acquisition Thesis Dan Ives’s endorsement, calling Nebius “ripe” for a 2026 acquisition by a hyperscaler, gave the stock a short-term boost. The day his comments were publicized, NBIS spiked about 14% following the news. Investors interpreted it as validation of Nebius’s strategic value. Ives specifically noted that among AI “neocloud” firms, Nebius is the most likely buyout candidate, which fueled positive sentiment.\n\nFor the company, this means fresh investor interest and higher trading volume, though it’s too early to say if any deal is imminent. In the near term, the news underscores Nebius’s industry stature; if true, a 2026 deal could be transformative. But even absent an actual acquisition, the hype helps spotlight Nebius’s core business and contracts, potentially improving access to capital.\nNebius Delivered Solid Revenue Yet Widened Losses Nebius delivered a strong quarter in Q3 2025, posting revenue of $146.1 million, up 355% year-over-year (YoY), as demand for AI infrastructure surged and large new contracts came online. This growth was largely driven by strong uptake across its core AI infrastructure business, which now accounts for the vast majority of results.\n\nProfitability, however, remains a work in progress. Nebius reported a GAAP net loss of $119.6 million, wider than a year earlier, reflecting aggressive expansion and rising depreciation tied to new data center capacity. But there was a bright spot below the surface. Adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed sharply to $5.2 million, a significant improvement from nearly $46 million last year, as higher revenue began to offset operating expenses.\nOn the other side, spending ramped up sharply as the company accelerated its buildout. Operating cash burn rose to $80.6 million, while capital expenditures jumped to nearly $1.0 billion in the quarter, underscoring how capital-intensive AI infrastructure has become. Even so, Nebius ended the period with a formidable $4.8 billion cash balance, supported by recent equity and debt raises, giving it ample firepower to execute its growth plans.\n\nLooking ahead, management remains aggressive. Nebius is targeting an annualized revenue run rate of $750 million to $1 billion by the end of 2025 and plans to scale connected power capacity to 800 to 1,000 megawatts by 2026, with even more capacity already under contract.\nCEO Arkady Volozh has said the company has effectively sold out its existing capacity, with future capacity already pre-committed. While losses are expected to persist in the near term, the strategy is clear: scale first, optimize later.\nRecent Developments Since the quarter's close, Nebius has continued to make headlines. On Dec. 17, it launched Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 featuring Nvidia’s new Blackwell ultra-power GPUs. The company said it is now “ the first cloud in Europe to operate ” these cutting-edge Nvidia GB300 and HGX B300 systems in production, a technical milestone for customers.\n\nNebius also highlighted its $3 billion AI infrastructure agreement with Meta (announced in September) as a revenue backlog boost. These announcements were viewed positively as further proof of Nebius’s scale and partnerships.\nAnalyst's Perspective on NBIS Stock Wall Street remains broadly positive on NBIS stock, though analysts are clear about the risks. Goldman Sachs reiterated a “Buy” rating in November 2025 and raised its 12-month price target to $155, citing accelerating demand for AI infrastructure and improving visibility on large-scale contracts.\nSimilarly, D.A. Davidson also maintained a “Buy” with a $150 target, while CICC initiated coverage at $143, pointing to Nebius’ growing role in global AI compute buildouts.\n\nTaken together, on average, the rating given by analysts is “Moderate Buy,” and the broader consensus sits at about $150, which implies roughly 70% upside potential, which shows analysts' confidence in Nebius’ growth trajectory rather than near-term profitability.\nHowever, that optimism comes with caveats. Analysts consistently highlight Nebius’ rapid revenue growth and ability to secure large enterprise deals, but many also flag valuation as demanding. The investment case assumes smooth execution, disciplined capital spending, and sustained customer demand. Any stumble could weigh heavily on NBIS stock.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "This Dividend-Yielding Tech Stock Looks a ‘Compelling Buy’ for 2026 After 2 Years of Underperformance\n\nMohit Oberoi\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:30 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nWith year-to-date (YTD) gains of just about 15%, Microsoft (MSFT) is underperforming both the broad-based S&P 500 Index ($SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX). The Satya Nadella-led company underperformed last year as well, and its gains of 12% in 2024 paled in comparison to its tech peers as well as the broader markets.\nIncidentally, the “Magnificent 7,” which led the market rally from the front in 2023 and 2024, did not have the best of years, and none of them made it to the list of top 20 gainers in the S&P 500 Index in 2025. The group’s collective price action has been below par, and only Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are outperforming their average S&P 500 Index peer by a noticeable margin. Meanwhile, after the 2025 underperformance, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities—a known perma tech bull—sees MSFT stock rising to $625 next year and termed it a “compelling buy.” Notably, while tech stocks aren’t really known for their dividends and many don’t pay one in the first place, Microsoft’s dividend yield of 0.75% is the highest among Magnificent 7 stocks. It is on the verge of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nThis Dividend Stock Just Scored an FDA Win.

Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWhy Did Microsoft Underperform in 2025? Microsoft’s 2025 underperformance has largely been due to concerns over its burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) capex. The company, which previously said that its capex growth would fall in the fiscal year 2026, now sees it going up instead. The Windows parent splurged almost $35 billion towards capex in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, which ended in September, a record for the company.\n\nTo be sure, rising AI capex is not a Microsoft thing, and Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet have also bumped up spending amid the AI arms race. Barring Alphabet, which entered 2025 with tepid expectations and ended up impressing with its financial performance, the other three are underperforming this year. I find an Alphabet connection to Microsoft’s underperformance. While Gemini gaining ground at OpenAI’s cost helped propel GOOG stock higher, it put pressure on Microsoft, which is OpenAI’s biggest investor and a proxy play on the world’s most valuable unlisted startup.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft Stock's 2026 Forecast Despite the 2025 underperformance, the analyst community is not giving up on Microsoft, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 48 analysts polled by Barchart . MSFT stock trades even below the Street-low target price of $490, while the mean target price of $629.23 is almost 30% higher than current price levels.\n\nNotably, Ives’ target price of $625 is similar to the consensus price target and the same as Wolfe Research, which lowered MSFT’s target price by $50 earlier this month. Looking at the recent action, DA Davidson and Jefferies maintained their bullish bets on Microsoft this month while maintaining their respective target prices of $675 and $650.\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy for 2026? I remain constructive on MSFT stock heading into 2026. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30.6x, which I find balanced. The P/E-to-growth (PEG) multiples do look a bit ugly at 1.82x, but that’s got to do with AI capex hitting the company’s profits in the form of higher capex. “Big Short” Michael Burry’s controversial views on tech companies’ inflating the useful life of AI chips notwithstanding, companies like Microsoft are set to face higher depreciation expenses over the next couple of years.\n\nThere is a lot to like about Microsoft at these levels, though. The stock is a defensive play with a well-diversified business. The company’s Windows and Office business would continue to benefit from the uptick in PC sales, led by an aging base of installed devices and the advent of AI PCs. The ending of Windows 10 support would also help keep that segment buoyed, as more users would feel urged to upgrade to Windows 11.\nMoreover, AI is fueling demand for subscriptions, which would add to Microsoft’s topline. The cloud business is particularly growing at a brisk pace, and Microsoft is closing the gap with market leader Amazon. Specifically, during their recent earnings call, Microsoft said that its commercial cloud remaining performance obligations (RPO) soared 50% to $400 billion at the end of September, with a weighted average duration of just two years.\nOverall, while I haven’t been a permabull on MSFT, I have used the dips to add to my positions, something I repeated this time around as well. At these levels, I find MSFT stock a decent buy and see it delivering double-digit returns next year.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: MSFT, GOOG, NVDA, AMZN, META.

      "Content": "Ranking the Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy for 2026. Here's My No. 4\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Microsoft's suite of productivity software is a must-have tool in any business setting.\nRevenue from its Intelligent Cloud sector may soon surpass that of its business software segment.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nWhen you think about computer software, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is certainly one of the first companies that comes to mind. Microsoft has made a fortune from its Microsoft 365 suite of applications, which includes programs such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams -- all of which are important for any business setting.\n\nMicrosoft has become a computing powerhouse that also sells personal computers, operating systems, tablets, and gaming consoles, as well as the LinkedIn social media platform, the Edge browser and the Bing search web engine. Through its early investment in OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, it's working closely in the field of artificial intelligence, bringing the revolutionary technology to bear to help users boost productivity and automate tasks. And it's a major hyperscaler through its Microsoft Azure cloud computing division, which is addressing a growing need for data center capacity as companies seek to leverage AI applications in their operations.\nThis is the fourth in a series of articles in which I'm ranking the best \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks to buy for 2026, in reverse order. In previous installments, I unveiled Apple as my No. 7 choice , Amazon in the No. 6 spot, and Tesla as the fifth-ranked stock.\nHere's why I'm ranking Microsoft, which has a market capitalization of $3.6 trillion, as the No. 4 Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026.\nAbout Microsoft stock Microsoft, headquartered in Redmond, Washington, has become a leading AI stock. In addition to its cloud computing services, Microsoft was an early adopter in incorporating generative AI into its search engine. It also rolled out Microsoft Copilot as a generative AI tool for its Microsoft 365 products.\n\n\"Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high-value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,\" CEO Satya Nadella said. \"It's why we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.\"\nThe company operates in three primary business segments: Productivity and Office Processes, which includes Microsoft 365 suite and LinkedIn; Intelligent Cloud, which includes Azure and cloud services; and More Personal Computing, which includes Windows, Bing, Surface devices, and Xbox gaming consoles.\n\nStory Continues\nThat combination has led to rapid growth for Microsoft over the last decade, with revenue increasing by more than 230% during that period. Earnings per share and net income are both up more than 500%.\nIn 2025, shares are up 15%, which roughly equals the growth of the S&P 500 index. Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Sept. 30, 2025) showed revenue of $77.7 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Net income was $27.7 billion, up 12%, and earnings per share of $3.72 was up 13% from the previous year.\nSegment\nQ1 2026 Revenue\n% Revenue Change from Q1 2025\nQ1 2026 Operating Income\n% Operating Income Change from Q1 2025\nProductivity and Business Processes\n$33.02 billion\n16.6%\n$20.41 billion\n23.5%\nIntelligent Cloud\n$30.89 billion\n28.2%\n$13.39 billion\n27.5%\nMore Personal Computing\n$13.75 billion\n4.4%\n$4.16 billion\n17.8%\n\nSource: Microsoft\nThe lucrative Intelligent Cloud segment is growing rapidly, and if it maintains this growth trajectory, it will surpass Microsoft's signature productivity software tools as its most lucrative segment.\nWhy Microsoft deserves the No. 4 spot All of the Magnificent Seven stocks are excellent companies, and each is a worthy addition to any portfolio. But when you're looking at the seven companies as a grouping, Microsoft is squarely in the middle of the pack.\nI believe it has a stronger growth engine than Apple, a more effective business model (with higher profit margins) than Amazon's massive e-commerce division, and is less volatile than Tesla. But at the same time, the remaining companies on this list ( Nvidia , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms ) have what I see as more dynamic opportunities to grow in 2026. That's why I'm putting Microsoft in the No. 4 spot.\n\nIf you're looking for a solid, reliable, but not explosive Magnificent Seven stock for 2026, Microsoft is a good bet.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $504,239 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,159,896 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 985 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 195% for the S&P 500.

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump’s $100,000 H-1B Visa Application Fee Upheld by Judge\n\nMadlin Mekelburg\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:18 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nTCS.BO\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge said the Trump administration can move ahead with a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, providing a setback for US technology companies that rely on hiring skilled foreign workers.\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell said in a ruling Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s effort to radically increase the cost of the popular visa is lawful. The decision gives a boost to the administration’s campaign to restrict immigration and push demand for US workers. The US Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the proposal, can appeal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nHowell rejected the Chamber’s argument that Trump doesn’t have the power to impose the fee, finding that his proclamation was issued under “an express statutory grant of authority to the President.”\nCongress has given the president broad authority that he used to address “in the manner he sees fit, a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security,” she wrote.\nDaryl Joseffer, the Chamber’s executive vice president, said in a statement the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive.\n“We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations,” Joseffer said.\n\nThe Chamber, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, argued in its October lawsuit that raising the fee is unlawful because it overrides federal immigration law and exceeds the fee-setting authority afforded by Congress.\nA group of 19 state attorneys general also is challenging Trump’s proclamation. Their lawsuit focuses on the projected impact to the public sector, particularly in the fields of health care and education, that also rely on the H-1B visa program. A separate suit was filed by a global nurse-staffing agency.\nThe ruling Tuesday, a so-called summary judgment that doesn’t require a trial, doesn’t have an impact on the other lawsuits, meaning another judge could still block the new visa fee in the months to come. The other cases include a suit filed in Massachusetts earlier this month by more than a dozen mostly Democratic-led states, as well as a suit filed in October in California by a global nurse-staffing agency and several unions.\nBoth of the other cases are also being handled by Obama appointees, and neither judge has yet ruled on any requests for injunctions against the rule. A hearing in the California case is set for Feb. 12 in Oakland. The dispute is likely to ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court.\n\nStory Continues\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of employment-based immigration, allowing companies in the US to hire college-educated foreign workers for specialized occupations. In September, Trump signed a proclamation to increase the application fee to discourage companies from abusing a program that he claimed displaces US workers.\n\nIt’s a stark shift from America’s historical stance toward immigration. Since its founding, the US has welcomed people from diverse countries and economic backgrounds who come to the US in search of a better life and more freedom.\nYet while Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have mused about the prospects of a windfall for the US Treasury that could total $100 billion or more, immigration attorneys have cautioned that an increase in cost of this magnitude would cause major disruptions that would be likely very expensive to the US economy.\n“This puts a chilling effect on America’s employers,” said Michael Wildes, a managing partner at the New York-based immigration law firm Wildes and Weinberg PC. “How can you make America great by taking away the talent pool?” Wildes noted that “it’s a limiting law in that America will skip a beat. There will be a generation of talent out there in the world that will go to other countries. We will be missing an opportunity and that is foolhardy.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said it will replace the lottery for choosing H-1B visa applicants with a weighted selection to overcome wage arbitrage and incentivize American employers “to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers.” There are also proposals being considered to impose a wage floor.\nH-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but are used primarily in the tech industry. Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. are among the companies with the greatest number of H-1B visas, according to the US government.\nThe visa fees will shape hiring efforts, but affect some jobs and companies more than others, said Alexis DuFresne, founder of recruiting firm Archer Search Partners, which specializes in recruitment for alternative financial asset managers.\n\nFor “superstars” in highly-paid, specialized roles, or for jobs that generate a lot of revenue, organizations will be willing to pay the $100,000 fee, she said.\nBut the high cost will change how people making hiring decisions approach looking for employees in more run-of-the-mill jobs, DuFresne said. “If you’re going to search, you’re going to tell the search people ‘Don’t look globally for me. Look domestically for me,’” she said of such common jobs.\nLikewise, organizations with offices around the world will be able to respond to the recruitment costs by shifting where they hire, according to DuFresne. “The firms that it’s going to affect the most are the smaller firms,” she said.\nThe tech industry has been adapting to changes in US immigration rules for a while now as political currents shift.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google is taking steps to help move employees off of H-1B visas and onto more permanent status. The company recently told staff it will be “ramping up” PERM applications next year for eligible employees, Business Insider reported, taking a crucial step to securing a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\nBeyond the US tech companies, the action also hits India hard, as Indians have been the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In addition to the extra costs that Indian IT companies will bear for thousands of employees on such visas, the ongoing unpredictability has unnerved many Indian professionals working in US tech, finance, health care and other industries, especially after the recent mass postponement of work-visa appointments.\n\nThe case is Chamber of Commerce vs. US Department of Homeland Security, 25-cv-03675, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).\n--With assistance from Jake Bleiberg, Erik Larson and Patrick Howell O'Neill.\n(Updates with expert comments in 14th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI & Security Push Aids Google Cloud: What's Ahead for GOOGL Stock?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:49 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nAlphabet GOOGL is riding on a strong Google Cloud prospect, which accounts for more than 14% of GOOGL’s revenues. In the trailing nine-month period ended Sept. 30, Google Cloud revenues jumped 31.2% over the same year-ago time frame to $41.04 billion. The top line benefited from growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core products, AI Infrastructure and generative AI (Gen AI) Solutions. Cloud backlog jumped 46% sequentially to $155 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2025. The AI and security push is expected to boost Google Cloud’s prospects in the near term.\n\nAlphabet’s expanding AI infrastructure is helping Alphabet win enterprise clients. GCP’s prospects remain robust, driven by strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs (led by seventh-generation Ironwood) and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for the latest Gemini and other AI models, and other services, including cybersecurity and data analytics. Google Cloud is also benefiting from strong Gen AI adoption due to leading models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues from products developed on Google’s Gen AI models surged more than 200% year over year.\n\nSecurity push is expected to drive Google Cloud’s top-line growth further. The addition of Wiz (acquisition pending, expected to complete in 2026) to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT in the cloud computing space. The latest collaboration between Google Cloud and Palo Alto Networks combines Google Cloud’s AI and infrastructure capabilities with Prisma AIRS, the latter’s comprehensive AI security platform. Accelerating investments bodes well for GOOGL’s prospects. Alphabet expects capital expenditure between $91 billion and $93 billion for 2025, which is anticipated to increase further in 2026.\n\nGOOGL Faces Tough Competition in Cloud Domain Per Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 29% in the third quarter of 2025, ahead of Microsoft’s Azure platform at 20% and Google Cloud at 13%.\n\nAmazon is spending heavily on fortifying its Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure that supports AI workloads and expanded data center capacity. Amazon committed $125 billion in capital expenditure for 2025, with the vast majority directed toward AWS infrastructure. The third quarter alone saw $34.2 billion in cash capex, while the company added 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity over 12 months, the largest expansion in cloud history.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft Azure and other cloud services revenues accelerated 40% in constant currency (cc), with management attributing significant contributions to AI-related demand. Microsoft Cloud revenues reached $49.1 billion, increasing 25% in cc and reflecting strong enterprise adoption of cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities. Spending is expected to accelerate throughout fiscal 2026, with roughly half to be spent on GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand and AI workload expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nGOOGL’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Alphabet shares have appreciated 60.5% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nGOOGL Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe GOOGL stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 9.67X compared with the broader sector’s 6.55X.

Based on comments he has made, a tech stock he would've liked to have bought is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- and there's a surprising reason why he didn't.\nWhy Warren Buffett never invested in Microsoft Microsoft has been one of the largest companies in the world for decades. At Berkshire's 2018 annual meeting, an audience member asked Buffett why he never bought shares, especially considering Berkshire's investments in Apple .\nHe answered that in the earlier years, he simply missed out (in his own words, \"the answer's stupidity\"). Buffett's investment strategy is to only invest in what you understand, and he has been selective with tech businesses.\n\nHowever, Buffett also explained that \"it would just be a mistake for Berkshire to buy Microsoft\" because of his friendship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who also served on Berkshire's board of directors. If Berkshire invested in Microsoft before a better-than-expected earnings report or any other positive news, outside observers might speculate that Gates had shared information with Buffett.\nMicrosoft would've been a great stock for Berkshire's portfolio, as it's up 798% over the last 10 years (as of Dec. 18). The S&P 500 has appreciated 241% over the same time period. Along with outperforming the market, Microsoft has also delivered six consecutive quarters of revenue growth, in part because of its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.\n\nFor Buffett, it was more important to avoid the appearance of impropriety than to invest in Microsoft.

      "Content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 24)\n\nJoel South\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:15 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nMSFT\n\nTM\n\nShares of Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) have popped 5.2% in the past week, after it announced it would begin shipping H200 chips to China in February and that it would invest $1.5 billion on a server farm in Israel. Nvidia’s stock is 30.2% higher than six months ago, outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in that time.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points U.S.-China trade relations have presented headwinds, but Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) is also the dominant AI chipmaker in the market, and the company’s profitability remains strong.\nHere is a look at where Nvidia stock could be headed for the rest of this year and into the next.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNote that gains for the chipmaker in that time have helped wipe away the steep drop the stock suffered early in 2025, after it reported it would take a $5.5 billion charge tied to the H20 chip export restrictions to China. While some analysts have raised price targets, others caution about ongoing headwinds due to uncertainty surrounding future U.S.-China trade relations and the potential for stricter regulations. The third-quarter report was stellar on the top and bottom lines due to strong growth in the data center segment.\nDespite its challenges, the company's pivot to U.S. AI infrastructure investments signals resilience. With analysts eyeing robust data center demand, 24/7 Wall St. here explores whether Nvidia can sustain its recovery and drive further growth.\n\nWhy Invest in Nvidia? Nvidia faces significant hurdles as it navigates U.S.-China trade restrictions and intense market expectations. In the first quarter, export controls on its H20 AI chip—which had been designed specifically to circumvent export restrictions on advanced technology to China—led to the substantial write-down noted above. Analysts believed the ban could result in a $9 billion revenue hit. Some $700 million would affect fiscal first-quarter results, with the remaining $8 billion spread across the second and third quarters.\n\nU.S. tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures also threatened supply chain costs, particularly for components sourced globally, while competition from Huawei’s Ascend chips grows. These factors had analysts warning of margin pressure. Yet, Nvidia's profitability remains robust. The company has reportedly raised prices 10% to 15% on some of its most popular GPUs as a result of the tariffs. Gaming processor prices jumped 5% to 10%, while it hiked high-end AI GPUs as much as 15% to account for surging manufacturing costs and to keep its earnings stable.\n\nStory Continues\nYet investments in U.S. AI infrastructure, supported by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's $165 billion Arizona fab expansion, bolster Nvidia's supply chains and are backed by its $37.6 billion cash reserve.\nCEO Huang announced during his recent trip to South Korea that Nvidia will supply more than 260,000 advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to South Korean firms, including Samsung and Hyundai Motor. He believes AI has reached a \"virtuous cycle\" where improvements in the models lead to more investment, which in turn leads to further improvement and investment. He also expressed hope that trade talks between the U.S. and China might lead to a change in policy that allows Nvidia to resume sales of state-of-the-art chips in China. As mentioned, the U.S. president has now allowed the company to sell its advanced H200 AI chips to China.\n\nThe AI market is projected to grow at a 37% CAGR through 2030, according to Grand View Research. This supports Nvidia’s $170 billion fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, a 30% increase over the $130.5 billion it generated in 2025.\nNvidia as a Company In its third-quarter earnings report, Nvidia revenue totaled a record $57.01 billion, including $51.2 billion from its data center division. The total was up 66% year over year, largely fueled by the voracious demand for its AI chips.\nThe chipmaker invested $3.2 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, expanding Blackwell accelerator production and AI infrastructure. The company's capex has spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion to meet hyperscaler demand.\n\nU.S.-China trade restrictions still pose risks, even with the seeming thaw, tariffs could raise costs, which would explain the price hikes reportedly implemented. A 36% operating expense increase to $5.8 billion for R&D offset Nvidia's adjusted operating income of $37.8 billion.\nYet, Nvidia's growth is not solely tied to data centers. The company expanded its automotive segment, with a 32% year-over-year increase to $592 million, driven by partnerships with Toyota and Aurora Innovation for autonomous vehicles. This diversifies Nvidia's portfolio amid tariff uncertainties.\nNvidia has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of $65 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook exceeded analysts' consensus projection.\nNvidia as a Stock This has been a rollercoaster year for Nvidia shareholders. The stock dropped to a 52-week low of $86.62 in April. After an announced pause in U.S.-China tariffs and the first-quarter results, the share price recovered. It hit an all-time high of $212.19 in October, which had the company's market cap briefly over $5 trillion.\n\nWhile some insiders have been selling shares, analyst sentiment remains bullish. Of 64 analysts who cover the stock, 60 recommend buying shares, 11 of them with Strong Buy ratings. Their consensus one-year price target is $253.02, which signals over 38% upside potential from its current price. Targets range from $140 to $352 per share.\nCitigroup, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and others recently maintained their Buy-equivalent ratings. Evercore ISI has the street-high target price. It cited accelerating revenue growth, strong demand for Blackwell chips, an improving supply chain, and a significant pipeline. Yet, renowned investor Michael Burry is bearish on Nvidia.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$140.00\n−23.5%\nMedian\n$253.02\n38.3%\nHigh\n$352.00\n92.4%\n\nNvidia's AI dominance, 93% data center growth, and automotive partnerships with Toyota positioned the company for gains in 2025. However, tariff risks and DeepSeek’s competitive AI models require caution. The AI market's growth and the chipmaker's $47 billion second-quarter revenue position Nvidia to achieve its $170 billion full-year revenue target, while its cash buffer and Stargate Project role offer stability. Still, valuation concerns linger. Nvidia is a buy for growth-oriented investors, but others should use caution.\n\n24/7 Wall St.'s 2026 year-end price target for Nvidia is $300.14 per share, which would be a 640.% gain. That estimate accounts for tariff risks, competition from DeepSeek, and potential Blackwell supply constraints. It also reflects Nvidia's AI dominance and second-quarter 2026 revenue guidance.\nTime to Sell Nvidia Stock as Michael Burry Takes Aim?\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "The 20-Year Signal: Preparing for the Predicted Reversal of AI-Fueled Stock Market Gains\n\nDavid Beren\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:45 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nThere is no question that artificial intelligence has transformed the stock market as we know it over the past three years, all but single-handedly driving the S&P 500 to record after record. Companies that are sitting at the forefront of this technology, like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), have delivered returns that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The Shiller CAPE ratio sits above 35, a level seen only twice before: the Great Depression and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\nThe S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022. The Mag 7 tech stocks now represent 30% of total S&P 500 market value.\nAfter the 2000 peak at similar CAPE levels, the S&P 500 fell 49% over 2.5 years and took 7 years to recover.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMost importantly, the AI technology is real, and so far, the enthusiasm for this technology has been mostly justified, all while the long-term potential (and dangers) seems incredible. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolios have grown in a massive way over the last 36 months. But, and there is always a but, beneath this celebratory growth, there is a warning signal that has emerged.\nThis indicator, which looks at the close relationships between stock prices and underlying economics, hasn't flashed at current levels in over 20 years, not since the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. The last time this signal appeared, it was followed by a multi-year bear market that erased roughly half of the market's overall value. While history doesn't always repeat itself, it does at least suggest that we need to look at these readings and consider, as investors, what the next smart move really is.\n\nAI Mania Drives Stocks to Historic, Record Highs The artificial intelligence revolution has, without question, captivated investors in a way that almost no other technology has. The belief that AI is going to and has already started to automate work, revolutionize manufacturing, and create entirely new industries is just scratching the surface of what investors are thinking about.\n\nFor companies that are in the AI world, all of this speculation and promise has led to explosive revenue growth. For example, NVIDIA's data center business has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in corporate America, and Microsoft's AI integration across basically its entire product lineup is driving enterprise adoption. In other words, this technology is actually driving real revenue.\n\nStory Continues\nThis technological transformation has driven stock prices to levels that would have seemed absurd three years ago. The S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022, and NVIDIA has seen its market cap grow by trillions. The Mag 7's technology stocks represent a whopping 30% of the entire S&P 500 market value, a level not seen since the 1990s. Valuations have also exploded as the forward P/E of the S&P 500 now hovers around 21 to 22, 40% above historical averages.\n\nThe optimism that is driving these valuation numbers is assuming that AI will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for years to come. More importantly, it also assumes that AI adoption won't have any obstacles to adoption in the coming years and that companies building AI infrastructure will continue generating returns to justify their current high stock prices and valuations.\nThis pattern of pricing in future success isn't new, as the late 1990s boom also seemed a trajectory where investors were basically paying today for profits they expected companies to deliver in the next five years. However, as the world knows, the technology of the internet boom from the 1990s succeeded, it's how you're reading this today, but many of the stocks crashed because valuations got too far ahead of any financial reality.\n\nA Rare Signal Not Seen in Two Decades: What the Indicator Means The warning signal that is flashing today is the Shiller CAPE ratio, a number that is an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio that measures stock prices relative to average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This metric attempts to smooth out short-term earnings volatility and give a longer-lens look at valuation extremes. As of December 2025, the Shiller CAPE sits above 35, a level that has only been seen twice in modern history: the Great Depression market crash and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\n\nThe last time the US saw the CAPE ratio reach these current levels was in early 2000, right before the stock-market crash. At that peak, investors were paying extreme premiums for stocks based on the expectation (think hope) that internet companies would continue to just deliver on their unprecedented growth. History reminds us that the reality of what took place was that these companies did not enjoy unstoppable growth and that the market declined 49% over a 2.5-year period, the NASDAQ fell 78%, and it took 7 years to recover.\nThe CAPE ratio's predictive power comes from understanding long-term perspectives, and unlike traditional P/E ratios that can be distorted by temporary earnings spikes or collapses, the CAPE ratio looks with a wide lens at a full decade of earnings. When this ratio does hit 30, it can be a historical signal that stocks are priced for perfection and have almost no room for disappointment.\n\nWhat makes the current signal particularly troubling is that it isn't just existing in a silo. Instead, it's appearing alongside three other late-cycle indicators like three consecutive years of double-digit S&P 500 gains, forward P/E ratios at 40-year highs, extreme concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks, and retail investor enthusiasm that feels eerily like the dot-com bubble. While no single indicator is going to be definitive, the combination of all three suggests that a major reversal could be on the horizon, and an entire generation of investors has never experienced what happens when valuations are this stretched.\nHistory's Verdict: A Reversal is Coming - How Smart Investors Respond History is pretty unambiguous about what can happen when an extreme CAPE reading is taking place. For one, you might be in a position that creates a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. At the 1929 stock peak, stocks fell 89% over three years, and again in 2000, you had the 49% S&P 500 drop over 2.5 years. What a drop might look like in the near future is unknown, but the pattern that occurred during these two previous instances of extreme valuations resolving through major corrections seems to be all too familiar to what we're going through now with AI.\n\nFor investors, this could be the strategic opportunity they have been waiting for rather than a situation full of panic. The mistake during previous bubbles wasn't recognizing that stocks were not expensive, but it was remaining fully invested at those prices and then panic-selling at the bottom. The smart approach today is about recognizing that current valuations create a situation where the downside potential far exceeds any upside of staying fully invested.\nBuilding a cash reserve now so investors can \"buy the dip,\" as the saying goes, is arguably the best move, to the tune of upward of 30% of a portfolio being liquidated for cash or put into short-term bonds. If the market does decline by 40-50% from current levels, this cash can be invested into companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA at valuations these companies haven't experienced in years. This could give investors a chance to double their position size.\n\nThe key here is going to be the right amount of discipline, as history shows that bear market pain isn't the actual decline itself, it's the psychology of trying to understand how to buy at the bottom. If the market falls 30%, there might be a voice going on that says it's going to 50% and if it falls 50%, total economic collapse might be the voice on the news. In other words, investors should have capital reserved for buying during these panics so they can ignore the noise and acquire quality companies at steep discounts and prepare for the next decade's best returns.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAMZN\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel ( INTC ) CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\n\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ) in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory Continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft ( MSFT ) CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms — Walden International and Walden Catalyst — did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO Born in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note.\nNo rash moves The consensus advice: Walk softly.\n“I would not urge anyone to do drastic selling,” Joseph Davis, Vanguard’s global chief economist and head of Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group, previously told me.\n“This is where I say ‘stay the course,’ but start thinking about diversifying,” Davis said. “It could be smaller-cap companies in the United States, which have trailed over the past 10 or 15 years, as well as non-US investments. Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Is It Too Late to Buy Alphabet Stock in 2026? The Answer May Surprise You.\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Alphabet stock is the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock in 2025.\nThe company is gaining market share in artificial intelligence (AI) and has many other drivers of growth.\nMargin expansion and share buybacks will help earnings per share keep compounding.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nA surprise candidate has come from behind and turned into the top-performing \" Magnificent Seven\" stock of 2025. The company's name is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Owner of Google and various other technology platforms, Alphabet's stock was a laggard versus the likes of Microsoft earlier this year, but has come roaring back to produce a total return of 57% so far in 2025.\nThe stock once again has one of the largest market caps in the world, and now trades at a much higher price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). Does that mean it is too late to buy Alphabet stock for your portfolio? The answer may surprise you.\nSteady market share gains in AI usage First, we need to take a look at Alphabet's position within the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Current earnings for the business may be derived from Google Search, but future revenue will come from its Gemini AI model being deployed across its namesake app, Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud (among other Alphabet products).\nGemini began its growth much more slowly than the disruptive chatbots ChatGPT and Claude, both heavily funded AI start-ups. However, 2025 has been the year of market share gains for Gemini, which came from close to no usage to a 13% share of the AI market. It is still well behind ChatGPT, but growing quickly, and with a huge distribution advantage with the billions of users of Google products, it can be easily marketed.\n\nAlphabet also has a cost advantage due to using its own data center infrastructure and computer chips to run Gemini, making it more profitable than both OpenAI (owner of ChatGPT) and Anthropic (owner of Claude), which are burning a boatload of cash right now.\nEven though Alphabet is spending close to $25 billion a quarter on capital expenditures, it is still generating positive free cash flow and self-funding its AI expansion. No direct competitor can say the same.\nLong-term earnings power growth AI should be a steady growth driver for Alphabet, especially if Gemini can keep gaining market share.\nThat is not the entire Alphabet business. Well, a lot of the business is now utilizing Gemini's AI capabilities, but it is far from the only moneymaking product under its umbrella. For example, there is YouTube, with over $10 billion in quarterly advertising revenue. Or there's Google Cloud, which is growing 34% year over year at over $15 billion in quarterly revenue. Not to forget Google Search, the main profit driver (still) for Alphabet, with $50 billion in quarterly sales.\n\nStory Continues\nThe list could go on. We even have self-driving division Waymo that is scaling up rapidly in cities around the country.\nAlphabet's revenue is growing by 15% year over year right now, even at such an immense scale. With so many growth engines over the next five years, this megacap company should be able to keep compounding its revenue higher for a long while.\nIs Alphabet stock still a buy? Alphabet's earnings power certainly did not grow as fast as its stock price in 2025. The stock now has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 30 compared to close to 15 earlier this year. That puts high expectations on the business going forward.\nEven with this high P/E ratio, I still think Alphabet will do well for investors who buy today and hold for many years. As mentioned, sales are growing quickly, but earnings per share (EPS) are growing even faster with margin expansion and steady share repurchases. A fast-growing EPS will bring down Alphabet's P/E ratio quickly and deliver strong stock returns over the next decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "2 Monster Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nJohn Ballard, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 3:44 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Alphabet's Google continues to gain share in the cloud computing market.\nMicrosoft has over 900 million people using AI features in its products.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nInvestors looking for solid stocks to buy for the next five years shouldn't overthink it. Sticking with established tech giants is one of the best ways to ride the current trends in technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) .\nThese are some of the most profitable companies in the world, and they have the resources to invest in cutting-edge technologies, delivering returns for their investors. Here are two that would make solid buy-and-hold investments for the next five years.\n1. Alphabet (Google) Over the last five years, shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have more than tripled in value, and tailwinds are moving in its favor to drive more market-beating returns through the end of the decade. Google's recent financial results demonstrate that it is a significant force in AI.\n\nGoogle's services revenue, including Search, reached $87 billion in the third quarter, a 14% year-over-year increase. Search processes billions of daily queries. Google is seeing higher user engagement, driven by new AI features, including Overviews and AI Mode. AI Mode alone has reached 75 million daily active users, doubling the number of searches since the second quarter. The growth in Google's Search business demonstrates how it ultimately benefits from a massive data advantage, enabling it to train its Gemini AI model and deliver better services to users.\nGemini also powers enterprise tools across Google Cloud, which continues to gain share in the $390 billion cloud computing market, according to Synergy Research. Businesses are increasingly relying on cloud services for storage and software development, positioning Google for significant growth. The cloud segment posted a healthy 34% year-over-year revenue increase last quarter. The growth in the cloud is a prime example of Alphabet's competitive position in the AI market.\n\nDespite the stock's surge this year, it still trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 27 based on 2026 earnings estimates. This is attractive considering analysts expect earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 15% in the next several years. Assuming the stock maintains its current forward P/E in 2030, the share price could reach $600 based on these earnings growth estimates.\n2. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a ubiquitous brand in computing, and that works to its advantage in the age of AI. Millions of people use Office and other Windows-based software products, providing a large installed base of users to monetize its AI investments. The stock has more than doubled since 2020, and the growing demand it is seeing in AI services could be enough to double the stock again.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's cloud infrastructure not only powers its enterprise cloud services but also its consumer-facing services. It has over 900 million monthly active users using AI features across its products. Microsoft 365, which includes Office, has over 400 million paid subscribers. New AI features drive healthy demand for these software products, with Microsoft 365 consumer cloud revenue up 26% year over year in the last quarter.\n\nAcross the business, Microsoft enjoys strong momentum. Its recent quarterly revenue of $77.7 billion increased by 18% year over year. The company's remaining performance obligations (representing long-term commitments from enterprises) reached $392 billion in the recent quarter. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of 51%.\nMicrosoft is playing a crucial role in one of the most significant transformations of the economy since the advent of the internet. The stock is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 30. This is reasonable for a leading cloud services provider experiencing robust revenue growth. Analysts currently project 13% annualized earnings growth over the next several years. This should fuel solid returns for Microsoft investors through at least 2030.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

The fund now reports no position in the company, following normal trading activity for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.\n\nWhat else to know Evolutionary Tree Capital Management, LLC fully divested from monday.com, which now represents 0% of its 13F reportable assets under management.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: MSFT: $8.85 million (9.7% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AMZN: $8.10 million (8.8% of AUM)\nNYSE: NOW: $4.90 million (5.3% of AUM)\nNYSE: RBLX: $4.74 million (5.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: NFLX: $4.55 million (5.0% of AUM)\n\nAs of November 12, 2025, shares of monday.com were priced at $159.11, down 38.94% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 by 56.34 percentage points.\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close November 12, 2025)\n$159.11\nMarket Capitalization\n$8.21 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.16 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$65.05 million\n\nCompany Snapshot Offers a cloud-based Work OS platform enabling organizations to build custom workflow and project management applications; product suite includes solutions for marketing, CRM, software development, and operational management.\nGenerates revenue primarily through subscription-based licensing of its SaaS platform, with additional income from value-added services such as onboarding and customer support.\nServes a global customer base spanning enterprises, SMBs, government, and educational institutions across the United States, EMEA, and other international markets.\n\nmonday.com operates at scale as a leading provider of flexible work management software, supporting over 2,500 employees and a diversified international client base.

Its competitive advantage lies in its highly customizable, user-friendly interface and its ability to address a wide range of business functions within a single unified system.\nFoolish take Evolutionary Tree appears to have sold out of its monday.com position after its pullback had already occurred.\n\nStory Continues\nThe SaaS stock had risen steadily since the end of the 2022 bear market . However, monday.com experienced its first significant pullback in years over the summer.\nEvolutionary Tree invests primarily in tech stocks. Although Microsoft and Amazon are its largest positions, most of its positions are tech growth stocks like monday.com.\n\nWith this stock, the timing is interesting since Evolutionary Tree began accumulating its Monday.com shares in 2023. It appears to have begun buying shares close to the price where it unloaded its entire position in the third quarter of 2025. It also continued adding shares over the years, implying that it likely lost money on this stock.\nUltimately, we do not know why the fund exited its monday position. Still, given the recent revenue slowdown and what looks like a lack of gains over the last two years, Evolutionary Tree seems to feel like sometimes it is best to admit a mistake and move on, which is often a wise decision when specific positions do not work out as planned.\nGlossary 13F AUM: Assets under management reported by institutional investment managers in quarterly SEC Form 13F filings.\nDivested: Sold off or disposed of an asset or investment, fully or partially, from a portfolio.\nStake: The ownership interest or share held in a company by an investor or fund.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\nCAGR: Compound Annual Growth Rate; the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period, assuming compounding.\nWork OS: A cloud-based platform enabling users to build custom workflow and project management applications.\nSaaS: Software as a Service; software delivered online via subscription rather than installed locally.\nValue-added services: Additional services provided beyond the core product, such as onboarding or customer support, often for extra fees.\nCloud-native: Software designed specifically to run and scale efficiently in cloud computing environments.\nDigital transformation: The integration of digital technology into all areas of a business to improve operations and value delivery.\nModular platform: A system built from separate components that can be independently developed, replaced, or upgraded.\nUnified system: A single platform that integrates multiple business functions or processes for streamlined management.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Apple spent 2025 setting itself up for the future — and its biggest moves weren't about AI\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nSSNLF\n\nIt’s been quite a year for Apple ( AAPL ). The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ).\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta ( META ) Reality Labs' new design studio .\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times , Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\nCook is steering a $4 trillion behemoth Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nStory Continues\nCook's decisions drove Apple's stock price ever higher. As a result, the company's market cap has increased from $1 trillion in 2018 to a whopping $4 trillion in 2025.\nRevenue has also continued its steady upward pace, with Apple reporting $416 billion in total sales for its fiscal 2025, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nApple is also reportedly preparing some of the biggest changes in years to its iPhone lineup in 2026. According to Gurman , the company will roll out a foldable iPhone, a first for Apple, in the latter half of the year.\n\nThat could help further goose already record iPhone sales. Apple is also reportedly preparing a new low-cost MacBook model, which would open up the company to a broader customer segment.\nAnd while it may not have the same margins as a high-powered MacBook Pro, a lower-cost MacBook could still help draw more customers to Apple's services, driving increased revenue over the long run.\n\nNew challenges ahead If Ternus is chosen to succeed Cook, he'll inherit an Apple at the peak of its power. While smartphone sales have slowed over time, the company is reaping the benefits of its massive install base, which still upgrades devices every few years and increasingly subscribes to Apple's various services.\n\nBut he'll also have to navigate his share of headaches. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting some kind of movement on Apple's AI strategy. And though the company is making progress on its AI rollout, it still needs to showcase its next-generation version of Siri.\nHe'll also have to prepare to take on the likes of Meta, Google, and Samsung ( 005930.KS ) in the smart glasses space. Meta already has two smart glasses on the market, and Google and Samsung are each working on their own intelligent eyewear.\nFor now, though, Cook is still Apple's CEO. We'll just have to see if that changes in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Google is less than $200B away from surpassing Apple as the world’s second-largest company.\nGoogle holds four of the top 10 AI models on LLMArena. OpenAI’s best model ranks eighth.\nMeta is negotiating billions in purchases of Google’s TPUs. Anthropic already bought 1 million TPUs from Google instead of buying from Nvidia (NVDA).\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) as the world's second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street.\nThere are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI \"replacing\" the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals.\n\nLet's take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026.\nGoogle is firing on all cylinders Google was supposed to \"die\" after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can.\nThen, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI \"Bard\" rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in \"code red\" mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards.\n\nIf you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI's sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each.\nIf you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI's GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn't spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) have gone into net debt.\nWhy Google's search business will never be replaced If Google's rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated.\nAs for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with.\n\nIn contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it.\nNvidia's AI GPUs at risk? Software isn't Alphabet's only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia's near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient.\nMeta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth \"billions of dollars,\" with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia's coffers instead.\n\nThe threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google's AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating.\nCould Google become the biggest company in 2026? I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world's largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030.\n\nNvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

Microsoft, Snowflake ( NYSE:SNOW ), and Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) remain top picks, supported by steady AI spending from hyperscalers.

Analysts said it checks many boxes of a washed-out software name, with improving momentum tied to its AI push and the potential for revenue growth to re-accelerate. Its relatively low free cash flow multiple was seen as making the risk-reward more attractive.\nElsewhere, Evercore likes Intuit ( NASDAQ:INTU ) as small businesses adopt AI, Samsara ( NYSE:IOT ) as a smaller-cap standout, and Palo Alto Networks ( NASDAQ:PANW ) as its top cybersecurity pick as recent acquisitions begin to show results.

      "Content": "Alphabet Agrees to Buy Intersect Power in $4.75 Billion Clean Energy Deal\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 9:07 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nAlphabet Inc. ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) has agreed to acquire clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash plus existing debt, a deal that could expand Google's access to electricity as it scales data centers tied to artificial intelligence. The acquisition, announced Monday, follows Google's minority investment in Intersect last year and comes as US power grids face rising strain from renewed demand growth. Alphabet said the transaction is intended to give Google greater flexibility to develop new power generation alongside expanding data center capacity, which has increasingly become a limiting factor for AI deployment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe deal arrives as the AI buildout drives consolidation across data centers and energy infrastructure. Google, along with Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Microsoft Corp. ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), has been managing the tension between rising electricity needs and long-term climate goals, after the company disclosed in 2024 that its carbon emissions increased 48% over the past five years due largely to data center operations. Intersect, backed by private equity firm TPG Inc., has focused on solar and battery storage projects designed to power large-scale data centers, particularly in Texas, a region its CEO Sheldon Kimber has described as attractive due to abundant wind and solar resources. The company has about 7.5 gigawatts of solar and storage in operation and another eight gigawatts in development, with much of that capacity tied to data-center-heavy markets.\n\nAs part of the transaction, Alphabet will acquire Intersect's power development platform, team, and in-development assets already contracted by Google, while Intersect will retain its brand and continue under Kimber's leadership. Grid assets contracted to other customers in Texas and California will remain outside the purchase, with TPG Rise Climate retaining a stake in those projects. Industry analysts have suggested the structure could reduce regulatory risk for Google, as owning power generation assets may provide more flexibility in how and where new data centers are built, rather than relying solely on third-party power arrangements as AI infrastructure continues to scale.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Bill Gates Portfolio: 3 Of His Ancor Holdings Every Investor Should Consider\n\nChris MacDonald\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 8:40 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nDHR\n\nMCD\n\nDE\n\nMicrosoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) founder Bill gates is best-known for his founding of the most valuable company in the world (on multiple occasions, just not now). And rightfully so.\nThat said, over the years, Bill Gates has adjusted his portfolio holdings, choosing to divest in a range of companies via his own personal portfolio but also via his charitable organizations and other investment funds. One could argue that he would have been much better off just staying highly concentrated in Microsoft stock, and those who'd make that argument would have been 100% correct. But that's not to say diversification isn't generally a good thing - it is.\n\nHere are three of Bill Gates' portfolio positions, and why I think these companies are worth considering (they're not his largest positions, but have some of the best upside among those reported on his recent 13-F filing).\nDeere (DE) Agricultural equipment giant Deere ( NYSE:DE ) has carved out a near-monopoly on the production of many of the most popular models of tractors, mowers, and other equipment used for both commercial and residential use. The company's ability to provide farmers and those who have a real penchant for mowing their lawns like pros with precision technology has created a relatively high-margin business out of a rather boring sector many wouldn't think to look at.\n\nProviding investors with a small but reasonable dividend yield of 1.4% and solid fundamentals overall, Deere remains a juggernaut in this space and is every investor's long-term dream stock. Over the past five years alone, Deere has produced capital appreciation of 74%, making its chart look more like a well-oiled tech stock than an industrial play.\nMuch of this is due to the company's strong recent results, in which Deere brought in revenue of $12 billion and EPS of $4.76. The company's revenues were down year-over-year, but resilient earnings numbers highlight the company's robust margins and ability to growth through difficult periods.\nFor those expecting some recessionary headwinds to form in the coming year, owning a piece of the agricultural sector (which is very stable on a relative basis) may be a good move, and Deere is the preeminent name in this space.\n\nDanaher (DHR) A company I don't cover much, but probably should, is Danaher ( NYSE:DHR ). The life sciences and diagnostics company has seen impressive margins, driven by a productivity-first growth model. Supported by strong acquisitions in recent years (with many analysts and investors hoping for more down the road), the company has seen robust revenue and growth in recent years.\n\nStory Continues\nNow, Danaher's revenue did slide similar to Deere, but only by 1% year-over-year. The company more than made up for this decline via strong free cash flow generation of $1.4 billion and robust operating margins of more than 25%. On that note, the company also reiterated its forward guidance, suggesting to investors that this past quarter was a blip.\n\nI'd tend to agree, considering the company's ability to continue to expand its margin as it acquires companies that don't have the same sort of fundamentals. With a goal of creating monopoly-like franchises, this is a stock I think can continue to outperform in a market environment where investors are reaching for safety.\nMcDonald's (MCD) Last, but certainly not least on this list of top Bill Gates holdings I think investors should consider is McDonald's ( NYSE:MCD ).\nShares of the fast food giant have been volatile in the past, but are starting to move in the right direction. On a year-to-date basis, MCD stock is up more than 9% as investors clearly begin to take a harder look at companies in more defensive sectors. As the leading fast food giant globally, when times are tough, consumers looking to dine away from home tend to trade down toward the lowest-cost value out there. It's hard to argue McDonald's isn't this pick for millions around the world.\n\nWith incredibly resilient and robust cash flow generation, and operating margins near 45%, this is a top stock I think long-term investors can buy and sit on for decades. Whether or not you visit one of the company's more than 40,000 locations around the world, plenty of regular traffic and a resurgence of interest around the company's value meals, could drive incredible upside in the years to come.\nThat thesis is doubly true for those who think tough times may be ahead.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

The hedge fund increased its position by 4.83% in the third quarter. Bridgewater owns more than 1 million shares of the ETF and started investing in IVV in 2010. IVV has $733 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe ETF provides exposure to large-cap companies in the U.S. and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index. IVV invests in the 500 top U.S. companies based on their market capitalization. This means its top holdings include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon.\nThe fund has a yield of 1.04% and pays quarterly dividends. Its highest allocation lies in the technology sector at 34.36%, followed by financials (13.38%) and consumer discretionary (10.56%). IVV has a low expense ratio of 0.03% and has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 94.83% and a 5-year return of 114.12%.\nIVV has gained 17.09% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $687.83. The fund has the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming years. With more than two decades of history, the fund has established itself as a strong player offering broad U.S. equity exposure.\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust Bridgewater has the second-highest position in State Street’s S&P 500 ETF ( NYSE: SPY ), which makes up 6.69% of the total portfolio. The fund also tracks the performance of the S&P 500 and is the first exchange-traded fund listed in the United States.\n\nStory Continues\nSPY is a low-risk investment that ensures steady capital appreciation. It has gained 17.41% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $684.83. The fund holds 503 stocks and has an expense ratio of 0.09%. It has a yield of 1.04% and has the highest allocation in the information technology sector (34.08%), followed by financials (13.55%) and consumer discretionary (10.62%).\n\nSimilar to IVV, its top 10 holdings include industry stalwarts such as Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. Despite making several buy and sell transactions, Dalio prefers to stick to some ETFs, and SPY is one of them. It can help build a strong foundation for your portfolio. The fund has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 20.43% and a 5-year return of 15.12%.\nWith SPY, you get to own the biggest companies across industries. IVV and SPY are virtually identical in many ways. Both track the S&P 500 index and have generated similar returns over time.\nAlphabet Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) forms 2.53% of Bridgewater’s portfolio and holds more than 3 million shares. While the hedge fund has trimmed its position over time, it still remains one of the top holdings. Looking at Dalio’s holdings, it shows that he’s bullish on the tech sector.\nAlphabet has gained 61.89% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $308.61. It has a comprehensive AI ecosystem that ensures steady revenue growth. While the company is known for the dominating Google search engine, it has a massive empire that continues to grow. Its search engine continues to lead the industry, while YouTube has become the largest streaming platform today.\n\nIts numbers are impressive. It reported a revenue of $102.3 billion, up 16% year over year, while the net income jumped 33%. Its cloud revenue soared 34% to $15.2 billion, and Google Services revenue jumped 14% to $87.1 billion. Its cloud division has gained a multi-year deal worth $10 billion with Palo Alto Networks, aimed at expanding the AI-driven security infrastructure.\nThere’s plenty of growth still to come. Wall Street remains bullish on the stock as its core business continues to thrive. A Wedbush analyst has an Outperform rating for the stock with a price target of $350.\nMicrosoft Corporation Tech dinosaur Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) forms 2.23% of Dalio’s portfolio. While he has trimmed his stake in the company during the third quarter, Microsoft continues to remain one of the top five holdings. The tech giant has seen a steady climb and continued optimism by Wall Street experts. AI will accelerate Microsoft’s growth, and the demand for Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure has outpaced supply.\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about Microsoft’s AI rollout across its entire product stack and the expansion of CoPilot in Windows. In the recently announced results, the company beat earnings and revenue expectations. It reported a revenue of $77.67 billion, up 18% year over year, and an EPS of $4.13. Its cloud segment recorded a growth of 28% with a revenue of $30.9 billion, being one of the biggest growth drivers for the business.\nMSFT stock has gained 15.80% year to date and is exchanging hands for $484.72. It has a dividend yield of 0.75% and has raised dividends every year since 2010. Despite the low yield, it is an excellent dividend stock to own. The company has increased its dividend by 250% in the past decade. However, the stock price has gone up; hence, the yield has dropped.\n\nDespite trimming his stake, Dalio believes in the future of Microsoft and has held the stock since 2005.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "An X-Ray View of the Magnificent Seven\n\nJohn Dorfman\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:38 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nBy John Dorfman December 22, 2025 (Maple Hill Syndicate)\nFor the past three years, a huge share of the stock market's action has been in the Magnificent Seven , a small group of super-successful, super-popular stocks.\nThere are signs of fatigue in this leadership group. But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

      "Content": "The S&P 500’s Rare 40-Year Valuation Warning: Economic Slowdown Is Confirmed by Federal Reserve\n\nDavid Beren\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:55 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered what can only be described as a strong year to date, extending a rally that has rewarded investors for staying the course through inflation, rate hikes, and geopolitical uncertainty. On the surface, by all accounts, the market looks healthy as stocks continue climbing and corporate earnings remain strong. Similarly, optimism around artificial intelligence and an easier monetary policy has kept an appetite for the stock market intact.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 now trades at 22.4x forward earnings. This valuation has only occurred twice in the past 40 years.\nFederal Reserve research shows tariff policies will reduce annual GDP growth by 0.3% to 0.5% over the next two years.\nProfit margins are near historical highs with limited expansion room while earnings forecasts for 2026 remain modest.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnderneath all of this performance, however, there is something of a growing concern as the same market producing double-digit gains is now trading at approximately 22.4 times forward earnings, a valuation number the country has only seen twice in the last 40 years. At the same time, you have new Federal Reserve research indicating that tariff policies will slow economic growth in a fairly substantial way over the next two years.\nWhen these extremes collide, it's cause for concern, but when combined with weakening fundamentals, history suggests that investors need to pay closer attention, even if the market appears to be mostly calm.\nThe Market Paradox: High Gains Amidst Tariff Uncertainty As you look at the 16% S&P 500 gain year to date, it not only reflects a level of continued optimism but also highlights that there are several key areas worth watching. At the top of any list has to be artificial intelligence, which continues to drive a ton of enthusiasm for technology stocks, particularly for names like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ).\n\nAdditionally, you have the Federal Reserve and its efforts to shift from rate hikes to rate cuts, which is helping to improve the situation for equity investments by making future earnings more valuable and reducing the competition from stocks and bonds, where people shifted money when interest rates were high.\nIf you have invested in the market, so far, so good, as you have been able to enjoy the financial benefits of a 16% market increase. The market has, as it often does, rewarded those who go full force ahead, all while punishing those who were too cautious and missed out on these returns.\n\nStory Continues\nStill, you can't ignore that the Federal Reserve's recent indicators around the impact of tariffs are going to give a whole lot of investors a reality check in the not-too-distant future. The Fed's analysis indicates that tariff policies could reduce annual GDP growth from anywhere between 0.3% and 0.5% over the next two years. On paper, this might sound small, but the resulting loss in growth is substantial. What's worse is that this isn't a speculative conclusion. It's based entirely on comprehensive economic modeling according to the Fed, so it's going to happen, it's just a matter of when.\n\nOnly Seen Twice: The 22.4x Forward Earnings Warning Unsurprisingly, the S&P 500's current forward P/E ratio of 22.4 as a red flag puts the market in the uncomfortable spot of being among the most expensive valuations in the last four decades. Considering that the historical average sits between 15 and 16, this current number is 40% higher, which leads to investors having to pay more for the same dollar of earnings than they have in the past.\n\nMore notable is that this scenario has only played out twice in the last 40 years, during the late 1990s tech boom and the 2021 pandemic stimulus period. If you are a student of financial history, you know that neither instance ended well for investors who bought at peak valuations, as the tech bubble crashed 49% between 2000 and 2002, while the 2021 pandemic peak was followed by a 25% decrease.\nWhile there is cause for concern, it's also necessary to highlight that high valuations do not automatically mean that economic conditions are not strong. If earnings are growing rapidly, which they are, and business conditions are improving, investors can make a justification for paying a premium for future growth. The flag here is that none of these conditions exist right now, including profit margins expanding, so earnings forecasts for 2026 are pretty modest. Profit margins, in particular, are close to historical highs, so there isn't a lot of room for expansion, and according to the Fed, business conditions are about to get worse.\n\nThe 22.4 forward P/E reflects an optimism for investors that doesn't really align with any reality the Fed is describing. It assumes continued strong earnings growth and stable margins, and when those assumptions break or uncertainty increases, valuations are going to reset lower as investors decide they no longer want to pay premiums for companies that have falling fundamentals.\nTariff Impact: Fed Study Predicts Slowed Growth and Market Headwinds The Fed's research on tariff impacts is likely to be the clearest warning sign about what could potentially happen next year with the economy. From its study, we learned that both the direct and indirect effects of tariffs across multiple sectors are going to slow US economic growth in a measurable and meaningful way in the next 24 months.\n\nAs data and detail-heavy as this all is, the math is pretty clear as tariffs increase input costs for manufacturers and force companies to either absorb the cost, impacting margins, or pass the expense onto consumers, which reduces overall demand. It won't surprise anyone to consider that both scenarios likely result in economic compression. If there is a higher input cost, there is less capital for companies to expand, hire, etc., and higher consumer prices reduce overall purchasing power, especially for middle and lower-income households that spend a lot of money on the exact kinds of goods that tariffs will hit hardest.\nThe research also highlighted the uncertainty that is going to impact overall business planning, even before tariffs have been fully implemented. Companies are undoubtedly going to keep delaying capital expenditures if there is even a hint of concern over clarity as to what trade rules could look like in six months. What's worse is that supply chain managers can't commit to long-term contracts when tariff policy shifts weekly. All of this comes together as slowed investment for companies as hiring plans are put on hold and any expansion projects get delayed, perhaps indefinitely.\n\nFor the stock market, any instance of slower economic growth is going to translate into weaker earnings. Corporate revenue is tied directly to economic activity, and even if GDP growth falls from 2% to 1.5%, which may not sound like a lot, it has a big impact. When sales fall, so too do profits, and when profits start to disappoint, stock prices are going to directly reflect investor concerns. Arguably, the biggest takeaway for investors is that the Fed's research all but confirms that the economics surrounding stock prices is about to weaken, perhaps significantly. This is going to translate to the kind of headwind that even the momentum of a few large-cap names can't overcome.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "Bull of the Day: MongoDB (MDB)\n\nAndrew Rocco\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MDB\n\nMDB Company Overview and Bull Case Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock MongoDB ( MDB ) is a leading database software company. Think of a traditional database (like a spreadsheet or filing cabinet) as being very rigid: you have to decide exactly how many columns your data will have before you put anything in it. If you want to add new information later, you must stop everything and restructure the entire cabinet. Conversely, MDB technology stores data in self-contained folders that can hold anything – text, photos, video links, or lists – all in one place. Additionally, MDB’s product is unique because:\n\n· There are No Rigid Rules (Flexible Schema): You don't have to define a strict structure upfront. If you have 100 customer folders, and you decide you want to track a new \"loyalty points\" field, you just add it to the following folder you create. The other 99 folders don't need to change. This is called a flexible schema.\n· It is Built for Speed and Scale: Because modern applications (like a popular social media app or an e-commerce site) serve millions of users and ingest new data every minute, MongoDB is designed to scale easily and handle massive amounts of data very quickly. It can simply add more \"cabinets\" (servers) to store data horizontally.\n\n· The Main Product: Atlas: The company's main business is MongoDB Atlas, which is like an easy button for this robust database. It's a cloud service that lets developers use the MongoDB database without worrying about setting up or maintaining the servers. They just pay to use the database as a service.\nMicrosoft Partnership Helps MDB Break Into AI MDB has a partnership with tech giant Microsoft ( MSFT ) that enables Atlas to be deeply integrated into Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. Clients can now plug Atlas into Microsoft Azure to utilize its AI tools. The Microsoft partnership is critical for helping MDB gain a share of the rapidly growing AI market. The good news for MDB investors is that MongoDB was named the 2025 ‘Microsoft United States Partner of the Year.’\n\nMDB: A Consistent EPS Outperformer Wall Street is a game of expectations, and MDB has illustrated that it’s capable of delivering. Over the past four quarters, it has surpassed Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates by a juicy 69.30%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMDB Reports Stellar EPS Earlier this month, MongoDB delivered strong third-quarter results that exceeded the high end of their guidance, driven by continued strength in Atlas, which saw growth accelerate 30% year-over-year. Meanwhile, total revenue and subscription revenue grew 19% year-over-year as margins expanded. Finally, MDB raised its guidance. The company now expects EPS growth of ~30% and revenue growth of 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nMDB Technical View: An EPS-Induced Breakaway Gap Following the early December earnings release, MDB shares spiked 22% as trading volume swelled to more than 4x the norm – a sign of heavy demand. Despite the large upside move, the stock has traded sideways since EPS, indicating that although investors have large profits in the stock, they are unwilling to part with their shares.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nBottom Line\nMongoDB’s flexible architecture, cloud-first Atlas platform, and strategic partnership with Microsoft give the company a powerful runway for AI-driven growth. With a track record of earnings outperformance and fresh momentum following EPS, MDB shares are a buy.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "My Top 3 Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in December\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Alphabet's Google Quantum AI is addressing nearly every aspect of superconducting quantum computing.\nAmazon's Ocelet chip holds the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of quantum error correction.\nMicrosoft's topoconductors could represent a giant leap forward in building large-scale quantum computers.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\n\"Plastics.\"\nThat's the one-word advice that Mr. McGuire (played by Walter Brooke) gave to Dustin Hoffman's character, Benjamin Braddock, in the classic 1967 movie The Graduate . If the movie were remade today, though, McGuire might have to use two words in his investing recommendation to young Braddock – quantum computing .\nQuantum computing is poised to profoundly reshape the technological landscape over the next few years. Importantly, it presents tremendous opportunities for investors today. I think that some opportunities stand out above others, though. Here are my top three quantum computing stocks to buy in December.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is best known as the parent company of Google. And Google, of course, is best known for its ubiquitous search engine. However, Google is also working to advance quantum computing.\nGoogle Quantum AI officially began operating in 2012. Its mission, then and now, is to 'build quantum computing for otherwise unsolvable problems.\"\n\nTo achieve this lofty goal, Google Quantum AI covers nearly every aspect of superconducting quantum computing . Its staff work on both hardware (including quantum processors and cooling systems called cryostats) and software (including operating systems and user applications).\nThus far, Google Quantum AI has completed two of the six milestones on its roadmap to build a practical, large-scale quantum computer. In 2019, Google Quantum AI announced that its technology achieved quantum supremacy (a term used to describe where a quantum computer solves a problem that would take classical supercomputers a significantly long time to handle). In 2023, its team unveiled the first logical qubit prototype that demonstrated quantum error correction.\n2. Amazon You may have also heard about my second quantum computing stock. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reigns as the 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce and cloud services. The company is also an important player in quantum computing.\nIn one sense, Amazon is a \"picks-and-shovels\" play in quantum computing. Amazon Braket is a quantum cloud computing service that's available on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It supports researchers in developing quantum computing algorithms, testing quantum hardware, and creating quantum software.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Amazon isn't just operating on the sidelines in the quantum computing arena. The company is also busy developing its own quantum technology. In February 2025, Amazon announced a new quantum computing chip called Ocelet.\nOcelet could be a key breakthrough in the goal to build large-scale quantum computers. The chip can reduce the costs of quantum error correction by up to 90% versus current approaches. It uses \"cat-qubits\" (named after physicist Erwin Schrödinger's famous quantum thought experiment, which featured a cat) that can suppress some types of quantum computing errors.\n\n3. Microsoft My third pick is also a household name. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a technology giant with products including the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office 365 productivity software, and Xbox gaming systems. Like Alphabet and Amazon, Microsoft is also investing heavily in quantum computing.\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform offers a \"Quantum Ready\" program. This program helps leaders develop strategies to mitigate the potential negative impact of quantum computing on their organizations while leveraging the opportunities that quantum computing presents.\n\nArguably, the most crucial quantum computing initiative for Microsoft is its topological core architecture. This architecture utilizes topological superconductors, also known as topoconductors, which are a special type of matter that falls neither into the solid, liquid, nor gas states.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced the first quantum computing chip that uses topoconductors – Majorana 1. Microsoft believes the technology used in Majorana 1 presents a key step toward fitting 1 million or more qubits on a single chip.\nCommon denominators You may have noticed several commonalities among my top three quantum computing stocks to buy in December. They're all so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. They all operate widely used cloud platforms. All three companies are leaders in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlso, none of them are pure-play quantum computing companies. I think that's critical. No one knows for sure which quantum technologies will emerge as the biggest winners. Investing in a single pure-play quantum computing stock could be a highly risky proposition.\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have ample financial flexibility to acquire smaller rivals that show exceptional promise. If you want to profit from quantum computing but not take on a significant amount of risk, these megacap stocks are the way to go, in my opinion.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "1 Stock I'd Buy Before Tesla in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Tesla is hovering around an all-time high despite its core automotive business posting poor results.\nNvidia’s high margins enable it to invest aggressively in research and development without draining its cash flows.\nNvidia is a far better value than Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been on a tear -- hitting an all-time high on Dec. 15 . Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This Nuclear Stock Could Turn $1,000 Into $100,000\n\nSteven Porrello, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:25 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OKLO\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Oklo is a pre-revenue nuclear start-up that needs a NRC license to turn its idea into profits.\nThe company's microreactors could be a billion dollar idea if data center demand stays hot.\nTo grow one-hundred-fold, Oklo would have to become a trillion dollar company, which would likely only happen over a long period.\n10 stocks we like better than Oklo ›\n\nEarly investors in Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) who held on to their shares through the flat and rocky months of 2024 have seen a triple-digit gain since last year.\nIndeed, after losing more than 50% on its first day of trading (May 10, 2024), Oklo stock has rebounded more than tenfold, beating heavyweight AI favorites, like Nvidia , Palantir , Alphabet , and Microsoft , plus the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the same period.\nPut differently: If you had invested $10,000 in Oklo near the end of its May 10 debut, you would have about $100,000 right now. At one point in October, that same holdings would have been worth well over $200,000.\nWith a 280% gain on the year, Oklo may seem like old news. And yet if you believe in the future of artificial intelligence (AI), this stock's incredible run may only be the beginning.\nCan Oklo turn $1,000 into $100,000? Oklo isn't your average nuclear company.\nThe Sam Altman-backed start-up is designing a microreactor (\"Aurora powerhouse\") that can supply on-site power to remote areas.\nUnlike traditional nuclear power plants, which are expensive and can take a decade to finish building, Oklo's Auroras are factory-built and can be deployed faster than large reactors. That makes them ideal for data center operators, who often build in rural areas where grid power would be severely strained by their electricity needs.\n\nBut here's something to consider: If Oklo turns $1,000 into $100,000, it would join the trillion-dollar club. That's a pretty tall order for any start-up, let alone one that will operate in the utilities sector.\nWhile a one-hundred-fold gain isn't impossible, it would likely take years, if not decades, to happen. Meanwhile, the utilities sector is expected to grow only about 5% annually. Even if Oklo can turn on its first plants, it would need to scale beyond that utility sector growth.\nAt this point, I'd size an Oklo position small; if its reactors work, it could matter over the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oklo right now? Before you buy stock in Oklo, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oklo wasn’t one of them.

Uh, you emphasize strong seasonal trends, Eric, you point out solid earnings growth, you talk about, you do raise some some questions on your radar as well. What what would those be Eric as we head into 2026?\n00:17 Eric\nWell, first off, uh always a pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me, Josh.\n00:22 Eric\nUh there's a lot of great momentum.\n00:27 Eric\nI think um the questions are simply one, valuation, right? And we and we know that.\n00:36 Eric\nUm concentration, right? We know that the top 10 stocks in the S&P now account for 40% of the value of the S&P. That is\n00:47 Eric\nas concentrated uh as we've ever been.\n00:52 Eric\nAnd we actually know from history, if you go back to 1970, once we get over 30% in those top 10, going out the next five years, there's a 95% chance\n01:06 Eric\nthat the other 490 are going to outperform those top 10.\n01:12 Eric\nUm so I'm concerned about concentration. And then of course with AI, look, AI is real. This is a game changer. It's going to change the world.\n01:20 Eric\nBut a lot of this is definitely focused on Open AI. Open AI is is right out there saying, hey guys, we're going to be losing money for a long time. We might be profitable\n01:30 Eric\n2030.\n01:32 Eric\nIs the market going to be patient and wait while all this capX happens and money's being invested and we're not seeing that ROI yet.\n01:43 Eric\nIs the market going to be patient with that? You know, I'm not sure. I think there's going to be a lot of volatility.\n01:49 Speaker A\nIn terms of that AI trade, Eric, looking ahead in 2026, do you think about, listen, I'll I'll just, I'll stick with the Mag 7 as a basket or do you feel like no, I'm going to have to be more discerning next year. It's going to get tougher. Maybe it's the mag 3 or four.\n02:04 Eric\nUh it's a great question. I mean, look, we're not stock pickers at the Wealth Alliance, we're more asset allocators.\n02:10 Eric\nI think if you own the Mag 7, I think you're going to be okay. Let's not forget, the Mag 7 the last decade has grown its earnings 20-fold.\n02:19 Eric\nThat is a 35% compounded versus about 8% for the S&P.\n02:25 Eric\nI think it's okay to have Mag 7 exposure and you should. My concern is when I see a lot of new clients are coming into the firm, they're just loaded up in tech.\n02:34 Eric\nAnd they're not diversified. And I'm I just hit my 40th anniversary doing this. and I remember 1999 and 2000, seeing the same thing. People just loaded up in the same stocks. That was just gets me all nervous. Stay diversified.

These Tech Stock Experts Think So.\n\nAaron McDade\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 12:34 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nKey Takeaways Wedbush analysts wrote Monday that Microsoft stock has room to run in 2026 after it has recently pulled back from October's record highs.\nInvestors are still \"underestimating\" how much value Microsoft's Azure cloud computing services could add as the AI industry continues to grow, the analysts said.\n\nMicrosoft ( MSFT ) stock has set a number of records this year, and analysts think that trend can continue well into 2026.\nWedbush analysts led by Dan Ives, who is particularly bullish on the artificial intelligence trade , wrote Monday that Microsoft remains undervalued as the new year approaches. The analysts reiterated their \"outperform\" rating and $625 price target, upside of nearly 30% from the stock's Monday levels.\nThe analysts wrote that investors are still \"underestimating\" how much Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service could grow if the AI industry continues expanding as Wedbush expects. The analysts project that Azure and Microsoft's Copilot AI assistant could add $25 billion in sales to Microsoft's results through fiscal 2026.\n\nWhy This Matter to Investors Despite a recent pullback in tech stocks , some analysts are still saying that the AI trade should be able to continue providing growth next year as the biggest tech companies keep spending tens of billions on the infrastructure behind AI.\n\"We believe Microsoft is set to have a massive 2026 and the stock is a compelling buy at these levels,\" the analysts wrote, as they expect Microsoft to play a \"foundational role\" in the next stages of AI development.\n\nWedbush analysts aren't alone, as all but one of the 13 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rate Microsoft a \"buy,\" with the other calling it a \"hold.\" The average price target among those analysts is $635, even higher than Wedbush's target, indicating the expectation that Microsoft stock will rise well above the records it set earlier this year.\nThe AI trade has had a rocky last several weeks as investors and analysts have raised an increasing number of questions over whether the circular nature of funding in the AI industry is sustainable, and when tech companies could potentially see a return on the billions they have invested in the tech.\nMicrosoft shares were little changed in late-afternoon trading Monday. They have gained about 15% since the start of the year, but are roughly 10% below their most recent record closing high , set just before the company's last earnings report in October.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Heavy AI Investment Positions Microsoft (MSFT) for Strong Growth Beyond 2026\n\nVardah Gill\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 9:28 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is included among the 13 Top Tech Stocks Paying Consistent Dividends .\nPixabay/Public Domain\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is making a massive push into artificial intelligence. In December 2025, the company announced plans to spend $17.5 billion on AI development in India, along with more than $5.4 billion in Canada over the next few years. Those commitments come on top of the already substantial investments Microsoft plans to make in the U.S. and other markets.\n\nThis level of spending is expected to translate into solid revenue and profit growth starting in 2026 and continuing beyond that. Over the next five years, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s expanding AI footprint could meaningfully reshape the long-term outlook for its stock.\nAI is set to remain a major growth engine for the company. During its fiscal first quarter, the company poured nearly $35 billion into capital expenditures, the highest quarterly total in its history, as it positions itself to capture demand across AI infrastructure and services. Management has said capital spending will continue to rise in 2026, laying the groundwork for sustained growth in the years ahead.\nAI is not the only opportunity on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s radar. The company also sees quantum computing as the next major catalyst for its cloud business. While still early, it represents a potentially enormous market over the long term.\n\nBack in 2023, CEO Satya Nadella laid out an ambitious target to push Microsoft’s annual revenue beyond $500 billion by 2030. That would imply sales growth of nearly 80% from the more than $280 billion the company generated in fiscal 2025, underscoring just how central these long-term technology bets are to Microsoft’s strategy.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Unless we see something dramatic over the next week, Amazon will end up as the worst-performing “Magnificent 7” constituent this year.\n\nWhile the coveted group did not have a roaring year with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta Platforms (META) underperforming the S&P 500 Index and Tesla (TSLA) only slightly nudging ahead following the recent rally, Amazon’s underperformance stands out.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nAnalysts Are Hot on the Foldable iPhone.

Sign Up Now!\nAmazon entered 2025 as a “top pick” for many brokerages—a distinction it had held for the previous couple of years. However, the stock failed to live up to expectations and is on track to underperform the broader markets by a wide margin. Notably, while Amazon shares outperformed in the preceding two years, riding the artificial intelligence (AI) mania, they underperformed in 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn fact, over the last five years, AMZN is up just 43%, which is just about half of what the average S&P 500 Index constituent has delivered. Meanwhile, brokerages are quite bullish on the stock’s prospects, and BMO, TD Cowen, Wedbush, Truist, J.P. Morgan, and Evercore ISI have named Amazon as a “top idea” or equivalent for 2026.\nWhy Did Amazon's Stock Underperform in 2025? Barring brief periods, particularly following the Q3 2025 earnings release, Amazon stock underperformed peers this year. There’s a lot that’s making markets apprehensive, which is reflected in the stock’s price action. Here’s a brief overview:\nRising Competition : Amazon is facing competitive pressure from legacy brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart (WMT), as well as Temu and Shein, which have become popular with their ultra-low-cost merchandise.\nMarket Share Losses in AWS : While Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) growth has rebounded, it continues to lose market share to Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), which are growing at a much faster rate.\nCapex Taking a Toll on Cash Flows : The Amazon story was never about GAAP earnings, but the stellar cash flows that it generated. However, the burgeoning capex, particularly towards building the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, is taking a toll on the company’s free cash flows. Amazon’s trailing 12-month free cash flows plunged to $14.8 billion at the end of Q3 2025, while the corresponding numbers in 2024 and 2023 were $47.7 billion and $21.4 billion, respectively. While AI could drive Amazon’s growth and help the company lower costs, intermittent concerns over tech companies’ ability to monetize their AI investments have put pressure on their stock prices.\nImpact of AI : While AI would positively impact nearly all aspects of Amazon’s business, there are concerns that the rise of third-party AI shopping agents is a threat to Amazon’s lucrative and fast-growing digital advertising business.\n\nStory Continues\nAMZN Stock 2026 Forecast Brokerages are upbeat on Amazon’s forecast, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 56 analysts covering the stock. AMZN’s mean target price of $295.80 is 30% higher than the current price levels. The stock trades even below the most pessimistic target price of $230, while the Street-high target price of $360 represents a potential upside of 58%.\nShould You Buy Amazon Stock? While Amazon’s e-commerce growth in developed markets might have plateaued, the company should be able to bolster its growth. Amazon is doubling down on groceries and has even launched a private food brand, which would help it increase its total addressable market. Haul, which is Amazon’s platform to take on the likes of Temu and Shein, should also help the company earn additional revenues. Amazon's business-to-business (B2B) platform, Amazon Business, is another potential growth driver to watch, and it is already running at a multi-billion-dollar gross revenue run rate.\n\nPrime should also help drive Amazon’s growth next year, and we might even see the company hike prices. The company has started cracking down on Prime password sharing and should ramp up ads in 2026, which would help it increase its digital ad business.\nAMZN stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 31.7x, which looks quite tempting to me even as earnings growth might be tepid over the next couple of years on higher depreciation expenses emanating from the AI capex.\nI find Amazon among the best structural growth stories, as the company is a play on several high-potential sectors like e-commerce, cloud, streaming, digital advertising, and now even AI. I have been bullish on Amazon stock for quite some time, and while I did book some profits earlier this year, I have used the recent dip to add more shares.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: AMZN, META, AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOG.

Caterpillar outpaced six of the seven Magnificent 7 tech stocks.\nCaterpillar’s Energy and Transportation segment drove gains with Q3 power generation sales up 31% from AI data center demand.\nCaterpillar raised guidance to 5% to 7% annual sales growth through 2030 with adjusted operating margins reaching 21% to 25% at $100B sales.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate market headlines in 2025, many of the stocks most closely tied to the technology -- the Magnificent 7 stocks of Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) -- have shown volatility or lagged.\nSix of the seven have experienced mixed or negative returns at points throughout the year, with broad concerns over valuations, sector rotations, and sustainability weighing on performance. In contrast, one unexpected name has outperformed six of the seven: Caterpillar ( NYSE:CAT ), the heavy equipment manufacturer. On a total return basis (capital appreciation plus dividends), Caterpillar trails only Alphabet by about one percentage point or so as of last Friday's close. Yet less than two weeks ago, Caterpillar was even ahead of Alphabet in year-to-date gains.\n\nSo, how is a traditional industrial company easily outpacing some of the world's largest tech giants?\nCaterpillar's Strong 2025 Performance Caterpillar has risen approximately 61% in 2025 compared to Alphabet's roughly 62 % gain, leaving the heavy equipment manufacturer just behind the tech behemoth and with the potential to surpass it by year-end.\nIt also stands as the top performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , edging out Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) in second place, and significantly outpacing the rest of the Magnificent 7, with only Nvidia, which has returned almost 35% this year, coming close.\n\nWhat Is Doing the Heavy Lifting for Caterpillar Caterpillar's outperformance stems from strong demand in its Energy and Transportation segment, particularly generators and power equipment for AI data centers and infrastructure. Partnerships like the one with Vertiv ( NYSE:VRT ) for data center power solutions have highlighted Caterpillar's role in supporting AI growth.\nEnduring global infrastructure spending and mining demand have also contributed, but the real standout has been in power generation and oil and gas, segments that saw sales rise 31% and 20%, respectively, in the third quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nTariffs posed challenges earlier in the year, with estimated costs up to $1.8 billion in 2025, but the company mitigated impacts through cost controls and pricing adjustments. Still, inflation continues to weigh on margins, with consolidated operating profits slipping 3%.\nHowever, these drivers that carried Caterpillar higher in 2025 appear sustainable into 2026, with analysts pointing to ongoing AI-related power needs and potential infrastructure rebounds. The risks of tariff escalation and cyclical slowdowns in construction or mining remain present.\n\nKey Takeaway Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar often deliver the best returns when bought during downturns to capture upside as cycles recover. Caterpillar began rising in late 2022, gained strongly in 2023, and delivered about 24% returns in 2024. In 2025, shares faltered on tariff fears in April before doubling from those lows.\n\nAt this point in the cycle, Caterpillar remains a solid holding, with tailwinds from AI infrastructure and global demand likely continuing into next year and beyond. Their strength allowed management to raise guidance for the next five years.\nCaterpillar is now expecting 5% to 7% compound annual sales growth through 2030, adjusted operating margins of 15% to 19% at $60 billion in sales and 21% to 25% at $100 billion in sales, and $6 billion to $15 billion in free cash flow—a 20% to 50% increase over prior estimates. While valuations are elevated with the stock trading well above its five-year average across most metrics, the structural shift toward power generation supports further gains rather than an imminent peak.\nAI's strong tailwinds will likely carry Caterpillar stock beyond the typical cyclical decline, and though investors should monitor economic indicators and keep an eye on whether AI is truly in a bubble phase or not, taking profits now may be premature given the outlook.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Analysis-How AI boom is pressuring videogame console industry in race for memory chips\n\nZaheer Kachwala\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:06 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nNTDOF\n\nBy Zaheer Kachwala\nDec 22 (Reuters) - Videogame console sales were already under pressure owing to tariff turmoil and weak consumer spending. Now a surge in the prices of memory chips is threatening to make the devices costlier in what could be ​another blow to the industry.\nDemand for dynamic random access memory - chips used in Sony's PlayStation , Microsoft 's Xbox and the Nintendo ‌Switch 2 - has exceeded supply as the tech sector races to build out artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThat has pushed memory makers to favor higher-margin data-center chips, tightening supply for consumer devices. ‌Micron, for instance, is pulling the plug on its long-running Crucial brand, a staple for PC builders and hobbyists.\nMemory chips are central to gaming systems, enabling quick load times, smooth frame rates and overall performance - features that matter most in big-budget and proven titles.\nCONSOLE MAKERS FORCED TO RAISE PRICES\nWith rising costs related to chips, console makers and other gaming-hardware producers may be forced to raise prices as the devices are usually sold on razor-thin margins, ⁠analysts and industry experts said.\nBut such a move ‌could sharply dent demand after tariff-driven hikes earlier this year, they warned. Sony, Xbox, and Nintendo did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCyberPowerPC, a maker of high-end gaming PCs, announced price increases late last month. Others such ‍as Dell Technologies and China's Lenovo also plan to raise prices, according to reports.\n\"Since memory makes up about a fifth of a PC's total component costs, this hits manufacturers hard,\" said Joost van Dreunen, games professor at NYU's Stern School of Business.\nHe said sticker prices for consoles could rise another 10% to 15% ​over the next year or two, while PC prices could climb as much as 30% as memory prices rise again in 2026.\nANOTHER PRICE ‌JUMP, DELAYS LIKELY IN 2026\nCounterpoint Research estimated in November that memory prices were likely to rise 30% in the last three months of 2025 and possibly 20% more early next year, on top of the 50% hikes so far this year.\n\nEven though major console makers such as Sony typically lock in some inventory years ahead and can extend device life-cycles to blunt the impact, some industry watchers have downgraded their forecasts for the console market.\nTrendForce expects growth of just 5.8% this year, down from a previous view of 9.7%, and sees a 4.4% decline in 2026 ⁠compared with an earlier forecast of a 3.5% drop.\nSpending on gaming hardware fell 27% ​last month, while unit sales for the period were the weakest since 1995 as ​the average price of a new gaming device hit a record for the month, according to industry tracker Circana.\n\nStory Continues\nAverage selling prices for consoles have increased this year as tariffs on imports hike manufacturing costs, while a lack of ‍system-selling games leaves aging hardware without a ⁠major catalyst for growth.\nHigh-end consoles such as the Xbox Series X retail for around $650, while the PlayStation 5 Pro is priced around $750, according to company announcements.\n\nHigher component costs could also complicate the roll-out of devices including the Steam Machine, a PC gaming platform ⁠from Counter-Strike creator Valve, which was expected to go on sale next year.\nValve did not respond to a request for comment.\nCompanies will move cautiously if videogame spending pulls ‌back more broadly, Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said. \"So instead of risking poor sales, we might see console makers delay releases.\"\n(Reporting ‌by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Arun Koyyur)\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

On December 16, JPMorgan cut Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG)’s price target to $410 from $422 while maintaining an Overweight rating, following updates to its model after the Q3 results.\nSuwin/Shutterstock.com\nOn December 11, Constellation Energy Corporation received the “Energy Deal of the Year” award at the 2025 Platts Global Energy Awards. The award honors Constellation’s 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which enabled the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center (Unit 1) in Londonderry Township, Pennsylvania. The Crane Clean Energy Center, formerly known as Three Mile Island Unit 1, was retired in 2019; its restart will generate 835 megawatts of carbon-free nuclear energy.\n\nUnder the agreement, Microsoft will purchase the full output to match electricity consumption at its data centers in the PJM Interconnection market. It will also support overall grid capacity and reliability. The project is expected to create more than 3,000 jobs, contribute over $16 billion to Pennsylvania’s GDP.\nIn a separate update, on December 5, Constellation reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division, clearing the final regulatory hurdle to acquiring Calpine Corporation. The company had announced in January 2025 a cash-and-stock deal to acquire the privately held company, but the transaction was delayed by the DOJ’s civil antitrust lawsuit. This settlement allows the deal to proceed, which will create the largest US power generation fleet.\n\nConstellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is an American energy company that produces and sells electricity, natural gas, and sustainable energy solutions across the United States.

      "Content": "Do Nebius Mega Deals Increase Customer Concentration Risk?\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:53 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMETA\n\nMSFT\n\nNebius Group N.V. NBIS has rapidly positioned itself as a major player in the AI cloud and infrastructure market, driven by unprecedented demand for GPU capacity and long-term contracts with large technology companies. On the third-quarter 2025 earnings call, management highlighted the signing of two transformative mega deals: a contract with Microsoft valued between $17.4 billion and $19.4 billion and a new agreement with Meta worth approximately $3 billion over the next five years.\n\nThe company emphasized that demand continues to outstrip supply, with all available capacity sold out each quarter. Management noted that every time new capacity is brought online, it is immediately absorbed by customers. These agreements provide long-term visibility into revenue and utilization as Nebius accelerates its expansion toward 2.5 gigawatts of contracted power and up to 1 gigawatt of connected capacity by the end of 2026. The company expects these deals to be a key contributor to its ambition of reaching $7 billion to $9 billion in annualized run-rate revenue by the end of 2026, with more than half of this target already booked.\nHowever, Nebius has tightened its full-year group revenue outlook to a range of $500 million to $550 million from the previous guidance of $450 million to $630 million. The company expects to land in the middle rather than the upper end, primarily relating to the timing of capacity coming online. Although the company expects adjusted EBITDA to turn slightly positive at the group level by year-end 2025, it will remain negative for the full year.\n\nThe company is grappling with macroeconomic uncertainties, rising expenses and heavy capital spending. For 2025, Nebius has raised its capital expenditure guidance from approximately $2 billion to around $5 billion. Elevated capital expenditure levels pose a risk if revenue growth fails to keep pace with the company’s capital intensity, particularly in an environment where AI demand may fluctuate amid competitive pricing pressures and evolving regulatory frameworks.\nMoreover, the scale of the Microsoft and Meta contracts inevitably raises customer concentration risk. A substantial portion of future revenue growth is expected from these two customers beginning in 2026, with Microsoft reaching full annual run-rate contribution from 2027 and Meta largely at full run rate in 2026. This reliance means that performance, timing of deployments and ongoing demand from a small number of very large customers could have an outsized impact on Nebius’ financial results. While these mega deals provide stability, financing advantages and rapid scale, they also heighten exposure to concentration, making continued diversification across start-ups, enterprises and other large customers critical to balancing growth with risk.\n\nStory Continues\nTaking a Look at NBIS Competitors’ Deals & Partnerships CoreWeave, Inc .’s CRWV revenue backlog expanded sharply to $55.6 billion in the third quarter, up 271% year over year and nearly doubling sequentially. The growth was fueled by large, long-term agreements with major customers like OpenAI, Meta and other hyperscalers, highlighting robust demand for AI-centric cloud infrastructure. The company’s momentum was also supported by multi-billion-dollar partnerships with NVIDIA, including industry-first rollouts of GB300 NVL72 systems and RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances, giving CRWV an early advantage in frontier AI and real-time workloads. Moreover, the company is expanding through acquisitions, adding Marimo in October after earlier deals such as OpenPipe and Weights & Biases.\n\nAlphabet Inc. ’s GOOGL investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI are growing. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, and increasing number of data centers are helping Google to expand its cloud footprint worldwide. Alphabet is benefiting from its partnership with NVIDIA in the cloud. Google Cloud was the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA’s B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs and will be offering its next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Introduction of 2.5 flash, Imagen 3 and Veo 2 are noteworthy developments. Recently, Alphabet’s Google Cloud and NextEra Energy announced an expanded partnership to develop multiple new gigawatt-scale data center campuses with accompanying generation and capacity.\nNBIS’ Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates Shares of Nebius have gained 212.3% in the past year compared with the Internet – Software and Services industry’s growth of 30.7%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation-wise, Nebius seems overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of F. In terms of Price/Book, NBIS shares are trading at 4.68X, higher than the Internet Software Services industry’s 3.83X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NBIS’ 2025 earnings has seen a downward revision over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNBIS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Only Seen Twice in 153 Years: History’s Clear Warning for the Stock Market in 2026\n\nDavid Beren\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAAPL\n\n^GSPC\n\nIt should go without saying that the S&P 500 has been riding high over the last few years and has delivered one of the most impressive runs in market history. Over the past three years, the index has surged a whopping 80%, driven in part by artificial intelligence, falling interest rates, and ongoing corporate earnings growth. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolio balances have reached levels that might have seemed all but impossible to achieve a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 surged 80% over three years. This has occurred only twice before in 153 years.\nPrevious instances (1920s and 1990s) both preceded market crashes of 49% to 89%.\nThe S&P 500 forward P/E sits around 21 to 22. This is roughly 40% above historical averages.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnfortunately, any exceptional performance like this in the market comes with something of a warning label. A three-year gain of this kind of magnitude with the S&P 500 has only occurred twice in the last 153 years of stock market performance. The first, the 1920s bull market, and the late 1990s tech boom both ended in devastating fashion with the Great Depression and the dot-com bust.\nThankfully, history doesn't always guarantee repetition, but it does signal that a pattern could be forming in the sense that markets performing this well for this long could be a giant warning sign for investors. As 2026 gets closer, understanding what happened in the last two instances now just feels like understanding basic risk management.\nThe S&P 500's Ultra-Rare 3-Year Surge: What History Predicts If you look closely, the 80% gain over the last three years roughly translates to anywhere between a 21% and 27% annualized return, which is more than double the S&P 500's long-term average of approximately 10% in gains. The rarity of this occurrence cannot be overstated, considering it has only happened twice in the 153 years, with the 1927-1929 bull market rising 95% and the tech boom between 1995 and 1998 increased 85%.\n\nIf you're seeing giant warning signs today, it's because you know that what is taking place in the market today, performance-wise, is eerily familiar to what has happened before. In the 1920s, you had a market that boomed because of cars becoming more readily available, on top of electrification taking place across cities and non-cities alike. It was the promise of a new era, and the 1990s boom was driven by something similar, as the internet was being heralded as something that was going to transform everything we knew about technology, communication, and just about everything in between.\n\nStory Continues\nThe 80% surge between 2023 and 2025 is following the same pattern, and this is what is causing warning bells to go off. Unsurprisingly, AI is being heralded as the transforming technology, and valuations have expanded significantly as a result. This all feels very much like 1999, and AI is being labeled as the kind of technology that will change everything, just as the internet was heralded as something transforming, and electricity absolutely did transform everything. This all comes together with a clear message in that when the stock market delivers this kind of three-year performance, it precedes major reversals.\n\nAnalyzing the Historical Precedents for 2026 During the 1927 to 1929 surge, the market continued to climb well into September before it all came crashing down in October. The initial 48% decline happened between October and November, but the real impact was felt from the end of 1929 all the way toward the end of 1932, when the total market collapse took place, dropping the market by around 89% in total. Crazily enough, it would take 25 years before the market would return to its 1929 highs.\n\nFast forward to the 1995-1998 surge, the market continued to climb higher and higher through 1999 before it peaked in March 2020. The rest, as they say, is well-known history, as the dot com crash erased 49% of the S&P 500's value in just 2.5 years. The Nasdaq fell 78% and its overall recovery would take another seven years before returning to its starting levels.\nThe takeaway here is that there is a consistent pattern that was followed in both of these cases, in that the market didn't crash immediately after a three-year surge. The market rally actually, and surprisingly, as you look back, continued for an extra year, delivering even more gains before a severe decline. In 2026, the cautionary tale is that history suggests either the market delivers this year as one full of gains or one that shows indicators of a reversal. Suffice it to say, neither scenario paints a pretty picture, as even if investors get one more year of gains, the crash starts and wipes all the gains out.\n\nIs an AI Bubble Forming? The Biggest Risk Heading into 2026 If you have been watching the current level of AI enthusiasm, and who hasn't been, the parallels between today and previous tech bubbles are almost impossible to ignore. We are already seeing just how transformative AI can be, something that echoes what the country saw during the electrification of the 1920s and the internet in the 1990s. Sadly, real technology, no matter how transformative, doesn't always prevent bubbles. If anything, it actually enables a bubble to take place by trying to justify massive corporate valuations.\n\nThe biggest takeaway right now is that the signs of a bubble transformation are present, and they are present across multiple indicators. Valuations for AI-centric stocks are assuming nearly flawless execution and sustained growth continuing for years into the future. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), and Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) are all investing billions, tens of billions into AI infrastructure without a clear signal of what the return could be. As a result, the S&P 500's forward P/E is sitting around 21 to 22, approximately 40% above historical averages.\nIf you are a retail investor, and many of us are, this is something to be very aware of, as is options trading, which has seen its volume surge in AI stocks. Reddit, in particular, has come alive with discussion, especially on places like r/WallStreetBets, in a way that feels almost too familiar if you were on message boards during the dot-com era in 1999. On top of social media conversation, you also have companies adding \"AI\" anywhere they can in their core descriptions or even their company names to try and boost valuations. This closely mirrors when companies added \".com\" to their company names in the late 1990s to try to jump on a similar trend.\n\nThe bottom line is that any catalyst for a stock reversal could come from slower-than-anticipated AI adoption or even disappointing returns from AI investments. Add to all of these concerns over an economic slowdown resulting from tariffs, or even inflationary concerns, depending on how the Fed handles interest rates. This all comes together in what could be a perfect storm for either a massive buying shift or a major selling rally, and any instance of the latter is going to feed on itself as panic selling grabs hold until the bottom falls out.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Investors Heavily Search Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Here is What You Need to Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 6:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has lost 0.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $3.86 per share, indicating a change of +19.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $15.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14.4%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.33 indicates a change of +17.4% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory Continues\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS Revenue Growth Forecast While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $80.16 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $325.18 billion and $372.35 billion estimates indicate +15.4% and +14.5% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History Microsoft reported revenues of $77.67 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.4%. EPS of $4.13 for the same period compares with $3.3 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $74.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.62%. The EPS surprise was +13.15%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMicrosoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Oracle May Not Be Able to Build Its Michigan Data Center After All. Should You Sell ORCL Stock Now?\n\nEbube Jones\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:51 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nOWL\n\nInvestors have been reminded lately that artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure investments are not always straightforward. Oracle (ORCL) stock slid following mixed financial results and a sharp increase in its capital spending outlook to roughly $50 billion for fiscal 2026. Shares dropped 12% after earnings and then another 6% following reports that a key $10 billion funding plan for a new Michigan AI data center with Blue Owl Capital had stalled, raising fresh concerns about rising debt and ongoing cash burn.\n\nThis is happening even as the global data center market is projected to generate more than $527 billion in revenue in 2025, which helps explain why the biggest tech companies are moving quickly to secure capacity for AI workloads.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nAnalysts Are Hot on the Foldable iPhone. Should You Buy AAPL Stock Before Apple’s Next Big Product Launch?\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now!\n\nFor Oracle, the Michigan project is a major part of that push, and the apparent breakdown of the Blue Owl deal has shifted what was supposed to be a headline AI partnership into a bigger debate about funding risk and balance-sheet pressure.\nWith ORCL now trading well below its 52-week high, the question is hard to ignore: If Oracle cannot confidently finance big AI data centers like Michigan, should investors treat this pullback as a rare buying opportunity, or is it a signal to sell the stock before the story gets worse? Let’s find out.\nHow Strong Is Oracle’s Foundation? Oracle is a major enterprise tech company that sells business software and cloud services, including cloud applications, AI-based analytics tools, and database systems used by large companies and government agencies.\nOver the past month, Oracle shares have slipped 14.9%, as investors have reacted to the funding setback for the Michigan data center. Still, over the past 52 weeks, the stock is up 13.7%, which shows the longer-term view on Oracle’s move deeper into the cloud is still strong.\nIn terms of valuation, Oracle trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33x, which is higher than the tech sector average of about 24x. That indicates that investors are still pricing in strong growth. Oracle also returns cash to shareholders through dividends, with a 1.9% dividend yield, a most recent payout of $0.50 per share, and a forward payout ratio of 32.7%, supported by regular quarterly dividends.\n\nStory Continues\nFinancially, Oracle’s fiscal 2026 second-quarter results were strong in several important areas. Total revenue rose 14% year-over-year to $16.1 billion, and cloud revenue jumped 34% to $8 billion. Cloud Infrastructure (IaaS) revenue grew 68%, while Cloud Applications (SaaS) revenue increased 11%. GAAP earnings per share (EPS) surged 91% to $2.10, and remaining performance obligations climbed to $523 billion, up 438%, pointing to a much larger backlog of future business. With $12.4 billion in annual net income and a $551 billion market capitalization, Oracle’s financial base still looks solid even after the recent stock drop.\n\nWhat’s Driving Oracle Now Oracle Health and Life Sciences is focusing on specific areas like cancer care, and its work with the Cancer Center Informatics Society (Ci4CC) makes that clear. The two organizations aim to move AI forward in oncology care and research by combining Oracle’s technology with Ci4CC’s Initiatives Program and its national network of NCI-Designated and Community Care Cancer Centers.\n\nThe plan is to co-design an electronic health record (EHR) for cancer care, while also creating programs that will connect day-to-day oncology care physicians with clinical research. That includes combining clinical and genomic data for personalized medicine, using AI to accelerate clinical trial innovation and drug development, building real-world evidence frameworks, and supporting precision oncology platforms.\nOn the enterprise software side, Oracle is also working on making it easier for customers to use AI inside the tools they already use. The company launched the Oracle Fusion Applications AI Agent Marketplace, which aims to help Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications customers find and deploy validated, partner-built AI agents directly in their own environments.\n\nOracle is also deepening its manufacturing and supply chain work through its collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT). The two companies announced an integration blueprint that links Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain and Manufacturing (SCM) workflows with live production data captured through Azure IoT Operations and Microsoft Fabric. The goal is to automate key supply chain processes and improve data-driven decision-making by sending shop-floor insights straight into enterprise workflows.\nWhat Lies Ahead for ORCL At Oracle’s next earnings release, analysts are looking for quarterly EPS of $1.35. For the following quarter, that estimate rises to $1.55, and analysts expect EPS of $5.82 for the full fiscal year 2026. If those numbers pan out, that would reflect year-over-year EPS growth of 14.4% for the current quarter and 14.8% for the next quarter, with a much bigger 32.3% jump expected for fiscal 2026.\n\nEven with concerns that the stalled Blue Owl funding could slow the Michigan data center build, Bank of America analyst Brad Sills is sticking with a “Buy” rating. He did lower his price target to $300, but he says Oracle is “entering its largest phase of AI infrastructure build‑out” and is basically “paying the price to invest in growth.” JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy is more cautious, maintaining a “Neutral” rating and cutting his target to $230, but he still calls Oracle a “key beneficiary of AI infrastructure demand.” He points to remaining performance obligations now above $500 billion as a sign that hyperscalers and frontier AI customers are committing to long‑term Oracle Cloud capacity.\nStepping back, among 41 analysts surveyed, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy,” and the average price target is $306.19.\nIn Conclusion Given the Michigan funding uncertainty and Oracle’s sharp capex ramp, this is not the kind of setup that demands an automatic sell, but it does argue against chasing the stock aggressively until financing and spending visibility improve. The business itself still appears fundamentally intact, with fast cloud growth and a massive backlog pointing to durable demand, and Wall Street still sees sizable upside, so a full exit looks premature unless the risk profile no longer fits. Most likely, shares will stay volatile in the near term and could drift sideways or lower on any new capex or funding headlines. However, the bias over the next six to 12 months still tilts higher if Oracle proves it can fund capacity expansion without stressing the balance sheet.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Oracle, Microsoft and Alphabet are part of Zacks Earnings Preview\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 5:49 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 22, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week&rsquo;s list includes Oracle ORCL, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\nBreaking Down Oracle, the AI Trade & Outlook for Tech Earnings Oracle's relationship with OpenAI has become a never-ending source of market angst, as the tie-in reminds many of questionable vendor-financing practices from the late 1990s. Tied to Oracle's OpenAI exposure are questions about the company's financial health and its ability to fund its data center expansion plans.\n\nThe December 10 th quarterly release, which was, at best, mixed, added to Oracle's woes. Oracle missed consensus revenue and margin expectations and raised its capital expenditure (capex) outlook. The stock's negative reaction to this quarterly release contrasted with the prior quarterly release in early September, when the stock jumped by more than a third.\nWhen investors typically think of the big Tech players, like Microsoft or Alphabet or even Oracle, they instinctively assume fortress balance sheets and ungodly amounts of operating cash flows. Those assumptions are misplaced in the case of Oracle, as it has been relying lately on the debt markets to fund its ever-rising data center buildout-related capital expenditures.\nOracle's capex outlay totaled $21.2 billion in fiscal year 2025 (FY ends in May), up from $6.7 billion in FY 2024. The company generated $20.8 billion of free cash flow in FY 2025, meaning it was free cash flow negative for the year. The expectation for the current year (FY 2026) is that Oracle's $50 billion capex budget is approximately double the amount of operating cash flows it is expected to generate. In fact, Oracle will most likely be free cash flow negative in fiscal year 2027 as well, which means that it will need to tap the debt market to fund its capex budget.\n\nThe chart below provides an overview of Oracle's debt load and the comparable measure for Microsoft. Long-term debt as a share of the company's total capital is not the only, nor even the best, measure of balance-sheet leverage, but it is a simple and easily understood indicator of financial flexibility.\nWe should keep in mind that Oracle isn't in any financial distress, as it currently has an 'investment grade' credit rating from the rating agencies. That said, its credit rating of BBB (from S&P) is the lowest rung of investment-grade credit rating.\nWe are all familiar with the market's concerns about the broader 'AI trade', which ranges from the 'bubble narrative' at one extreme to reasonable questions about the monetization of AI investments at the other.\n\nStory Continues\nThe ongoing issues in Oracle shares are not a reflection of those AI concerns, as the chart above clearly shows, but rather a function of the aforementioned OpenAI exposure and concerns about its financial health. We would have seen far more solidarity from Microsoft and Alphabet with Oracle in the above period had the overriding issue been the 'AI trade'.\n\nOne key performance metric that took center stage in the Oracle story is Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), which reached $523 billion this quarter, up $455 billion from the preceding quarter. For reference, the comparable number for Microsoft reached $392 billion in the company's latest quarterly report.\nThink of this key performance metric as Oracle's backlog or future revenues had jumped by an eye-popping $317 billion in the preceding quarter. The bearish narrative on Oracle notes that $300 billion of the preceding quarter's $317 billion RPO growth was attributable to OpenAI.\nIt is this elevated level of customer concentration risk, coupled with Oracle's relatively stretched financial health, that has been weighing on the stock lately.\n\nA fair assessment of the evolving Oracle story is that while there is undoubtedly more uncertainty and risk associated with its RPO (or backlog) getting converted into future revenues, particularly say relative to Microsoft or Alphabet, it is nevertheless a key element of the company's growth profile and its status as a critical player in the emerging AI world.\nIn other words, no one should be under the impression that this is a second coming of Enron or other such dubious characters from our collective past.\nThe chart below provides a 10-year comparison of Oracle valuation relative to Microsoft, using the forward 12-month P/E multiple. As you can see here, Oracle shares broke away from their historically discounted valuation to Microsoft only in May 2025, but have now reversed all of those gains.\n\nThis 10-year history shows that Oracle shares have commanded as high as 66% premium (September 2025) to Microsoft share to a 55% discount (November 2020), with a 10-year median of 28% discount. The stock is currently trading at an 18% discount to Microsoft shares (23.6X for Oracle vs. 28.7X for Microsoft).\nThe lower discount relative to history makes sense when seen in the context of Oracle's emerging status as a key player in the emerging AI world. Oracle bulls would likely argue that there is no justification for the 'new Oracle' to trade at a discount to Microsoft going forward, notwithstanding its balance sheet vulnerability.\nTech Earnings Outlook The Tech sector has been critical to driving aggregate earnings growth for the last 9 quarters (since 2023 Q3), and the above chart shows that it is expected to continue playing that role in the coming periods as well.\nPlease note that the Tech sector has been consistently enjoying positive estimate revisions over the past year, and we saw the same trend at play since the start of 2025 Q4 in October. In fact, had it not been for positive revisions to Tech sector estimates, aggregate Q4 earnings estimates for the S&P 500 index would be modestly down since the start of October.\n\nEarnings Outlook for the Mag 7 The Mag 7 group is generally seen as mega-cap Tech players. However, in the Zacks sector classification system, two of the Mag 7 players are not part of the Zacks Tech sector; we place Amazon in the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla in the Zacks Auto sector. Both of these sectors are Zacks innovations, as the 'official' Standard & Poor's industry classification does not have stand-alone sectors for the retail and auto spaces.\n\nFor 2025 Q4, the Mag 7 group is expected to produce +16.9% earnings growth on +16.4% higher revenues.\nThe group's 2026 earnings are currently expected to be up +16.6%, followed by +18% in 2027.\nThe important factor to keep in mind is that the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 26.4% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2026, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 11.7% in 2019. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 34.6% weight in the index.\n2025 Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard Last week's Oracle earnings report was for the company's fiscal quarter ending in November, which we and other research organizations count as part of the December-quarter tally. Oracle is hardly alone in this respect, and quarterly results from the likes of FedEx, Nike, Adobe, and others fall in the same category. Through Friday, December 19 th , we have seen such Q4 results from 18 S&P 500 members.\n\nTotal earnings for these 18 index members are up +32.2% from the same period last year on +9% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.\nFor a detailed view of the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>>Q4 Earnings: Tech Expected to Remain Growth Driver\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

On December 12, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella confirmed the statewide rollout of MahaCrimeOS AI.\nKen Wolter / Shutterstock.com\nThe artificial intelligence-powered platform designed for the Maharashtra police is built on Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service and Microsoft Foundry. The platform was developed in collaboration with the Maharashtra Government and its MARVEL initiative. It leverages next-generation AI to tackle the new wave of complex, evolving cybercrimes, fast-tracking the fight against cybercrime nationwide.\nIt also augments officers with AI tools to ensure cases are resolved faster and more efficiently. They will be able to upload unstructured inputs, including cybercrime complaints, chat messages, and bank records.\nOn December 11, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced partnerships with Cognizant, Infosys, TCS, and Wipro to deploy over 200,000 Copilot licenses, following a $17.5 billion AI investment plan. The move embeds Microsoft 365 Copilot into core operations, boosting productivity and innovation, while positioning these firms as leaders in human‑AI collaboration. Puneet Chandok, President of Microsoft India & South Asia, said the companies are shifting from trials to full‑scale adoption, setting a global benchmark for enterprise transformation.\n\nMeanwhile, Kirk Materne of Evercore reiterated Microsoft is a Buy on December 8 and set a $640 price target. While Philip Securities lowered its price target for the stock to $540 from $550, it maintains an Accumulate rating, impressed by the company’s aggressive investments in cloud and AI infrastructure.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops and sells software, cloud services, personal devices, and video games, known for Windows, Office (Microsoft 365), Azure cloud platform, Xbox gaming, Surface hardware, and AI integration.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

But this year’s standout performer isn’t riding on just hype. AppLovin (APP) is achieving tremendous growth by quietly scaling its platform using artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology while producing significant cash flow. Furthermore, its inclusion in the S&P 500 Index signals that expectations are rising.\n\nAppLovin stock has surged 122% year-to-date (YTD), outperforming most in the “Magnificent Seven” group. Let’s see if now is a good time to buy APP stock.\nMore News from Barchart Chevron Could Raise Its Dividend Next Month - CVX Stock Looks Too Cheap\nAs Google Launches Gemini 3 Flash, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold GOOGL Stock?\nAnalysts Are Hot on the Foldable iPhone.

Sign Up Now!\nA Strong Quarter Built on Core Momentum AppLovin, valued at $244.88 billion, is a technology company that helps mobile app creators sell, monetize, and expand their apps, particularly in mobile gaming. Simply put, AppLovin serves as a behind-the-scenes growth engine for mobile games, linking advertisers with users and assisting developers in scaling quickly, making it one of the most powerful ad-tech platforms in mobile gaming today.\n\nOne of the most significant recent achievements was AppLovin's inclusion in the S&P 500 ($SPX). However, management claims that this puts pressure on the company to enhance its performance to meet expectations. Its third-quarter results indicate that AppLovin is on the right track. AppLovin runs an ad platform that helps app developers find new users. Its AI-powered software shows ads to people most likely to download and engage with an app, which drives higher returns on ad spend for advertisers.\nIn Q3, total revenue increased 68% year-on-year (YoY) to $1.4 billion, owing mostly to model upgrades in the core gaming sector. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.16 billion, up 79% YoY, with an outstanding margin of 82%. Net income rose 92% to $836 million. Core models delivered multiple incremental improvements, and the company’s Max supply-side platform continued to grow at very healthy rates. In the quarter, international expansion also advanced faster than expected. The company extended foreign traffic to advertising marketing websites or shops ahead of schedule, increasing its reach and creating the framework for a broader global advertiser base.\n\nStory Continues\nIn October, the company launched its self-service platform and referral form. Management stated that early data revealed that the platform had efficiently filtered out low-quality ad accounts, and spending from self-service advertisers was already increasing by around 50% week over week. Looking ahead, the company's priority continues to be model improvement. It intends to continue refining onboarding routines while incorporating additional AI agents into workflows to provide a seamless experience for new advertisers.\n\nFree cash flow totaled $1.049 billion, a 92% increase YoY, indicating both profitability and disciplined capital management. The balance sheet also remains robust. The company ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Shareholder returns remain a priority for the company, with approximately 1.3 million shares repurchased for $571 million during the quarter. The company also increased its share repurchase authorization by an additional $3.2 billion.\nLooking ahead, management guided continued growth. For 2025, revenue is expected to be between $1.57 billion and $1.6 billion, representing 12% to 14% sequential growth. Adjusted EBITDA is projected between $1.29 billion and $1.32 billion, with margins holding strong in the 82% to 83% range. Analysts are forecasting rapid top-line and bottom-line growth. Revenue is expected to rise 22.1% to $5.7 billion, while earnings are projected to more than double (up 106.4%) in 2025. Looking ahead to 2026, both revenue (up 35.6%) and earnings (up 55.6%) are expected to keep growing at an unusually fast pace. Trading at 47x forward 2026 earnings, the stock is not cheap. Investors are already paying a premium for future growth, meaning the market expects these forecasts to be met or exceeded.\n\nWhy This Growth Story Stands Out AppLovin’s growth story is defined not just by rapid top-line expansion but by extraordinary margins, strong cash generation, disciplined capital returns, and a clear AI-driven roadmap. Furthermore, inclusion in the S&P 500 is already bringing broader visibility and long-term investors into the stock. If the company delivers on the aggressive growth and earnings expectations, the valuation can be justified.\n\nIs APP Stock a Buy on Wall Street? APP stock has all the love on Wall Street, holding an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Recently, BTIG raised its price target for APP to $771 from $705 while reiterating a “Buy” rating, signaling growing confidence in the stock’s outlook. The firm is constructive on the gaming and gambling end markets heading into 2026.\n\nOut of the 26 analysts who cover APP stock, 19 rate it as a “Strong Buy,” while two rate it as a “Moderate Buy,” four rate it a “Hold,” and one rates it a “Strong Sell.” The average target price of $720.46 is just a hair above current levels. However, the high price estimate of $860 implies that the stock could rally by up to 20% over the next 12 months.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Microsoft Corp's Intrinsic Value\n\nGuruFocus News\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nIn this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nIs MSFT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nAs of 2025-12-22, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $454.72. It's currently trading at a price of $485.92. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -6.86%. The company is fair valued.\nThe model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\n\nAssumptions Term\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$14.55\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.17%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 20.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years.

All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nNavigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener , you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

      "Content": "Why Microsoft Is a Great Income Stock Despite a 0.77% Yield\n\nWilliam Dahl, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 2:37 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nKey Points Microsoft has raised its dividend every year since 2010, growing payouts by 600% in 15 years.\nAnyone who bought shares in January 2010 is enjoying an 11.8% yield on cost today.\nA combination of growing earnings, accelerating share buybacks, and hefty cash flow from operating activities points to Microsoft continuing its prodigious dividend growth in the years ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nWhen mapping out compound growth scenarios, one trick to use is the \"Rule of 72.\" To see how long it takes an amount to double at a fixed growth rate, divide 72 by the rate of increase for your answer. For instance, capital growing at 8% a year will double in nine years, while an investment compounding at 10% a year will double in roughly seven.\nThe Rule of 72 is imprecise, but it gets you close. Even if the doubling takes a few years, you would be surprised at how that can add up over an investing lifetime. For instance, the S&P 500 's average annual gain since 1975 is 12.2% each year, including dividends. Using the Rule of 72, that's a double roughly every six years, which doesn't sound life-changing. Yet it's enough to turn every $100 invested 50 years ago into $33,854.\n\nThe Rule of 72 jumped out at me when researching historical dividend growth for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . Since it began raising its dividend in 2010, Microsoft's payouts have grown by an average annual rate of 13.9%. While only a 15-year streak, that's faster than the S&P 500's average annual growth over the last half century, and it's powerful enough for Microsoft's dividend to have increased by 600% since 2010.\nWhat if one of the world's top five most profitable and powerful companies keeps up this average dividend growth? Here's what the numbers say.\nHow Microsoft's 0.77% yield could snowball Microsoft's 600% dividend growth since 2010 means that anyone who bought shares in January of that year would now be enjoying a yield on cost of 11.8%. This means that for every $10,000 invested then, investors would be collecting $1,180 in 2025. That's not a bad outcome when the same $10,000 invested in 10-year Treasuries today would pay $414, while the average S&P 500 company would pay $117 in dividends on that capital.\n\nIf Microsoft's dividend grows at the same average annual rate as it has over the last 15 years, its 0.77% yield would mushroom into 5.39%. That's a lower yield on cost than 2010 investors are seeing today. However, there are three reasons to think that, far from plateauing or slowing down, Microsoft's dividend growth could exceed its 15-year average going forward.\n\nStory Continues\nStart with net cash flow from operations. This metric, sometimes abbreviated as CFO, measures the cash a company generates from regular business operations, showing the amount of cash left over after salaries, overhead, energy bills, and all other operating costs are paid. After keeping the lights on, it's what a company has left over for acquisitions, dividends, and share buybacks.\n\nIn Microsoft's case, net operating cash flow totaled $136.16 billion in fiscal year 2025. That's compared to the $24.07 billion in net operating cash flow that the company logged in the 2010 fiscal year.\nSo CFO has grown by 466% since 2010, a slower rate of growth than Microsoft's 600% dividend hike in that time frame. That would seem to augur for the dividend growth slowing down from here.\nBut wait. Microsoft has also bought back 1.5 billion of its own shares since 2010, as part of an aggressive share buyback program. In 2010, its dividend was mailed out to shareholders owning 8.9 billion of the shares outstanding between them. In 2025, there are now just 7.43 billion shares outstanding.\nThese extra 1.5 billion shares in 2010 mean that Microsoft was then paying 19.2% of its CFO to cover its dividend. In 2025, it's paying 19.8% of its CFO to do so. These near-identical numbers show that Microsoft has as much breathing room now to grow its dividend as it did in 2010.\n\nBut there's more. The share buybacks haven't been linear, and Microsoft's share buyback activity took off like a rocket last year when its board approved a $60 billion repurchase program. It's one of the biggest buyback programs in history, with only Apple , Alphabet , and Meta announcing larger ones.\nFinally, there's earnings growth to consider. Last quarter, Microsoft grew earnings by 12.5% year over year. While not a blockbuster figure, its stellar operating margin of 48.9% means that roughly half of those increased earnings are available to go toward the dividend should management choose. And this earnings growth is roughly in line with the average annual growth rate for its dividend that Microsoft has achieved since 2010.\n\nA lot can happen in 15 years, but Microsoft's near-identical percentage of CFO going toward its dividend as in 2010, combined with its historic share buyback program and solid earnings growth, makes its future dividend growth likely to match or even exceed the 600% growth it's notched since then. Income investors should not be deterred by the stock's current yield of under 1%, given its likelihood of becoming a formidable income stream in just a few years' time.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now?

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\n\nOmdia: Global Cloud Infrastructure Spending Hits $102.6 Billion, up 25% in Q3 2025\n\nBusiness Wire\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 1:05 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TTGT\n\nMSFT\n\nLONDON, December 22, 2025 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--According to new research from Omdia, global spending on cloud infrastructure services reached $102.6 billion in Q3 2025, representing 25% year-on-year growth. Market momentum remained stable, marking the fifth consecutive quarter in which growth has remained above 20% highlighting continued strength across the sector. This performance reflects a significant shift in the technology landscape as enterprise demand for AI moves beyond early experimentation toward scaled production deployment. As this transition accelerates, hyperscalers are increasingly redirecting competition away from the incremental gains in model performance and toward platform-level capabilities that support multi-model deployment and ensure the reliable operation of AI agents in real-world environments.\n\nIn Q3 2025, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud maintained their market rankings from the previous quarter, collectively accounting for 66% of global cloud infrastructure spending. Together, the three hyperscalers delivered 29% year-on-year growth.\nAWS’s growth reaccelerated to 20% year on year quartering Q3 2025, marking its strongest performance since 2022. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud also maintained strong momentum, each delivering year-on-year growth of more than 35%. As enterprise demand for AI continues to materialize, growth in the cloud market is shifting from early-stage experimentation and pilot projects toward the scaled deployment of enterprise-grade AI applications. Backlog levels among leading cloud providers continued to rise, with AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud all reporting further increases in Q3 order backlogs, reinforcing the market’s underlying resilience and healthy demand environment.\n\nHyperscalers’ AI strategies are evolving from a primary focus on incremental model performance toward more platform-driven and production-ready approaches. Enterprises are no longer evaluating AI platforms solely on model capabilities, but increasingly on their support for multi-model strategies and agent-based applications.\nThis shift is accelerating hyperscalers’ move toward platform-level AI capabilities. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are integrating proprietary foundation models with a growing range of third-party and open-weight models, leveraging managed AI platforms and services such as Amazon Bedrock, Azure AI Foundry, and Vertex AI’s Model Garden to expand support for multi-model adoption.\n\"Collaboration across the ecosystem remains critical,\" said Rachel Brindley, Senior Director at Omdia . \"Multi-model support is increasingly viewed as a production requirement rather than a feature, as enterprises seek resilience, cost control, and deployment flexibility across generative AI workloads.\"\n\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, hyperscalers are stepping up investment in agent build-and-run capabilities, as real-world deployment continues to prove more complex than early experimentation suggested. \"Many enterprises still lack standardized building blocks that can support business continuity, customer experience, and compliance at the same time, which is slowing the real-world deployment of AI agents,\" said Yi Zhang, Senior Analyst at Omdia . \"This is where hyperscalers are increasingly stepping in, using platform-led approaches to make it easier for enterprises to build and run agents in production environments.\"\n\nRecent launches such as AWS AgentCore and Microsoft’s Agent Framework reflect this direction, providing standardized foundational capabilities that help enterprises more efficiently build, deploy, and operate AI agents in production settings.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) led the global cloud infrastructure market with a 32% share and 20% year-on-year revenue growth. This performance was supported by easing compute supply constraints, alongside incremental demand driven by its partnership with Anthropic. AWS reported a total backlog of $200 billion by the end of Q3, underscoring sustained demand. Amazon Bedrock continues to evolve rapidly, expanding both model choice and platform capabilities, including support for Claude 4.5, 18 managed open-weight models, and enhanced Guardrails and Data Automation features. At AWS re:Invent 2025, AWS also introduced the Nova 2 model family, Nova Act, and Nova Forge, strengthening its end-to-end enterprise AI stack from models to agents and automation. In addition, AWS expanded its regional footprint with the launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region in September, adding three availability zones to support local data residency and low-latency workloads.\n\nMicrosoft Azure remained the world’s second-largest cloud provider in Q3 2025, holding a 22% market share and delivering robust 40% year-on-year revenue growth. In October, Microsoft renewed its partnership with OpenAI, further anchoring OpenAI’s AI development and deployment on Azure. Azure AI Foundry continued to broaden its model ecosystem, supporting multiple frontier foundation models, including Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Haiku 4.5. The platform now serves more than 80,000 customers and provides access to over 11,000 models. In October, Microsoft also introduced the Microsoft Agent Framework, enabling enterprises to build and orchestrate multi-agent systems. Customers such as KPMG are already applying the framework to enhance audit processes, with these production-grade AI deployments contributing to Azure’s overall growth momentum. In parallel, Microsoft continued to invest in regional infrastructure, announcing plans in November to expand its Azure cloud region in Malaysia and to launch a new Azure datacenter region in India in 2026.\n\nGoogle Cloud remained the world’s third-largest cloud services provider in Q3 2025, delivering strong 36% year-on-year growth and increasing its market share to 11%. Growth was primarily driven by enterprise AI offerings, with quarterly revenue from this segment reaching several billion dollars. As of September 30, Google Cloud reported a backlog of $157.7 billion, up sharply from $108.2 billion in Q2, underscoring strengthening demand visibility. On the platform side, Vertex AI’s Model Garden continued to expand its large-scale AI model portfolio, adding new models such as multimodal variants from the Gemini 2.5 series, Kimi K2 Thinking, and DeepSeek-V3.2. In October 2025, Google Cloud also launched Gemini Enterprise, an AI platform designed for enterprise customers that integrates the Gemini model family with enterprise-grade AI agents, no-code development tools, and security and governance capabilities.\n\nOmdia defines cloud infrastructure services as the sum of bare metal as a service (BMaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and container-as-a-service (CaaS) and serverless that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users via the Internet.\nABOUT OMDIA\nOmdia , part of Informa TechTarget, Inc.

According to an estimate by McKinsey, companies need to invest a staggering $5.2 trillion by 2030 on data centers equipped to handle AI processing loads.\n\nHowever, technology is only part of the story. Power is quietly becoming a major factor in driving the AI revolution because AI data centers consume an enormous amount of electricity. As a result, leading energy infrastructure companies such as NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) are emerging as leaders in powering the AI revolution.\nPartnering with AI leaders NextEra Energy owns the country's largest electric utility (Florida Power & Light) and one of the largest energy infrastructure development companies (NextEra Energy Resources). The energy resources segment owns and develops energy infrastructure, including electricity transmission lines and power generation facilities, to support third-party demand.\n\nThe company has become a key partner of choice for technology companies to help power their AI strategies over the past year. In October, NextEra Energy signed a new collaboration with Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to accelerate nuclear energy deployment in the U.S. As part of the partnership, NextEra Energy will restart its dormant Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa to support Google's growing power needs. The tech titan has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) to purchase the bulk of the power produced by the facility upon its return to commercial service in the first quarter of 2029.\nNextEra and Google also announced a significant expansion of their energy and technology collaboration in December. They will partner on developing multiple gigawatt (GW)-scale data center campuses in the future with accompanying generation and capacity. NextEra will supply the energy expertise, while Google will bring its data center development capabilities to the partnership.\nNextEra Energy is also working with Meta Platforms to help power its AI operations. Meta Platforms recently signed 11 PPAs and two energy storage agreements. NextEra will develop several solar energy projects for Meta, totaling 2.5 GW of power-producing capacity.\n\nStory Continues\nMassive power deals Brookfield Renewable is a leading global renewable energy producer . It sells the power it produces to utilities and large corporations under long-term PPAs.\nEarlier this year, Brookfield announced a first-of-its-kind Hydro Framework Agreement with Google. The cloud giant will purchase up to 3 GW of carbon-free hydroelectric power from the company in the future, marking the largest-ever hydropower deal. The first two 20-year PPAs represent over $3 billion of power and cover Brookfield's Holtwood and Safe Harbor hydroelectric facilities in Pennsylvania, which have a combined generating capacity of 670 megawatts.\n\nBrookfield also signed a first-of-its-kind global renewable energy framework with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) last year. The five-year agreement will see Brookfield develop over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity for the technology giant in the 2026 through 2030 time frame across the U.S. and Europe. It's eight times bigger than the largest single corporate PPA ever signed. The deal will provide Microsoft with a pipeline of renewable energy capacity to support growing demand for its cloud and AI services. The companies have the potential to expand their collaboration to Asia-Pacific, India, and Latin America in the future, as well as to new or impactful carbon-free energy sources beyond wind and solar.\nAdditionally, Brookfield Renewable has an investment in Westinghouse Electric, a nuclear technology company . The U.S. Government recently signed a strategic partnership with Westinghouse to build at least $80 billion of new nuclear reactors in the country using the company's technology. These plants will help support the country's growing AI power needs.\n\nThe power behind the AI revolution NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable are two of the world's largest clean power producers. They have the electricity production capacity and development capabilities to meet the growing power needs of AI. That's leading tech titans Google, Meta, Microsoft, and others to join forces with these energy companies to help fuel the AI revolution. These deals will provide technology companies with the energy they need, while potentially powering robust total returns for investors in NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable in the coming years.\n\nShould you buy stock in NextEra Energy right now?

Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

If the Reuters report is confirmed in the not-so-distant future, the deal won't simply be about getting in on the hottest name in AI.\n\nIt would mean that Amazon is willing to put real money behind its chips, cloud, and reputation, even if it has long been seen as behind in the AI arms race.\nIt's also an uncommon move for Amazon that will have ramifications for chip stocks, cloud computing, and the planned OpenAI IPO .\nAmazon's AI problem and how $10 billion could fix it Amazon is a cloud powerhouse thanks to AWS, but when it comes to high-profile AI projects, it has fallen behind Microsoft and Google.\nYears ago, Microsoft put $13 billion into OpenAI. Google is sponsoring both its own DeepMind subsidiary and its competitor Anthropic.\nAs for Amazon, people have spoken a lot about its Trainium and Inferentia chips and released services like Bedrock, but investors weren't very impressed — until now.\n\nRelated: Nvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nIf Amazon invests in OpenAI, it will get one of the world's most valuable AI workloads.\nOpenAI previously inked a $38 billion cloud agreement with AWS , but this arrangement might go much further and require OpenAI to employ Amazon's proprietary processors. That goes directly against Nvidia 's supremacy and strongly supports Trainium's claim of low cost and high performance.\nIt also has a number of strategic uses:\nGets AWS a big-name AI customer.\nShows Wall Street that Amazon's story about bespoke silicon is true.\nTells clients that Amazon is decreasing the cost of AI computing.\nPortrays Amazon as a legitimate \"AI arms dealer\" with tangible infrastructure.\nAnd the market saw it. The revelation made Amazon's stock rise, and some experts say this is when investors started to see Amazon as a real \"AI play.\"\n\nA high-stakes deal, just as the cloud gets crowded The timing couldn't be better. AWS is still the leader in cloud market share , but it is seeing more competition from Microsoft, Google, and fast-growing \"neo-cloud\" firms such as CoreWeave and Crusoe.\nBig companies, including Capital One, have voiced concerns about the escalating prices of AWS. Some people are even thinking about switching suppliers or creating their own AI infrastructure.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nBank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nBank of America sets AI stocks to buy list for 2026\n\nStory Continues\nA collaboration with OpenAI helps Amazon respond to that criticism. It sends a message: AWS isn't simply selling computing power; it's constructing the infrastructure for AI on a large scale and at a lower cost.\nWhat if OpenAI trains GPT-5 on Trainium chips instead of Nvidia processors? That's a big gain for believability.\n\nIt's also a way to protect investments. Anthropic has already gotten money from Amazon. It might now be supporting both of the top independent AI laboratories, which would guarantee its victory.\nRelated: Intel CEO deals spark controversy, debate\nMore broadly, the deal:\nStrengthens Amazon’s grip on multi-billion dollar AI workloads.\nUndermines \"single-cloud\" dependence criticism.\nAdds pressure on neo-cloud startups and rivals like Oracle.\nCould slow defections from AWS by enterprise clients concerned about cost.\nA trillion-dollar AI IPO? Amazon wants in The other side? OpenAI's plan to go public.\nOpenAI may now accept money from people who don't work for Microsoft after a big restructuring in 2025.\nAmazon entering the cap table gives it more weight, which probably raises OpenAI's value toward the projected $1 trillion IPO goal in 2026 or 2027.\nAmazon isn't only about using the cloud. It's a gamble that OpenAI will be a key player in the next tech era. And if OpenAI leverages Amazon's infrastructure to get there, that's even better.\n\nRelated: US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding\nThe acquisition does, however, pose certain dangers. Some experts are concerned about how \"circular\" these investments are: Big Tech gives money to startups, which then spend that money on Big Tech's platforms. That kind of thing has happened before in tech bubbles.\nBut Amazon's effort is plainly different in one way. It's not simply buying enthusiasm; it wants to sell the infrastructure that makes it work.\nHere’s why the deal could reshape the landscape:\nAmazon would join Microsoft as a top-tier OpenAI partner.\nOpenAI gains multi-cloud flexibility (Azure, AWS, Oracle).\nTrainium adoption could reduce Nvidia dependence.\nOpenAI gets a financial runway to delay IPO if needed.\nAmazon may lock in rights to exclusive OpenAI features.\nRelated: Box office is booming in 2025 but Netflix’s $82.7 billion surprise raises alarms\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "The 3 Deep Learning Stocks That Could Be Worth 50% More by 2027\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 8:10 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Microsoft owns 27% of OpenAI, with massive Azure cloud contracts in the pipeline.\nAlphabet has come back to be a recognized leader in generative AI, with a big lead in autonomous vehicles.\nIntel has begun its turnaround, which should only accelerate in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n2025 is nearly over, and despite the strong year, many investors are biting their fingernails over the prospects for 2026. Will the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continue despite talks of a bubble and debt investors recently balking at funding large-scale data centers? Whom will President Donald Trump pick as the new Federal Reserve chair, and will the new nominee be independent?\n\nShort-term concerns always dominate headlines and investors' mindsets in the moment, but real long-term outperformance comes from taking a broader mindset and looking at the big picture.\nAssuming the AI buildout continues apace and AI usage increases over the next several years -- and there's no evidence AI adoption is slowing at all -- these three artificial intelligence stocks still look like they have upside. In fact, there's a case for 50% upside for each in 2026.\n1. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up a solid 15% year to date in 2025 but has pulled back in recent months. Investors have grown nervous over OpenAI's technical moat and ability to fund massive spending commitments. That's important for Microsoft, which is both a 27% owner of OpenAI and a cloud provider for $250 billion of OpenAI cloud computing commitments -- a result of the 2025 negotiations by which OpenAI converted into a for-profit company.\n\nThat ownership and cloud pipeline would be highly bullish for Microsoft, but doubt has crept in regarding OpenAI's lead in generative AI in recent months. Rival Anthropic has shown significant enterprise growth, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) released its impressive Gemini 3 model in November.\nStill, the fear may be misplaced. It doesn't seem likely that the AI revolution would be dominated by a single model builder, but rather by a cohort of winners in an oligopoly. That's how both the semiconductor and cloud computing sectors have evolved. The AI large language model (LLM) market will likely follow a similar path.\nAfter all, Alphabet was regarded as a loser in the AI race as recently as this year, only to retake the lead. OpenAI is certainly not going away, and this week's investment in OpenAI by Amazon appears to indicate that at least some astute executives and investors still believe in the company.\n\nContinua a leggere\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley sell-side analyst Keith Weiss just upgraded Microsoft stock, giving it a $650 price target, good for 35% upside from the current price. His analysis and conversations with management indicated that Azure AI demand is stronger than initially thought and that Azure AI's gross margins can expand with scale as more revenue is generated over the next two years. Furthermore, Weiss noted that his estimates don't even contemplate the full OpenAI contract, which could lead to further upside.\n\n2026 should also see the introduction of Microsoft's next-generation AI chip, named Braga. According to reports this past summer, the chip was initially planned for 2025, but a redesign pushed back its introduction by six months. If Microsoft can develop an impressive in-house-designed chip, as Alphabet and Amazon have, that could lead to even more optimism.\n2. Alphabet Speaking of Alphabet, it would definitely be possible for both Microsoft and Alphabet to appreciate 50% in 2026. While Alphabet has had the best year of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, up 62% on the year, Alphabet also entered the year as the cheapest of the bunch. In fact, despite this year's rise, it's still the second-cheapest of the bunch .\n\nComing into the year, investors were nervous that AI chatbots could disrupt Alphabet's Search business. However, that doesn't seem to be happening. Search paid clicks grew by 2%, 4%, and 7% in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively, showing a reacceleration after Alphabet introduced AI Mode into Search in May.\nWith the November release of Gemini 3, Alphabet has seemingly taken the lead for the moment in the AI race across several benchmarks. What's even better is that Gemini 3 was trained on Alphabet's homegrown Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Following the Gemini release, other major companies are now looking to buy or lease TPUs from Alphabet or its cloud unit, Google Cloud.\n\nEven Alphabet rival Meta Platforms is reportedly considering using TPUs, according to late-November press reports. And just last Friday, Reuters reported a massive cloud deal worth over $10 billion between cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks and Google Cloud.\nThat all bodes very well for Google Cloud, which has been an incredibly underrated part of Alphabet's business. Google Cloud has now reached scale, with a $60 billion revenue run-rate and an almost $5 billion operating profit run-rate as of the last quarter. Growth accelerated by 34% for that business in Q3, accompanied by margin expansion.\nSo not only could the Cloud unit become a second major profit center beyond ad revenue, but 2026 could also bring exciting developments for Waymo. Waymo is now delivering over 1 million autonomous rides per month, with a significant lead over competitors in scaling. Next year could bring about more disclosure around Waymo's revenue or valuation, which could add yet another major business to Alphabet's expanding empire.\n\n3. Intel Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has had an even better year than Alphabet or Microsoft, up 83.6% on the year thus far. Of course, Intel was trading at a practically distressed price heading into 2025, below its book value and without a CEO. And despite the 2025 surge, its market cap is still far, far lower than all the supposed AI winners of today.\n\nMeanwhile, 2026 is shaping up to be an exciting year. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who joined the company in March, will begin to make his presence felt more noticeably. The all-important 18A node -- the node at which Intel predicts it will either equal competitors or regain its technology leadership in the industry -- will begin to deliver product. 18A has just begun high-volume manufacturing this quarter, with the first 18A product, Panther Lake, set to enter the laptop market in January.\nSuccess on 18A in the form of better revenue and margins could yield external customer wins for future nodes 18AP and 14A. Already, technology pundits are reporting that major companies such as Apple , Nvidia, and even Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices are looking to potentially use the 14A node for their server central processing units (CPUs), according to analysts for China research firm GF Securities.\n\nIf an external customer were to commit to Intel's 14A node, which is expected to be released in 2027 or 2028, there could be confirmation of the customer win during 2026. After all, there has already been a flurry of positive reports on 14A technology and the adoption of Intel's EMIB packaging technology over the past month or so.\nIf investors come to believe that Intel has pulled even or ahead in terms of process technology, financial results improve with 18A manufacturing, and/or Intel announces a significant external 18AP or 14A customer win for its foundry, there is still considerable upside left in the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

President Trump announced the news in the Oval Office in January, flanked by the respective companies’ leaders, including Oracle chair Larry Ellison — a move that sent the stock soaring .\n\nAI optimism continued to push Oracle shares higher following its quarterly earnings reports in June and September , with AI-driven deals set to push cloud segment revenue to $166 billion in 2030. The stock’s surge in September briefly made Ellison the world’s wealthiest person .\nBut AI euphoria quickly gave way to doubt. Investors became increasingly concerned over the rising use of debt to fund tech firms’ AI spending, just as the payoff of that spending remains hotly debated. Those concerns are evidenced in the budding demand for Big Tech credit default swaps (CDS) — financial contracts that act as insurance by letting investors bet on the likelihood that a company will default on its debt.",

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nLa historia continúa\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

It owns three of the four most popular social media networks , which lets it collect user data and target media content. That advantage has made Meta the second-largest adtech company in the world. But the company also dominates the nascent smart glasses market.\n\nMeta is using artificial intelligence (AI) -- from custom chips to proprietary large language models -- to improve user engagement and advertising conversions across its portfolio of industry-leading social media. It is also developing a superintelligence system to integrate with its smart glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says glasses will be our \"primary computing devices\" in the future.\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look quite reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842 per share. That implies 28% upside from its current share price of $658.\nMicrosoft: 30% upside implied by the median target price Microsoft has a strong competitive position in two markets: enterprise software and cloud computing. It is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for its office productivity suite Microsoft 365, its portfolio also includes popular applications for business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning. Meanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud services provider.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft is monetizing AI across its software and cloud businesses. CEO Satya Nadella says customers are adopting Microsoft 365 Copilot (a generative AI assistant) faster than any new product. Additionally, its entire family of Copilot applications topped 150 million monthly active users in the quarter ended in September, up from 100 million in the quarter ended in June.\n\nMicrosoft Azure has gained about 3 percentage points of market share since the AI boom started, despite compute capacity constraints. However, the company is building out its data center capacity faster than any other cloud provider, according to Satya Nadella. Azure plans to double its data center footprint in the next two years.\nWall Street expects Microsoft's earnings to increase at 14% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 35 times earnings look somewhat expensive, though investors eager to own the stock could still buy a small position today. Among 62 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 30% upside from its current share price of $485.\nAmazon: 32% upside implied by the median target price Amazon has a strong competitive position in three industries: e-commerce, advertising, and cloud computing. It runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. The company dominates retail media, one of the fastest-growing verticals in the broader digital advertising market. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services.\n\nIn retail, Amazon has built an artificial intelligence shopping assistant called Rufus that is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales in 2025. Shoppers who engage the conversational chatbot are 60% more likely to make a purchase. Amazon has also developed generative AI tools that improve inventory placement, robot productivity, and last-mile delivery.\nMeanwhile, AWS is introducing artificial intelligence features at a rapid clip. In the last few months, the company added tools to Bedrock AgentCore that help developers build and deploy generative AI agents. AWS also added agents for software development, security fixes, and performance monitoring. And it expanded its portfolio of pre-trained models.\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 32 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 73 analysts, Amazon has a median target price of $300 per share. That implies 32% upside from its current share price of $228.\n\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Is All Set to Hit a $5 Trillion Market Cap in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \" Magnificent Seven \" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\nAI is set to accelerate Microsoft's growth There is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.\n\nStory Continues\nFrom cloud computing to personal computing to productivity tools, Microsoft has infused AI across all of its business segments. The good part is that its AI tools are gaining traction among customers. For example, Microsoft management remarked on the company's October earnings conference call that Copilot, its chat-based AI assistant, is now being used by 90% of the Fortune 500 companies.\n\nEven better, Microsoft says that a \"large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more seats.\" Even coders and cybersecurity specialists are using Microsoft's Copilot to enhance productivity and improve the effectiveness of their tools. So, it won't be surprising to see Microsoft cornering a bigger share of the office productivity tools market in the long run, as compared to its current share of 30%.\nOn the other hand, the demand for Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure is outpacing supply. This explains why Microsoft intends to double its data center capacity over the next couple of years to support the rapidly growing demand from customers looking to build AI tools on its platform.\nIt is worth noting that Microsoft's commercial remaining performance obligations (RPO) stood at a massive $392 billion at the end of the previous quarter, up by 51% from the prior year. This metric refers to the total value of contracts yet to be fulfilled. The size of Microsoft's RPO is larger than the $294 billion revenue it recorded in the trailing 12 months. Additionally, its RPO grew at a faster pace than the 18% revenue jump Microsoft recorded last quarter, indicating that it is winning new business at a faster rate than it is fulfilling existing contracts.\n\nAs such, don't be surprised to see Microsoft's growth accelerating in 2026, putting the tech giant on track to attain a $5 trillion market cap.\nHere's how it can reach that milestone Microsoft currently has a market cap of $3.6 trillion. So, it needs to appreciate by another 41% from current levels to reach the $5 trillion milestone. Analysts expect a 16% jump in Microsoft's revenue in the current fiscal year to $327 billion, followed by a 15% increase in the next one to $376 billion.\n\nHowever, Microsoft's massive RPO and the pace of growth in this metric indicate that it could outpace those expectations. Assuming Microsoft's revenue grows by 20% in the next fiscal year to $392 billion (from this year's estimated revenue of $327 billion) and it trades at 13 times sales at that time, in line with its current price-to-sales ratio, its market cap will land at just over $5 trillion.\nSo, this AI stock seems poised to deliver healthy gains in the coming year, which is why investors may consider adding it to their buy list for the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Should You Buy Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks In 2026?\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft have struggled in the last few months, bringing their valuations down with them.\nOther AI stocks like Amazon still look cheaper at today's prices.\nCyclicality risks should keep investors away from Nvidia stock in 2026. Amazon looks like a better buy.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence ( AI ) trade began to sputter in late 2025. Stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are flat since August of this year after seemingly going up at an insatiable rate for three straight years. Similar results have occurred for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shareholders, with its stock actually down over the last six months.\nInvestors have begun to lose faith in the growth-at-any-cost mindset among these AI start-ups even though underlying revenue growth is still strong for the sector.\nDoes that make now a perfect time to buy AI stocks for 2026? Let's take a look at the numbers and find out.\nHigh multiples and fast-growing businesses Stagnant share prices have helped some of the fundamentals for these AI stocks catch up to their share prices. Last quarter, Nvidia's revenue grew 62% year over year to $57 billion, with net income up 65% to $31.9 billion. Microsoft's revenue was up 18%, with 24% growth in operating income.\nAI companies are still paying big paychecks to buy Nvidia's advanced computer chips or to utilize them in AI data centers run by cloud providers such as Microsoft. OpenAI is the leader in AI spending, with commitments in the hundreds of billions of dollars across various sources. A lot of this spending will go to Nvidia computer chips.\n\nStill, even with soaring earnings, both Microsoft and Nvidia (two of the largest companies in the world by market cap) do not have dirt cheap earnings ratios. Nvidia has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 44, while Microsoft's is 34. If earnings keep growing quickly, these ratios will come down in a hurry, but it puts high expectations on future growth.\nMore exposure to AI and cyclicality than others Booming spending in any industry can lead to supply gluts. This has happened in the computer chip space many times throughout history, as well as in other infrastructure build-outs like telecommunications and railroads.\nDon't ignore this risk with the AI winners like Nvidia. There is a major downside risk to Nvidia's earnings power if the company's revenue growth declines along with its profit margin, a double whammy to net income.\n\nSome stocks are more exposed to the AI trade than others, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, or Oracle . Others have been less aggressive on spending or winning contracts, such as Amazon , and are therefore less at risk to an AI or computer chip spending downcycle. With a P/E ratio of 31, Amazon's valuation is lower based on its trailing earnings as well.\n\nStory Continues\nDon't ask whether you should buy AI stocks Investors shouldn't ask whether they should buy AI stocks, as there are dozens, if not hundreds, of stocks exposed to the AI trade, all with different stories and valuations. You have direct beneficiaries such as Nvidia that may be a risky bet right now, or even wilder companies like CoreWeave , laden with debt.\n\nDon't ask if you should buy AI stocks. Ask which AI stocks you should buy today. Amazon looks like a good candidate at today's prices because of its lower P/E ratio, dual growth engines from cloud computing and e-commerce, as well as its growing relationship with start-up Anthropic. Amazon has not gotten as much enthusiasm from Wall Street in 2025, which just might make it a good pick for 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The company announced participation in the Energy Dept.'s Genesis Mission, an initiative to accelerate scientific research, national security, and energy innovation through AI and supercomputing.\nIt also got a boost from Citi analyst Tyler Radke who resumed coverage of CoreWeave stock with a Buy/High Risk rating. These events marked a change for the specialized AI cloud provider, which has endured months of negative pressure that drove its stock down 60% from its mid-2025 highs, a stark contrast to the AI fervor that fueled its post-IPO rally.\nFrom AI Darling to Rough Waters The landscape for CoreWeave has shifted significantly since its March IPO. Initially buoyed by explosive demand for GPU cloud infrastructure amid the AI boom, the stock soared from its $40 IPO price to a peak around $187 per share.\nHowever, investor concerns quickly mounted over execution risks, including data center construction delays, high-interest debt financing, and customer concentration. The company relies heavily on a few major clients, such as Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and OpenAI , and faces competition from hyperscalers building in-house capacity. There is also growing concern over its relationship with Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) -- which invested in the IPO -- and the circular financing nature of its investments.\n\nThese factors, combined with broader AI sector scrutiny, led to sharp declines and revised revenue guidance, heightening the stock's volatility.\nAn Opportunity, Not a Game-Changer CoreWeave's involvement in the Genesis Mission provides access to public sector workloads and aligns with its expansion into government services via its Federal unit. The initiative connects scientific institutions and technology providers to support advanced AI-driven research.\nWhile this is a positive opportunity for long-term credibility and diversification, potentially opening up opportunities for collaborations with national labs and supercomputing centers, it does not substantially alter the company's near-term challenges. The mission represents a small fraction of possible revenue compared to commercial demand, and it does little to address immediate issues like capacity constraints, debt burdens, and execution delays.\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Citi Says Buy Despite the Risks Citi's investor note on the resumption of coverage highlighted strong underlying demand, with overwhelming interest in CoreWeave's platform leading the company to turn away customers at times. Analysts noted that third-quarter bookings supported growth, though some revenue shifted to 2026 due to power and supply issues.\n\nThe analyst emphasized CoreWeave's self-build and joint-venture model for faster deployment while retaining control, plus a planned new credit facility to reduce costs. Despite high customer concentration and limited trading history -- factors warranting the High Risk label -- Citi views the stock as a compelling buy given the durability of AI infrastructure needs.\nGrowth of $5,000 in CoreWeave CoreWeave went public in March at $40 per share where a $5,000 investment at the IPO price would have purchased 125 shares. As of Friday's close, with the stock trading $83 per share (following the recent surge), those shares would be worth approximately $10,500 -- a gain of $5,500 or 110% in under nine months. On an annualized basis, this equates to roughly a 160% return, which is not too shabby considering the headwinds CoreWeave has faced.\n\nWhile an investor would have ultimately profited from buying at the IPO, much of the gain stemmed from broader AI market tailwinds rather than any strengths specific to CoreWeave. IPOs often carry high risk, with many underperforming or taking time to stabilize -- if they ever do -- due to volatility, execution challenges, and market shifts.\nKey Takeaway Recent data from Jay Ritter at the University of Florida shows that between 1980 and 2023, there were more than 9,000 IPOs. Buying in at their offer price, they have a history of losses after three years of 1.6%. However, tech stocks tend to do considerably better, returning over 25% compared to a near-15% loss by non-tech stocks. However, if you're not lucky enough to buy in at the offer price -- and few small retail investors have access to such opportunities -- the results are much different.\n\nBuying in at the closing price after their first day of trading shows IPOs lost 19% on average, with tech stocks losing 5.1% (non-tech stocks lost 25.6%). It takes time for newly public companies to gain their footing to overcome volatility, lock-up expirations, and overoptimism about growth prospects. maller, unprofitable firms fared the worst.\nCoreWeave remains unprofitable with ongoing net losses despite rapid revenue increases. Yet the stock trades at lofty multiples, suggesting there may be further downward reratings ahead.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

This signals strong but increasingly volatile momentum as investors weigh AI upside against dilution and execution risk.\n\nIf you like the IREN story but want more ways to play the AI infrastructure theme, now is a good time to explore high growth tech and AI stocks for other high potential names.\nWith the stock now trading near some analysts’ targets after a 280 percent year to date surge and a hefty capital raise, has the recent pullback opened a genuine entry point, or is the market already discounting IREN’s next leg of growth?\nMost Popular Narrative Narrative: 57.9% Undervalued According to BlackGoat’s widely followed narrative, IREN’s fair value of $94.84 sits far above the recent $39.92 close, framing a large implied upside that rests on aggressive but structured growth assumptions.\nA successful upgrade to 30 EH/s by year end would place IREN among industry leaders like RIOT, MARA, and CLSK, who are also planning to expand towards a staggering 70 EH/s. However, the expansion to 30 EH/s appears to be only partially funded, raising concerns about potential further dilution in 2024, which I will monitor closely.\n\nRead the complete narrative.\nWant to see what kind of revenue surge, profit margins and future earnings multiple BlackGoat believes can support that valuation gap?

As of the close of business on December 17, Wall Street analysts have a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock, with a one-year average share price target of $632.22, representing an upside of 33%.\nImage by Tawanda Razika from Pixabay\nRecent analyst updates include Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterating a Buy rating on the stock on December 17 with a share price target of $650.\nThis followed Phillip Securities’ adjustment on December 14, when it lowered its price target on the stock to $540 from $550 and maintained an Accumulate rating on the shares. According to TipRanks, the firm told investors that the tech giant was ‘aggressively’ into cloud and AI infrastructure.\n\nEarlier in the month, on December 4, DA Davidson maintained a Buy rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a target price of $650. The firm’s analyst Gil Luria noted how the strategic partnership with OpenAI will help the company maintain its ‘fastest growing hyperscaler’ status.\nThis month, Microsoft announced up to $23 billion in new AI investments, of which $17.5 billion would go into establishing a significant cloud computing presence in India over the next four years, while $5.42 billion would be spent in Canada on AI partnerships and cloud capacity.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology company best known for its operating systems and software products.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Is Microsoft Still Attractive After AI Investment Push and Strong Multi Year Share Gains?\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:17 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nWondering if Microsoft at around $485 a share is still worth buying, holding, or finally trimming? You are not alone, and that is exactly what this breakdown aims to unpack.\nOver the last week the stock is up 1.5%, roughly flat over the past month at -0.2%, but still sitting on gains of 16.1% year to date and 12.1% over the last year, with a 108.4% return over 3 years and 127.3% over 5 years.\nRecent headlines have focused on Microsoft doubling down on AI infrastructure and partnerships, alongside continued expansion of its cloud and productivity ecosystems. This steady stream of long term growth initiatives helps explain why investors have been comfortable pushing the share price to new highs even after such strong multi year returns.\nAccording to Simply Wall St, Microsoft currently scores 3/6 on its valuation checks. This means it looks undervalued on half of the metrics they track. We will dig into what that actually means using multiples, cash flow based models, and a more nuanced framework that ties valuation back to the company narrative later in the article.\n\nMicrosoft delivered 12.1% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Software industry.\nApproach 1: Microsoft Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and discounting those cash flows back to today in $ terms.\nFor Microsoft, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $89.4 billion. Analysts and model assumptions project this to rise to roughly $206.2 billion by 2030, with interim years stepping up from around $75.1 billion in 2026 to $153.5 billion in 2029. Beyond the analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extends these forecasts using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, gradually slowing growth as the company matures.\n\nWhen all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of about $603.92 per share. Compared with the current share price near $485, the DCF suggests Microsoft is trading at roughly a 19.5% discount to its estimated fair value.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Microsoft is undervalued by 19.5%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 914 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Microsoft.\nApproach 2: Microsoft Price vs Earnings For a consistently profitable business like Microsoft, the Price to Earnings, or PE, ratio is a practical way to gauge what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of current earnings. It condenses expectations about future growth and risk into a single, easy to compare number.\n\nStory Continues\nIn general, faster growing and lower risk companies tend to trade on higher PE ratios. Slower growing or riskier firms tend to trade on lower multiples. So the question is not whether a PE of 10x or 40x is high or low in isolation, but whether it fits a company’s growth profile and risk.\nMicrosoft currently trades on a PE of about 34.4x, slightly above the Software industry average of around 32.4x and the peer average of roughly 32.5x. Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio for Microsoft, which blends in factors like earnings growth, margins, size, industry and risk, sits much higher at about 52.7x. This Fair Ratio is more informative than simple peer comparisons because it is tailored to Microsoft’s specific fundamentals rather than broad sector averages. With the market multiple well below that fair level, the PE perspective points to Microsoft being undervalued rather than stretched.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1466 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Microsoft Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. These are simply your story about a company, expressed as your own assumptions for its future revenue, earnings and margins, and then translated into a fair value you can compare to today’s price to help you decide whether to buy, hold or sell.\n\nOn Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors build Narratives for companies like Microsoft. They link what they believe about AI growth, cloud competition or capital spending directly to financial forecasts. These Narratives update dynamically as new news, results or risks emerge, so your view never goes stale.\nFor example, one Microsoft Narrative might conclude that the fair value is around $360 a share because AI spending will compress margins and growth. Another might see fair value closer to $532 if AI, cloud and productivity tools compound efficiently. It is precisely this spread in thoughtful views that helps you stress test your own Narrative and decide whether today’s $485 share price looks attractive or expensive.\nFor Microsoft, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Microsoft Narratives:\n\n🐂 Microsoft Bull Case\nFair value: $624.45 per share\nImplied undervaluation vs current price: 22.3%\nForecast revenue growth: 15.30%\nExpanded AI partnerships, a deep Azure backlog and integrated security offerings are expected to sustain double digit revenue growth and high, stable margins.\nSubscription driven businesses like Microsoft 365, Dynamics and Game Pass, together with strong contracted commitments, support predictable earnings and free cash flow.\nManagement aims to offset heavy AI and cloud CapEx through software and efficiency gains, keeping operating margins flat to slightly expanding even as infrastructure spend remains elevated.\n🐻 Microsoft Bear Case\nFair value: $420.00 per share\nImplied overvaluation vs current price: 13.6%\nForecast revenue growth: -0.78%\n\nA shrinking PC market, weak Xbox hardware performance and rising Mac adoption in enterprises are seen as structural headwinds for Microsoft’s traditional franchises.\nHeavy AI and datacenter CapEx, dependence on OpenAI and intensifying competition from Gemini and open source models raise concerns about returns on investment and long term margins.\nInternal morale issues, product quality concerns around Windows 11 and the risk that AI tools cannibalize per seat Office demand underpin a view that Microsoft’s current valuation embeds overly optimistic assumptions.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Microsoft?

      "Content": "Breaking Down Oracle, the AI Trade, and the Outlook for Tech Earnings\n\nSheraz Mian\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:39 PM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nOracle’s ORCL relationship with OpenAI has become a never-ending source of market angst, as the tie-in reminds many of questionable vendor-financing practices from the late 1990s. Tied to Oracle’s OpenAI exposure are questions about the company’s financial health and its ability to fund its data center expansion plans.\n\nThe December 10 th quarterly release, which was, at best, mixed, added to Oracle’s woes. Oracle missed consensus revenue and margin expectations and raised its capital expenditure (capex) outlook. The stock’s negative reaction to this quarterly release contrasted with the prior quarterly release in early September, when the stock jumped by more than a third.\nWhen investors typically think of the big Tech players, like Microsoft MSFT or Alphabet GOOGL or even Oracle, they instinctively assume fortress balance sheets and ungodly amounts of operating cash flows. Those assumptions are misplaced in the case of Oracle, as it has been relying lately on the debt markets to fund its ever-rising data center buildout-related capital expenditures.\nOracle’s capex outlay totaled $21.2 billion in fiscal year 2025 (FY ends in May), up from $6.7 billion in FY 2024. The company generated $20.8 billion of free cash flow in FY 2025, meaning it was free cash flow negative for the year. The expectation for the current year (FY 2026) is that Oracle’s $50 billion capex budget is approximately double the amount of operating cash flows it is expected to generate. In fact, Oracle will most likely be free cash flow negative in fiscal year 2027 as well, which means that it will need to tap the debt market to fund its capex budget.\n\nThe chart below provides an overview of Oracle’s debt load and the comparable measure for Microsoft. Long-term debt as a share of the company’s total capital is not the only, nor even the best, measure of balance-sheet leverage, but it is a simple and easily understood indicator of financial flexibility.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWe should keep in mind that Oracle isn’t in any financial distress, as it currently has an ‘investment grade’ credit rating from the rating agencies. That said, its credit rating of BBB (from S&P) is the lowest rung of investment-grade credit rating.\nWe are all familiar with the market’s concerns about the broader ‘AI trade’, which ranges from the ‘bubble narrative’ at one extreme to reasonable questions about the monetization of AI investments at the other.\nThe chart below shows the three-month performance of Oracle shares relative to Alphabet, Microsoft, the Zacks Tech sector, and the S&P 500 index.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe ongoing issues in Oracle shares are not a reflection of those AI concerns, as the chart above clearly shows, but rather a function of the aforementioned OpenAI exposure and concerns about its financial health. We would have seen far more solidarity from Microsoft and Alphabet with Oracle in the above period had the overriding issue been the ‘AI trade’.\n\nOne key performance metric that took center stage in the Oracle story is Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), which reached $523 billion this quarter, up $455 billion from the preceding quarter. For reference, the comparable number for Microsoft reached $392 billion in the company’s latest quarterly report.\nThink of this key performance metric as Oracle’s backlog or future revenues had jumped by an eye-popping $317 billion in the preceding quarter. The bearish narrative on Oracle notes that $300 billion of the preceding quarter’s $317 billion RPO growth was attributable to OpenAI.\nIt is this elevated level of customer concentration risk, coupled with Oracle’s relatively stretched financial health, that has been weighing on the stock lately.\n\nA fair assessment of the evolving Oracle story is that while there is undoubtedly more uncertainty and risk associated with its RPO (or backlog) getting converted into future revenues, particularly say relative to Microsoft or Alphabet, it is nevertheless a key element of the company’s growth profile and its status as a critical player in the emerging AI world.\nIn other words, no one should be under the impression that this is a second coming of Enron or other such dubious characters from our collective past.\nThe chart below provides a 10-year comparison of Oracle valuation relative to Microsoft, using the forward 12-month P/E multiple. As you can see here, Oracle shares broke away from their historically discounted valuation to Microsoft only in May 2025, but have now reversed all of those gains.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis 10-year history shows that Oracle shares have commanded as high as 66% premium (September 2025) to Microsoft share to a 55% discount (November 2020), with a 10-year median of 28% discount. The stock is currently trading at an 18% discount to Microsoft shares (23.6X for Oracle vs. 28.7X for Microsoft).\n\nThe lower discount relative to history makes sense when seen in the context of Oracle’s emerging status as a key player in the emerging AI world. Oracle bulls would likely argue that there is no justification for the ‘new Oracle’ to trade at a discount to Microsoft going forward, notwithstanding its balance sheet vulnerability.\nTech Earnings Outlook The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth outlook for the Zacks Tech sector on a quarterly basis, where we highlight expectations for 2025 Q4 in the context of what the sector achieved in the preceding two quarters and what is expected in the following three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Tech sector has been critical to driving aggregate earnings growth for the last 9 quarters (since 2023 Q3), and the above chart shows that it is expected to continue playing that role in the coming periods as well.\nPlease note that the Tech sector has been consistently enjoying positive estimate revisions over the past year, and we saw the same trend at play since the start of 2025 Q4 in October. In fact, had it not been for positive revisions to Tech sector estimates, aggregate Q4 earnings estimates for the S&P 500 index would be modestly down since the start of October.\nThe chart below shows the sector’s earnings growth picture on an annual basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe positive revisions trend that we referenced for the Tech sector in the context of 2025 Q4 earnings estimates is very much in place for full-year 2026 estimates as well, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Tech sector is not ordinary; it accounts for nearly a third of S&P 500 earnings, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings Outlook for the Mag 7 The Mag 7 group is generally seen as mega-cap Tech players. However, in the Zacks sector classification system, two of the Mag 7 players are not part of the Zacks Tech sector; we place Amazon in the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla in the Zacks Auto sector. Both of these sectors are Zacks innovations, as the ‘official’ Standard & Poor’s industry classification does not have stand-alone sectors for the retail and auto spaces.\nFor 2025 Q4, the Mag 7 group is expected to produce +16.9% earnings growth on +16.4% higher revenues, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the Mag 7 group’s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the group’s 2026 earnings are currently expected to be up +16.6%, followed by +18% in 2027.\nThe important factor to keep in mind is that the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 26.4% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2026, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 11.7% in 2019. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 34.6% weight in the index.\n2025 Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard Last week’s Oracle earnings report was for the company’s fiscal quarter ending in November, which we and other research organizations count as part of the December-quarter tally. Oracle is hardly alone in this respect, and quarterly results from the likes of FedEx, Nike, Adobe, and others fall in the same category. Through Friday, December 19 th , we have seen such Q4 results from 18 S&P 500 members.\nTotal earnings for these 18 index members are up +32.2% from the same period last year on +9% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates from these companies in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe comparison charts below show the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Earnings Big Picture The chart below shows current Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&P 500 index in the context of the preceding 4 quarters and the coming three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor a detailed view of the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>>Q4 Earnings: Tech Expected to Remain Growth Driver\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Aravolta builds integrated data center infrastructure (DCIM), electrical power (EPMS) and building management (BMS) products and are rapidly expanding as demand soars for their products.\n\nAravolta is led by Margarita Groisman (CEO), Jack Sutton (CTO), and Pietro Sette (COO). Margarita previously worked on chip and server deployments inside Microsoft’s data centers. Jack is a lifelong engineer working as a founding engineer across many startups. Pietro has led engineering and operations at high-growth software organizations. The team focuses on building software to manage and automate the physical systems that power modern data centers.\n\"We’re seeing a wave of new data center entrants realize that these facilities are far more complex to run than traditional industrial sites,\" Groisman said. \"GPU environments are especially demanding: power, cooling and networking are tightly coupled, and small changes can ripple across the entire system.\n\nAravolta brings those signals into one place and makes them actionable. We're ‘ Palantir for data centers ’, not just aggregating data, but turning it into decisions and control.\"\nAravolta’s customers already include colocation providers, chip manufacturers, edge data centers, and emerging neoclouds - names like OpenColo, Flexnode, DataCrunch, and Centra, as well as others you’ve definitely heard of but they can’t yet name publicly.\nBacked by $5.1 million from notable investors such as Topology, Wishchoff, Crucible, Susa, Afore, Y Combinator, Pioneer Fund , and Banyan with Guillermo Rauch , Nick Hansen , and more among its notable angels.\nWhile Aravolta technically sits in the DCIM (Data Center Infrastructure Management) category, its capabilities extend far beyond the legacy tools of the past. Operators praise its single pane of glass for data center operations - including capabilities like branch circuit monitoring, precision power metering, and automation workflows that make the complex orchestration of modern data centers not just manageable - but elegant.\nIn short: As the world races to build the infrastructure for the AI age, Aravolta is building the software to make it all run.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251219337091/en/\nContacts\nMedia Contact: Margarita Groisman\nEmail: margarita@aravolta.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

At the same time, revenue growth expectations have nudged higher from around 15.28% to 15.30%, reflecting stronger conviction that accelerating AI adoption, expanding cloud demand, and deepened model partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic can sustain robust top line momentum. Stay tuned to see how you can track these nuanced revisions and follow Microsoft’s evolving stock narrative over time.\n\nStay updated as the Fair Value for Microsoft shifts by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Microsoft.\nWhat Wall Street Has Been Saying 🐂 Bullish Takeaways\nMorgan Stanley, Bernstein, RBC Capital, Goldman Sachs, Evercore ISI, Guggenheim, Baird and Truist all reiterate or initiate positive views, citing durable demand across Azure, broader cloud, productivity software and security as core to sustaining double digit growth and margin expansion.\nSeveral firms have lifted or reiterated elevated targets in the $560 to $675 range, including Morgan Stanley (to $650), Bernstein (to $645), RBC Capital ($640), Goldman Sachs ($630), Guggenheim ($586), Baird ($600), Truist ($675), and earlier Rothschild & Co Redburn (to $560), underscoring confidence that current AI and cloud investments can translate into higher long term earnings power.\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley and Evercore ISI highlight the updated OpenAI agreement and the new $250B Azure commitment as clearing a major overhang while validating Microsoft’s leadership in AI infrastructure and strengthening visibility into future cloud revenue.\nRecent Q1 results are described as strong or better than expected by Morgan Stanley, Bernstein and RBC Capital, with commentary pointing to accelerating commercial bookings, strong Azure growth, robust customer commitments and room for further operating leverage, reinforcing views on execution quality and cost discipline.\nWhile generally positive, some bullish firms still flag reservations around rich valuation and heavy capex, noting that part of the AI upside may already be reflected in the share price and that investors will closely track returns on enlarged AI and cloud infrastructure spending.\n\n🐻 Bearish Takeaways\nRothschild & Co Redburn has shifted to a more cautious stance, downgrading Microsoft to Neutral and cutting its target to $500 from $560 as it questions whether current AI driven hyperscaler economics can match prior cloud 1.0 returns given materially higher capital intensity.\nThe same analysis from Rothschild & Co Redburn argues that investors may be giving Microsoft too much benefit of the doubt by treating elevated GPU and data center capex as if it will generate legacy cloud like returns, implying downside risk to earnings expectations if monetization lags.\nEven among generally bullish houses, commentary around outages at major cloud providers, including Azure, and broader concerns over high multiples and AI cycle volatility point to near term reputational and valuation risks that could cap upside if execution stumbles.\n\nStory Continues\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts?

Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. No one was very focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 for a while was bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. But not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist Art Hogan joins Opening Bid with Brian Sozzi to talk about his expectations for the Magnificent Seven and the broader AI trade.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat is the future of the AI trade and how are you playing it next year? Art, is it Max 7 or bust for you?\n00:09 Art\nUh, it's not. and I'll tell you this. I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI hyperscalers have room for ‘elevated debt issuance’ — even after their recent bond binge, BofA says\n\nJason Ma\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:44 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BAC\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThe tech giants fueling the AI boom generate so much cash relative to their debt that they have more than enough room to issue more, according to Bank of America .\nIn a note this week, analysts looked at the top five publicly traded AI hyperscalers: Meta , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon and Oracle .\nBofA pointed out that while the companies can fund their near-term capital expenditures with cash, they are tapping debt markets for balance-sheet flexibility and better cost of capital. Last month alone, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon raised tens of billions of dollars in the bond market.\n\nOperating cash flow for the big five hyperscalers is expected to hit $577 billion this year from $378 billion in 2023, while debt should climb from $356 billion to $433 billion.\nThat means their overall debt burden is actually getting lighter as the debt-to-cash ratio should dip from 0.94 to 0.75.\n“Given the hyperscalers’ historically conservative capital allocation and balance sheet policies, elevated debt issuance is possible, as evident by the recent bond deals from Meta, Alphabet and Amazon,” BofA said.\nAnd plenty of additional cash is on the way. By 2029, operating cash flow is seen jumping 95% to $1.1 trillion, while capex is forecast to grow at a much slower pace of 58% to $632 billion.\nBut then there’s Oracle. Unlike the other AI hyperscalers, it will have negative free cash flow until 2029, meaning its capex will exceed cash from operations, according to BofA. As a result, it doesn’t have much capacity to take on more debt.\n\nIndeed, fears about Oracle’s debt binge have rattled the overall AI stock trade as the company isn’t a cash machine like its AI peers.\nRecent earnings guidance was also weak, and the company raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 capex by another $15 billion. In addition, surging lease obligations have spooked Wall Street.\nA Financial Times report on Wednesday that said alternative investments firm Blue Owl didn’t team up with Oracle on a data center after all piled on more concerns. Shares fell on the news, though the company’s development partner, Related Digital, said Blue Owl was outbid on the project and didn’t back out of it.\nBut even though debt may not pose a limit on hyperscalers’ ambitions, they still face physical limits , namely in building enough infrastructure fast enough to meet demand.\nData-center researcher Jonathan Koomey told Fortune’s Eva Roytburg that capital can be deployed instantly, but the equipment that capital must buy cannot. Tmelines for turbines, transformers, specialized cooling systems, and high-voltage gear have stretched into years, he explained.\n\nStory Continues\n“This happens every time there’s a massive shift in investment,” Koomey added. “Eventually manufacturers catch up, but not right away. Reality intervenes.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\n\nAnalysts led by Tyler Radke said strong third-quarter bookings drove growth, though supply constraints and power capacity delays shifted some revenue and capital expenditure into the first quarter of 2026.\nCiti highlighted that demand remains robust through the fourth quarter, with capacity reportedly sold out for the year and early talks underway for 2027 projects. Enterprise interest is rising, with at least two contracts expected to exceed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, though hyperscalers still dominate bookings.\nRadke noted some potential demand, including an estimated $40-50 billion from Microsoft (MSFT), was redirected to other GPU-as-a-Service providers due to capacity limits.\nThe analysts said CoreWeave is managing growth with a self-build, 80/20 joint-venture model and maintains strong financials, with over 60% of revenue from investment-grade clients.

Meanwhile, the threat of competition from deep-pocketed heavyweights and upstarts like OpenAI and Anthropic weighed on software makers that are considered most at risk from challengers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNYC’s Adams Names Four to Rent Board in Challenge to Mamdani\nWith the bull market in US stocks stretching into a fourth year, there are more concerns than ever about the sustainability of heavy spending on AI computing and whether the returns will justify the investments.\n“There’s a lot of optimism around AI, but also a lot of hype,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. “2026 will be more about the proof of AI. What’s the ROI on the hyperscalers that have been spending? Will they see profit growth continue to accelerate?”\n\nHere’s a look at some of the biggest stock market stories for the tech industry in 2025 and the outlook for each in the new year.\nNeocloud Nerves\nNeoclouds, which are companies that provide cloud-computing services tailored to AI customers, were the rage for most of 2025. But heading into 2026 they look more like proxies for AI bubble risk.\nGrowing scrutiny over OpenAI’s lack of profitability has raised questions about its ability to pay for its massive spending commitments, including a cloud-computing deal with Oracle Corp. said to be worth $300 billion over five years. Oracle was expected to be a major beneficiary of AI growth, but its stock is down more than 45% through Thursday’s close since hitting a peak in September as its exposure to OpenAI becomes a major concern. Oracle shares were up about 6% in early trading Friday as TikTok said it is being bought by a group of buyers led by the software company.\n“There is a lot of fear with OpenAI and the commitments it has made,” said Adam Rich, who helps oversee more than $17 billion in assets as deputy chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Vaughan Nelson. “People can only forecast what we know, and right now there’s a lot we don’t know. So long as that’s the case, it will be hard for companies like Oracle to regain their luster.”\n\nStory Continues\nOracle has other issues, including the amount of money it’s spending on data center leases, reported delays in some data center projects, and financing questions. Its growing debt load is particularly concerning to investors, as a measure of the company’s credit risk has skyrocketed to its highest level since the financial crisis.\n\nBeyond Oracle, neocloud provider CoreWeave Inc. has lost about two-thirds of its market value since hitting a high in June. And Nebius Group NV shares are down more than 42% from an October peak through Thursday’s close.\nBoring Tech\nInvestors discovered new AI trades in 2025 by following where the billions of dollars in pledged capital expenditures are going. You can see it just by looking at the top performers in the S&P 500 Index. Memory and storage company Sandisk Corp. leads the list, followed by Western Digital Corp, which makes hard disk drives, and its rival Seagate Technology Holdings Plc. Micron Technology Inc., the biggest US-based maker of memory chips, is fifth.\nThe trend is expected to continue in 2026 as capital expenditures keep growing. Investors are increasingly thinking about where the next wave is headed, with some eyeing beaten-down software stocks.\n“Things at the edge are interesting,” said Melissa Otto, who heads technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “There is this AI ecosystem that orbits around the AI infrastructure itself.”\n\nSoftware Slump\nSoftware stocks traded at attractive market valuations in 2025, but that did little to entice investors. Shares of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, companies were hit particularly hard. Much of the weakness reflects growing fears that the group will be disrupted by AI, as offerings from services like ChatGPT and Alphabet’s Gemini cut into demand or pricing power.\nAI represents “existential competition” for some software companies as “AI chatbot and agent dominance becomes the core battlefield,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a research note this week.\nCompanies like ServiceNow Inc., Adobe Inc., and Salesforce Inc. were among the weakest performers in the tech sector this year. A Morgan Stanley index of SaaS companies is down 10%, compared with a gain of about 6% for a broader software index that includes perceived AI winners like Microsoft Corp.\nWhether software’s underperformance continues will be a key stock market theme in 2026. Some Wall Street pros already think it’s overdone. The SaaS group “is trading anywhere between a 30-40% discount relative to what its fundamentals would suggest,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note to clients late last month.\n\nPricey Got Pricier\nConcerns that nose-bleed valuations would hamper the ascent of some of 2024’s hottest stocks in 2025 proved misplaced. Palantir Technologies Inc. turned out to be one of the year’s best performers despite trading at more than 200 times estimated profits for much of the year. The stock’s nearly 150% advance ranks eighth in the S&P 500.\nWall Street has long been skeptical of Palantir, mainly because of the stock’s lofty valuation. Of the 29 the analysts covering the maker of data analysis software, just nine rate the stock a buy. Still, the company is expected to expand at an enviable clip, with revenue projected to jump 43% in 2026 and 39% in 2027, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nElectric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. also overcame concerns about its valuation, which is by far the most expensive among the so-called Magnificent Seven. The stock hit a record this week despite trading at more than 200 times anticipated profits and facing a number of headwinds from slowing EV sales to concerns about safety.\n\nInvestors are optimistic about Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s vision of a self-driving car future and nascent push into robotics. After two years of stagnant revenue growth, Tesla’s sales are expected to expand 13% in 2026 and 19% in 2027.\nAll of which leaves the tech landscape heading into 2026 roughly where it was a year ago. Yes, the stocks are pricey. But the opportunities for growth are there. It’s up to the companies to deliver.\n“Expectations are high and valuations are expensive,” Ameriprise’s Saglimbene said. “That means they have more to prove, and they will really have to exceed expectations to move higher.”\n--With assistance from Phil Serafino and Stephen Kirkland.\n(Updates stock moves throughout, adds detail in paragraph seven.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "CRWV Stock Crashes 49% in 3 Months: Buy the Dip or Hold Back for Now?\n\nShreya Majumder\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 7:01 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: CRWV\n\n^GSPC\n\nNBIS\n\nMSFT\n\nCoreWeave, Inc . CRWV is the world’s first hyperscale AI cloud, delivering purpose-built compute, storage, networking and software to help customers build, train and deploy AI products faster. The stock has tumbled 49.2% in the past three months, much higher than the Zacks Internet-Software Market’s and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s fall of 13.5% and 0.5%, respectively, while the S&P 500 Composite has grown 1.8%.\n\nThe company has underperformed its peers and tech behemoths like Microsoft MSFT, which has declined 5.9% over the past three months, while Nebius Group N.V. NBIS, another emerging AI infrastructure player, has plunged 26.7%. Once a market favorite riding the AI infrastructure boom, the stock has been hit by concerns around execution, heavy capital spending and leverage, alongside broader volatility in AI-related equities.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCRWV currently trades at $67.68, well beneath its 52-week high of $187. The key consideration now is whether the pullback in CRWV stock presents a buying opportunity or reflects underlying concerns. Examining recent performance metrics, management insights and guidance provides greater clarity on the path ahead.\n\nKey Risks to Consider for CRWV Before Buying the Dip Despite operating in a favorable demand environment, CRWV continues to face increasing supply chain pressures, where demand for its AI cloud platform greatly exceeds available capacity, limiting its ability to serve customers fully. Delays in powered-shell delivery from a data center provider are likely to adversely impact its performance in the fourth quarter. Although temporary and with the customer agreeing to adjust the schedule to retain full contract value, these setbacks have prompted management to lower its 2025 outlook. The company now expects 2025 revenue of $5.05–$5.15 billion, down from $5.15–$5.35 billion, and adjusted operating income of $690–$720 million, below the previous $800–$830 million range.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, CoreWeave plans to bring some of the largest deployments in its history online, a move that is expected to weigh on near-term adjusted operating margins due to the lag between upfront data-center costs and revenue recognition. This timing mismatch underscores the company’s continued struggle to translate heavy infrastructure spending into immediate financial returns.\nLeverage remains another concern. Management expects 2025 interest expense of $1.21–$1.25 billion due to rising debt levels needed to fund demand-led CapEx. While a lower cost of capital offers some relief, it does little to offset the scale of the interest burden. Capital intensity also remains elevated. CapEx for 2025 is now projected at $12–$14 billion, with the reduction from prior guidance largely reflecting spending deferrals rather than true cost savings, as infrastructure buildouts remain stuck in construction-in-progress. Much of the CapEx initially expected in fourth quarter has merely shifted into first quarter, extending near-term cash flow pressure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLooking ahead, risks intensify further. Management expects 2026 CapEx to more than double from the 2025 levels, signaling even greater capital demands despite ongoing margin and leverage pressures. While the company frames these investments as strengthening its competitive position, they also heighten concerns about execution risk, balance-sheet strain and the sustainability of CoreWeave’s hyper-growth strategy.\n\nCRWV’s Bullish Fundamentals Still Intact Despite supply-chain disruptions prompting cuts to full-year revenue and CapEx guidance, management highlighted its ability to adapt operations, pursue multiple growth avenues and access ample capital. The company remains confident in its capacity to meet long-term demand, expand infrastructure at scale and strengthen its position in AI cloud services, viewing new product launches, strategic partnerships and emerging federal opportunities as key drivers of sustained hypergrowth.\n\nCRWV strengthened its position as a leading AI cloud infrastructure provider in the third quarter, expanding its active power footprint by 120 MW to about 590 MW and boosting contracted capacity to 2.9 GW. With more than 1 GW of contracted capacity yet to come online and new compute deals that broadened its customer base, the company is well-positioned for continued growth. It has a substantial contracted backlog, which provides visibility into future revenue streams, even during short-term execution hiccups. Its revenue backlog has expanded sharply, to $55.6 billion in the third quarter, marking a 271% year-over-year increase and nearly doubling sequentially. The growth is driven by large, long-term contracts with major customers such as OpenAI, Meta and multiple hyperscalers, underscoring strong demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe backlog mix also highlights improving long-term visibility. While 40% of backlog is expected to convert within 24 months, a solid portion extends beyond that horizon, with 39% scheduled over 25–48 months and 21% beyond 49 months. This longer-dated profile enhances revenue visibility and reinforces its dependence on timely infrastructure deployment to convert backlog into recognized revenue.\nIts momentum is further being driven by multi-billion-dollar partnerships with NVIDIA, including industry-first deployments of GB300 NVL72 systems and RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances, giving CRWV an early edge in frontier AI and real-time workloads. The company is also pursuing inorganic growth through acquisitions, including Marimo in October, following earlier deals such as OpenPipe and Weights & Biases.\n\nEstimate Revision Trend for CRWV CRWV’s estimates revisions are on an upward trajectory currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings for 2025 has been revised north 8.5% over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation Vulnerabilities CRWV stock is not so cheap, as its Value Style Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment. In terms of Price/Book, CRWV’s shares are trading at 8.53X, higher than the Internet Software industry’s 5.95X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFinal Verdict CRWV’s momentum has never been stronger, with expanding opportunities ahead. Backed by exceptional products, a world-class team and disciplined execution, CoreWeave is poised to enter its next phase of growth as a full-stack AI services provider and hyperscaler.\nHowever, management flagged supply chain and data center delays as near-term risks, but views them as temporary with mitigations in place. Concerns around overcapacity, execution and CapEx are being addressed through provider diversification, self-builds, flexible contracts and diversified funding. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), CRWV appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAs is the case with other technology giants, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has positioned itself to be a key player in the AI race. The firm differs from players such as Google and Amazon through the fact that it does not operate a cloud computing business. Yet, while Google, Amazon, and Microsoft spend on AI data centers to bolster their cloud computing capabilities, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) continues to spend just as much despite not being a major player in the industry. The spending has also seen the focus of analysts, with TD Cowen commenting on December 4th that the firm’s decision to cut back its metaverse spending could counter the increased spending on AI infrastructure. TD Cowen kept a Buy rating and an $810 share price target for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s shares.\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\nThe firm’s infrastructure spending includes a major data center it is building in Louisiana. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced on December 4th, 2024, that it was building a $10 billion data center in the state, and recent media reports have suggested that costs have ballooned to $27 billion. During this episode, Cramer and his co-hosts discussed reports of CoreWeave’s Texas data center project struggling, and Meta Platforms, Inc.

These include the firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business and its in-house Trainium AI chips. The highly competitive cloud computing industry, which sees investors demand high growth rates, has also affected Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in 2025.

      "Content": "FDVV’s 2.78% Yield Looks Weak Next to SCHD’s 3.80% Income Stream for Retirees\n\nMichael Williams\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:07 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SCHD\n\nJPM\n\nFDVV\n\nXOM\n\nNVDA\n\nQuick Read FDVV allocates 18% to NVIDIA, Apple and Microsoft but these three holdings yield less than 0.5%.\nThe fund cut dividends 7.7% in 2024 after growing payouts 48% cumulatively from 2020 to 2023.\nSCHD offers a 3.80% yield versus FDVV’s 2.78% with more stable distributions.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nFidelity High Dividend ETF ( NYSEARCA:FDVV ) markets itself as a high-dividend option for income investors, but its 2.78% yield and unusual portfolio composition raise questions about long-term sustainability. The ETF generates income from dividends paid by underlying equity holdings, tracking the Fidelity High Dividend Index of large and mid-cap stocks. With $7.7 billion in assets and a low 0.15% expense ratio, FDVV appears attractive on paper. However, a closer look at its top holdings reveals a fundamental tension between growth and income.\nPortfolio Composition Raises Concerns FDVV's largest positions are growth-oriented technology stocks that contribute minimal dividend income. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), the fund's largest holding at 6.41%, yields just 0.02% with an annual dividend of $0.04 per share. Despite a 53% profit margin and 67% earnings growth, NVIDIA slashed its quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.01 in 2024—a 75% cut that signals the company prioritizes reinvestment over shareholder payouts.\n\nApple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), the second-largest holding at 6.11%, offers a 0.37% yield with a $1.02 annual dividend. While more substantial than NVIDIA, this remains far below income investor expectations. Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) rounds out the tech triumvirate at 5.24% of the portfolio with a 0.72% yield and $3.40 annual dividend.\nTogether, these three holdings represent nearly 18% of FDVV but collectively yield less than 0.5%.\nTraditional Dividend Payers Provide Stability JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE:JPM ), representing 2.71% of the portfolio, offers more reliable income with a 1.73% yield and $5.55 annual dividend. The bank's 16x earnings multiple and 16% return on equity suggest sustainable payouts. Exxon Mobil ( NYSE:XOM ) at 1.97% of holdings provides a 3.36% yield with a $3.96 annual dividend, though recent quarterly earnings declined 8% year-over-year amid energy price volatility.\n\nThe problem is clear: FDVV's 26.5% allocation to information technology—the largest sector weighting—contradicts its dividend-focused mandate. Meanwhile, traditional income sectors like utilities (9.6%) and energy (8.7%) receive far less emphasis. Dividend payments have also shown concerning volatility, ranging from $0.185 to $0.504 quarterly over the past four years. After growing dividends 48% cumulatively from 2020 to 2023, FDVV experienced its first annual decline in 2024, dropping 7.7%.\n\nStory Continues\nThis infographic evaluates the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV), highlighting its portfolio's reliance on low-yield tech stocks and significant dividend volatility. It presents the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a potentially more reliable alternative for income-focused investors.\nConsider SCHD as an Alternative For investors seeking more reliable dividend income, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF ( NYSEARCA:SCHD ) offers a compelling alternative. SCHD yields 3.80%—significantly higher than FDVV's 2.78%—and focuses exclusively on US companies with consistent dividend growth records. The fund screens for financial strength and dividend sustainability, resulting in a portfolio weighted toward traditional dividend sectors rather than growth tech. SCHD has demonstrated more stable quarterly distributions and maintains a similarly low expense ratio, making it a stronger choice for income-focused investors seeking dependable cash flow.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

Alphabet: Which Could Be The World's Biggest Company By End-2026?\n\nPiero Cingari\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have quietly become the two most dominant forces inside the Magnificent Seven, riding different paths to the same destination: artificial intelligence supremacy.\nNvidia's GPUs remain the backbone of the global AI buildout, powering everything from data centers to cutting-edge model training.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is pushing its own vertically integrated AI stack — from custom TPUs to Gemini — embedding intelligence directly across Search, Cloud and consumer products.\nThe market thus far has rewarded both approaches. Nvidia is up 33% year-to-date through Dec. 17, while Alphabet has surged 62%.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nZooming out further tells an even more dramatic story: since early 2023, Alphabet shares are up roughly 250%, while Nvidia has delivered a staggering 1,120% return.\nThat explosive run has made Nvidia the world's biggest company today, with a market capitalization of about $4.318 trillion — even briefly touching $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet ranks third at approximately $3.7 trillion, behind Apple's $4.05 trillion valuation.\n\nYet traders see a far closer race ahead.\nOn Polymarket, both Nvidia and Alphabet are assigned a 35% probability of being the world's most valuable company by the end of 2026.\nA $100 bet on Alphabet overtaking Nvidia to become the world's biggest company by the end of next year would pay out $265 if it happens — with nearly identical returns available for those wagering that Nvidia holds onto the crown.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) trails with a 14% chance, followed by Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT ) at 9%.\nTesla Inc . (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) sit further back, at 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nHow Could Alphabet Overtake Nvidia As World’s Biggest Company? For Alphabet to dethrone Nvidia as world’s biggest company, it needs to outperform by a meaningful margin.\nThe current valuation gap between the two companies is about $600 billion.\nIf Nvidia's market cap were to grow 10% in 2026, it would climb from roughly $4.3 trillion to about $4.75 trillion. For Alphabet to leapfrog Nvidia in that scenario, its shares would need to outperform Nvidia by roughly 19 percentage points.\n\nStory Continues\nIn practical terms, that would mean Alphabet gaining about 29% in a year where Nvidia rises 10%, lifting Google's valuation to around $4.77 trillion.\nAny performance gap of 19 percentage points in Alphabet's favor could hand it the crown — assuming today's market caps as the starting line.\n\nThe bet, then, is whether Alphabet's AI monetization, advertising leverage and cloud growth can accelerate faster than Nvidia's already-dominant chip business.\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nWall Street Still Backs Nvidia Where traders see a coin flip, Wall Street analysts remain more decisive.\nBased on median 12-month price targets, analysts expect Nvidia's reign to continue. Consensus estimates point to Nvidia shares reaching about $250 over the next year, or roughly 40% upside from the current price near $177.\nAlphabet's outlook is far more muted by comparison. Analysts see a median 12-month target of $330, implying just 6% upside from its current level around $306.\n\nThat gap underscores the tension at the core of the debate: prediction markets see a neck-and-neck race for the world's largest company, while Wall Street analysts continue to model an extended run of Nvidia's dominance.\nBy the end of 2026, the outcome may hinge on a single question: will the AI arms race ultimately reward the company supplying the picks and shovels, or the one embedding intelligence into every layer of the digital economy?\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

      "Content": "4 Key Cloud Computing Stocks to Include in Your Portfolio for 2026\n\nSupriyo Bose\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:41 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: IBM\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAn updated edition of the Nov. 04, 2025 article.\n\nLeveraging virtualization technology, which enables users to access and store data over the Internet without managing their physical servers and intricate IT infrastructure, cloud computing has gained increasing prominence in driving innovation and digital transformation. It enables multiple users to share the same hardware resources by connecting to the cloud platform through a web browser or dedicated applications, thereby creating a framework for seamless omnichannel customer engagement.\n\nFor investors seeking to invest in blue-chip tech firms, cloud computing has emerged as an attractive theme. This has made cloud computing companies like Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and International Business Machines Corporation IBM indispensable for any investment portfolio. But before digging deep into these prized possessions, let us examine a little more into why organizations are increasingly adopting cloud computing.\n\nBased on a pay-per-use pricing model, enterprises only pay for the computing resources they use. This has helped business enterprises to reduce operating costs for maintaining on-site data centers and deploying IT experts to manage the infrastructure, making it a highly cost-effective solution. With easy access to a plethora of innovative technologies, cloud computing increases productivity with greater agility and flexibility, and improves scalability with higher economies of scale. Moreover, cloud computing services are delivered over a highly secure network with low latency for applications and data backup facilities for improved reliability.\n\nCloud computing services fall into four broad categories, namely infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless and software as a service (SaaS), offering different levels of control, flexibility and management options to business enterprises. Cloud computing, which relies heavily on virtualization and automation technologies, provides the requisite infrastructure for AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning (ML) workloads. It delivers powerful computing abilities to process and analyze data, creating an ideal platform for Big Data management.\n\nPer Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market size is expected to swell to $2,390.2 billion by 2030 from $752.4 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 20.4% with a variety of capabilities across multiple industries. These include diverse use cases such as improved patient monitoring and outcomes in healthcare, personalized financial management and predictive spending, immersive learning in education, superior inventory management in retail and predictive maintenance and better supply chain management in the manufacturing sector.\n\nIf you intend to capitalize on this buzzing trend, our Cloud Computing Thematic Investing Screen could make it easy to identify high-potential stocks in this domain at any given time, just like the four mentioned above. By leveraging advanced tools, our thematic screens identify companies shaping the future, making it easier to benefit from emerging trends.\n\nReady to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas? Explore 36 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Investing Screens and discover your next big opportunity.\n\nStory Continues\nKey Cloud Computing Stocks to Watch Microsoft is one of the most prominent public cloud providers that delivers a wide variety of IaaS and PaaS solutions at scale. Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing platform, allows users to build, run and scale applications in the cloud. It offers a variety of services, including storage, networking, analytics and AI.\n\nMicrosoft has doubled down on the cloud computing opportunity. Azure&rsquo;s increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally has strengthened Microsoft's competitive position in the cloud computing market. Operating through a vast network of global data centers that ensure high availability and reliability for applications, Azure offers seamless access to all the services included in the portal once customers subscribe to it. Subscribers can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as virtual machines (VMs) and databases, which can then be assembled into running environments used to host workloads and store data.\n\nAs Microsoft continues to push the boundaries of networking technology, it aims to create innovative, resilient and secure solutions that enable businesses to leverage AI and the cloud to their fullest potential. It is heavily investing in AI-powered cloud services, integrating Azure OpenAI Service, Copilot and ML into various cloud solutions, making AI a central feature of Azure to empower organizations to manage their applications with greater confidence and efficiency. Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nAlphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search engine provider to a leading provider of cloud computing technology. Google Cloud has turned out to be the key catalyst behind the company&rsquo;s growth, driven by its strengthening cloud service offerings.\n\nThe solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace and continued investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI have helped Google to expand its cloud footprint worldwide. The increasing number of cloud regions and availability zones globally has been a hallmark of Google Cloud. Currently, Google Cloud has 42 cloud regions, 127 availability zones and 200 network edge locations across more than 200 countries. Google Cloud is considered the third-largest cloud player among numerous cloud providers worldwide.\n\nAlphabet&rsquo;s growing GenAI capabilities and significant investments in cloud computing are potential catalysts for the future amid stiff competition in the cloud space and increasing regulatory headwinds. This Zacks Rank #3 company&rsquo;s dominant position in the search engine market and the cloud boosts its long-term prospects.\n\nAmazon enjoys a leading position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the IaaS space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin-generating businesses. The expanding customer base of AWS, driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid Amazon's dominance in the global cloud space.\n\nAWS is the world&rsquo;s most comprehensive and broadly adopted on-demand cloud computing platform, offering more than 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers, including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises and leading government agencies, are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile and innovate faster. It reportedly offers the widest variety of databases that are purpose-built for different types of applications to enable subscribers to choose the right tool for the job.\n\nAmazon aims to extend AWS&rsquo; AI and ML capabilities to facilitate improved decision-making. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company intends to expand its global infrastructure for faster and more reliable service with low latency and maximum availability. From cloud-native applications and AI-driven solutions to edge computing and sustainability initiatives, AWS is likely to push the limits in the realm of cloud computing technology.\n\nIBM has gradually evolved as a provider of cloud and data platforms. The Red Hat acquisition, in particular, has helped it strengthen its competitive position in the hybrid cloud market. With the buyout, the company offers a Linux operating system&mdash;Red Hat Enterprise Linux&mdash;and a hybrid cloud platform&mdash;Red Hat OpenShift&mdash;aiding enterprises with digital transformation.\n\nWith a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management, translating into a healthy demand for IBM hybrid cloud solutions. In addition, the buyout of HashiCorp has significantly augmented IBM&rsquo;s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. HashiCorp&rsquo;s tool sets complement IBM RedHat&rsquo;s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management and bolstering its hybrid multi-cloud approach.\n\nIBM is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments. This Zacks Rank #3 company&rsquo;s growth is expected to be aided primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long run.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\n\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits , suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google , OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\n\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction .\nOpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The accord addresses U.S. national security concerns and prevents a social media app ban. Oracle and its partners would hold over 80% of a new TikTok U.S. corporation by late January. The deal might boost Oracle's cloud business by making TikTok a long-term client, analysts said. This would secure TikTok as a key customer for OCI and could drive meaningful upside for non-AI parts of the business via durable, higher-margin workloads, Mizuho analyst Siti Panigrahi said. The Information said that Microsoft-backed OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion at a $750 billion value, boosting the stock. The prospective funding shows investor interest in artificial intelligence, which is linked to Oracle's cloud infrastructure relationships.

Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThat would be a massive jump from the roughly $500 billion valuation reported earlier and even above the $750 billion figure mentioned in recent reports. Nothing is final yet. The talks are still in the early stages, and OpenAI is hoping to complete the round by the end of Q1 at the earliest. Whether there is enough investor demand remains an open question, especially as scrutiny around AI spending has increased.\nThe reason for the raise is straightforward. Building and running cutting edge AI models is incredibly expensive. OpenAI is projected to burn more than $200 billion in cash through 2030 as it scales infrastructure and computing power. Some partners, including Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) and CoreWeave ( NASDAQ:CRWV ), have already felt investor pressure tied to data center expansion.\nFor investors, this funding round is a real stress test.

We we heard from Gil Luria recently, smart, smart analyst, thoughtful guy.\n00:05 Speaker B\nLove Gil.\n00:06 Speaker A\nWe love Gil. Uh and we wanted his take. Now Gil is, you know, not a fan of Oracle. He's neutral. He tells his clients, stay on the sidelines. Take a listen to what he had to say and then we'll get your response.\n00:19 Gil Luria\nMicrosoft is front of the line. Microsoft who owns the biggest part of OpenAI is front of the line. They'll get paid first. If there's something left over, I'd argue that Amazon is probably next. Maybe after that is Oracle, which is to say the 300 billion isn't going to materialize.\n00:39 Speaker A\nSo 300 billion not going to materialize. What do you think, Corey?\n00:44 Corey\nWell, I mean, you know, they've got contracts with with their customers. They've clearly vetted the customers that they want and not had the customers that they don't. Um but again, this is why your choice of OpenAI is so important. Is OpenAI really going to stiff and not be able to pay their bills? It's it's a question. It's a reasonable question, but it's not just OpenAI. Their customers are companies like Nvidia, their customers are companies like like, you know, Milwaukee Best tools. I mean, they have so many varied customers that have deep pockets, uh that, you know, I would expect them to get paid in almost every occasion and that the risk does not entirely sit with OpenAI. But yeah, if OpenAI goes belly up and can't pay its bills, Microsoft's going to be in trouble, too.\n01:31 Speaker A\nLet me ask you, this broader AI boom bubble debate, when you hear of more companies and they're tapping the debt markets now to finance these AI ambitions,\n01:43 Corey\nYes.\n01:44 Speaker A\nDoes that cause you to reconsider that debate at all, broadly?\n01:49 Corey\nYou know, debt debt works both ways, leverage book works both ways, right? It works to help you do great things, greater, and it can work to blow things up when things go bad. So, I think you do have to look sort of case by case at what's going on here. But when I look at a company like Oracle, if Oracle can call, you know, give him a 12% return on invested capital, which is what they've averaged the last five years or so. If you could tell them if you spend $100 billion, you can make $12 billion in profits, Larry Ellison and the management of of Oracle is right to say, well, I'll give you 200 billion, give me 24 billion in revenues. You know, or in returns and in ultimate returns here. So I think that, you know, if their cost of capital is 3%, if their return on invested capital is 12%, why wouldn't they take bigger bets to get that done? Yeah, you got to be smart, you got to pick the right customers. Well, who's smarter than than the folks at Oracle uh at managing this and taking advantage of this business opportunity? They have captured the biggest contracts out there. They have so far done a good job of executing those contracts. They're financing that using debt at a low cost of capital. That's business. It's smart business.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Six Charts That Show How Stock Markets Got Reshaped in 2025\n\nMichael Msika and Jan-Patrick Barnert\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nGOOG\n\n^VIX\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Stock investors can’t claim that this year has lacked market drama.\nIt didn’t always look likely, but equities have managed strong returns in 2025, weathering shocks like DeepSeek of China’s challenge to US artificial intelligence and the tariff storm unleashed by the Trump administration in April.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nDips were bought at record pace and a fear of missing out on the rally dominated sentiment. In the background, a powerful wave of diversification swept through the market as investors responded to the cracks appearing in so-called US exceptionalism by buying up European, Asian and emerging-market stocks.\nHere are six charts that capture some of the key episodes that reshaped equity markets in 2025:\n\nThe year started with investors maxed-out on American exposure and convinced US dominance was here to stay. But DeepSeek shook the status quo in the AI world, while President Donald Trump’s April tariff salvo all but spelled the end of the bull market that began in 2022. Still, as Trump dialed back his trade war, interest rates fell and the global economy showed resilience, investor confidence returned.\nThat didn’t spare US stocks from bearing the brunt of the selloff. And they never fully caught up with the rest of the world, held back by a weakening dollar. The greenback hasn’t clawed back its 13% slump in the first half, while a growing chorus of strategists has recommended international equities over their US peers.\nMSCI Inc.’s gauge of global stocks excluding the US is tracking its strongest outperformance over the S&P 500 since 2009.\nThe US flagship index is missing from the ranks of best-performing benchmarks, but it did still achieve decent enough gains of 14%. The nagging worry for investors has been the concentrated nature of those returns. “Bubble in the making” became a key concern this year, with some data echoing the early stages of excessive internet over-valuations. The tech sector’s weighting in the S&P 500 reached a record 36%, breaching the previous peak of 2000 leading into the dotcom crash, before retreating below 35%.\n\nA closer examination of this year’s trading reveals unprecedented levels of concentration behind the gains on Wall Street. Tech megacaps powered the rally all year long, with just five stocks accounting for nearly 45% of the benchmark’s returns: Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile excitement around AI has driven returns in the US and Asia, the story has been very different in Europe, a market crucially lacking tech stocks. Here, other thematics stepped to the fore. Banks led Europe’s rally, surging on the way to their strongest year since 1997, while governments’ defense, energy and infrastructure spending commitments lifted the names set to benefit from these outlays.\nThe upshot of all this is the widest dislocation in market leadership between the US and Europe ever seen. Value stocks inspired the advance in Europe, while growth equities led it in the US. This pushed investors into unchartered territory, as equity factors typically move in similar fashion.\nInvestors buffeted by April’s extreme turbulence could hardly have anticipated the relatively smooth ride they had the remaining three-quarters of the year. No drawdown exceeded 5% until November, with each dip enthusiastically snapped up at a rapid clip. The AI narrative, solid earnings and the leftovers from April’s sudden positioning washout encouraged investors to chase stocks steadily higher. The impressive rally stalled only as exuberance over AI was questioned in the final stretch of the year.\nStrong appetite for stocks has been accompanied by the destruction of volatility this year. Considering historical reset patterns for the VIX Index, it’s surprising how often the gauge managed to retrace a spike of 40% or more within a 10-day trading period. This didn’t happen at all before 2011, but has already occurred several times in topsy-turvy 2025.\nStock investors embraced the notion that volatility spikes have become increasingly short-lived. A new market logic appears to have taken hold: stocks panic, volatility gets bid, the risk event is resolved, gamma supply takes over and volatility quickly retreats.\nUS option volumes marked fresh highs, with two daily prints exceeding 100 million turnover this year for the first time. To emphasise the increased demand, trading volume was above 60 million daily contracts on 117 days compared to only 12 days in 2024.\nWhile hedging demand played a role in April and November, most of the time it was calls dominating the tape. With investors chasing the right tail as well as volatility sellers using ultra short-term contracts to earn income, the options market remains a key factor for stocks, contributing to the swift resets in volatility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

However, their sheer size makes it more challenging to maintain high growth rates as they’ve already captured significant portions of their markets.\nThese trade-offs can cause headaches for even the most seasoned professionals, which is why we started StockStory - to help you find high-quality companies that can grow their earnings no matter what. Keeping that in mind, here is one large-cap stock that still has big upside potential and two that could be stalling.\n\nTwo Large-Cap Stocks to Sell: Expedia (EXPE) Market Cap: $34.65 billion\nOriginally founded as a part of Microsoft, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is one of the world’s leading online travel agencies.\nWhy Does EXPE Worry Us?\nLarge revenue base makes it harder to increase sales quickly, and its annual revenue growth of 8.3% over the last three years was below our standards for the consumer internet sector\nPreference for prioritizing user growth over monetization has led to 1.7% annual drops in its average revenue per booking\nHighly competitive market means it’s on the never-ending treadmill of sales and marketing spend\n\nAt $285.52 per share, Expedia trades at 10.2x forward EV/EBITDA. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including EXPE in your portfolio, it’s free for active Edge members .\nHoneywell (HON) Market Cap: $126.9 billion\nOriginally founded in 1906 as a thermostat company, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) is a multinational conglomerate known for its aerospace systems, building technologies, performance materials, and safety and productivity solutions.\nWhy Are We Hesitant About HON?\nAbsence of organic revenue growth over the past two years suggests it may have to lean into acquisitions to drive its expansion\nProjected sales decline of 3.3% for the next 12 months points to a tough demand environment ahead\nShrinking returns on capital suggest that increasing competition is eating into the company’s profitability\n\nHoneywell is trading at $197.56 per share, or 19.5x forward P/E. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than HON .\nOne Large-Cap Stock to Watch: Wabtec (WAB) Market Cap: $36.53 billion\nAlso known as Wabtec, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (NYSE:WAB) provides equipment, systems, and related software for the railway industry.\nWhy Does WAB Stand Out?\nOperating profits and efficiency rose over the last five years as it benefited from some fixed cost leverage\nPerformance over the past two years was turbocharged by share buybacks, which enabled its earnings per share to grow faster than its revenue\nRobust free cash flow margin of 11.6% gives it many options for capital deployment\n\nStory Continues\nWabtec’s stock price of $213.41 implies a valuation ratio of 21.6x forward P/E. Is now the time to initiate a position? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nStocks We Like Even More The market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 6 Stocks for this week . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\nStocks that made our list in 2020 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-small-cap company Exlservice (+354% five-year return).

      "Content": "Billionaire Bill Gates Has 60% of His Foundation's $37 Billion Portfolio Invested in Noticeably Non-Tech Stocks Heading Into 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:50 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nKey Points Warren Buffett is one of the biggest donors to the Gates Foundation, and his influence is noticeable.\nThe foundation's trust invests primarily in slow-growing value stocks with wide moats.\nThese three companies are trading around fair value, with predictable growth ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\n\nBill Gates built his fortune through Microsoft , one of the world's largest tech companies . He and co-founder Paul Allen got in on the ground floor of the personal computing revolution and amassed fortunes as their company's value rose in tandem with the boom in PCs in the 1980s and 1990s. Gates became the world's first centibillionaire (a net worth of $100 billion) in 1999, nearly two decades before anyone else would reach that level of wealth.\nToday, Gates is still worth about $100 billion, despite Microsoft's value skyrocketing about sixfold from its peak in 1999. That's because he's turned his attention to his foundation, where he plans to give away 99% of his remaining wealth over the next 20 years.\nGates has historically donated his Microsoft shares to the foundation, but the foundation trust's portfolio has sold off those shares while remaining heavily invested in some noticeably non-tech names. In fact, about 60% of the trust's portfolio is invested in three mostly low-tech companies, following the investment managers' sale of about two-thirds of its Microsoft shares last quarter. Here's where the Gates Foundation is investing today.\n1. Berkshire Hathaway (29.3% of portfolio value) Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is a longtime donor to the Gates Foundation. Every year, he donates Class B shares of the stock to the foundation, along with several other charitable organizations. This year, he gave just over 9.4 million shares of the stock to the foundation at the end of June.\n\nBerkshire has produced solid results from its insurance business in 2025, despite setbacks from the California wildfires at the start of the year. Third-quarter results were particularly impressive, with underwriting earnings rising to $3.2 billion from $1 billion in Q3 2024. That more than offset the drop in earnings through the first half of the year.\nMeanwhile, Berkshire's massive investment portfolio continues to produce gains. However, Buffett and his investment team have struggled to find significant opportunities to invest Berkshire's growing cash pile . That pile's made bigger as Berkshire sells more equities than it buys every quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nShares of the conglomerate now trade for about 1.55 times book value. While that's above the stock's historic average, it's down from the high price investors were paying early in 2025. With Buffett's retirement announcement taking some air out of the stock, it's now trading closer to fair value at today's price, based on the assets held in its portfolio and its core operating results from insurance.\n\n2. Waste Management (17.1%) Waste Management (NYSE: WM) is one of the longest-held securities in the Gates Foundation trust. There's a good reason for that. It's a recession-resistant business with a huge competitive advantage.\nWaste Management's main waste-hauling business benefits from its scale and its dominant landfill ownership position. With its scale, the company is able to build a more efficient network of collection routes and transfer stations, benefiting its operating margin. Meanwhile, Waste Management's 262 active landfills put it in an enviable position among other waste haulers, as regulations make it extremely costly to obtain approval and build new landfills. As a result, the company has been able to raise prices every year due to the growing scarcity of landfills, while charging third-party waste haulers fees to use its facilities.\n\nThe business generated a 32% adjusted operating margin last quarter, continuing to demonstrate room for improvement as it exercises pricing power and scales.\nAdditionally, Waste Management now operates a medical waste disposal business following its acquisition of Stericycle, which it rebranded as WM Health Solutions. Management sees room for synergies to cut costs for the business, but it expects the market for Health Solutions to climb quickly over the next decade due to the aging U.S. population. For now, the business accounts for less than 10% of revenue.\nIt's no wonder that the trust has rarely sold shares of the stock, which has grown considerably over the last 25 years. Even with the company trading at an enterprise value of around 15 times its expected EBITDA over the next 12 months, it appears to be a good value. Strong earnings improvements for Health Solutions, combined with steady growth for the main waste-hauling business, should enable the stock to keep climbing from here.\n\n3. Canadian National Railway (13.6%) Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI) (TSX: CNR) connects Canada's east and west coasts with the Midwest United States and the Gulf Coast. Railroads remain an important method of hauling freight across dry land as massive scale drives overall costs lower. Better fuel efficiency than trucks, and the ability of trains to haul massive amounts, make them more economical for long-hauling. That said, it's a very slow-growing industry.\n\nOn the plus side, there are significant barriers to entry. It's practically impossible for a new company to compete with the big ones, as it takes thousands of freight contracts to generate the scale needed to operate profitably. Instead, the industry has consolidated over the years, as businesses look to take advantage of the benefits of scale. To that end, Canadian National has been able to raise prices steadily while growing contract volume. That's pushed its operating margin higher. It reached 38.6% last quarter.\nMany feared that tariffs would negatively affect the railroad's international freight business from Canada through the middle of the U.S. While management has seen a drop in volume for metals, minerals, and forest products due to the tariffs, it has seen increases in petroleum and chemicals, grain, coal, and fertilizers.\n\nDespite slow revenue growth, management has been able to increase its operating results while reducing its capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow growth climbed 14% through the first nine months of the year. Management expects further improvements in free cash flow in 2026, driven by additional reductions in capital expenditures. It returns that excess cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, the latter supporting mid-single-digit earnings-per-share growth.\nWith the company's enterprise value roughly 12 times analysts' EBITDA expectations, it appears to be a great value relative to its peers, trading closer to a 14-times multiple. Considering the barriers protecting the business, it's not surprising that the Gates Foundation continues to hold a massive position in the railroad.\n\nShould you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

(NYSE: NOW ) is included among the 12 Best Long Term US Stocks to Buy Now .\nPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on Unsplash\nOn December 17, BTIG initiated coverage of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with a Buy rating and a $1,000 price target.\nThe firm points to how far the platform has come since the launch of Now Assist two years ago. What started as an AI feature has grown into a broader system where humans and AI agents work side by side. ServiceNow now offers an AI Control Tower to handle oversight and governance, and it is working closely with Microsoft to run agent-based AI workflows across the entire enterprise. BTIG’s upside case assumes ServiceNow keeps operating above the Rule of 50. That includes revenue growth in the high teens and free cash flow growth in the mid-20% range.\n\nIn other news, Bloomberg reported that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is in advanced discussions to acquire cybersecurity startup Armis. The company was last valued at $6.1 billion, and the deal could reach around $7 billion, which would make it ServiceNow’s largest acquisition to date. The report cited people familiar with the talks, who said the discussions are private. The transaction could be announced as soon as this week, though it is not guaranteed to close. Neither Armis nor ServiceNow responded to a request for comment from CNBC.\nArmis focuses on securing and managing internet-connected devices, helping organizations protect against cyber risks. Just over a month ago, the company raised $435 million in new funding and said it plans to pursue an IPO over time.\n\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides a cloud-based platform that helps organizations automate and manage digital workflows across IT, HR, customer service, and other business functions.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Microsoft (MSFT) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) closed the most recent trading day at $483.84, moving +1.62% from the previous trading session.

      "Content": "Mag 7 stocks are 'back in favor' among retail investors: Robinhood\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Josh Lipton\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:30 PM PST\n\nIn this video: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nMETA\n\nHOOD\n\nRobinhood's ( HOOD ) chief brokerage officer, Steve Quirk, joins Market Domination host Josh Lipton to talk about trends among retail investors before 2025 draws to a close.\nWatch the video above to hear more about retail investor behavior on the platform.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nYou know, Steve, more broadly, I always love having you on because you have such unique line of sight into the retail investors and and what they're doing with their money, Steve. Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
