Market momentum remained stable, marking the fifth consecutive quarter in which growth has remained above 20% highlighting continued strength across the sector. This performance reflects a significant shift in the technology landscape as enterprise demand for AI moves beyond early experimentation toward scaled production deployment. As this transition accelerates, hyperscalers are increasingly redirecting competition away from the incremental gains in model performance and toward platform-level capabilities that support multi-model deployment and ensure the reliable operation of AI agents in real-world environments.\n\nIn Q3 2025, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud maintained their market rankings from the previous quarter, collectively accounting for 66% of global cloud infrastructure spending. Together, the three hyperscalers delivered 29% year-on-year growth.\nAWS’s growth reaccelerated to 20% year on year quartering Q3 2025, marking its strongest performance since 2022. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud also maintained strong momentum, each delivering year-on-year growth of more than 35%. As enterprise demand for AI continues to materialize, growth in the cloud market is shifting from early-stage experimentation and pilot projects toward the scaled deployment of enterprise-grade AI applications. Backlog levels among leading cloud providers continued to rise, with AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud all reporting further increases in Q3 order backlogs, reinforcing the market’s underlying resilience and healthy demand environment.\n\nHyperscalers’ AI strategies are evolving from a primary focus on incremental model performance toward more platform-driven and production-ready approaches. Enterprises are no longer evaluating AI platforms solely on model capabilities, but increasingly on their support for multi-model strategies and agent-based applications.\nThis shift is accelerating hyperscalers’ move toward platform-level AI capabilities. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are integrating proprietary foundation models with a growing range of third-party and open-weight models, leveraging managed AI platforms and services such as Amazon Bedrock, Azure AI Foundry, and Vertex AI’s Model Garden to expand support for multi-model adoption.\n\"Collaboration across the ecosystem remains critical,\" said Rachel Brindley, Senior Director at Omdia . \"Multi-model support is increasingly viewed as a production requirement rather than a feature, as enterprises seek resilience, cost control, and deployment flexibility across generative AI workloads.\"\n\nStory Continues\nMeanwhile, hyperscalers are stepping up investment in agent build-and-run capabilities, as real-world deployment continues to prove more complex than early experimentation suggested. \"Many enterprises still lack standardized building blocks that can support business continuity, customer experience, and compliance at the same time, which is slowing the real-world deployment of AI agents,\" said Yi Zhang, Senior Analyst at Omdia . \"This is where hyperscalers are increasingly stepping in, using platform-led approaches to make it easier for enterprises to build and run agents in production environments.\"\n\nRecent launches such as AWS AgentCore and Microsoft’s Agent Framework reflect this direction, providing standardized foundational capabilities that help enterprises more efficiently build, deploy, and operate AI agents in production settings.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) led the global cloud infrastructure market with a 32% share and 20% year-on-year revenue growth. This performance was supported by easing compute supply constraints, alongside incremental demand driven by its partnership with Anthropic. AWS reported a total backlog of $200 billion by the end of Q3, underscoring sustained demand. Amazon Bedrock continues to evolve rapidly, expanding both model choice and platform capabilities, including support for Claude 4.5, 18 managed open-weight models, and enhanced Guardrails and Data Automation features. At AWS re:Invent 2025, AWS also introduced the Nova 2 model family, Nova Act, and Nova Forge, strengthening its end-to-end enterprise AI stack from models to agents and automation. In addition, AWS expanded its regional footprint with the launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region in September, adding three availability zones to support local data residency and low-latency workloads.\n\nMicrosoft Azure remained the world’s second-largest cloud provider in Q3 2025, holding a 22% market share and delivering robust 40% year-on-year revenue growth. In October, Microsoft renewed its partnership with OpenAI, further anchoring OpenAI’s AI development and deployment on Azure. Azure AI Foundry continued to broaden its model ecosystem, supporting multiple frontier foundation models, including Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Haiku 4.5. The platform now serves more than 80,000 customers and provides access to over 11,000 models. In October, Microsoft also introduced the Microsoft Agent Framework, enabling enterprises to build and orchestrate multi-agent systems. Customers such as KPMG are already applying the framework to enhance audit processes, with these production-grade AI deployments contributing to Azure’s overall growth momentum. In parallel, Microsoft continued to invest in regional infrastructure, announcing plans in November to expand its Azure cloud region in Malaysia and to launch a new Azure datacenter region in India in 2026.\n\nGoogle Cloud remained the world’s third-largest cloud services provider in Q3 2025, delivering strong 36% year-on-year growth and increasing its market share to 11%. Growth was primarily driven by enterprise AI offerings, with quarterly revenue from this segment reaching several billion dollars. As of September 30, Google Cloud reported a backlog of $157.7 billion, up sharply from $108.2 billion in Q2, underscoring strengthening demand visibility. On the platform side, Vertex AI’s Model Garden continued to expand its large-scale AI model portfolio, adding new models such as multimodal variants from the Gemini 2.5 series, Kimi K2 Thinking, and DeepSeek-V3.2. In October 2025, Google Cloud also launched Gemini Enterprise, an AI platform designed for enterprise customers that integrates the Gemini model family with enterprise-grade AI agents, no-code development tools, and security and governance capabilities.\n\nOmdia defines cloud infrastructure services as the sum of bare metal as a service (BMaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and container-as-a-service (CaaS) and serverless that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users via the Internet.\nABOUT OMDIA\nOmdia , part of Informa TechTarget, Inc.

According to an estimate by McKinsey, companies need to invest a staggering $5.2 trillion by 2030 on data centers equipped to handle AI processing loads.\n\nHowever, technology is only part of the story. Power is quietly becoming a major factor in driving the AI revolution because AI data centers consume an enormous amount of electricity. As a result, leading energy infrastructure companies such as NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC) (NYSE: BEP) are emerging as leaders in powering the AI revolution.\nPartnering with AI leaders NextEra Energy owns the country's largest electric utility (Florida Power & Light) and one of the largest energy infrastructure development companies (NextEra Energy Resources). The energy resources segment owns and develops energy infrastructure, including electricity transmission lines and power generation facilities, to support third-party demand.\n\nThe company has become a key partner of choice for technology companies to help power their AI strategies over the past year. In October, NextEra Energy signed a new collaboration with Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google to accelerate nuclear energy deployment in the U.S. As part of the partnership, NextEra Energy will restart its dormant Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa to support Google's growing power needs. The tech titan has signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) to purchase the bulk of the power produced by the facility upon its return to commercial service in the first quarter of 2029.\nNextEra and Google also announced a significant expansion of their energy and technology collaboration in December. They will partner on developing multiple gigawatt (GW)-scale data center campuses in the future with accompanying generation and capacity. NextEra will supply the energy expertise, while Google will bring its data center development capabilities to the partnership.\nNextEra Energy is also working with Meta Platforms to help power its AI operations. Meta Platforms recently signed 11 PPAs and two energy storage agreements. NextEra will develop several solar energy projects for Meta, totaling 2.5 GW of power-producing capacity.\n\nStory Continues\nMassive power deals Brookfield Renewable is a leading global renewable energy producer . It sells the power it produces to utilities and large corporations under long-term PPAs.\nEarlier this year, Brookfield announced a first-of-its-kind Hydro Framework Agreement with Google. The cloud giant will purchase up to 3 GW of carbon-free hydroelectric power from the company in the future, marking the largest-ever hydropower deal. The first two 20-year PPAs represent over $3 billion of power and cover Brookfield's Holtwood and Safe Harbor hydroelectric facilities in Pennsylvania, which have a combined generating capacity of 670 megawatts.\n\nBrookfield also signed a first-of-its-kind global renewable energy framework with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) last year. The five-year agreement will see Brookfield develop over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity for the technology giant in the 2026 through 2030 time frame across the U.S. and Europe. It's eight times bigger than the largest single corporate PPA ever signed. The deal will provide Microsoft with a pipeline of renewable energy capacity to support growing demand for its cloud and AI services. The companies have the potential to expand their collaboration to Asia-Pacific, India, and Latin America in the future, as well as to new or impactful carbon-free energy sources beyond wind and solar.\nAdditionally, Brookfield Renewable has an investment in Westinghouse Electric, a nuclear technology company . The U.S. Government recently signed a strategic partnership with Westinghouse to build at least $80 billion of new nuclear reactors in the country using the company's technology. These plants will help support the country's growing AI power needs.\n\nThe power behind the AI revolution NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable are two of the world's largest clean power producers. They have the electricity production capacity and development capabilities to meet the growing power needs of AI. That's leading tech titans Google, Meta, Microsoft, and others to join forces with these energy companies to help fuel the AI revolution. These deals will provide technology companies with the energy they need, while potentially powering robust total returns for investors in NextEra Energy and Brookfield Renewable in the coming years.\n\nShould you buy stock in NextEra Energy right now?

      "Content": "Meet the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Pays More Dividends Than Any Other S&P 500 Company. Here's Why It's a Buy Before 2026.\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:05 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nMETA\n\nTSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a textbook example of why the dividend growth rate can be more important to long-term investors than the current dividend yield.\nThe tech giant is taking a calculated risk on artificial intelligence (AI) spending by ensuring it doesn’t strain its balance sheet or free cash flow.\nMicrosoft can support future dividend raises due to its diversified and high-margin business model.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\n\" Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Nvidia , Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Amazon , Meta Platforms , and Tesla -- are known for their market-beating returns in recent years and runways for future growth.\nSo you may be surprised to learn that Microsoft pays more dividends (in terms of total cash spent) than any other S&P 500 company -- even more than Apple, JPMorgan Chase , and high-yield behemoths like ExxonMobil , Chevron , Johnson & Johnson , and Verizon Communications .\nIn fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30, Microsoft spent $18.42 billion on stock buybacks and $24.08 billion on dividends. In September, Microsoft announced a 10% dividend raise, marking its 16th consecutive annual increase.\nDespite only yielding 0.7%, here's why Microsoft is an excellent dividend-paying growth stock for long-term investors to buy now.\nMicrosoft is an underrated dividend stock One of the biggest mistakes dividend investors make is overly focusing on a stock's forward dividend yield, which is the return you can expect to make from the stock's annualized dividend, divided by its current stock price. Forward dividend yield is useful, but limited. It's merely a snapshot of a dividend yield at a moment in time. It doesn't accurately reflect a stock's true passive income potential, which is more closely tied to the dividend growth rate.\n\nThe best dividend-paying growth stocks are companies that consistently growth their earnings, and in turn, can justify paying a higher dividend expense. And if investors are confident that earnings can continue rising, the stock price should go up over time. There's even an elite group of companies known as Dividend Kings that have raised their payouts annually for over 50 consecutive years -- like Coca-Cola .\nMicrosoft is the fourth most valuable company in the world and has produced monster gains for long-term investors. But it has also become a passive income powerhouse.\nIf you had bought Microsoft 10 years ago for around $56 per share, your yield on cost would be 6.5%. Yield on cost takes the annualized dividend and divides it by the price you paid for the stock, rather than its current price, which better represents the dividend income generated based on your initial investment.\n\nStory Continues\nThe issue with forward dividend yield is that it punishes high-performing stocks and rewards underperforming stocks. Many of the highest-yielding companies in the S&P 500 are stocks that have gone down in price in recent years, rather than companies that are rapidly raising their dividends.\nBy comparison, Microsoft has increased its dividend by over 250% over the last decade, but the stock price has gone up even more, so the yield has dropped -- overshadowing Microsoft's commitment to its dividend.\n\nWhat's more, Microsoft also buys back a ton of stock -- far more than it pays in stock-based compensation. Like dividends, stock buybacks are a lever companies can pull to return capital directly to shareholders. If buybacks are larger than stock-based compensation, the outstanding share count will fall. And with fewer shares to go around, earnings per share will rise faster than net income, making the stock a better value for long-term investors.\nMicrosoft's spending is bold, but controlled Microsoft is the most balanced Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026 because it rewards shareholders through a combination of organic growth, dividends, and buybacks. The company has a booming cloud computing business through Microsoft Azure; is a major player in artificial intelligence (AI) through OpenAI (which powers a lot of Microsoft's AI tools); has a massive software, gaming, and personal computing presence; and owns a variety of platforms -- from GitHub to LinkedIn.\n\nBut no single segment makes or breaks the investment thesis. Rather, Microsoft has numerous high-margin ways to deploy capital, which can reduce the temptation to bet too heavily on a single idea.\nBig tech companies have been in the spotlight for their AI spending, with concerns that the payoff of that spending is uncertain or won't be realized for several years. Microsoft is spending heavily on AI, but not to the point where it's straining free cash flow (FCF).\nFCF is a crucial metric for determining the amount of cash flowing in or out of the business. The formula is simply cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures (capex). As you can see in the chart, Microsoft's capex has exploded higher in recent years, but so has its cash from operations. So it is still growing FCF.\nHowever, some companies, like Meta Platforms, are growing capex faster than cash flow from operations, which is leading to lower FCF. Meta still has a phenomenal balance sheet and high margins, but the aggressive spending adds more pressure for investments to pay off.\nA foundational stock to buy now Microsoft's high dividend growth rate and commitment to returning capital to shareholders should allow it to maintain its position as the S&P 500 component with the largest dividend expense for years to come. Investors who buy the stock today will only get a 0.7% yield based on its current price, but they can expect the yield on cost to be much higher in the future as Microsoft raises its payout.\n\nMicrosoft's growing dividend, reasonable valuation, and high-margin diversified business make it one of the most balanced stocks to buy and hold, even if there's a stock market sell-off in 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Maybe the company didn't sort of message very well about some delays at one of its um data centers in terms of construction or one of the data centers it's leasing, not that it owns. Um, are you worried about that name, you know, in terms of execution risk, in terms of debt, in terms of the business model?\n00:32 Speaker B\nYeah, I'm not I mean, because I look at Core Weave, Nebius is another one from some of the Neo clouds. Look, I just my view is like, you're going to see things quarter to quarter move out. You you're going to see some blemishes in this really fourth industrial revolution. But I don't view it as sort of these panic moments, everyone heads for the elevator, yelling fire in a crowd theater. I mean, I do think this is one where it's going to be hyperfocused, but the onus is on them to execute, communicate it. Because right now, like, investors are so sensitive naturally, right? In terms of like, is this a bubble? Again, like I've told you, I I think it's 10:30 p.m. in that AI party that goes to 4:00 a.m. but these are that the responsibility is on the companies to communite.\n01:21 Speaker A\nOkay, so let me ask you this then. Like, I understand the thesis on the whole AI space, but if there are ones that are maybe a little bit higher risk in terms of messaging and execution, why not avoid that one? Why just not buy the other ones that don't necessarily have that risk?\n01:40 Speaker B\nSure, and like in our ETF, like we have the 30 AI win, I mean Core Weave's one of them, but the point is like, you can't just like bet on one company. I think you do have to like whether it's Godfather of AI Jensen video, whether it's AMD, whether it's Micron, on the software and the hyperscalar side, bet on your Pounteers, the Mongo DBs, the energy companies, the GE Vernovas and others. So I do think like to that point\n01:54 Speaker A\nYou disperse it.\n01:55 Speaker B\nYou have because you have to think about like a barbell approach. If you just bet on one, there's risk, right? In terms of like what could happen with that company. WeWork would be a perfect example. I think when it comes to the best way to play AI revolution, you have to own some chip names, software,\n02:22 Speaker A\nBut But I guess I'm asking why not avoid say a Core Weave and an Oracle? Why not just leave them out?\n02:27 Speaker B\nYeah, look, but but my to that point is investors be like, oh, you don't touch them, they're toxic. But then let's say six, nine months from now, you're like, okay, how come I didn't buy Oracle at 180 when now it's 240. So, so my view is like, if there was structural issues, if I didn't believe in the thesis, if there was something that felt like it was a business model change, then you avoid them. But I don't believe that is, but it speaks to like, look, you need like you know, strong hands and sort of you know, a strong stomach to battle through some of these sort of like waves that we're going to see, the deep seek moments, liberation day. I mean, we'll have more in 26, right? But it speaks to my view like you'll be wearing a, you know, S&P 7,000 hat, an 8,000 hat in New York. Like that's my view where we're two more years left in the tech bull market. and again, the bears in hibernation mode, they can't see in their spreadsheets. They missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years, focus on what could happen.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Business\nA $1 trillion IPO looms, and Amazon may have just locked in early\n\nFaizan Farooque\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 10:47 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAmazon is increasingly aggressive and smart in its battle to acquire a greater role in AI .\nAmazon will reportedly make a huge $10 billion investment in OpenAI, which shocked Wall Street and rattled Silicon Valley. If the Reuters report is confirmed in the not-so-distant future, the deal won't simply be about getting in on the hottest name in AI.\n\nIt would mean that Amazon is willing to put real money behind its chips, cloud, and reputation, even if it has long been seen as behind in the AI arms race.\nIt's also an uncommon move for Amazon that will have ramifications for chip stocks, cloud computing, and the planned OpenAI IPO .\nAmazon's AI problem and how $10 billion could fix it Amazon is a cloud powerhouse thanks to AWS, but when it comes to high-profile AI projects, it has fallen behind Microsoft and Google.\nYears ago, Microsoft put $13 billion into OpenAI. Google is sponsoring both its own DeepMind subsidiary and its competitor Anthropic.\nAs for Amazon, people have spoken a lot about its Trainium and Inferentia chips and released services like Bedrock, but investors weren't very impressed — until now.\n\nRelated: Nvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nIf Amazon invests in OpenAI, it will get one of the world's most valuable AI workloads.\nOpenAI previously inked a $38 billion cloud agreement with AWS , but this arrangement might go much further and require OpenAI to employ Amazon's proprietary processors. That goes directly against Nvidia 's supremacy and strongly supports Trainium's claim of low cost and high performance.\nIt also has a number of strategic uses:\nGets AWS a big-name AI customer.\nShows Wall Street that Amazon's story about bespoke silicon is true.\nTells clients that Amazon is decreasing the cost of AI computing.\nPortrays Amazon as a legitimate \"AI arms dealer\" with tangible infrastructure.\nAnd the market saw it. The revelation made Amazon's stock rise, and some experts say this is when investors started to see Amazon as a real \"AI play.\"\n\nA high-stakes deal, just as the cloud gets crowded The timing couldn't be better. AWS is still the leader in cloud market share , but it is seeing more competition from Microsoft, Google, and fast-growing \"neo-cloud\" firms such as CoreWeave and Crusoe.\nBig companies, including Capital One, have voiced concerns about the escalating prices of AWS. Some people are even thinking about switching suppliers or creating their own AI infrastructure.\n\nMore AI Stocks:\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\nBank of America updates Palantir stock forecast after private meeting\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\nBank of America sets AI stocks to buy list for 2026\n\nStory Continues\nA collaboration with OpenAI helps Amazon respond to that criticism. It sends a message: AWS isn't simply selling computing power; it's constructing the infrastructure for AI on a large scale and at a lower cost.\nWhat if OpenAI trains GPT-5 on Trainium chips instead of Nvidia processors? That's a big gain for believability.\n\nIt's also a way to protect investments. Anthropic has already gotten money from Amazon. It might now be supporting both of the top independent AI laboratories, which would guarantee its victory.\nRelated: Intel CEO deals spark controversy, debate\nMore broadly, the deal:\nStrengthens Amazon’s grip on multi-billion dollar AI workloads.\nUndermines \"single-cloud\" dependence criticism.\nAdds pressure on neo-cloud startups and rivals like Oracle.\nCould slow defections from AWS by enterprise clients concerned about cost.\nA trillion-dollar AI IPO? Amazon wants in The other side? OpenAI's plan to go public.\nOpenAI may now accept money from people who don't work for Microsoft after a big restructuring in 2025.\nAmazon entering the cap table gives it more weight, which probably raises OpenAI's value toward the projected $1 trillion IPO goal in 2026 or 2027.\nAmazon isn't only about using the cloud. It's a gamble that OpenAI will be a key player in the next tech era. And if OpenAI leverages Amazon's infrastructure to get there, that's even better.\n\nRelated: US Navy bets $448M on Palantir AI to speed shipbuilding\nThe acquisition does, however, pose certain dangers. Some experts are concerned about how \"circular\" these investments are: Big Tech gives money to startups, which then spend that money on Big Tech's platforms. That kind of thing has happened before in tech bubbles.\nBut Amazon's effort is plainly different in one way. It's not simply buying enthusiasm; it wants to sell the infrastructure that makes it work.\nHere’s why the deal could reshape the landscape:\nAmazon would join Microsoft as a top-tier OpenAI partner.\nOpenAI gains multi-cloud flexibility (Azure, AWS, Oracle).\nTrainium adoption could reduce Nvidia dependence.\nOpenAI gets a financial runway to delay IPO if needed.\nAmazon may lock in rights to exclusive OpenAI features.\nRelated: Box office is booming in 2025 but Netflix’s $82.7 billion surprise raises alarms\nThis story was originally published by TheStreet on Dec 21, 2025, where it first appeared in the Investing section.

      "Content": "The 3 Deep Learning Stocks That Could Be Worth 50% More by 2027\n\nBilly Duberstein, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 8:10 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Microsoft owns 27% of OpenAI, with massive Azure cloud contracts in the pipeline.\nAlphabet has come back to be a recognized leader in generative AI, with a big lead in autonomous vehicles.\nIntel has begun its turnaround, which should only accelerate in 2026.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n2025 is nearly over, and despite the strong year, many investors are biting their fingernails over the prospects for 2026. Will the artificial intelligence (AI) boom continue despite talks of a bubble and debt investors recently balking at funding large-scale data centers? Whom will President Donald Trump pick as the new Federal Reserve chair, and will the new nominee be independent?\n\nShort-term concerns always dominate headlines and investors' mindsets in the moment, but real long-term outperformance comes from taking a broader mindset and looking at the big picture.\nAssuming the AI buildout continues apace and AI usage increases over the next several years -- and there's no evidence AI adoption is slowing at all -- these three artificial intelligence stocks still look like they have upside. In fact, there's a case for 50% upside for each in 2026.\n1. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is up a solid 15% year to date in 2025 but has pulled back in recent months. Investors have grown nervous over OpenAI's technical moat and ability to fund massive spending commitments. That's important for Microsoft, which is both a 27% owner of OpenAI and a cloud provider for $250 billion of OpenAI cloud computing commitments -- a result of the 2025 negotiations by which OpenAI converted into a for-profit company.\n\nThat ownership and cloud pipeline would be highly bullish for Microsoft, but doubt has crept in regarding OpenAI's lead in generative AI in recent months. Rival Anthropic has shown significant enterprise growth, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) released its impressive Gemini 3 model in November.\nStill, the fear may be misplaced. It doesn't seem likely that the AI revolution would be dominated by a single model builder, but rather by a cohort of winners in an oligopoly. That's how both the semiconductor and cloud computing sectors have evolved. The AI large language model (LLM) market will likely follow a similar path.\nAfter all, Alphabet was regarded as a loser in the AI race as recently as this year, only to retake the lead. OpenAI is certainly not going away, and this week's investment in OpenAI by Amazon appears to indicate that at least some astute executives and investors still believe in the company.\n\nContinua a leggere\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley sell-side analyst Keith Weiss just upgraded Microsoft stock, giving it a $650 price target, good for 35% upside from the current price. His analysis and conversations with management indicated that Azure AI demand is stronger than initially thought and that Azure AI's gross margins can expand with scale as more revenue is generated over the next two years. Furthermore, Weiss noted that his estimates don't even contemplate the full OpenAI contract, which could lead to further upside.\n\n2026 should also see the introduction of Microsoft's next-generation AI chip, named Braga. According to reports this past summer, the chip was initially planned for 2025, but a redesign pushed back its introduction by six months. If Microsoft can develop an impressive in-house-designed chip, as Alphabet and Amazon have, that could lead to even more optimism.\n2. Alphabet Speaking of Alphabet, it would definitely be possible for both Microsoft and Alphabet to appreciate 50% in 2026. While Alphabet has had the best year of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, up 62% on the year, Alphabet also entered the year as the cheapest of the bunch. In fact, despite this year's rise, it's still the second-cheapest of the bunch .\n\nComing into the year, investors were nervous that AI chatbots could disrupt Alphabet's Search business. However, that doesn't seem to be happening. Search paid clicks grew by 2%, 4%, and 7% in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively, showing a reacceleration after Alphabet introduced AI Mode into Search in May.\nWith the November release of Gemini 3, Alphabet has seemingly taken the lead for the moment in the AI race across several benchmarks. What's even better is that Gemini 3 was trained on Alphabet's homegrown Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Following the Gemini release, other major companies are now looking to buy or lease TPUs from Alphabet or its cloud unit, Google Cloud.\n\nEven Alphabet rival Meta Platforms is reportedly considering using TPUs, according to late-November press reports. And just last Friday, Reuters reported a massive cloud deal worth over $10 billion between cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks and Google Cloud.\nThat all bodes very well for Google Cloud, which has been an incredibly underrated part of Alphabet's business. Google Cloud has now reached scale, with a $60 billion revenue run-rate and an almost $5 billion operating profit run-rate as of the last quarter. Growth accelerated by 34% for that business in Q3, accompanied by margin expansion.\nSo not only could the Cloud unit become a second major profit center beyond ad revenue, but 2026 could also bring exciting developments for Waymo. Waymo is now delivering over 1 million autonomous rides per month, with a significant lead over competitors in scaling. Next year could bring about more disclosure around Waymo's revenue or valuation, which could add yet another major business to Alphabet's expanding empire.\n\n3. Intel Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has had an even better year than Alphabet or Microsoft, up 83.6% on the year thus far. Of course, Intel was trading at a practically distressed price heading into 2025, below its book value and without a CEO. And despite the 2025 surge, its market cap is still far, far lower than all the supposed AI winners of today.\n\nMeanwhile, 2026 is shaping up to be an exciting year. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who joined the company in March, will begin to make his presence felt more noticeably. The all-important 18A node -- the node at which Intel predicts it will either equal competitors or regain its technology leadership in the industry -- will begin to deliver product. 18A has just begun high-volume manufacturing this quarter, with the first 18A product, Panther Lake, set to enter the laptop market in January.\nSuccess on 18A in the form of better revenue and margins could yield external customer wins for future nodes 18AP and 14A. Already, technology pundits are reporting that major companies such as Apple , Nvidia, and even Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices are looking to potentially use the 14A node for their server central processing units (CPUs), according to analysts for China research firm GF Securities.\n\nIf an external customer were to commit to Intel's 14A node, which is expected to be released in 2027 or 2028, there could be confirmation of the customer win during 2026. After all, there has already been a flurry of positive reports on 14A technology and the adoption of Intel's EMIB packaging technology over the past month or so.\nIf investors come to believe that Intel has pulled even or ahead in terms of process technology, financial results improve with 18A manufacturing, and/or Intel announces a significant external 18AP or 14A customer win for its foundry, there is still considerable upside left in the stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

Investors have just become choosier about which players might emerge as winners heading into 2026.\nTech ( XLK ) stocks have been on a rollercoaster recently as concerns over funding for Oracle ( ORCL ) data centers and construction delays from CoreWeave ( CRWV ) rattled AI plays.\n\n\"I do believe these are all hyper-valid concerns for the theme, and with the market now breaking out the 'scrutiny scalpel' we are finally seeing appropriate 'winners and losers' dispersion, and that's a good thing,\" Nomura Securities equity derivatives analyst Charlie McElligott wrote in a note on Thursday.\nHowever, Micron Technology's ( MU ) blockbuster results sparked a rebound in AI trades. The memory chipmaker beat Wall Street estimates on Q1 revenue and EPS, helped by AI-fueled demand.\nMcElligott compared Micron's earnings' \"upside shock\" to Nvidia's ( NVDA ) results in May 2023 , which acted as a catalyst for the broader AI boom.\n\"Point-being, there is still blood left in this AI stone,\" McElligott wrote.\n\nInvestors have been watching for potential funding risks within the AI trade after Oracle stock fell following a Financial Times report that Blue Owl Capital would not support Oracle's $10 billion data center project.\nThe concerns are particularly notable given the market concentration among the largest tech companies in the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ).\n\nGoldman Sachs analysts forecast S&P 500 earnings growth of over 12% in 2026, largely driven by the top seven stocks in the index. Those include Nvidia ( NVDA ), Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Broadcom ( AVGO ), and Meta ( META ). Together, they account for roughly a quarter of the index's earnings.\nMeanwhile, the \"Magnificent 7\" tech players are up an average of 21% this year, compared with a 16% gain for the S&P 500, according to Yahoo Finance data.\nSevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye told Yahoo Finance he expects to see winners and losers within the group heading into next year.",

      "Content": "The Magnificent Seven Myth Is Starting to Crack\n\nDouglas A. McIntyre\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:23 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nQuick Read Only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are outperforming the S&P 500 this year, with the rest of the Magnificent Seven lagging the index.\nMarket leadership has thinned materially, a classic late-cycle signal as former leaders lose momentum after a multi-year run.\nInvestors sitting on outsized gains in index funds or mega-cap stocks may want to trim exposure as bull-market fatigue builds.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nWatch the Video There is a widespread perception that the Magnificent Seven represent the greatest investment basket in history. Put equal money into all seven, hold forever, and you cannot lose. Lee and I both agreed that this narrative is starting to break down.\nThe data point that changed the discussion Lee cited recent work from BTIG that caught his attention. As of mid-December, only Nvidia and Alphabet are beating the S&P 500 this year. The rest of the Magnificent Seven are trailing the benchmark. That surprised even seasoned investors. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperforming was not shocking, but Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) lagging the index caught many people off guard given its solid earnings and strong AI narrative.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) have also struggled on a relative basis. Collectively, that means five of the seven stocks that carried the market for nearly three years are no longer doing the heavy lifting.\nLeadership fatigue is a market signal Lee and I have both seen this movie before. Every era has its dominant group, whether it was the Nifty Fifty in the 1960s, the dot-com leaders in 2000, or the financials and housing-related stocks before the global financial crisis. Leadership does not disappear forever, but it does rotate. What makes the current setup notable is how quickly that rotation is happening.\n\nI said plainly that when leading stocks start to run out of gas, that is often how market tops are formed. You do not need the entire market to collapse. You just need fewer stocks pulling it higher. When five of the seven biggest drivers stall, the margin for error shrinks fast.\nA strong market with hidden fragility Lee pointed out that the S&P 500 itself has still had a very good year, up roughly 15% to 17%, and is on track for a third consecutive year of double-digit gains. That is rare. This has been one of the longest bull runs we have seen since the mid-1990s, rivaling the recovery periods after the dot-com bust and the financial crisis.\n\nStory Continues\nThat strength is exactly why complacency becomes dangerous. Long bull markets convince investors that the ride will never end. History says otherwise.\nThe oldest rule still applies Lee closed the thought perfectly, echoing one of the oldest adages on Wall Street. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Casinos are not built because the house loses. The long-term trend of the S&P 500 may be upward, but it is not a straight line. Knowing when leadership is narrowing can be the difference between protecting gains and giving them back.\n\nTranscript: [00:00:04] Doug McIntyre: Lee, there is a conception that the Magnificent seven are the, that is the best investment in the history of the world.\n[00:00:11] Just take those, put your money into them. you'll be good forever. Put an equal amount of money into each one you cannot lose. Guess what? How are they doing compared to the S&P 500 this year?\n\n[00:00:27] Lee Jackson: Well, strangely enough, and, this caught my attention about three or four days ago, maybe a week, and it was an article from the good folks at BTIG, which is an outstanding firm on Wall Street that pointed out that only Nvidia and Google were beating the S&P 500 this year, the rest of the Magnificent seven, and you know who they are.\n[00:00:53] Trailing the basic index for large cap stocks, which I was stunned by that, because I knew, that Amazon had underperformed, so I thought, well, that, that doesn't surprise me, but I thought Microsoft would be ahead of it. 'cause they've had a solid year. No, just those two.\n[00:01:13] Doug McIntyre: well, yeah, meta, listen, some of those stocks have really done very poorly.\n\n[00:01:19] Lee Jackson: on a comparative basis. Yeah, so I mean, literally they led the market for almost three years. So it's no surprise that they're having a hard time at this juncture because most of 'em, for the most part, are overbought and they tend to correct extremely quickly. And only Nvidia and Google have had the huge stories behind them and, so much positive earningS&Positive forward expectations, right. That, yeah. So it, it's interesting though, how a group, but it, listen, we've been around long enough to see, and I wasn't really in the business in the sixties for the Nifty 50, but there's always been a group of stocks, like we discussed recently, there's only like two stocks that were the top stocks in 2000 in the S&P 500 that still are.\n\n[00:02:08] So it just shows you, how things rotate. And one of those was Microsoft, but it shows you how things rotate and it's only at like once in a generation. It's not like once every a hundred years.\n[00:02:19] Doug McIntyre: Well, I think if you want to call ato, if you say, when do you call a peak in a stock market. Okay. When do you think a stock market actually has hit a spot and the only direction is down?\n[00:02:33] Take the stocks that are the leading stocks and when they start to run out of gas, and you've just described, you've got five of seven running outta gas, you're really thinning out the stocks that have pulled the market higher. Absolutely. But when I start to see those guys get weak, I start to call a top.\n\n[00:02:54] That's when I start to see a top in the stock market. Yeah.\n[00:02:57] Lee Jackson: and the S&P and the thing that's, that, that's interesting about that is now it's not like the S&P hasn't had a decent year. It's up 15, 16, 17% in the ballpark. And we're headed for the third full year of double digit. S&P 500, growth going up, over double digits for three years in a row.\n[00:03:19] And this has been one of the longest bull markets we've had since I, I don't know. I, guess you'd have to go back to the early aughts, when we rallied out of the, out of the dot com explosion or maybe the period after the real estate stuff from maybe 2010 to 15. But I haven't seen anything like this since the mid nineties.\n\n[00:03:40] Doug McIntyre: Well, let's go back to something we said earlier, and it's important if you own the S&P 500, if you've got a financial in, in instrument where you own it, we're talking about taking half of your profits off the table, right? That isn't just true of stocks, okay? Yeah. If you own S&P 500, if you own gold, whatever it is, don't just stay there and assume that, well, this is gonna go up forever.\n[00:04:06] It's great. If you've made a lot of money on, being, there's several ways to be in the S&P 500. I would, I'd sell some of that absolutely.\n[00:04:18] Lee Jackson: After this year, after the run we've had these last three years. That's what I mean. That's always been, trust me, when I was a salesman, that was the, I, could easily get people to buy, but it was hard to get them to sell for just that reason.\n\n[00:04:32] They thought, oh, it's gonna go higher. And I said, well, look, that's why I always had, look, let's sell half. Let's sell a third. Let's at least put some in the bank. Because they don't build those casinos 'cause the house loses and eventually this will come back down. The long term for the S&P 500 is a sweet 45 degree angle, but it has some big dips in it.\n[00:04:52] And sometimes those dips take quite a while to come back. I mean, after 2000, after that blowup, it took years for the NASDAQ to come back. Oh my God. Like 10 years it took years. And after other sell offs, it's taken years so it never hurts to take some money. And then you can reinvest that into something maybe a little safer or a stock that hasn't run as much, or whatever the case might be.\n\n[00:05:16] But I think you're exactly right. It's the old adage on Wall Street, this one, nobody ever went broke, taking a profit.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "How Oracle became a ‘poster child’ for AI bubble fears\n\nLaura Bratton\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 7:00 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nGOOG\n\nSFTBF\n\nMSFT\n\nOracle ( ORCL ) stock’s boom and bust in 2025 has become emblematic of the tech trade’s central conflict: Investors can’t decide whether AI is a generational opportunity or a looming risk.\nOracle started the year on a high note by announcing a joint venture with ChatGPT developer OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) and SoftBank called Stargate, in which the companies committed to investing $500 billion in US AI infrastructure. President Trump announced the news in the Oval Office in January, flanked by the respective companies’ leaders, including Oracle chair Larry Ellison — a move that sent the stock soaring .\n\nAI optimism continued to push Oracle shares higher following its quarterly earnings reports in June and September , with AI-driven deals set to push cloud segment revenue to $166 billion in 2030. The stock’s surge in September briefly made Ellison the world’s wealthiest person .\nBut AI euphoria quickly gave way to doubt. Investors became increasingly concerned over the rising use of debt to fund tech firms’ AI spending, just as the payoff of that spending remains hotly debated. Those concerns are evidenced in the budding demand for Big Tech credit default swaps (CDS) — financial contracts that act as insurance by letting investors bet on the likelihood that a company will default on its debt.",

      "Content": "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Cognizant Announce a Multi-Year Partnership\n\nNoor Ul Ain Rehman\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nCTSH\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds in 2025 .

      "Content": "Prediction: These 3 Stocks Will Join the $3 Trillion Club in 2026\n\nGeoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 4:32 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAVGO\n\nKey Points Amazon has a path to a $3 trillion market cap by accelerating growth at AWS.\nMeta Platforms is the cheapest megacap tech stock, and it could see a huge lift from continued growth and more disciplined spending.\nBroadcom's stock could hit $3 trillion if it can capitalize on the enormous custom AI chip growth opportunity in front of it.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nCurrently, four companies have market caps above $3 trillion: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) , and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) . By the end of next year, that number is likely to rise to seven.\nLet's look at three stocks that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026.\n1. Amazon With a $2.4 billion market cap, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the best-positioned company to join the exclusive club next year, needing a 25% gain. While the stock has been a laggard the past few years, the company is well-positioned heading into 2026.\nOne of the big reasons Amazon's stock has lagged is that while its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is growing quickly, its growth has trailed that of Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. However, AWS' revenue started to accelerate last quarter, up 20%, and the company is increasing its spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to meet increasing demand. Meanwhile, its big Project Rainier for Anthropic continues to ramp up, and it recently signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI. It's also in talks with OpenAI about an investment that would see the company use its custom Trainium AI chips.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's e-commerce business is seeing strong operating leverage from its investments in robotics and AI. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28 times, the stock has room to run next year.\n2. Meta Platforms With a $1.7 trillion market cap, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has more work to do than Amazon, needing a more than 75% gain in 2026 to reach $3 trillion. However, don't count the stock out. It's the cheapest of the megacap tech stocks, trading at a forward P/E of below 22 times, while also growing quickly, with its revenue climbing 26% last quarter.\n\nMeta's stock hit a speed bump late in the year, as investors worried about its spending. However, the company is reportedly set to slash spending on its money-losing metaverse projects to focus more on AI, where it has been seeing a nice return.\nMeta has seen a big boost from AI, as the company has been using the technology to improve its recommendation algorithm, leading to users spending more time on its sites. At the same time, it's using AI to help advertisers create better campaigns and improve ad targeting. The positive impact of this could be seen in Q3, as its ad impressions jumped 14%, while ad prices climbed 10%, as its ads have become more effective. It's also just starting to introduce ads to its WhatsApp and Threads platforms, which should help drive future growth.\n\nStory Continues\nIf the company can cut back on some of its more wasteful spending, easing investor concerns, and continue to grow at its current pace, the stock could hit $3 trillion next year.\n3. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is another company that could hit the $3 trillion mark in 2026. Its path looked a little easier earlier in the month before its stock lost nearly 20% of its value to bring its market cap to $1.6 trillion. However, the company has an explosive growth opportunity in front of it that could propel its stock much higher in 2026.\n\nBroadcom has been enjoying strong growth in its networking portfolio due to the data center buildout, but its biggest opportunity is in helping customers design custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs are preprogrammed chips designed for specific tasks, and as such, they can outperform general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) and be more energy efficient. This last part is particularly important for inference, which is an ongoing expense, and customers are increasingly turning to it as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia.\nBroadcom helped Alphabet design its highly successful Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which has led other companies to flock to its services. It recently signed a huge deal with OpenAI that could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while Anthropic will deploy $21 billion in Alphabet's TPUs in 2026. Meanwhile, it said its original three customers could be an up to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal year 2027. In addition, there are reports that Apple is working with Broadcom on an AI chip that could be ready for mass production next year.\n\nFor a company that delivered just below $64 billion in total revenue last fiscal year (ending in October), that's just a huge growth opportunity. If Broadcom can deliver on this growth and Apple does indeed start deploying Broadcom-designed AI chips, the stock could skyrocket next year and hit a $3 trillion market cap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Ranking the Top \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy in 2026\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 2:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla have some questions to address.\nMeta Platforms and Alphabet should maintain momentum.\nNvidia expects to continue its rapid growth again in the new year.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" group of stocks is a commonly mentioned name attached to some of the biggest companies in the world. All seven are ranked inside the top 10 by market cap, making them incredibly important. The seven stocks making up the Magnificent Seven are:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nThese stocks have had a mixed bag in 2025, with some stocks falling and others rocketing higher. But which stocks are the best buys for 2026? I've ranked them in descending order, with some ranging from avoid to strong buys.\n7. Apple Starting with Apple, it's a stock I wouldn't recommend buying today. While Apple may be the face of consumer electronics, it has lost its innovative touch over the past few years. This has led to poor revenue growth since 2022.\nThere isn't a new product or feature coming that will likely turn that trend around, so Apple ranks last in growth potential. Combine that with a fairly expensive stock price (34 times forward earnings ), and you have a recipe for a stock to underperform in 2026.\n6. Tesla Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has had a rough year. With the EV tax credit ending, Tesla's vehicles don't appear as cheap as they used to. Furthermore, Tesla's margins have slipped because it has chosen to eat some costs instead of passing them on to the consumer. This has allowed revenue growth to continue in the latest quarter, while diluted earnings per share (EPS) have shrunk the whole year.\nThis isn't an easy-to-solve trend for Tesla, and it may be smart to avoid it in 2026 as a result.\n5. Microsoft Although there's only one spot separating Microsoft from Tesla, there is a huge jump in potential performance for 2026. I'd consider Microsoft and every stock above it a buy right now, as 2026 is looking impressive.\nMicrosoft has delivered strong growth throughout all of 2025, thanks to its investments in OpenAI and its status as a top-tier cloud computing provider. All of the tailwinds that pushed Microsoft's stock higher in 2025 (it's up about 14%) exist in 2026, and the stock should perform around market-average.\n\n4. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms was having a great 2025 until its Q3 earnings. The parent company of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram saw incredible growth, with revenue rising 26% thanks to the implementation of artificial intelligence on those platforms. However, the market was unhappy with Meta's capital expenditure projections.\n\nLa historia continúa\nThis caused the stock to tumble, as data center buildout could consume all of its operating cash flows. The market wants to see a bigger return on investment from Meta surrounding this AI spend, and I think some of that could happen in 2026 as Meta's investments drive more time spent on their platforms and increase efficiencies within the company. Meta can return to new highs in 2026, making it a strong stock pick.\n\n3. Amazon Amazon was a poor performer in 2025. Its stock has risen a mere 3%, lagging many on this list. However, it's slated for a great 2026.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, saw its growth surge to 20% -- a recent high. This bodes well, as AWS holds the biggest share of this important market. Additionally, its ad service division saw 24% growth in Q4 -- an acceleration over prior quarters.\n\nBoth of these businesses are crucial to Amazon's success, as they have far greater operating margins than Amazon's core e-commerce business. I think this sets Amazon up well to bounce back in 2026, and it will be a great Magnificent Seven stock to own.\n2. Alphabet Alphabet's stock has had the best 2025, rising more than 60% so far this year. While it may be difficult to match that growth in 2026, I still think it can be a top performer.\nAlphabet has emerged as one of the best AI companies, with its leading generative AI model, Gemini. That wasn't the case heading into 2025, and with Alphabet closing the gap throughout 2025, it could open up a serious lead over the competition in 2026. Furthermore, Alphabet's core business, Google Search, is thriving and no longer has to worry about being broken up for being an illegal monopoly.\n\nAlphabet has addressed a lot of investors' concerns about the future of its company in 2025. This frees the stock up to rise based on Alphabet's business performance in 2026, which could be another strong year.\n1. Nvidia Last, but certainly not least, is Nvidia. Nvidia has delivered strong growth for multiple years in a row, thanks to being the primary computing supplier for the AI arms race. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are best in class, and Nvidia has \"sold out\" of its cloud GPUs due to strong demand.\n\nWith AI hyperscalers (including several in the Magnificent Seven) all informing investors to expect record-setting capital expenditures in 2026 on top of already record-breaking figures in 2025, Nvidia is slated to have another fantastic year. Nvidia expects global data center capital expenditures to rise from $600 billion in 2025 to $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually by 2030. If that growth pans out, Nvidia will continue to be the top stock to own in the Magnificent Seen not only in 2026, but several years after that.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Has 18% of His Portfolio Invested in 3 Trillion-Dollar AI Stocks. Wall Street Says They Can Soar in 2026.\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 21, 2025 at 1:16 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Meta Platforms is using artificial intelligence to improve user engagement and advertising outcomes across its social media networks.\nMicrosoft has added generative artificial intelligence features (Copilots) to many of its software products, and its data center footprint is expanding rapidly.\nAmazon is leaning on artificial intelligence to makes its e-commerce business more profitable and to increase cloud computing sales.\n10 stocks we like better than Meta Platforms ›\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont runs Coatue Management, a hedge fund that outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points over the last three years. That makes him an excellent source of inspiration.\nLaffont had nearly 18% of his portfolio invested in three artificial intelligence stocks (each worth well over $1 trillion) as of the third quarter: 7.3% in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , 5.9% in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , and 4.7% in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) . He clearly has a great deal of confidence in those companies, and Wall Street anticipates substantial upside in all three stocks in the next year.\nHere are the important details.\nMeta Platforms: 28% upside implied by the median target price Meta has a strong presence in two industries: digital advertising and smart glasses. It owns three of the four most popular social media networks , which lets it collect user data and target media content. That advantage has made Meta the second-largest adtech company in the world. But the company also dominates the nascent smart glasses market.\n\nMeta is using artificial intelligence (AI) -- from custom chips to proprietary large language models -- to improve user engagement and advertising conversions across its portfolio of industry-leading social media. It is also developing a superintelligence system to integrate with its smart glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says glasses will be our \"primary computing devices\" in the future.\nWall Street expects Meta's earnings to increase at 17% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 29 times earnings look quite reasonable. Indeed, among 71 analysts, Meta has a median target price of $842 per share. That implies 28% upside from its current share price of $658.\nMicrosoft: 30% upside implied by the median target price Microsoft has a strong competitive position in two markets: enterprise software and cloud computing. It is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for its office productivity suite Microsoft 365, its portfolio also includes popular applications for business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning. Meanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud services provider.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft is monetizing AI across its software and cloud businesses. CEO Satya Nadella says customers are adopting Microsoft 365 Copilot (a generative AI assistant) faster than any new product. Additionally, its entire family of Copilot applications topped 150 million monthly active users in the quarter ended in September, up from 100 million in the quarter ended in June.\n\nMicrosoft Azure has gained about 3 percentage points of market share since the AI boom started, despite compute capacity constraints. However, the company is building out its data center capacity faster than any other cloud provider, according to Satya Nadella. Azure plans to double its data center footprint in the next two years.\nWall Street expects Microsoft's earnings to increase at 14% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 35 times earnings look somewhat expensive, though investors eager to own the stock could still buy a small position today. Among 62 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 30% upside from its current share price of $485.\nAmazon: 32% upside implied by the median target price Amazon has a strong competitive position in three industries: e-commerce, advertising, and cloud computing. It runs the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. The company dominates retail media, one of the fastest-growing verticals in the broader digital advertising market. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services.\n\nIn retail, Amazon has built an artificial intelligence shopping assistant called Rufus that is on pace to deliver $10 billion in sales in 2025. Shoppers who engage the conversational chatbot are 60% more likely to make a purchase. Amazon has also developed generative AI tools that improve inventory placement, robot productivity, and last-mile delivery.\nMeanwhile, AWS is introducing artificial intelligence features at a rapid clip. In the last few months, the company added tools to Bedrock AgentCore that help developers build and deploy generative AI agents. AWS also added agents for software development, security fixes, and performance monitoring. And it expanded its portfolio of pre-trained models.\nWall Street expects Amazon's earnings to increase at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 32 times earnings look reasonable. Indeed, among 73 analysts, Amazon has a median target price of $300 per share. That implies 32% upside from its current share price of $228.\n\nShould you buy stock in Meta Platforms right now?

      "Content": "Prediction: This Company Is All Set to Hit a $5 Trillion Market Cap in 2026 (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)\n\nHarsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Microsoft's stock needs to appreciate by 41% from current levels to achieve a $5 trillion market cap.\nThe company's AI tools are gaining terrific traction in the productivity space, while its cloud business is also booming.\nDan Ives of Wedbush expects Microsoft to become a $5 trillion company next year, and it won't be surprising to see the company indeed hitting that milestone.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) briefly became the first company to cross a $5 trillion market cap just a couple of months ago, driven by the company's remarkable revenue and earnings growth on account of its dominance of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.\nHowever, the share price of the chip giant has pulled back since then, even though it continues to maintain terrific growth despite its massive size. Concerns about the AI boom becoming a bubble and the sustainability of the heavy infrastructure spending that has driven Nvidia's phenomenal growth over the past three years have begun to weigh on the stock.\nBut there's another company -- Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- that's making the most of the proliferation of AI. One analyst believes that this \" Magnificent Seven \" company could hit a $5 trillion market cap in 2026. Let's take a closer look at Microsoft's prospects and why it could hit the $5 trillion market cap milestone in the new year.\nAI is set to accelerate Microsoft's growth There is no denying that Nvidia's chips have played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of AI technology. However, the computing power provided by its chips is eventually harnessed to create customer-facing solutions. For example, training OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't have been possible without Nvidia's chips, but the chatbot became popular because of what it was doing for users.\n\nFrom helping users write emails to creating images to drafting documents and writing code, ChatGPT's versatility and productivity have been the key reasons behind its raging success. Not surprisingly, ChatGPT parent OpenAI points out that it now has more than 1 million paying enterprise customers, while more than 800 million users use ChatGPT every week.\nMicrosoft made a smart move in 2019 by investing in OpenAI. It still holds a 27% stake in OpenAI, a company reportedly worth $500 billion. However, more than the financial aspect, OpenAI provided Microsoft with access to large language models (LLMs) and applications, enabling it to build a wide portfolio of AI-powered tools and deploy them across its offerings.\n\nStory Continues\nFrom cloud computing to personal computing to productivity tools, Microsoft has infused AI across all of its business segments. The good part is that its AI tools are gaining traction among customers. For example, Microsoft management remarked on the company's October earnings conference call that Copilot, its chat-based AI assistant, is now being used by 90% of the Fortune 500 companies.\n\nEven better, Microsoft says that a \"large majority of our enterprise customers continue to come back to purchase more seats.\" Even coders and cybersecurity specialists are using Microsoft's Copilot to enhance productivity and improve the effectiveness of their tools. So, it won't be surprising to see Microsoft cornering a bigger share of the office productivity tools market in the long run, as compared to its current share of 30%.\nOn the other hand, the demand for Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure is outpacing supply. This explains why Microsoft intends to double its data center capacity over the next couple of years to support the rapidly growing demand from customers looking to build AI tools on its platform.\nIt is worth noting that Microsoft's commercial remaining performance obligations (RPO) stood at a massive $392 billion at the end of the previous quarter, up by 51% from the prior year. This metric refers to the total value of contracts yet to be fulfilled. The size of Microsoft's RPO is larger than the $294 billion revenue it recorded in the trailing 12 months. Additionally, its RPO grew at a faster pace than the 18% revenue jump Microsoft recorded last quarter, indicating that it is winning new business at a faster rate than it is fulfilling existing contracts.\n\nAs such, don't be surprised to see Microsoft's growth accelerating in 2026, putting the tech giant on track to attain a $5 trillion market cap.\nHere's how it can reach that milestone Microsoft currently has a market cap of $3.6 trillion. So, it needs to appreciate by another 41% from current levels to reach the $5 trillion milestone. Analysts expect a 16% jump in Microsoft's revenue in the current fiscal year to $327 billion, followed by a 15% increase in the next one to $376 billion.\n\nHowever, Microsoft's massive RPO and the pace of growth in this metric indicate that it could outpace those expectations. Assuming Microsoft's revenue grows by 20% in the next fiscal year to $392 billion (from this year's estimated revenue of $327 billion) and it trades at 13 times sales at that time, in line with its current price-to-sales ratio, its market cap will land at just over $5 trillion.\nSo, this AI stock seems poised to deliver healthy gains in the coming year, which is why investors may consider adding it to their buy list for the new year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?

      "Content": "Should You Buy Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks In 2026?\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 9:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft have struggled in the last few months, bringing their valuations down with them.\nOther AI stocks like Amazon still look cheaper at today's prices.\nCyclicality risks should keep investors away from Nvidia stock in 2026. Amazon looks like a better buy.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe artificial intelligence ( AI ) trade began to sputter in late 2025. Stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are flat since August of this year after seemingly going up at an insatiable rate for three straight years. Similar results have occurred for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shareholders, with its stock actually down over the last six months.\nInvestors have begun to lose faith in the growth-at-any-cost mindset among these AI start-ups even though underlying revenue growth is still strong for the sector.\nDoes that make now a perfect time to buy AI stocks for 2026? Let's take a look at the numbers and find out.\nHigh multiples and fast-growing businesses Stagnant share prices have helped some of the fundamentals for these AI stocks catch up to their share prices. Last quarter, Nvidia's revenue grew 62% year over year to $57 billion, with net income up 65% to $31.9 billion. Microsoft's revenue was up 18%, with 24% growth in operating income.\nAI companies are still paying big paychecks to buy Nvidia's advanced computer chips or to utilize them in AI data centers run by cloud providers such as Microsoft. OpenAI is the leader in AI spending, with commitments in the hundreds of billions of dollars across various sources. A lot of this spending will go to Nvidia computer chips.\n\nStill, even with soaring earnings, both Microsoft and Nvidia (two of the largest companies in the world by market cap) do not have dirt cheap earnings ratios. Nvidia has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 44, while Microsoft's is 34. If earnings keep growing quickly, these ratios will come down in a hurry, but it puts high expectations on future growth.\nMore exposure to AI and cyclicality than others Booming spending in any industry can lead to supply gluts. This has happened in the computer chip space many times throughout history, as well as in other infrastructure build-outs like telecommunications and railroads.\nDon't ignore this risk with the AI winners like Nvidia. There is a major downside risk to Nvidia's earnings power if the company's revenue growth declines along with its profit margin, a double whammy to net income.\n\nSome stocks are more exposed to the AI trade than others, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, or Oracle . Others have been less aggressive on spending or winning contracts, such as Amazon , and are therefore less at risk to an AI or computer chip spending downcycle. With a P/E ratio of 31, Amazon's valuation is lower based on its trailing earnings as well.\n\nStory Continues\nDon't ask whether you should buy AI stocks Investors shouldn't ask whether they should buy AI stocks, as there are dozens, if not hundreds, of stocks exposed to the AI trade, all with different stories and valuations. You have direct beneficiaries such as Nvidia that may be a risky bet right now, or even wilder companies like CoreWeave , laden with debt.\n\nDon't ask if you should buy AI stocks. Ask which AI stocks you should buy today. Amazon looks like a good candidate at today's prices because of its lower P/E ratio, dual growth engines from cloud computing and e-commerce, as well as its growing relationship with start-up Anthropic. Amazon has not gotten as much enthusiasm from Wall Street in 2025, which just might make it a good pick for 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "If You Invested $5,000 in CoreWeave at Its March IPO, Here’s How Much You’d Have Today\n\nRich Duprey\nSat, December 20, 2025 at 6:11 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: CRWV\n\nMSFT\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nQuick Read CoreWeave ( CRWV ) shares surged 22% after joining the Energy Department’s Genesis Mission and receiving a Buy rating from Citi .\nCoreWeave stock remains down 55% from mid-2025 highs due to execution risks and high customer concentration with Microsoft and OpenAI.\nA $5,000 investment at CoreWeave’s $40 IPO price in March would be worth $10,500 today at $83 per share.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nCoreWeave ( NASDAQ:CRWV ) investors received a welcome reprieve yesterday as its shares surged 22% amid two key developments. The company announced participation in the Energy Dept.'s Genesis Mission, an initiative to accelerate scientific research, national security, and energy innovation through AI and supercomputing.\nIt also got a boost from Citi analyst Tyler Radke who resumed coverage of CoreWeave stock with a Buy/High Risk rating. These events marked a change for the specialized AI cloud provider, which has endured months of negative pressure that drove its stock down 60% from its mid-2025 highs, a stark contrast to the AI fervor that fueled its post-IPO rally.\nFrom AI Darling to Rough Waters The landscape for CoreWeave has shifted significantly since its March IPO. Initially buoyed by explosive demand for GPU cloud infrastructure amid the AI boom, the stock soared from its $40 IPO price to a peak around $187 per share.\nHowever, investor concerns quickly mounted over execution risks, including data center construction delays, high-interest debt financing, and customer concentration. The company relies heavily on a few major clients, such as Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and OpenAI , and faces competition from hyperscalers building in-house capacity. There is also growing concern over its relationship with Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) -- which invested in the IPO -- and the circular financing nature of its investments.\n\nThese factors, combined with broader AI sector scrutiny, led to sharp declines and revised revenue guidance, heightening the stock's volatility.\nAn Opportunity, Not a Game-Changer CoreWeave's involvement in the Genesis Mission provides access to public sector workloads and aligns with its expansion into government services via its Federal unit. The initiative connects scientific institutions and technology providers to support advanced AI-driven research.\nWhile this is a positive opportunity for long-term credibility and diversification, potentially opening up opportunities for collaborations with national labs and supercomputing centers, it does not substantially alter the company's near-term challenges. The mission represents a small fraction of possible revenue compared to commercial demand, and it does little to address immediate issues like capacity constraints, debt burdens, and execution delays.\n\nStory Continues\nWhy Citi Says Buy Despite the Risks Citi's investor note on the resumption of coverage highlighted strong underlying demand, with overwhelming interest in CoreWeave's platform leading the company to turn away customers at times. Analysts noted that third-quarter bookings supported growth, though some revenue shifted to 2026 due to power and supply issues.\n\nThe analyst emphasized CoreWeave's self-build and joint-venture model for faster deployment while retaining control, plus a planned new credit facility to reduce costs. Despite high customer concentration and limited trading history -- factors warranting the High Risk label -- Citi views the stock as a compelling buy given the durability of AI infrastructure needs.\nGrowth of $5,000 in CoreWeave CoreWeave went public in March at $40 per share where a $5,000 investment at the IPO price would have purchased 125 shares. As of Friday's close, with the stock trading $83 per share (following the recent surge), those shares would be worth approximately $10,500 -- a gain of $5,500 or 110% in under nine months. On an annualized basis, this equates to roughly a 160% return, which is not too shabby considering the headwinds CoreWeave has faced.\n\nWhile an investor would have ultimately profited from buying at the IPO, much of the gain stemmed from broader AI market tailwinds rather than any strengths specific to CoreWeave. IPOs often carry high risk, with many underperforming or taking time to stabilize -- if they ever do -- due to volatility, execution challenges, and market shifts.\nKey Takeaway Recent data from Jay Ritter at the University of Florida shows that between 1980 and 2023, there were more than 9,000 IPOs. Buying in at their offer price, they have a history of losses after three years of 1.6%. However, tech stocks tend to do considerably better, returning over 25% compared to a near-15% loss by non-tech stocks. However, if you're not lucky enough to buy in at the offer price -- and few small retail investors have access to such opportunities -- the results are much different.\n\nBuying in at the closing price after their first day of trading shows IPOs lost 19% on average, with tech stocks losing 5.1% (non-tech stocks lost 25.6%). It takes time for newly public companies to gain their footing to overcome volatility, lock-up expirations, and overoptimism about growth prospects. maller, unprofitable firms fared the worst.\nCoreWeave remains unprofitable with ongoing net losses despite rapid revenue increases. Yet the stock trades at lofty multiples, suggesting there may be further downward reratings ahead.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Is Microsoft Still Attractive After AI Investment Push and Strong Multi Year Share Gains?\n\nSimply Wall St\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 9:17 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nWondering if Microsoft at around $485 a share is still worth buying, holding, or finally trimming? You are not alone, and that is exactly what this breakdown aims to unpack.\nOver the last week the stock is up 1.5%, roughly flat over the past month at -0.2%, but still sitting on gains of 16.1% year to date and 12.1% over the last year, with a 108.4% return over 3 years and 127.3% over 5 years.\nRecent headlines have focused on Microsoft doubling down on AI infrastructure and partnerships, alongside continued expansion of its cloud and productivity ecosystems. This steady stream of long term growth initiatives helps explain why investors have been comfortable pushing the share price to new highs even after such strong multi year returns.\nAccording to Simply Wall St, Microsoft currently scores 3/6 on its valuation checks. This means it looks undervalued on half of the metrics they track. We will dig into what that actually means using multiples, cash flow based models, and a more nuanced framework that ties valuation back to the company narrative later in the article.\n\nMicrosoft delivered 12.1% returns over the last year. See how this stacks up to the rest of the Software industry.\nApproach 1: Microsoft Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis A Discounted Cash Flow model estimates what a company is worth by projecting the cash it can generate in the future and discounting those cash flows back to today in $ terms.\nFor Microsoft, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $89.4 billion. Analysts and model assumptions project this to rise to roughly $206.2 billion by 2030, with interim years stepping up from around $75.1 billion in 2026 to $153.5 billion in 2029. Beyond the analyst horizon, Simply Wall St extends these forecasts using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach, gradually slowing growth as the company matures.\n\nWhen all those projected cash flows are discounted back to today, the model arrives at an intrinsic value of about $603.92 per share. Compared with the current share price near $485, the DCF suggests Microsoft is trading at roughly a 19.5% discount to its estimated fair value.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Microsoft is undervalued by 19.5%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio , or discover 914 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows .\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Microsoft.\nApproach 2: Microsoft Price vs Earnings For a consistently profitable business like Microsoft, the Price to Earnings, or PE, ratio is a practical way to gauge what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of current earnings. It condenses expectations about future growth and risk into a single, easy to compare number.\n\nStory Continues\nIn general, faster growing and lower risk companies tend to trade on higher PE ratios. Slower growing or riskier firms tend to trade on lower multiples. So the question is not whether a PE of 10x or 40x is high or low in isolation, but whether it fits a company’s growth profile and risk.\nMicrosoft currently trades on a PE of about 34.4x, slightly above the Software industry average of around 32.4x and the peer average of roughly 32.5x. Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio for Microsoft, which blends in factors like earnings growth, margins, size, industry and risk, sits much higher at about 52.7x. This Fair Ratio is more informative than simple peer comparisons because it is tailored to Microsoft’s specific fundamentals rather than broad sector averages. With the market multiple well below that fair level, the PE perspective points to Microsoft being undervalued rather than stretched.\nResult: UNDERVALUED\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1466 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth .\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Microsoft Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let’s introduce you to Narratives. These are simply your story about a company, expressed as your own assumptions for its future revenue, earnings and margins, and then translated into a fair value you can compare to today’s price to help you decide whether to buy, hold or sell.\n\nOn Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors build Narratives for companies like Microsoft. They link what they believe about AI growth, cloud competition or capital spending directly to financial forecasts. These Narratives update dynamically as new news, results or risks emerge, so your view never goes stale.\nFor example, one Microsoft Narrative might conclude that the fair value is around $360 a share because AI spending will compress margins and growth. Another might see fair value closer to $532 if AI, cloud and productivity tools compound efficiently. It is precisely this spread in thoughtful views that helps you stress test your own Narrative and decide whether today’s $485 share price looks attractive or expensive.\nFor Microsoft, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Microsoft Narratives:\n\n🐂 Microsoft Bull Case\nFair value: $624.45 per share\nImplied undervaluation vs current price: 22.3%\nForecast revenue growth: 15.30%\nExpanded AI partnerships, a deep Azure backlog and integrated security offerings are expected to sustain double digit revenue growth and high, stable margins.\nSubscription driven businesses like Microsoft 365, Dynamics and Game Pass, together with strong contracted commitments, support predictable earnings and free cash flow.\nManagement aims to offset heavy AI and cloud CapEx through software and efficiency gains, keeping operating margins flat to slightly expanding even as infrastructure spend remains elevated.\n🐻 Microsoft Bear Case\nFair value: $420.00 per share\nImplied overvaluation vs current price: 13.6%\nForecast revenue growth: -0.78%\n\nA shrinking PC market, weak Xbox hardware performance and rising Mac adoption in enterprises are seen as structural headwinds for Microsoft’s traditional franchises.\nHeavy AI and datacenter CapEx, dependence on OpenAI and intensifying competition from Gemini and open source models raise concerns about returns on investment and long term margins.\nInternal morale issues, product quality concerns around Windows 11 and the risk that AI tools cannibalize per seat Office demand underpin a view that Microsoft’s current valuation embeds overly optimistic assumptions.\nDo you think there's more to the story for Microsoft?

      "Content": "Breaking Down Oracle, the AI Trade, and the Outlook for Tech Earnings\n\nSheraz Mian\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:39 PM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nOracle’s ORCL relationship with OpenAI has become a never-ending source of market angst, as the tie-in reminds many of questionable vendor-financing practices from the late 1990s. Tied to Oracle’s OpenAI exposure are questions about the company’s financial health and its ability to fund its data center expansion plans.\n\nThe December 10 th quarterly release, which was, at best, mixed, added to Oracle’s woes. Oracle missed consensus revenue and margin expectations and raised its capital expenditure (capex) outlook. The stock’s negative reaction to this quarterly release contrasted with the prior quarterly release in early September, when the stock jumped by more than a third.\nWhen investors typically think of the big Tech players, like Microsoft MSFT or Alphabet GOOGL or even Oracle, they instinctively assume fortress balance sheets and ungodly amounts of operating cash flows. Those assumptions are misplaced in the case of Oracle, as it has been relying lately on the debt markets to fund its ever-rising data center buildout-related capital expenditures.\nOracle’s capex outlay totaled $21.2 billion in fiscal year 2025 (FY ends in May), up from $6.7 billion in FY 2024. The company generated $20.8 billion of free cash flow in FY 2025, meaning it was free cash flow negative for the year. The expectation for the current year (FY 2026) is that Oracle’s $50 billion capex budget is approximately double the amount of operating cash flows it is expected to generate. In fact, Oracle will most likely be free cash flow negative in fiscal year 2027 as well, which means that it will need to tap the debt market to fund its capex budget.\n\nThe chart below provides an overview of Oracle’s debt load and the comparable measure for Microsoft. Long-term debt as a share of the company’s total capital is not the only, nor even the best, measure of balance-sheet leverage, but it is a simple and easily understood indicator of financial flexibility.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWe should keep in mind that Oracle isn’t in any financial distress, as it currently has an ‘investment grade’ credit rating from the rating agencies. That said, its credit rating of BBB (from S&P) is the lowest rung of investment-grade credit rating.\nWe are all familiar with the market’s concerns about the broader ‘AI trade’, which ranges from the ‘bubble narrative’ at one extreme to reasonable questions about the monetization of AI investments at the other.\nThe chart below shows the three-month performance of Oracle shares relative to Alphabet, Microsoft, the Zacks Tech sector, and the S&P 500 index.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe ongoing issues in Oracle shares are not a reflection of those AI concerns, as the chart above clearly shows, but rather a function of the aforementioned OpenAI exposure and concerns about its financial health. We would have seen far more solidarity from Microsoft and Alphabet with Oracle in the above period had the overriding issue been the ‘AI trade’.\n\nOne key performance metric that took center stage in the Oracle story is Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), which reached $523 billion this quarter, up $455 billion from the preceding quarter. For reference, the comparable number for Microsoft reached $392 billion in the company’s latest quarterly report.\nThink of this key performance metric as Oracle’s backlog or future revenues had jumped by an eye-popping $317 billion in the preceding quarter. The bearish narrative on Oracle notes that $300 billion of the preceding quarter’s $317 billion RPO growth was attributable to OpenAI.\nIt is this elevated level of customer concentration risk, coupled with Oracle’s relatively stretched financial health, that has been weighing on the stock lately.\n\nA fair assessment of the evolving Oracle story is that while there is undoubtedly more uncertainty and risk associated with its RPO (or backlog) getting converted into future revenues, particularly say relative to Microsoft or Alphabet, it is nevertheless a key element of the company’s growth profile and its status as a critical player in the emerging AI world.\nIn other words, no one should be under the impression that this is a second coming of Enron or other such dubious characters from our collective past.\nThe chart below provides a 10-year comparison of Oracle valuation relative to Microsoft, using the forward 12-month P/E multiple. As you can see here, Oracle shares broke away from their historically discounted valuation to Microsoft only in May 2025, but have now reversed all of those gains.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThis 10-year history shows that Oracle shares have commanded as high as 66% premium (September 2025) to Microsoft share to a 55% discount (November 2020), with a 10-year median of 28% discount. The stock is currently trading at an 18% discount to Microsoft shares (23.6X for Oracle vs. 28.7X for Microsoft).\n\nThe lower discount relative to history makes sense when seen in the context of Oracle’s emerging status as a key player in the emerging AI world. Oracle bulls would likely argue that there is no justification for the ‘new Oracle’ to trade at a discount to Microsoft going forward, notwithstanding its balance sheet vulnerability.\nTech Earnings Outlook The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth outlook for the Zacks Tech sector on a quarterly basis, where we highlight expectations for 2025 Q4 in the context of what the sector achieved in the preceding two quarters and what is expected in the following three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Tech sector has been critical to driving aggregate earnings growth for the last 9 quarters (since 2023 Q3), and the above chart shows that it is expected to continue playing that role in the coming periods as well.\nPlease note that the Tech sector has been consistently enjoying positive estimate revisions over the past year, and we saw the same trend at play since the start of 2025 Q4 in October. In fact, had it not been for positive revisions to Tech sector estimates, aggregate Q4 earnings estimates for the S&P 500 index would be modestly down since the start of October.\nThe chart below shows the sector’s earnings growth picture on an annual basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe positive revisions trend that we referenced for the Tech sector in the context of 2025 Q4 earnings estimates is very much in place for full-year 2026 estimates as well, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Tech sector is not ordinary; it accounts for nearly a third of S&P 500 earnings, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings Outlook for the Mag 7 The Mag 7 group is generally seen as mega-cap Tech players. However, in the Zacks sector classification system, two of the Mag 7 players are not part of the Zacks Tech sector; we place Amazon in the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla in the Zacks Auto sector. Both of these sectors are Zacks innovations, as the ‘official’ Standard & Poor’s industry classification does not have stand-alone sectors for the retail and auto spaces.\nFor 2025 Q4, the Mag 7 group is expected to produce +16.9% earnings growth on +16.4% higher revenues, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the Mag 7 group’s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs you can see above, the group’s 2026 earnings are currently expected to be up +16.6%, followed by +18% in 2027.\nThe important factor to keep in mind is that the Mag 7 earnings outlook is steadily improving, as the chart below shows.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that the Mag 7 group is on track to bring in 26.4% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2026, up from 23.2% of the total in 2024 and 11.7% in 2019. Regarding market capitalization, the Mag 7 group currently carries a 34.6% weight in the index.\n2025 Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard Last week’s Oracle earnings report was for the company’s fiscal quarter ending in November, which we and other research organizations count as part of the December-quarter tally. Oracle is hardly alone in this respect, and quarterly results from the likes of FedEx, Nike, Adobe, and others fall in the same category. Through Friday, December 19 th , we have seen such Q4 results from 18 S&P 500 members.\nTotal earnings for these 18 index members are up +32.2% from the same period last year on +9% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates from these companies in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe comparison charts below show the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Earnings Big Picture The chart below shows current Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&P 500 index in the context of the preceding 4 quarters and the coming three quarters.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFor a detailed view of the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>>Q4 Earnings: Tech Expected to Remain Growth Driver\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Aravolta builds integrated data center infrastructure (DCIM), electrical power (EPMS) and building management (BMS) products and are rapidly expanding as demand soars for their products.\n\nAravolta is led by Margarita Groisman (CEO), Jack Sutton (CTO), and Pietro Sette (COO). Margarita previously worked on chip and server deployments inside Microsoft’s data centers. Jack is a lifelong engineer working as a founding engineer across many startups. Pietro has led engineering and operations at high-growth software organizations. The team focuses on building software to manage and automate the physical systems that power modern data centers.\n\"We’re seeing a wave of new data center entrants realize that these facilities are far more complex to run than traditional industrial sites,\" Groisman said. \"GPU environments are especially demanding: power, cooling and networking are tightly coupled, and small changes can ripple across the entire system.\n\nAravolta brings those signals into one place and makes them actionable. We're ‘ Palantir for data centers ’, not just aggregating data, but turning it into decisions and control.\"\nAravolta’s customers already include colocation providers, chip manufacturers, edge data centers, and emerging neoclouds - names like OpenColo, Flexnode, DataCrunch, and Centra, as well as others you’ve definitely heard of but they can’t yet name publicly.\nBacked by $5.1 million from notable investors such as Topology, Wishchoff, Crucible, Susa, Afore, Y Combinator, Pioneer Fund , and Banyan with Guillermo Rauch , Nick Hansen , and more among its notable angels.\nWhile Aravolta technically sits in the DCIM (Data Center Infrastructure Management) category, its capabilities extend far beyond the legacy tools of the past. Operators praise its single pane of glass for data center operations - including capabilities like branch circuit monitoring, precision power metering, and automation workflows that make the complex orchestration of modern data centers not just manageable - but elegant.\nIn short: As the world races to build the infrastructure for the AI age, Aravolta is building the software to make it all run.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251219337091/en/\nContacts\nMedia Contact: Margarita Groisman\nEmail: margarita@aravolta.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

At the same time, revenue growth expectations have nudged higher from around 15.28% to 15.30%, reflecting stronger conviction that accelerating AI adoption, expanding cloud demand, and deepened model partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic can sustain robust top line momentum. Stay tuned to see how you can track these nuanced revisions and follow Microsoft’s evolving stock narrative over time.\n\nStay updated as the Fair Value for Microsoft shifts by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio . Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on Microsoft.\nWhat Wall Street Has Been Saying 🐂 Bullish Takeaways\nMorgan Stanley, Bernstein, RBC Capital, Goldman Sachs, Evercore ISI, Guggenheim, Baird and Truist all reiterate or initiate positive views, citing durable demand across Azure, broader cloud, productivity software and security as core to sustaining double digit growth and margin expansion.\nSeveral firms have lifted or reiterated elevated targets in the $560 to $675 range, including Morgan Stanley (to $650), Bernstein (to $645), RBC Capital ($640), Goldman Sachs ($630), Guggenheim ($586), Baird ($600), Truist ($675), and earlier Rothschild & Co Redburn (to $560), underscoring confidence that current AI and cloud investments can translate into higher long term earnings power.\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley and Evercore ISI highlight the updated OpenAI agreement and the new $250B Azure commitment as clearing a major overhang while validating Microsoft’s leadership in AI infrastructure and strengthening visibility into future cloud revenue.\nRecent Q1 results are described as strong or better than expected by Morgan Stanley, Bernstein and RBC Capital, with commentary pointing to accelerating commercial bookings, strong Azure growth, robust customer commitments and room for further operating leverage, reinforcing views on execution quality and cost discipline.\nWhile generally positive, some bullish firms still flag reservations around rich valuation and heavy capex, noting that part of the AI upside may already be reflected in the share price and that investors will closely track returns on enlarged AI and cloud infrastructure spending.\n\n🐻 Bearish Takeaways\nRothschild & Co Redburn has shifted to a more cautious stance, downgrading Microsoft to Neutral and cutting its target to $500 from $560 as it questions whether current AI driven hyperscaler economics can match prior cloud 1.0 returns given materially higher capital intensity.\nThe same analysis from Rothschild & Co Redburn argues that investors may be giving Microsoft too much benefit of the doubt by treating elevated GPU and data center capex as if it will generate legacy cloud like returns, implying downside risk to earnings expectations if monetization lags.\nEven among generally bullish houses, commentary around outages at major cloud providers, including Azure, and broader concerns over high multiples and AI cycle volatility point to near term reputational and valuation risks that could cap upside if execution stumbles.\n\nStory Continues\nDo your thoughts align with the Bull or Bear Analysts? Perhaps you think there's more to the story. Head to the Simply Wall St Community to discover more perspectives or begin writing your own Narrative!\nWhat's in the News Microsoft is scaling up its AI infrastructure with new Fairwater super factory data centers in Atlanta and Wisconsin and plans to roughly double its global data center footprint over the next 2 years to support rising AI and Azure workloads.\nAI spending and profitability are under scrutiny as CEO Satya Nadella appoints Rolf Harms as adviser on AI economics and signals that elevated AI capex will boost capacity but keep margins under pressure in the near term.\nRegulators are intensifying oversight, with the EU considering DMA constraints on Azure, Australia’s ACCC suing over alleged 365 Copilot bundling practices, and investors criticizing limited disclosure around Microsoft’s financial exposure to OpenAI.\nMicrosoft is deepening and diversifying its AI model strategy, expanding use of Anthropic models inside Microsoft 365 Copilot while renewing its OpenAI partnership and promoting AI centered Windows and “AI PC” positioning to encourage broader Copilot adoption.\n\nHow This Changes the Fair Value For Microsoft The fair value estimate edged down slightly from approximately $625.41 to $624.45 per share, reflecting modest tweaks to long term assumptions rather than a fundamental shift in outlook.\nThe discount rate increased marginally from 8.52% to about 8.53%, implying a slightly higher required return on equity risk.\nRevenue growth nudged higher from roughly 15.28% to 15.30%, indicating a modestly more optimistic view on top line expansion.\nThe net profit margin eased slightly from about 37.95% to 37.93%, incorporating small adjustments to long term profitability expectations.\nThe future P/E multiple ticked down modestly from roughly 34.76x to 34.71x, suggesting a marginally more conservative terminal valuation framework.\n\n🔔 Never Miss an Update: Follow The Narrative Narratives on Simply Wall St turn raw numbers into a living story, connecting what a company does with forecasts for revenue, earnings and margins to arrive at a fair value.

Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. No one was very focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 for a while was bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. But not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist Art Hogan joins Opening Bid with Brian Sozzi to talk about his expectations for the Magnificent Seven and the broader AI trade.\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat is the future of the AI trade and how are you playing it next year? Art, is it Max 7 or bust for you?\n00:09 Art\nUh, it's not. and I'll tell you this. I think this was the year after uh three years of AI uh being rolled out and the revolution starting where investors clearly had to start to differentiate. Now the differentiation point really came to the fact that\n00:27 Art\nif you were spending massive amounts of money on CAPEX to build out your large language model, that's fine if it's coming from free cash flow. If you're putting a lot of debt out there, your return on invested capital is starting to be called into question and rightly so. We know there's six large language models being developed right now. We know there's not going to be six at the end of this revolution or at the end of the rainbow here.\n00:52 Art\nSo the winners will have to be picked and largely right now that's happening in a form of how much debt are you laying out to make this happen and how long is it going to take to return that investment? So I I agree with one of the hits that you just put on and I think Google uh is in the in the lead. It goes back and forth between chat GPT 4.0 and open AI. We really don't know if they'll ever become public, so that's not an investment opportunity. But where you want to be careful is in those names that continue to lay out debt.\n01:14 Art\nUh companies like uh Corven and Oracle clearly have been the poster child of you're spending too much money and we don't think you're going to get it back.\n01:21 Speaker A\nAre you unsettled by the valuations on some of these AI names?\n01:26 Art\nWell, let's look at Nvidia trading at 24 times next year's earnings. Uh they've laid they've laid out what the demand is for the Blackwell and and they'll have another offering by the middle of next year. So clearly, they are at the tip of the sword of where the CAPEX is going and they're profiting from it and here and now. So there's no question about their return on invested capital. So in in that case, I'm not whatsoever concerned.\n01:46 Art\nUh Alphabet's trading at a reasonable multiple, 33 times forward, continues to have uh strong free cash flows and, you know, all the concerns that we had about the relationship with Google, I mean with Apple. Now they're going to be a partner with Apple with Gemini. So that's going to be where your smart Apple Apple intelligence comes from. So in those two names, no. I think when you move down the ladder and look at some of the names like Meta,\n02:05 Art\nTesla, I don't throw into that basket because it's not exactly uh artificial intelligence play.\n02:08 Speaker A\nWe're still trying to figure out what what Tesla is at this point, Art. You're not alone.\n02:10 Art\nYeah, I I still think you know what? I think they're trying to figure it out too. It's always about the future and what they're able to deliver. But I think the sneakiest of the uh AI plays is Apple and continues to be. Everyone said they had no AI strategy, all of a sudden they've delivered that. They've been blowout returns for the iPhone 17 and they're they're going to buy it. They're not going to build it. So, you know, they're going to partner with uh Alphabet here than somebody else internationally and and clearly they will be the winner and that's how we'll likely consume artificial intelligence next year.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI hyperscalers have room for ‘elevated debt issuance’ — even after their recent bond binge, BofA says\n\nJason Ma\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 8:44 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: BAC\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThe tech giants fueling the AI boom generate so much cash relative to their debt that they have more than enough room to issue more, according to Bank of America .\nIn a note this week, analysts looked at the top five publicly traded AI hyperscalers: Meta , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon and Oracle .\nBofA pointed out that while the companies can fund their near-term capital expenditures with cash, they are tapping debt markets for balance-sheet flexibility and better cost of capital. Last month alone, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon raised tens of billions of dollars in the bond market.\n\nOperating cash flow for the big five hyperscalers is expected to hit $577 billion this year from $378 billion in 2023, while debt should climb from $356 billion to $433 billion.\nThat means their overall debt burden is actually getting lighter as the debt-to-cash ratio should dip from 0.94 to 0.75.\n“Given the hyperscalers’ historically conservative capital allocation and balance sheet policies, elevated debt issuance is possible, as evident by the recent bond deals from Meta, Alphabet and Amazon,” BofA said.\nAnd plenty of additional cash is on the way. By 2029, operating cash flow is seen jumping 95% to $1.1 trillion, while capex is forecast to grow at a much slower pace of 58% to $632 billion.\nBut then there’s Oracle. Unlike the other AI hyperscalers, it will have negative free cash flow until 2029, meaning its capex will exceed cash from operations, according to BofA. As a result, it doesn’t have much capacity to take on more debt.\n\nIndeed, fears about Oracle’s debt binge have rattled the overall AI stock trade as the company isn’t a cash machine like its AI peers.\nRecent earnings guidance was also weak, and the company raised its forecast for fiscal 2026 capex by another $15 billion. In addition, surging lease obligations have spooked Wall Street.\nA Financial Times report on Wednesday that said alternative investments firm Blue Owl didn’t team up with Oracle on a data center after all piled on more concerns. Shares fell on the news, though the company’s development partner, Related Digital, said Blue Owl was outbid on the project and didn’t back out of it.\nBut even though debt may not pose a limit on hyperscalers’ ambitions, they still face physical limits , namely in building enough infrastructure fast enough to meet demand.\nData-center researcher Jonathan Koomey told Fortune’s Eva Roytburg that capital can be deployed instantly, but the equipment that capital must buy cannot. Tmelines for turbines, transformers, specialized cooling systems, and high-voltage gear have stretched into years, he explained.\n\nStory Continues\n“This happens every time there’s a massive shift in investment,” Koomey added. “Eventually manufacturers catch up, but not right away. Reality intervenes.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Enterprise interest is rising, with at least two contracts expected to exceed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, though hyperscalers still dominate bookings.\nRadke noted some potential demand, including an estimated $40-50 billion from Microsoft (MSFT), was redirected to other GPU-as-a-Service providers due to capacity limits.\nThe analysts said CoreWeave is managing growth with a self-build, 80/20 joint-venture model and maintains strong financials, with over 60% of revenue from investment-grade clients.

      "Content": "Bubbles and Boring Bets: What’s Coming for Tech Stocks in 2026\n\nJeran Wittenstein, Ryan Vlastelica and Carmen Reinicke\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 7:11 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nPLTR\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Investors will remember 2025 as the year the artificial intelligence rally broadened out and the fears became more pronounced — not only of a bubble in the stocks, but also of the disruption the technology represents.\nWhile tech giants like Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp. delivered strong gains, unsung corners of the industry, like memory chips and hard disk drives, proved to be far better places for investors. Meanwhile, the threat of competition from deep-pocketed heavyweights and upstarts like OpenAI and Anthropic weighed on software makers that are considered most at risk from challengers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nNYC’s Adams Names Four to Rent Board in Challenge to Mamdani\nWith the bull market in US stocks stretching into a fourth year, there are more concerns than ever about the sustainability of heavy spending on AI computing and whether the returns will justify the investments.\n“There’s a lot of optimism around AI, but also a lot of hype,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. “2026 will be more about the proof of AI. What’s the ROI on the hyperscalers that have been spending? Will they see profit growth continue to accelerate?”\n\nHere’s a look at some of the biggest stock market stories for the tech industry in 2025 and the outlook for each in the new year.\nNeocloud Nerves\nNeoclouds, which are companies that provide cloud-computing services tailored to AI customers, were the rage for most of 2025. But heading into 2026 they look more like proxies for AI bubble risk.\nGrowing scrutiny over OpenAI’s lack of profitability has raised questions about its ability to pay for its massive spending commitments, including a cloud-computing deal with Oracle Corp. said to be worth $300 billion over five years. Oracle was expected to be a major beneficiary of AI growth, but its stock is down more than 45% through Thursday’s close since hitting a peak in September as its exposure to OpenAI becomes a major concern. Oracle shares were up about 6% in early trading Friday as TikTok said it is being bought by a group of buyers led by the software company.\n“There is a lot of fear with OpenAI and the commitments it has made,” said Adam Rich, who helps oversee more than $17 billion in assets as deputy chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Vaughan Nelson. “People can only forecast what we know, and right now there’s a lot we don’t know. So long as that’s the case, it will be hard for companies like Oracle to regain their luster.”\n\nStory Continues\nOracle has other issues, including the amount of money it’s spending on data center leases, reported delays in some data center projects, and financing questions. Its growing debt load is particularly concerning to investors, as a measure of the company’s credit risk has skyrocketed to its highest level since the financial crisis.\n\nBeyond Oracle, neocloud provider CoreWeave Inc. has lost about two-thirds of its market value since hitting a high in June. And Nebius Group NV shares are down more than 42% from an October peak through Thursday’s close.\nBoring Tech\nInvestors discovered new AI trades in 2025 by following where the billions of dollars in pledged capital expenditures are going. You can see it just by looking at the top performers in the S&P 500 Index. Memory and storage company Sandisk Corp. leads the list, followed by Western Digital Corp, which makes hard disk drives, and its rival Seagate Technology Holdings Plc. Micron Technology Inc., the biggest US-based maker of memory chips, is fifth.\nThe trend is expected to continue in 2026 as capital expenditures keep growing. Investors are increasingly thinking about where the next wave is headed, with some eyeing beaten-down software stocks.\n“Things at the edge are interesting,” said Melissa Otto, who heads technology, media and telecommunications research at Visible Alpha. “There is this AI ecosystem that orbits around the AI infrastructure itself.”\n\nSoftware Slump\nSoftware stocks traded at attractive market valuations in 2025, but that did little to entice investors. Shares of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, companies were hit particularly hard. Much of the weakness reflects growing fears that the group will be disrupted by AI, as offerings from services like ChatGPT and Alphabet’s Gemini cut into demand or pricing power.\nAI represents “existential competition” for some software companies as “AI chatbot and agent dominance becomes the core battlefield,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a research note this week.\nCompanies like ServiceNow Inc., Adobe Inc., and Salesforce Inc. were among the weakest performers in the tech sector this year. A Morgan Stanley index of SaaS companies is down 10%, compared with a gain of about 6% for a broader software index that includes perceived AI winners like Microsoft Corp.\nWhether software’s underperformance continues will be a key stock market theme in 2026. Some Wall Street pros already think it’s overdone. The SaaS group “is trading anywhere between a 30-40% discount relative to what its fundamentals would suggest,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note to clients late last month.\n\nPricey Got Pricier\nConcerns that nose-bleed valuations would hamper the ascent of some of 2024’s hottest stocks in 2025 proved misplaced. Palantir Technologies Inc. turned out to be one of the year’s best performers despite trading at more than 200 times estimated profits for much of the year. The stock’s nearly 150% advance ranks eighth in the S&P 500.\nWall Street has long been skeptical of Palantir, mainly because of the stock’s lofty valuation. Of the 29 the analysts covering the maker of data analysis software, just nine rate the stock a buy. Still, the company is expected to expand at an enviable clip, with revenue projected to jump 43% in 2026 and 39% in 2027, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nElectric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. also overcame concerns about its valuation, which is by far the most expensive among the so-called Magnificent Seven. The stock hit a record this week despite trading at more than 200 times anticipated profits and facing a number of headwinds from slowing EV sales to concerns about safety.\n\nInvestors are optimistic about Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s vision of a self-driving car future and nascent push into robotics. After two years of stagnant revenue growth, Tesla’s sales are expected to expand 13% in 2026 and 19% in 2027.\nAll of which leaves the tech landscape heading into 2026 roughly where it was a year ago. Yes, the stocks are pricey. But the opportunities for growth are there. It’s up to the companies to deliver.\n“Expectations are high and valuations are expensive,” Ameriprise’s Saglimbene said. “That means they have more to prove, and they will really have to exceed expectations to move higher.”\n--With assistance from Phil Serafino and Stephen Kirkland.\n(Updates stock moves throughout, adds detail in paragraph seven.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "CRWV Stock Crashes 49% in 3 Months: Buy the Dip or Hold Back for Now?\n\nShreya Majumder\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 7:01 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: CRWV\n\n^GSPC\n\nNBIS\n\nMSFT\n\nCoreWeave, Inc . CRWV is the world’s first hyperscale AI cloud, delivering purpose-built compute, storage, networking and software to help customers build, train and deploy AI products faster. The stock has tumbled 49.2% in the past three months, much higher than the Zacks Internet-Software Market’s and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s fall of 13.5% and 0.5%, respectively, while the S&P 500 Composite has grown 1.8%.\n\nThe company has underperformed its peers and tech behemoths like Microsoft MSFT, which has declined 5.9% over the past three months, while Nebius Group N.V. NBIS, another emerging AI infrastructure player, has plunged 26.7%. Once a market favorite riding the AI infrastructure boom, the stock has been hit by concerns around execution, heavy capital spending and leverage, alongside broader volatility in AI-related equities.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCRWV currently trades at $67.68, well beneath its 52-week high of $187. The key consideration now is whether the pullback in CRWV stock presents a buying opportunity or reflects underlying concerns. Examining recent performance metrics, management insights and guidance provides greater clarity on the path ahead.\n\nKey Risks to Consider for CRWV Before Buying the Dip Despite operating in a favorable demand environment, CRWV continues to face increasing supply chain pressures, where demand for its AI cloud platform greatly exceeds available capacity, limiting its ability to serve customers fully. Delays in powered-shell delivery from a data center provider are likely to adversely impact its performance in the fourth quarter. Although temporary and with the customer agreeing to adjust the schedule to retain full contract value, these setbacks have prompted management to lower its 2025 outlook. The company now expects 2025 revenue of $5.05–$5.15 billion, down from $5.15–$5.35 billion, and adjusted operating income of $690–$720 million, below the previous $800–$830 million range.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, CoreWeave plans to bring some of the largest deployments in its history online, a move that is expected to weigh on near-term adjusted operating margins due to the lag between upfront data-center costs and revenue recognition. This timing mismatch underscores the company’s continued struggle to translate heavy infrastructure spending into immediate financial returns.\nLeverage remains another concern. Management expects 2025 interest expense of $1.21–$1.25 billion due to rising debt levels needed to fund demand-led CapEx. While a lower cost of capital offers some relief, it does little to offset the scale of the interest burden. Capital intensity also remains elevated. CapEx for 2025 is now projected at $12–$14 billion, with the reduction from prior guidance largely reflecting spending deferrals rather than true cost savings, as infrastructure buildouts remain stuck in construction-in-progress. Much of the CapEx initially expected in fourth quarter has merely shifted into first quarter, extending near-term cash flow pressure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLooking ahead, risks intensify further. Management expects 2026 CapEx to more than double from the 2025 levels, signaling even greater capital demands despite ongoing margin and leverage pressures. While the company frames these investments as strengthening its competitive position, they also heighten concerns about execution risk, balance-sheet strain and the sustainability of CoreWeave’s hyper-growth strategy.\n\nCRWV’s Bullish Fundamentals Still Intact Despite supply-chain disruptions prompting cuts to full-year revenue and CapEx guidance, management highlighted its ability to adapt operations, pursue multiple growth avenues and access ample capital. The company remains confident in its capacity to meet long-term demand, expand infrastructure at scale and strengthen its position in AI cloud services, viewing new product launches, strategic partnerships and emerging federal opportunities as key drivers of sustained hypergrowth.\n\nCRWV strengthened its position as a leading AI cloud infrastructure provider in the third quarter, expanding its active power footprint by 120 MW to about 590 MW and boosting contracted capacity to 2.9 GW. With more than 1 GW of contracted capacity yet to come online and new compute deals that broadened its customer base, the company is well-positioned for continued growth. It has a substantial contracted backlog, which provides visibility into future revenue streams, even during short-term execution hiccups. Its revenue backlog has expanded sharply, to $55.6 billion in the third quarter, marking a 271% year-over-year increase and nearly doubling sequentially. The growth is driven by large, long-term contracts with major customers such as OpenAI, Meta and multiple hyperscalers, underscoring strong demand for AI-focused cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe backlog mix also highlights improving long-term visibility. While 40% of backlog is expected to convert within 24 months, a solid portion extends beyond that horizon, with 39% scheduled over 25–48 months and 21% beyond 49 months. This longer-dated profile enhances revenue visibility and reinforces its dependence on timely infrastructure deployment to convert backlog into recognized revenue.\nIts momentum is further being driven by multi-billion-dollar partnerships with NVIDIA, including industry-first deployments of GB300 NVL72 systems and RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition instances, giving CRWV an early edge in frontier AI and real-time workloads. The company is also pursuing inorganic growth through acquisitions, including Marimo in October, following earlier deals such as OpenPipe and Weights & Biases.\n\nEstimate Revision Trend for CRWV CRWV’s estimates revisions are on an upward trajectory currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings for 2025 has been revised north 8.5% over the past 60 days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation Vulnerabilities CRWV stock is not so cheap, as its Value Style Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment. In terms of Price/Book, CRWV’s shares are trading at 8.53X, higher than the Internet Software industry’s 5.95X.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFinal Verdict CRWV’s momentum has never been stronger, with expanding opportunities ahead. Backed by exceptional products, a world-class team and disciplined execution, CoreWeave is poised to enter its next phase of growth as a full-stack AI services provider and hyperscaler.\nHowever, management flagged supply chain and data center delays as near-term risks, but views them as temporary with mitigations in place. Concerns around overcapacity, execution and CapEx are being addressed through provider diversification, self-builds, flexible contracts and diversified funding. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), CRWV appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAs is the case with other technology giants, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has positioned itself to be a key player in the AI race. The firm differs from players such as Google and Amazon through the fact that it does not operate a cloud computing business. Yet, while Google, Amazon, and Microsoft spend on AI data centers to bolster their cloud computing capabilities, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) continues to spend just as much despite not being a major player in the industry. The spending has also seen the focus of analysts, with TD Cowen commenting on December 4th that the firm’s decision to cut back its metaverse spending could counter the increased spending on AI infrastructure. TD Cowen kept a Buy rating and an $810 share price target for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s shares.\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\nThe firm’s infrastructure spending includes a major data center it is building in Louisiana. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced on December 4th, 2024, that it was building a $10 billion data center in the state, and recent media reports have suggested that costs have ballooned to $27 billion. During this episode, Cramer and his co-hosts discussed reports of CoreWeave’s Texas data center project struggling, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) factored into the discussion:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a key player in the AI industry due to several factors. These include the firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business and its in-house Trainium AI chips. The highly competitive cloud computing industry, which sees investors demand high growth rates, has also affected Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in 2025. As an example, the shares dipped in August after the firm’s second-quarter earnings saw AWS post a 17.5% revenue growth, which was slower than Microsoft and Google’s cloud growth rates of 39% and 32%, respectively.\nZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.com\nAWS has also been the focus of recent analyst coverage for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s shares. For instance, Guggenheim initiated coverage on December 10th as it set a Buy rating and a $300 share price target. The research firm cited AWS as the reason behind its coverage and shared that the business’s 3.8-year backlog had touched $200 billion in Q2. Cramer also discussed the AWS business. He insisted that the cloud business will drive the narrative, and commented on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) after BMO Capital raised the share price target to $304 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating, and raised the Q1 2026 AWS cloud growth estimate to 24% from an earlier 23%.

The increasing ease of content creation for immersive environments and the rising adoption of digital training and simulation methods across manufacturing, aerospace and defense sectors further support market growth. As enterprises invest in advanced visualization tools, immersive VR is becoming an essential technology for enhancing productivity, skill development and operational performance.\n\nDownload PDF Sample for More Insights:\nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=201528031\nMajor Top Key Players included:\nMeta,\nSony Group Corporation,\nSamsung Electronics,\nMicrosoft and\nApple\nSoftware Segment to Register the Fastest Growth\nThe software segment is projected to expand at the highest CAGR between 2024 and 2029 due to the rising demand for engaging and diverse VR content. As VR hardware becomes more accessible and powerful, the need for high quality software that delivers meaningful and interactive experiences is increasing rapidly. Software developers are creating immersive applications across entertainment, education, healthcare and industrial training, enabling users to benefit from realistic and dynamic virtual environments. The continued evolution of VR content and its compatibility with existing devices are expected to accelerate the growth of immersive VR software throughout the forecast period.\n\nConsumer Applications Leading Market Share\nConsumer applications are expected to capture the largest share of the immersive VR market from 2024 to 2029. Advancements in VR headsets have significantly improved user experience by making devices more comfortable, robust and affordable. Gaming remains the primary driver of consumer adoption, offering deeply engaging experiences that cannot be replicated by traditional platforms. Beyond gaming, the consumer market is expanding rapidly with the rise of social VR platforms, virtual recreation and immersive digital travel. These developments are reshaping digital engagement and broadening the appeal of immersive VR across diverse user groups.\nAsia Pacific to Record the Highest Regional Growth\nAsia Pacific is forecast to witness the highest CAGR in the immersive VR market between 2024 and 2029. The region’s strong entertainment, gaming and training ecosystems are contributing to widespread adoption of VR technologies. Countries such as China and South Korea have large and active gaming communities that are embracing immersive VR for enhanced interactive experiences. Additionally, the region is investing heavily in education and industrial training, recognizing the role of immersive content in improving learning efficiency and workforce capabilities. The increasing integration of VR in academic institutions and corporate training centers is expected to further accelerate market growth in the region.\n\nStory Continues\nAsk for Sample Report to Get More Information:\nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=201528031\nOpportunity: Continuous developments in 5G technology\nImmersive VR market is becoming increasingly popular for both personal and business use. It is anticipated that the introduction of 5G technology will solve certain issues by enabling the most efficient deployment of processing power. 5 G's improved performance enhances the VR application user experience through reliable and faster connections. Virtual reality experiences can become more responsive with reduced latency and increased data transmission rates, while graphics can also allow for real-time streaming of complex 3D images and better-quality data.\n\nChallenge: High energy consumption and latency issues\nThe effectiveness of VR devices is influenced by a few technological factors that need to be carefully considered. The two most significant factors are energy consumption and display latency. Latency, or the interval of time between a user's action in a virtual reality environment and its visual display, influences the user's sense of immersion with these technologies. The slightest delays could result in uneasiness, perplexity, or a sense of being cut off from the virtual world.\nSubmit an Inquiry:\nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=201528031\nSee More Latest Semiconductor Reports:\nAugmented and Virtual Reality Market by Enterprise, Technology (Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality), Offering (Hardware, Software), Device Type (HMDs, HUDs, Gesture Tracking Devices), Application and Region - Global Forecast to 2029\n\nDownload PDF Sample: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=1185\nVirtual Reality (VR) Market Size, Share & Industry Growth Analysis Report by Technology (Non-immersive, Semi & Fully Immersive), Offering, Device Type (Head-mounted Devices, Gesture Tracking Devices, Projectors & Display Walls), Application and Region - Global Forecast to 2029\nDownload PDF Sample: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=458\nCONTACT: About MarketsandMarkets™: MarketsandMarkets™ has been recognized as one of America's Best Management Consulting Firms by Forbes, as per their recent report.

      "Content": "FDVV’s 2.78% Yield Looks Weak Next to SCHD’s 3.80% Income Stream for Retirees\n\nMichael Williams\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:07 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: SCHD\n\nJPM\n\nFDVV\n\nXOM\n\nNVDA\n\nQuick Read FDVV allocates 18% to NVIDIA, Apple and Microsoft but these three holdings yield less than 0.5%.\nThe fund cut dividends 7.7% in 2024 after growing payouts 48% cumulatively from 2020 to 2023.\nSCHD offers a 3.80% yield versus FDVV’s 2.78% with more stable distributions.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nFidelity High Dividend ETF ( NYSEARCA:FDVV ) markets itself as a high-dividend option for income investors, but its 2.78% yield and unusual portfolio composition raise questions about long-term sustainability. The ETF generates income from dividends paid by underlying equity holdings, tracking the Fidelity High Dividend Index of large and mid-cap stocks. With $7.7 billion in assets and a low 0.15% expense ratio, FDVV appears attractive on paper. However, a closer look at its top holdings reveals a fundamental tension between growth and income.\nPortfolio Composition Raises Concerns FDVV's largest positions are growth-oriented technology stocks that contribute minimal dividend income. NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), the fund's largest holding at 6.41%, yields just 0.02% with an annual dividend of $0.04 per share. Despite a 53% profit margin and 67% earnings growth, NVIDIA slashed its quarterly dividend from $0.04 to $0.01 in 2024—a 75% cut that signals the company prioritizes reinvestment over shareholder payouts.\n\nApple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ), the second-largest holding at 6.11%, offers a 0.37% yield with a $1.02 annual dividend. While more substantial than NVIDIA, this remains far below income investor expectations. Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) rounds out the tech triumvirate at 5.24% of the portfolio with a 0.72% yield and $3.40 annual dividend.\nTogether, these three holdings represent nearly 18% of FDVV but collectively yield less than 0.5%.\nTraditional Dividend Payers Provide Stability JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE:JPM ), representing 2.71% of the portfolio, offers more reliable income with a 1.73% yield and $5.55 annual dividend. The bank's 16x earnings multiple and 16% return on equity suggest sustainable payouts. Exxon Mobil ( NYSE:XOM ) at 1.97% of holdings provides a 3.36% yield with a $3.96 annual dividend, though recent quarterly earnings declined 8% year-over-year amid energy price volatility.\n\nThe problem is clear: FDVV's 26.5% allocation to information technology—the largest sector weighting—contradicts its dividend-focused mandate. Meanwhile, traditional income sectors like utilities (9.6%) and energy (8.7%) receive far less emphasis. Dividend payments have also shown concerning volatility, ranging from $0.185 to $0.504 quarterly over the past four years. After growing dividends 48% cumulatively from 2020 to 2023, FDVV experienced its first annual decline in 2024, dropping 7.7%.\n\nStory Continues\nThis infographic evaluates the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (FDVV), highlighting its portfolio's reliance on low-yield tech stocks and significant dividend volatility. It presents the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) as a potentially more reliable alternative for income-focused investors.\nConsider SCHD as an Alternative For investors seeking more reliable dividend income, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF ( NYSEARCA:SCHD ) offers a compelling alternative. SCHD yields 3.80%—significantly higher than FDVV's 2.78%—and focuses exclusively on US companies with consistent dividend growth records. The fund screens for financial strength and dividend sustainability, resulting in a portfolio weighted toward traditional dividend sectors rather than growth tech. SCHD has demonstrated more stable quarterly distributions and maintains a similarly low expense ratio, making it a stronger choice for income-focused investors seeking dependable cash flow.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Nvidia Vs. Alphabet: Which Could Be The World's Biggest Company By End-2026?\n\nPiero Cingari\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have quietly become the two most dominant forces inside the Magnificent Seven, riding different paths to the same destination: artificial intelligence supremacy.\nNvidia's GPUs remain the backbone of the global AI buildout, powering everything from data centers to cutting-edge model training.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is pushing its own vertically integrated AI stack — from custom TPUs to Gemini — embedding intelligence directly across Search, Cloud and consumer products.\nThe market thus far has rewarded both approaches. Nvidia is up 33% year-to-date through Dec. 17, while Alphabet has surged 62%.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nZooming out further tells an even more dramatic story: since early 2023, Alphabet shares are up roughly 250%, while Nvidia has delivered a staggering 1,120% return.\nThat explosive run has made Nvidia the world's biggest company today, with a market capitalization of about $4.318 trillion — even briefly touching $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet ranks third at approximately $3.7 trillion, behind Apple's $4.05 trillion valuation.\n\nYet traders see a far closer race ahead.\nOn Polymarket, both Nvidia and Alphabet are assigned a 35% probability of being the world's most valuable company by the end of 2026.\nA $100 bet on Alphabet overtaking Nvidia to become the world's biggest company by the end of next year would pay out $265 if it happens — with nearly identical returns available for those wagering that Nvidia holds onto the crown.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) trails with a 14% chance, followed by Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT ) at 9%.\nTesla Inc . (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) sit further back, at 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nHow Could Alphabet Overtake Nvidia As World’s Biggest Company? For Alphabet to dethrone Nvidia as world’s biggest company, it needs to outperform by a meaningful margin.\nThe current valuation gap between the two companies is about $600 billion.\nIf Nvidia's market cap were to grow 10% in 2026, it would climb from roughly $4.3 trillion to about $4.75 trillion. For Alphabet to leapfrog Nvidia in that scenario, its shares would need to outperform Nvidia by roughly 19 percentage points.\n\nStory Continues\nIn practical terms, that would mean Alphabet gaining about 29% in a year where Nvidia rises 10%, lifting Google's valuation to around $4.77 trillion.\nAny performance gap of 19 percentage points in Alphabet's favor could hand it the crown — assuming today's market caps as the starting line.\n\nThe bet, then, is whether Alphabet's AI monetization, advertising leverage and cloud growth can accelerate faster than Nvidia's already-dominant chip business.\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nWall Street Still Backs Nvidia Where traders see a coin flip, Wall Street analysts remain more decisive.\nBased on median 12-month price targets, analysts expect Nvidia's reign to continue. Consensus estimates point to Nvidia shares reaching about $250 over the next year, or roughly 40% upside from the current price near $177.\nAlphabet's outlook is far more muted by comparison. Analysts see a median 12-month target of $330, implying just 6% upside from its current level around $306.\n\nThat gap underscores the tension at the core of the debate: prediction markets see a neck-and-neck race for the world's largest company, while Wall Street analysts continue to model an extended run of Nvidia's dominance.\nBy the end of 2026, the outcome may hinge on a single question: will the AI arms race ultimately reward the company supplying the picks and shovels, or the one embedding intelligence into every layer of the digital economy?\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

      "Content": "4 Key Cloud Computing Stocks to Include in Your Portfolio for 2026\n\nSupriyo Bose\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:41 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: IBM\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nAn updated edition of the Nov. 04, 2025 article.\n\nLeveraging virtualization technology, which enables users to access and store data over the Internet without managing their physical servers and intricate IT infrastructure, cloud computing has gained increasing prominence in driving innovation and digital transformation. It enables multiple users to share the same hardware resources by connecting to the cloud platform through a web browser or dedicated applications, thereby creating a framework for seamless omnichannel customer engagement.\n\nFor investors seeking to invest in blue-chip tech firms, cloud computing has emerged as an attractive theme. This has made cloud computing companies like Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and International Business Machines Corporation IBM indispensable for any investment portfolio. But before digging deep into these prized possessions, let us examine a little more into why organizations are increasingly adopting cloud computing.\n\nBased on a pay-per-use pricing model, enterprises only pay for the computing resources they use. This has helped business enterprises to reduce operating costs for maintaining on-site data centers and deploying IT experts to manage the infrastructure, making it a highly cost-effective solution. With easy access to a plethora of innovative technologies, cloud computing increases productivity with greater agility and flexibility, and improves scalability with higher economies of scale. Moreover, cloud computing services are delivered over a highly secure network with low latency for applications and data backup facilities for improved reliability.\n\nCloud computing services fall into four broad categories, namely infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless and software as a service (SaaS), offering different levels of control, flexibility and management options to business enterprises. Cloud computing, which relies heavily on virtualization and automation technologies, provides the requisite infrastructure for AI (artificial intelligence) and machine learning (ML) workloads. It delivers powerful computing abilities to process and analyze data, creating an ideal platform for Big Data management.\n\nPer Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market size is expected to swell to $2,390.2 billion by 2030 from $752.4 billion in 2024 at a CAGR of 20.4% with a variety of capabilities across multiple industries. These include diverse use cases such as improved patient monitoring and outcomes in healthcare, personalized financial management and predictive spending, immersive learning in education, superior inventory management in retail and predictive maintenance and better supply chain management in the manufacturing sector.\n\nIf you intend to capitalize on this buzzing trend, our Cloud Computing Thematic Investing Screen could make it easy to identify high-potential stocks in this domain at any given time, just like the four mentioned above. By leveraging advanced tools, our thematic screens identify companies shaping the future, making it easier to benefit from emerging trends.\n\nReady to uncover more transformative thematic investment ideas?

Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing platform, allows users to build, run and scale applications in the cloud. It offers a variety of services, including storage, networking, analytics and AI.\n\nMicrosoft has doubled down on the cloud computing opportunity. Azure&rsquo;s increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally has strengthened Microsoft's competitive position in the cloud computing market. Operating through a vast network of global data centers that ensure high availability and reliability for applications, Azure offers seamless access to all the services included in the portal once customers subscribe to it. Subscribers can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as virtual machines (VMs) and databases, which can then be assembled into running environments used to host workloads and store data.\n\nAs Microsoft continues to push the boundaries of networking technology, it aims to create innovative, resilient and secure solutions that enable businesses to leverage AI and the cloud to their fullest potential. It is heavily investing in AI-powered cloud services, integrating Azure OpenAI Service, Copilot and ML into various cloud solutions, making AI a central feature of Azure to empower organizations to manage their applications with greater confidence and efficiency. Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nAlphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search engine provider to a leading provider of cloud computing technology. Google Cloud has turned out to be the key catalyst behind the company&rsquo;s growth, driven by its strengthening cloud service offerings.\n\nThe solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace and continued investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI have helped Google to expand its cloud footprint worldwide. The increasing number of cloud regions and availability zones globally has been a hallmark of Google Cloud. Currently, Google Cloud has 42 cloud regions, 127 availability zones and 200 network edge locations across more than 200 countries. Google Cloud is considered the third-largest cloud player among numerous cloud providers worldwide.\n\nAlphabet&rsquo;s growing GenAI capabilities and significant investments in cloud computing are potential catalysts for the future amid stiff competition in the cloud space and increasing regulatory headwinds. This Zacks Rank #3 company&rsquo;s dominant position in the search engine market and the cloud boosts its long-term prospects.\n\nAmazon enjoys a leading position in the cloud-computing market, particularly in the IaaS space, thanks to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of its high-margin-generating businesses. The expanding customer base of AWS, driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid Amazon's dominance in the global cloud space.\n\nAWS is the world&rsquo;s most comprehensive and broadly adopted on-demand cloud computing platform, offering more than 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers, including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises and leading government agencies, are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile and innovate faster. It reportedly offers the widest variety of databases that are purpose-built for different types of applications to enable subscribers to choose the right tool for the job.\n\nAmazon aims to extend AWS&rsquo; AI and ML capabilities to facilitate improved decision-making. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company intends to expand its global infrastructure for faster and more reliable service with low latency and maximum availability. From cloud-native applications and AI-driven solutions to edge computing and sustainability initiatives, AWS is likely to push the limits in the realm of cloud computing technology.\n\nIBM has gradually evolved as a provider of cloud and data platforms. The Red Hat acquisition, in particular, has helped it strengthen its competitive position in the hybrid cloud market. With the buyout, the company offers a Linux operating system&mdash;Red Hat Enterprise Linux&mdash;and a hybrid cloud platform&mdash;Red Hat OpenShift&mdash;aiding enterprises with digital transformation.\n\nWith a surge in traditional cloud-native workloads and associated applications, along with a rise in generative AI deployment, there is a radical expansion in the number of cloud workloads that enterprises are currently managing. This has resulted in heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies, which have led firms to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to highly secure multi-cloud management, translating into a healthy demand for IBM hybrid cloud solutions. In addition, the buyout of HashiCorp has significantly augmented IBM&rsquo;s capabilities to assist enterprises in managing complex cloud environments. HashiCorp&rsquo;s tool sets complement IBM RedHat&rsquo;s portfolio, bringing additional functionalities for cloud infrastructure management and bolstering its hybrid multi-cloud approach.\n\nIBM is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in the Software and Consulting segments. This Zacks Rank #3 company&rsquo;s growth is expected to be aided primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security in the long run.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\n\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits , suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google , OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\n\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction .\nOpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Oracle Shares Jump 5% on TikTok Deal Progress, OpenAI Fundraising Talks\n\nFaizan Farooque\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 5:28 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: ORCL\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nMSFT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nOracle ( ORCL , Financials ) shares rose more than 5% after ByteDance agreed to sell a controlling interest in TikTok's U.S. business to Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. The accord addresses U.S. national security concerns and prevents a social media app ban. Oracle and its partners would hold over 80% of a new TikTok U.S. corporation by late January. The deal might boost Oracle's cloud business by making TikTok a long-term client, analysts said. This would secure TikTok as a key customer for OCI and could drive meaningful upside for non-AI parts of the business via durable, higher-margin workloads, Mizuho analyst Siti Panigrahi said. The Information said that Microsoft-backed OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion at a $750 billion value, boosting the stock. The prospective funding shows investor interest in artificial intelligence, which is linked to Oracle's cloud infrastructure relationships. Oracle shares were under pressure due to OpenAI cloud collaboration expenditure fears. The current developments indicate increased confidence in the company's 2026 AI and enterprise cloud growth plan.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The company is exploring a new funding round that could raise as much as $100 billion and push its valuation to around $830 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nIs ORCL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThat would be a massive jump from the roughly $500 billion valuation reported earlier and even above the $750 billion figure mentioned in recent reports. Nothing is final yet. The talks are still in the early stages, and OpenAI is hoping to complete the round by the end of Q1 at the earliest. Whether there is enough investor demand remains an open question, especially as scrutiny around AI spending has increased.\nThe reason for the raise is straightforward. Building and running cutting edge AI models is incredibly expensive. OpenAI is projected to burn more than $200 billion in cash through 2030 as it scales infrastructure and computing power. Some partners, including Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) and CoreWeave ( NASDAQ:CRWV ), have already felt investor pressure tied to data center expansion.\nFor investors, this funding round is a real stress test.

We we heard from Gil Luria recently, smart, smart analyst, thoughtful guy.\n00:05 Speaker B\nLove Gil.\n00:06 Speaker A\nWe love Gil. Uh and we wanted his take. Now Gil is, you know, not a fan of Oracle. He's neutral. He tells his clients, stay on the sidelines. Take a listen to what he had to say and then we'll get your response.\n00:19 Gil Luria\nMicrosoft is front of the line. Microsoft who owns the biggest part of OpenAI is front of the line. They'll get paid first. If there's something left over, I'd argue that Amazon is probably next. Maybe after that is Oracle, which is to say the 300 billion isn't going to materialize.\n00:39 Speaker A\nSo 300 billion not going to materialize. What do you think, Corey?\n00:44 Corey\nWell, I mean, you know, they've got contracts with with their customers. They've clearly vetted the customers that they want and not had the customers that they don't. Um but again, this is why your choice of OpenAI is so important. Is OpenAI really going to stiff and not be able to pay their bills? It's it's a question. It's a reasonable question, but it's not just OpenAI. Their customers are companies like Nvidia, their customers are companies like like, you know, Milwaukee Best tools. I mean, they have so many varied customers that have deep pockets, uh that, you know, I would expect them to get paid in almost every occasion and that the risk does not entirely sit with OpenAI. But yeah, if OpenAI goes belly up and can't pay its bills, Microsoft's going to be in trouble, too.\n01:31 Speaker A\nLet me ask you, this broader AI boom bubble debate, when you hear of more companies and they're tapping the debt markets now to finance these AI ambitions,\n01:43 Corey\nYes.\n01:44 Speaker A\nDoes that cause you to reconsider that debate at all, broadly?\n01:49 Corey\nYou know, debt debt works both ways, leverage book works both ways, right? It works to help you do great things, greater, and it can work to blow things up when things go bad. So, I think you do have to look sort of case by case at what's going on here. But when I look at a company like Oracle, if Oracle can call, you know, give him a 12% return on invested capital, which is what they've averaged the last five years or so. If you could tell them if you spend $100 billion, you can make $12 billion in profits, Larry Ellison and the management of of Oracle is right to say, well, I'll give you 200 billion, give me 24 billion in revenues. You know, or in returns and in ultimate returns here. So I think that, you know, if their cost of capital is 3%, if their return on invested capital is 12%, why wouldn't they take bigger bets to get that done? Yeah, you got to be smart, you got to pick the right customers. Well, who's smarter than than the folks at Oracle uh at managing this and taking advantage of this business opportunity? They have captured the biggest contracts out there. They have so far done a good job of executing those contracts. They're financing that using debt at a low cost of capital. That's business. It's smart business.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Six Charts That Show How Stock Markets Got Reshaped in 2025\n\nMichael Msika and Jan-Patrick Barnert\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nGOOG\n\n^VIX\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Stock investors can’t claim that this year has lacked market drama.\nIt didn’t always look likely, but equities have managed strong returns in 2025, weathering shocks like DeepSeek of China’s challenge to US artificial intelligence and the tariff storm unleashed by the Trump administration in April.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nDips were bought at record pace and a fear of missing out on the rally dominated sentiment. In the background, a powerful wave of diversification swept through the market as investors responded to the cracks appearing in so-called US exceptionalism by buying up European, Asian and emerging-market stocks.\nHere are six charts that capture some of the key episodes that reshaped equity markets in 2025:\n\nThe year started with investors maxed-out on American exposure and convinced US dominance was here to stay. But DeepSeek shook the status quo in the AI world, while President Donald Trump’s April tariff salvo all but spelled the end of the bull market that began in 2022. Still, as Trump dialed back his trade war, interest rates fell and the global economy showed resilience, investor confidence returned.\nThat didn’t spare US stocks from bearing the brunt of the selloff. And they never fully caught up with the rest of the world, held back by a weakening dollar. The greenback hasn’t clawed back its 13% slump in the first half, while a growing chorus of strategists has recommended international equities over their US peers.\nMSCI Inc.’s gauge of global stocks excluding the US is tracking its strongest outperformance over the S&P 500 since 2009.\nThe US flagship index is missing from the ranks of best-performing benchmarks, but it did still achieve decent enough gains of 14%. The nagging worry for investors has been the concentrated nature of those returns. “Bubble in the making” became a key concern this year, with some data echoing the early stages of excessive internet over-valuations. The tech sector’s weighting in the S&P 500 reached a record 36%, breaching the previous peak of 2000 leading into the dotcom crash, before retreating below 35%.\n\nA closer examination of this year’s trading reveals unprecedented levels of concentration behind the gains on Wall Street. Tech megacaps powered the rally all year long, with just five stocks accounting for nearly 45% of the benchmark’s returns: Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile excitement around AI has driven returns in the US and Asia, the story has been very different in Europe, a market crucially lacking tech stocks. Here, other thematics stepped to the fore. Banks led Europe’s rally, surging on the way to their strongest year since 1997, while governments’ defense, energy and infrastructure spending commitments lifted the names set to benefit from these outlays.\nThe upshot of all this is the widest dislocation in market leadership between the US and Europe ever seen. Value stocks inspired the advance in Europe, while growth equities led it in the US. This pushed investors into unchartered territory, as equity factors typically move in similar fashion.\nInvestors buffeted by April’s extreme turbulence could hardly have anticipated the relatively smooth ride they had the remaining three-quarters of the year. No drawdown exceeded 5% until November, with each dip enthusiastically snapped up at a rapid clip. The AI narrative, solid earnings and the leftovers from April’s sudden positioning washout encouraged investors to chase stocks steadily higher. The impressive rally stalled only as exuberance over AI was questioned in the final stretch of the year.\nStrong appetite for stocks has been accompanied by the destruction of volatility this year. Considering historical reset patterns for the VIX Index, it’s surprising how often the gauge managed to retrace a spike of 40% or more within a 10-day trading period. This didn’t happen at all before 2011, but has already occurred several times in topsy-turvy 2025.\nStock investors embraced the notion that volatility spikes have become increasingly short-lived. A new market logic appears to have taken hold: stocks panic, volatility gets bid, the risk event is resolved, gamma supply takes over and volatility quickly retreats.\nUS option volumes marked fresh highs, with two daily prints exceeding 100 million turnover this year for the first time. To emphasise the increased demand, trading volume was above 60 million daily contracts on 117 days compared to only 12 days in 2024.\nWhile hedging demand played a role in April and November, most of the time it was calls dominating the tape. With investors chasing the right tail as well as volatility sellers using ultra short-term contracts to earn income, the options market remains a key factor for stocks, contributing to the swift resets in volatility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

However, their sheer size makes it more challenging to maintain high growth rates as they’ve already captured significant portions of their markets.\nThese trade-offs can cause headaches for even the most seasoned professionals, which is why we started StockStory - to help you find high-quality companies that can grow their earnings no matter what. Keeping that in mind, here is one large-cap stock that still has big upside potential and two that could be stalling.\n\nTwo Large-Cap Stocks to Sell: Expedia (EXPE) Market Cap: $34.65 billion\nOriginally founded as a part of Microsoft, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is one of the world’s leading online travel agencies.\nWhy Does EXPE Worry Us?\nLarge revenue base makes it harder to increase sales quickly, and its annual revenue growth of 8.3% over the last three years was below our standards for the consumer internet sector\nPreference for prioritizing user growth over monetization has led to 1.7% annual drops in its average revenue per booking\nHighly competitive market means it’s on the never-ending treadmill of sales and marketing spend\n\nAt $285.52 per share, Expedia trades at 10.2x forward EV/EBITDA. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including EXPE in your portfolio, it’s free for active Edge members .\nHoneywell (HON) Market Cap: $126.9 billion\nOriginally founded in 1906 as a thermostat company, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) is a multinational conglomerate known for its aerospace systems, building technologies, performance materials, and safety and productivity solutions.\nWhy Are We Hesitant About HON?\nAbsence of organic revenue growth over the past two years suggests it may have to lean into acquisitions to drive its expansion\nProjected sales decline of 3.3% for the next 12 months points to a tough demand environment ahead\nShrinking returns on capital suggest that increasing competition is eating into the company’s profitability\n\nHoneywell is trading at $197.56 per share, or 19.5x forward P/E.

Is now the time to initiate a position? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nStocks We Like Even More The market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 6 Stocks for this week .

      "Content": "Billionaire Bill Gates Has 60% of His Foundation's $37 Billion Portfolio Invested in Noticeably Non-Tech Stocks Heading Into 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:50 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nKey Points Warren Buffett is one of the biggest donors to the Gates Foundation, and his influence is noticeable.\nThe foundation's trust invests primarily in slow-growing value stocks with wide moats.\nThese three companies are trading around fair value, with predictable growth ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\n\nBill Gates built his fortune through Microsoft , one of the world's largest tech companies . He and co-founder Paul Allen got in on the ground floor of the personal computing revolution and amassed fortunes as their company's value rose in tandem with the boom in PCs in the 1980s and 1990s. Gates became the world's first centibillionaire (a net worth of $100 billion) in 1999, nearly two decades before anyone else would reach that level of wealth.\nToday, Gates is still worth about $100 billion, despite Microsoft's value skyrocketing about sixfold from its peak in 1999. That's because he's turned his attention to his foundation, where he plans to give away 99% of his remaining wealth over the next 20 years.\nGates has historically donated his Microsoft shares to the foundation, but the foundation trust's portfolio has sold off those shares while remaining heavily invested in some noticeably non-tech names. In fact, about 60% of the trust's portfolio is invested in three mostly low-tech companies, following the investment managers' sale of about two-thirds of its Microsoft shares last quarter. Here's where the Gates Foundation is investing today.\n1. Berkshire Hathaway (29.3% of portfolio value) Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is a longtime donor to the Gates Foundation. Every year, he donates Class B shares of the stock to the foundation, along with several other charitable organizations. This year, he gave just over 9.4 million shares of the stock to the foundation at the end of June.\n\nBerkshire has produced solid results from its insurance business in 2025, despite setbacks from the California wildfires at the start of the year. Third-quarter results were particularly impressive, with underwriting earnings rising to $3.2 billion from $1 billion in Q3 2024. That more than offset the drop in earnings through the first half of the year.\nMeanwhile, Berkshire's massive investment portfolio continues to produce gains. However, Buffett and his investment team have struggled to find significant opportunities to invest Berkshire's growing cash pile . That pile's made bigger as Berkshire sells more equities than it buys every quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nShares of the conglomerate now trade for about 1.55 times book value. While that's above the stock's historic average, it's down from the high price investors were paying early in 2025. With Buffett's retirement announcement taking some air out of the stock, it's now trading closer to fair value at today's price, based on the assets held in its portfolio and its core operating results from insurance.\n\n2. Waste Management (17.1%) Waste Management (NYSE: WM) is one of the longest-held securities in the Gates Foundation trust. There's a good reason for that. It's a recession-resistant business with a huge competitive advantage.\nWaste Management's main waste-hauling business benefits from its scale and its dominant landfill ownership position. With its scale, the company is able to build a more efficient network of collection routes and transfer stations, benefiting its operating margin. Meanwhile, Waste Management's 262 active landfills put it in an enviable position among other waste haulers, as regulations make it extremely costly to obtain approval and build new landfills. As a result, the company has been able to raise prices every year due to the growing scarcity of landfills, while charging third-party waste haulers fees to use its facilities.\n\nThe business generated a 32% adjusted operating margin last quarter, continuing to demonstrate room for improvement as it exercises pricing power and scales.\nAdditionally, Waste Management now operates a medical waste disposal business following its acquisition of Stericycle, which it rebranded as WM Health Solutions. Management sees room for synergies to cut costs for the business, but it expects the market for Health Solutions to climb quickly over the next decade due to the aging U.S. population. For now, the business accounts for less than 10% of revenue.\nIt's no wonder that the trust has rarely sold shares of the stock, which has grown considerably over the last 25 years. Even with the company trading at an enterprise value of around 15 times its expected EBITDA over the next 12 months, it appears to be a good value. Strong earnings improvements for Health Solutions, combined with steady growth for the main waste-hauling business, should enable the stock to keep climbing from here.\n\n3. Canadian National Railway (13.6%) Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI) (TSX: CNR) connects Canada's east and west coasts with the Midwest United States and the Gulf Coast. Railroads remain an important method of hauling freight across dry land as massive scale drives overall costs lower. Better fuel efficiency than trucks, and the ability of trains to haul massive amounts, make them more economical for long-hauling. That said, it's a very slow-growing industry.\n\nOn the plus side, there are significant barriers to entry. It's practically impossible for a new company to compete with the big ones, as it takes thousands of freight contracts to generate the scale needed to operate profitably. Instead, the industry has consolidated over the years, as businesses look to take advantage of the benefits of scale. To that end, Canadian National has been able to raise prices steadily while growing contract volume. That's pushed its operating margin higher. It reached 38.6% last quarter.\nMany feared that tariffs would negatively affect the railroad's international freight business from Canada through the middle of the U.S. While management has seen a drop in volume for metals, minerals, and forest products due to the tariffs, it has seen increases in petroleum and chemicals, grain, coal, and fertilizers.\n\nDespite slow revenue growth, management has been able to increase its operating results while reducing its capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow growth climbed 14% through the first nine months of the year. Management expects further improvements in free cash flow in 2026, driven by additional reductions in capital expenditures. It returns that excess cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, the latter supporting mid-single-digit earnings-per-share growth.\nWith the company's enterprise value roughly 12 times analysts' EBITDA expectations, it appears to be a great value relative to its peers, trading closer to a 14-times multiple. Considering the barriers protecting the business, it's not surprising that the Gates Foundation continues to hold a massive position in the railroad.\n\nShould you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

(NYSE: NOW ) is included among the 12 Best Long Term US Stocks to Buy Now .\nPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on Unsplash\nOn December 17, BTIG initiated coverage of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with a Buy rating and a $1,000 price target.\nThe firm points to how far the platform has come since the launch of Now Assist two years ago. What started as an AI feature has grown into a broader system where humans and AI agents work side by side. ServiceNow now offers an AI Control Tower to handle oversight and governance, and it is working closely with Microsoft to run agent-based AI workflows across the entire enterprise. BTIG’s upside case assumes ServiceNow keeps operating above the Rule of 50. That includes revenue growth in the high teens and free cash flow growth in the mid-20% range.\n\nIn other news, Bloomberg reported that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is in advanced discussions to acquire cybersecurity startup Armis. The company was last valued at $6.1 billion, and the deal could reach around $7 billion, which would make it ServiceNow’s largest acquisition to date. The report cited people familiar with the talks, who said the discussions are private. The transaction could be announced as soon as this week, though it is not guaranteed to close. Neither Armis nor ServiceNow responded to a request for comment from CNBC.\nArmis focuses on securing and managing internet-connected devices, helping organizations protect against cyber risks. Just over a month ago, the company raised $435 million in new funding and said it plans to pursue an IPO over time.\n\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides a cloud-based platform that helps organizations automate and manage digital workflows across IT, HR, customer service, and other business functions.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Microsoft (MSFT) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) closed the most recent trading day at $483.84, moving +1.62% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.79%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.38%.\nThe stock of software maker has fallen by 2.26% in the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.85% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Microsoft in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $3.86, marking a 19.5% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $80.16 billion, up 15.12% from the year-ago period.\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $15.59 per share and a revenue of $325.15 billion, representing changes of +14.3% and +15.42%, respectively, from the prior year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Microsoft. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.19% higher. Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn terms of valuation, Microsoft is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 30.55. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 23.55 for its industry.\n\nWe can additionally observe that MSFT currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.81. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.82.\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 74, putting it in the top 30% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nTo follow MSFT in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Jefferies Says IonQ Stock Can Double Over the Next 12 Months. Should You Buy It Here?\n\nAditya Raghunath\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nJefferies just launched coverage of the quantum computing sector with a bullish call, sending IonQ (IONQ) shares surging. The firm slapped a $100 price target on IONQ stock, implying roughly 110% upside from current levels, while initiating with a “Buy” rating.\nIonQ develops trapped-ion quantum computers designed to solve complex problems across business, society, and scientific research. Founded on 25 years of academic research, the company uses ionized atoms to perform longer, more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors than competing quantum systems.\n\nMore News from Barchart Cathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock. Should You?\nIs Cathie Wood Jumping Ship on Tesla Stock?\nBroadcom Stock Is Up 120% in the Past Year. This Analyst Thinks It Is One of the Highest-Quality Stocks to Buy for the Next Year Too.\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nIonQ is the first quantum hardware provider integrated with all major cloud platforms, offering accessible quantum computing through partnerships with Amazon's (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, and Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google Cloud for applications in chemistry, medicine, finance, and logistics optimization.\nAnalyst Kevin Garrigan expects IonQ to benefit from powerful ecosystem tailwinds driving quantum computing adoption. The company's trapped-ion architecture differentiates in coherence, fidelity, and native all-to-all connectivity, technical advantages that matter as the technology matures.\nIonQ's roadmap targets fault-tolerant quantum computing with integrated 256 qubits by 2026, scaling to 10,000 physical qubits and 800 logical qubits in 2027, and ultimately 2 million physical qubits with 80,000 logical qubits by 2030.\n\nIs IONQ Stock a Good Buy Right Now? IonQ delivered a stunning third quarter, solidifying its position as the dominant force in quantum computing. It reported revenue of almost $40 million, beating its guidance by 37% and growing 222% year-over-year (YoY).\nThe Q3 results showcased IonQ's expanding quantum platform strategy, encompassing computing, networking, sensing, and cybersecurity capabilities that no competitor can match.\n\nIonQ's fifth-generation Tempo system achieved an algorithmic qubit score of 64, creating a computational space 36 quadrillion times larger than IBM's (IBM) leading commercial system. More significantly, the company demonstrated a world-record 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity, meaning IonQ has hit every key technical milestone needed for full fault tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\nIonQ's acquisition spree is proving transformative. The Oxford Ionics deal closed during the quarter, bringing Electronic Qubit Control technology that leverages standard semiconductor fabrication.\nThis matters enormously because IonQ can now manufacture quantum chips using mature 128-nanometer nodes at existing foundries rather than building custom infrastructure that would cost billions. The bill of materials for a 2-million-qubit machine comes in at under $30 million, much lower than competitors.\n\nVector Atomic's addition expands IonQ's total addressable market into quantum sensing for positioning, navigation, and timing applications critical to defense customers. With quantum key distribution capabilities from the ID Quantique acquisition, IonQ can now bid on massive Golden Dome-style infrastructure projects that require integrated quantum solutions.\nThe business is rapidly globalizing, with international revenue accounting for 30% of total sales, up from nearly zero a year ago. Government and enterprise partnerships validate commercial viability, while the company expands beyond pure compute into quantum networking and sensing applications.\nWhat Is the IONQ Stock Price Target? Guidance for full-year 2025 revenue increased to $106 million to $110 million, breaking historical seasonality patterns as fourth-quarter revenue is expected to exceed the third quarter.\nThe company's 256-qubit system launches in 2026, followed by a roadmap that reaches 80,000 logical qubits by 2030, compared with IBM's stated target of just 2,000 logical qubits by 2033.\n\nAnalysts tracking the quantum computing stock forecast revenue to increase from $108.5 million in 2025 to $746 million in 2029. Despite this significant top-line growth, IONQ is expected to remain unprofitable. Over the next four years, its free cash outflow is projected to surpass $1.2 billion.\nIonQ raised $2 billion in October at $93 per share, bringing the pro forma cash balance to $3.5 billion with zero debt. This war chest positions the company to continue aggressive investment in maintaining what management describes as a five-year technical lead over competitors.\nIONQ stock has been volatile, down about 40% from October highs alongside the broader quantum computing selloff. Yet Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish, with 75% of analysts recommending IonQ.\nOut of the 13 analysts covering IONQ stock, eight recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” and four recommend “Hold.” The average IONQ stock price target is $75.50, above the current price of $47.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

A $750 billion valuation would represent about a 50% increase from its reported $500 billion valuation in October.\nSeparate reports suggest OpenAI is also broadening its partnerships. The ChatGPT maker is said to be raising at least $10 billion from Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and exploring the use of Amazon's AI chips, signaling diversification beyond its close relationship with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ).\nThe push for fresh capital comes as AI infrastructure costs keep rising, even as OpenAI generates billions in revenue.

      "Content": "ChatGPT Just Took Over Campus--And Microsoft Is Losing the AI Classroom War\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:53 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nNFLX\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nOpenAI's expansion across US college campuses is starting to resemble an early-stage distribution strategy that could shape long-term adoption trends. According to purchase orders reviewed by Bloomberg, the company has sold more than 700,000 ChatGPT licenses to around 35 public universities, giving students and faculty broad access to the tool. Usage data from 20 campuses shows ChatGPT was called more than 14 million times in September, with average users turning to it 176 times that month for writing, research, and data analysis. While private university data is not publicly disclosed, OpenAI says it has sold well over one million licenses globally to colleges, suggesting overall penetration could be meaningfully higher.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with ARES.\nIs NFLX fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nPricing dynamics appear to be central to this momentum, especially when compared with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ). Universities reviewed by Bloomberg are paying a few dollars per user per month for bulk ChatGPT access, a sharp discount to the $20 per month typically charged to smaller educational users and far below corporate pricing. By contrast, Microsoft's Copilot has often been quoted at around $30 per user per month at many campuses, prompting some schools to limit licenses largely to faculty, though Microsoft has since announced a reduced academic price of about $18 per month. At California State University, administrators evaluated multiple tools and selected ChatGPT as the cheapest and most familiar option, agreeing to pay OpenAI $15 million per year to cover roughly 500,000 students and staff. Even at schools deeply embedded in Microsoft software, internal documents suggest ChatGPT usage can exceed Copilot, with Google's Gemini sometimes also seeing stronger engagement.\n\nCompetition for the education market remains active and unsettled. Google is offering its Gemini Pro assistant free for a year to college students and has promoted adoption across universities and large school districts, while Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) continues to use education discounts to cultivate long-term loyalty. Policymakers are also stepping in, with the Trump administration recently announcing new federal grant priorities, including a $50 million pool aimed at expanding AI access in higher education. At the same time, concerns about educational impact persist. Netflix ( NASDAQ:NFLX ) Chairman Reed Hastings has donated $50 million to Bowdoin College to study how AI affects teaching and learning, reflecting unease that institutions may be moving quickly to adopt AI tools without clear evidence of improved outcomes. How OpenAI's early campus lead ultimately translates into durable preference among future workers may depend on how rivals adjust pricing, access, and integration in the years ahead.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "3 Best AI ETF Picks for 2026\n\nDavid Dierking, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 9:50 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: OPAI.PVT\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points Quantum computing is an exciting theme, but one that's going to take some time to play out.\nInvestors should consider a broad spectrum of names beyond just the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nThe three ETFs below offer a range of options for investors to gain exposure to the AI sector.\n10 stocks we like better than Defiance Quantum ETF ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is already well on its way to being the biggest technological revolution since the internet -- and it's still in the early innings.\nWhile names such as Nvidia , Microsoft , OpenAI , and Alphabet have emerged as the \"faces\" of AI, there are plenty of potential winners throughout the sector. Infrastructure builders, enterprise software creators, application developers, and cloud providers all play an integral part to the ecosystem. AI is far more than just semiconductor manufacturers.\nThat's why when it comes to investing in AI, it may be better to just buy the theme instead of trying to pick individual winners. Some of the biggest returns so far have been delivered by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. But stretched valuations, evidence of slowing momentum, and questions surrounding whether all the AI development spending will be worth it are beginning to plague some companies.\nAn ETF that can maintain exposure to some of those megacap names but look beyond them for additional opportunities may be the way to play it in 2026. Here are the three artificial intelligence ETFs that I'm favoring as we head into the new year.\n1. Defiance Quantum ETF If you're interested in true futuristic tech, quantum computing is probably for you. If artificial intelligence is the next revolution, quantum is the rocket that could really propel it to the next level.\nQuantum computing involves developing the technology for processing and calculating at speeds far beyond what traditional computers can do today. It has potential applications in technology, medicine, energy, finance, scientific discovery, and more.\n\nThe Defiance Quantum ETF (NASDAQ: QTUM) invests in companies at the forefront of quantum development. Top holdings right now include Tower Semiconductor , Rigetti Computing , Teradyne , Coherent , and Micron Technology .\nThe only Magnificent Seven name among the top 10 holdings is Alphabet, and it only comes in at No. 10, with a weight of 1.8%. So there's good diversification here relative to the broader tech sector and the equity market in general.\nQuantum is a little more niche and a lot more appropriate for a long-term holding than traditional AI stocks. It may be years before quantum becomes anything close to having mainstream applications, so it should be considered an investment in potential more than concrete current results.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF The Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AIQ) looks more like a traditional big tech ETF, but it's careful to include companies of all sizes and from all around the world. In that way, it's designed to be a more inclusive and comprehensive take on AI investing.\nThe fund's index starts by grouping companies in two categories:\n\nAI developers: Includes product and services developers and users, as well as companies that offer AI solutions as a service to customers.\nAI and big data analytics: Semiconductor, storage, and/or hardware manufacturers, as well as quantum computing developers.\nA minimum \"exposure score\" is required for inclusion. Qualifying components are weighted by market cap.\nAIQ is a nice middle ground between big and small companies, although it definitely tilts toward large caps. The AI exposure requirement is a nice way to build the portfolio and ensure that the fund is more of a pure AI play than just a generic megacap tech fund.\n3. Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) describes itself as the world's first generative AI ETF. It's unique in that it's the only actively managed fund among the three, which is advantageous in such a rapidly evolving space. But it also leans more toward the megacap names.\n\nTop holdings currently include Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms , and Palantir . Amazon , Broadcom , and Advanced Micro Devices also reside in the top 10, so there's very much a Nasdaq-100 index feel to this fund.\nIf you're looking for a straightforward, more \"conservative\" way to invest in AI, CHAT might not be a bad choice. You get the heavy large-cap exposure without a lot of the risk that comes from investing in newer or emerging names.\nShould you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF right now? Before you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Defiance Quantum ETF wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $511,196 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,047,897 !*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 954 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

With the addition of support for VMware ESXi hypervisors, Windows, Linux and macOS environments, Arms Cyber becomes the first software vendor to offer a unified ransomware defense from a single platform.\n\nThe launch of Arms Cyber’s cross-hypervisor capabilities comes as ransomware operators increasingly target virtualization infrastructure to maximize impact. According to Microsoft, incidents targeting ESXi hypervisors have more than doubled over the past three years, with threat actors recognizing that a single compromised hypervisor can encrypt dozens of virtual machines simultaneously, paralyzing entire enterprises with devastating efficiency. For example, in April, the DragonForce ransomware attack targeting major UK retailers encrypted VMware ESXi hypervisors at Marks & Spencer, halting online sales for over 46 days and resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in profit losses and market value.\nRansomware Meets Its Match with Cross-Hypervisor Support\n\nArms Cyber takes a unique approach to solving this problem. Upon initial access, attackers using LOTL techniques establish patterns that deviate from normal operating procedures. Arms Cyber’s zero trust policies build off these deviation requirements to reinforce more effective prevention. Intruders also rely on reliable information about their target, and static environments offer an ideal landscape for gathering such data. Integrating Arms Cyber’s anti-ransomware platform at various layers introduces a level of diversity and dynamism, making it nearly impossible for attackers to gain the actionable intelligence they need about their target.\nWith the addition of support for VMware, Windows, Linux and macOS environments, Arms Cyber is securing the virtualization layer where attacks often hide. The new release hardens remote access with multi-factor authentication, blocks malicious executables with application filtering and process controls, and enforces network and file access lockdowns across the hypervisor environment. Decoy files provide early detection, while AI-powered response halts attacks with over 98% efficacy, automates file rollback, and removes attacker persistence. The platform deploys easily on VMware ESXi, Nutanix, XenServer, Citrix Hypervisor, Proxmox, RHEV, and KVM, requires no kernel modifications, and runs with a minimal footprint and performance impact.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout Arms Cyber\nArms Cyber delivers a revolutionary approach to defeat attacks others miss through a three-part strategy: Conceal, Deceive, and Restore — powered by stealth. By adding stealth to an organization’s existing security posture, we keep critical data invisible to attackers, detect threats before they cause serious damage, and enable rapid recovery without compromise. The outcome: no ransom payouts, no public breaches, no costly downtime.\nCONTACT: Kevin Wolf TGPR kevin@tgprllc.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO, Elon Musk , once again reignited the debate surrounding Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) co-founder, Bill Gates ‘ massive wealth, and what it could have been, had he not conformed to conventional wealth planning norms.\nBill Gates Could Have Been ‘World’s First Trillionaire’ On Wednesday, in a post on X, investor Michael Arouet highlighted the current top 10 richest people in the world, a list that no longer includes the Microsoft co-founder but does feature former CEO Steve Ballmer at No. 8, with an estimated net worth of $166 billion.\nThis comes after being ranked as the world’s wealthiest person by Forbes magazine for 18 of the 24 years between 1995 and 2017.\n\nDon't Miss:\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n$100k+ in investable assets?

(NYSE: BRK ) (NYSE: BRK ) CEO, Warren Buffett , who asked him to diversify his holdings.\nAccording to Arouet, if Gates hadn’t listened to Buffett, he would now be “the world's first trillionaire, worth twice as much as Elon.”\nAs Microsoft shares continue to soar, and its market capitalization is now at $3.6 trillion, Gates’ net worth would have stood at a staggering $1.5 trillion if he had retained all of his shares in the company and hadn’t embarked on the massive philanthropic journey with his ex-wife, Melinda Gates .\nTo be fair, it's difficult to fault Buffett for that advice.

      "Content": "How will the stock market perform in 2026? Wall Street pros weigh in.\n\nMary Cunningham\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.\nThe S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17— a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.\nThe key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an AI bubble percolate?\n\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"\nOther forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.\nWhat will drive stocks in 2026?\nSeveral catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.\n\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"\nThe AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.\nAnother area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers .\n\nStory Continues\nGrowth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.\n\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.\n\nAdam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.\nStill, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.\n\nIs my money safe?\nThe biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.\nAI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with earnings growth from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.\n\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.\nAmid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.\n\nIn its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.\nCrisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped . The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.\n\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"\nStill, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.\n\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.\nWhat to expect from Trump's address to the nation\nMore details emerge about Rob Reiner and wife Michele's killings\nNew surveillance video shows Nick Reiner before his arrest\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Microsoft Looks Like a “Table Pounder” After Dipping on AI Worries\n\nJoey Frenette\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nQuick Read Microsoft stock is down over 12% from recent highs amid AI spending concerns and competition from Google’s Gemini 3.0.\nThe company denied reports of reduced AI sales quotas following an article from The Information.\nMicrosoft has its own AI team led by Mustafa Suleyman and can reduce OpenAI dependence through Azure and its MAI model.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIf you've been waiting for an opportunity to pick up shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on the cheap amid broad AI and tech jitters, here's your chance. The stock has been beaten down in recent months, now off more than 12% from its recent all-time highs. And while the still seemingly frothy 33.89 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple doesn't seem to suggest Microsoft shares are a \"table pounder,\" I do think that the premier hyperscaler remains one of the best bets of the Magnificent Seven.\nOf course, its close ties to OpenAI used to be a positive. Nowadays, it's a negative, with ChatGPT losing a bit of ground in the AI race to the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), which has seemingly caught up with the release of its well-received Gemini 3.0 model.\n\nBut just because Google Gemini and the hardware running behind the scenes (Google TPUs) are having their moment, it does not mean we should start treating OpenAI as a laggard. Is the AI innovator behind ChatGPT a bit heavy on the debt, with more than a handful of circular deals?\nAI spending fears are weighing on the hyperscalers, Microsoft included Sure, but just because we've got reminders of the internet bubble and dot-com bust does not mean we're in for an exact repeat. Of course, heavy debt loads and extreme spending might be a concern for many. And circular dealmaking in the AI scene makes things a tad trickier and perhaps scarier for those with AI bubble fears.\n\nHowever, I think the big question is whether or not the AI efforts are going to pay off. If they do, leverage might work out heavily in the AI titan's favor in a big-time way. Of course, it's hard to tell how the AI frenzy ends, when it will end, and if the pain will be as bad as the dot-com bust. Either way, I think investors might wish to treat Microsoft as more than just an OpenAI proxy.\nAt the end of the day, Microsoft has been making its own investments to lessen its dependence on ChatGPT. Even if a worst-case scenario happens and OpenAI runs into a bit of financial trouble at some point down the road while giving up more ground to rival AI models, Microsoft can go its own way.\n\nStory Continues\nOpenAI aside, Microsoft has plenty of its own AI firepower Azure is the star of the show, and Microsoft can swap out the model running behind the scenes with another one, including its own (think the MAI model). With a powerful, arguably one of the most powerful, AI teams in the world, headed by a genius in Mustafa Suleyman, I'd argue that Microsoft's own AI dream team is worth the premium price tag.\n\nEither way, Microsoft has more than one racer in the AI race, and that improves the enterprise software behemoth's chances of having a winner on the road to AGI (artificial general intelligence).\nEither way, I think far too many investors are doubting OpenAI. But with the release of GPT-5.2, it's clear that OpenAI is a hungry company that's willing to do whatever it takes to keep that AI ball rolling. If anything, I'd argue that Gemini 3.0 and the \"code red\" it gave OpenAI is a good thing. It might be the nudge the firm needs to sprint that much faster.\nIn any case, I continue to view OpenAI as a massive positive for Microsoft that the market will appreciate again, perhaps in due time, or after the release of GPT-6, which one has to think will be smoother and far more impressive than the launch of GPT-5.\n\nWhat about jitters over that report on lower AI sales quotas? Finally, there's renewed anxiety that Microsoft's AI sales will miss the mark following a report from The Information that some divisions reduced their sales growth quotas.\nThe company has since denied the report, but, nevertheless, it seems like the investor unease has stuck around. If a future quarter proves sales jitters are unwarranted, perhaps Microsoft stock is unfairly sold off right here. In any case, I think 2026 could be a huge year for AI monetization, and few firms, I think, are better prepared than Microsoft.\n\nWhether we're talking about the OpenAI worries, broad bubble fears, or The Information report, I think there's too much negativity in Microsoft stock right here. And that might make its stock one of the bigger \"table pounders\" for the new year.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms.\nMicrosoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) lost 0.03% over the past five trading sessions after losing 0.27% the five prior. That brings MSFT's year-to-date gain to 13.75%, including a more than 3r4% gain since its year-to-date low on April 8.\nWhen the Magnificent Seven member reported FY 2026 Q1 earnings on Oct. 29, shares fell despite beating on EPS and revenue. The company announced earnings of $3.72 per share versus analysts' expectations of $3.67, and quarterly revenue of $77.67 billion versus analysts' expectations of $75.33 billion.\nOn Oct. 1, the company announced that it was increasing its Xbox Game Pass subscription by 50%. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft saw more than 8% of revenue derived from its gaming segment, which now boasts 50 million monthly active subscribers and nearly $5 billion in YoY revenue.\n\nMicrosoft's decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth.\nWhy Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) AWS.\nIn June, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 39% in FY25 Q4, driven by AI services.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect the company's capex to remain elevated to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth.\n\nTariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year.\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft's AI and cloud momentum.\n\nMicrosoft As a Stock Broadly, 34 Wall Street analysts' remain bullish, with 32 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a \"Buy\" rating, two assigning it a \"Hold\" rating and none assigning it a \"Sell\" rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating. Wall Street's price targets cover a significant range, spanning $500 per share on the low end to $700 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $632.22, which represents 32.78% potential upside from today's share price.\nInstitutional ownership currently stands at 73.74%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\n%Change From Current Price\nLow\n$500\n5.01%\nMedian\n$632.22\n32.17%\nHigh\n$700\n47.02%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s strong Azure revenue growth positions it for cloud and AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger.\n\n24/7 Wall St. ’s year-end price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying upside potential of 18.38% from the stock's current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and FY26 Q1 revenue guidance, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

While expenditure hurt near-term optimism, cloud revenue grew strongly. Azure revenue increased 28% year over year, indicating sustained demand for cloud and AI services.\nMicrosoft also revealed a 50% rise in commercial outstanding performance commitments to approximately $400 billion. Rising capital intensity is mitigated by the expanding backlog, which increases revenue visibility.\nThe firm generates substantial cash flow from its cloud computing, corporate software, productivity tools, and gaming business strategy. Microsoft's balance sheet strength is an advantage as companies expand in AI, investors say.\nTechnical support at recent lows suggests modest downside danger, say market participants.

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided. The report also discusses market trends, drivers of the leading Cloud service providers' capex growth during the quarter, and the outlook for the next year.

      "Content": "Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.: Why the Mag 7 needs to 'recalibrate'\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is concentrated primarily in the top ten technology stocks, according to Barclays.\nPNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati, Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré , and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss the market's concentration in tech and whether it's time for investors to start selling the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat I mentioned at the top about how much concentration risk there is in the S&P 500. What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
