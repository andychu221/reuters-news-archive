      "Content": "Why anchoring 2026 portfolios in Big Tech and cybersecurity is the way to go\n\nFrancisco Velasquez\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 11:35 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nCRWD\n\nGOOG\n\nPLTR\n\nANET\n\nThe next phase of the AI trade is more about growth and survival than simply chasing the most coveted names.\n\"I definitely wouldn't just bet on Nvidia,\" Adam Coons, chief investment officer at Winthrop Capital Management, told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. \"We kind of like to barbell this with something like the big hyperscaler, like an Alphabet Google, because that's really the type of name that you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because the AI story is just benefitting an already existing business model that was doing well.\"\nThe \"barbell\" strategy is born out of a growing skepticism toward \"one-trick ponies.\" In this case, Coons says it applies to companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ), CoreWeave ( CRWV ), and Palantir ( PLTR ), which rely almost exclusively on the current AI hardware rush.\n\nWhile these names have led the market higher, their valuations have reached a point where \"margin of safety\" is effectively zero. In Coons's view, when a stock is priced to perfection, even a minor earnings miss can trigger a catastrophe.\n\"You need to position size,\" he said.\nBy anchoring a portfolio in \"behemoth hyperscalers\" like Alphabet ( GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ), investors get exposure to AI through companies with diversified cash flows. Such companies aren't just AI plays, but are advertising and software giants that use AI to optimize businesses that were already succeeding.\n\nIf the \"safe\" end of the barbell is Big Tech, the other side is \"growth,\" and it can be found in the infrastructure required to keep those systems running and secure.\n\"Down the chain, we like the things that overall the AI story will help prop up,\" Coons said. \"For us, it's cybersecurity [as it] becomes more and more important.\"\nHe added that Fortinet ( FTNT ) and CrowdStrike ( CRWD ) are among \"two of our top picks on the security side.\"\nAs AI advances, so does the risk for hacking, Coons noted. Cybersecurity isn't a discretionary expense, but a tax on the digital age that must be paid. Unlike the volatile demand for graphics processing units, the need for protection is more predictable.\nThe sector isn't without its risks, however. CrowdStrike faced a global IT outage in July 2024, caused by a faulty software update. It prompted the \"blue screens of death\" across 8.5 million machines, including airlines, hospitals, and banks.\n\nCoons says the final piece of the 2026 investor blueprint is disciplined position sizing. He suggests building a \"basket\" of smaller, high-conviction names — like Reddit ( RDDT ), which he views as a unique data play for AI training — but with the caveat of keeping those positions small.\n\nStory Continues\nAccording to Coons, the average investor should steer clear of trying to find the next Nvidia. The low-hanging fruit has been picked, and winning 2026 is more about leaning into the giants that own the platforms and the specialists who protect the data.\nAdditionally, Chris Versace, chief investment officer at Tematica Research, sees Marvell Technology ( MRVL ) and Arista Networks ( ANET ) as the next logical steps in the AI revolution.\n\nVersace argues that the massive spending on data centers is creating a \"network congestion\" problem. As AI usage explodes, the connection between chips becomes the new bottleneck.\n\"It's the network connection that will be the big bottleneck that I think folks are missing,\" Versace notes, pointing to Marvel because of its dominance in optical and networking hardware.\nFrancisco Velasquez is a Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The company has a market capitalization of $2.48 trillion as I write this, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a 21% return over the next year if it does cross the $3 trillion milestone.\nRead on, and let's consider Amazon's growth prospects in the year ahead.\nAll eyes on Amazon Web Services Amazon's potential pathway to the $3 trillion club next year starts with its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It used to be a place where businesses would simply store data and host their critical digital applications, but it has evolved to become the center of Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.\n\nAWS operates state-of-the-art data centers and it rents the computing capacity to AI developers who don't have the financial resources to build their own infrastructure. These data centers are filled with advanced AI chips from suppliers like Nvidia , but Amazon also designed its own chips called Inferentia and Trainium. Top developers like Anthropic are using hundreds of thousands of the latest Trainium2 chips, which offer up to 40% better price performance than competing hardware when training AI models.\nThen there is the AWS Bedrock platform, where businesses can access hundreds of completed AI models from third-parties including Anthropic and Meta Platforms . Developing models from scratch is time consuming and expensive, so using a ready-made solution can help businesses achieve their AI goals much faster.\n\nAWS generated a record $33 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 30), which was up 20% year over year. That was the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022, which highlights the platform's incredible AI-driven momentum. But it gets better, because AWS has a whopping $200 billion order backlog from customers who are waiting for more data center capacity to come online, so the strong top-line results are likely to continue.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon's earnings continue to crush Wall Street's estimates The $33 billion in third-quarter revenue that AWS brought in accounted for just 18% of Amazon's total revenue of $180 billion. However, the cloud business is the company's most profitable by far, contributing 65% of its total operating income. E-commerce is actually Amazon's largest source of revenue, but its profit margins are very thin because its Amazon.com site focuses on selling a high volume of products at low prices.\n\nHowever, Amazon is pushing to improve profitability in its e-commerce business by boosting efficiency and implementing new technologies. In 2023, it broke its U.S. logistics network into eight distinct regions, so now the products in each fulfillment center are specific to their geographic region. As a result, orders travel shorter distances to reach customers, which brings down packing and shipping costs.\nAmazon also uses AI-powered software like Project Private Investigator in its fulfillment centers, which uses computer vision to identify defective products before they ship. This reduces returns and refunds, creating further cost savings.\nThe accelerating growth at AWS combined with improved efficiency in the e-commerce business is driving a huge increase in Amazon's overall profit. The company generated earnings of $5.22 per share during the first three quarters of 2025, which was a whopping 42% jump from the same period in 2024. Plus, Amazon's earnings have beaten Wall Street's consensus estimates in every single quarter of 2025, by an average of 22%.\n\nHow Amazon can cross the $3 trillion milestone in 2026 Amazon stock trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.8 as I write this. That's roughly in line with the Nasdaq-100 index which trades at a P/E ratio of 32.1, so Amazon stock is basically sitting at fair value relative to its peers in the tech sector.\nWall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Amazon could generate earnings of $7.86 per share in 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of 29.6.\nAssuming Wall Street is right, Amazon stock would have to climb by 11% next year just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 32.8, lifting its market cap to $2.75 trillion. But remember, the company has a habit of beating Wall Street's expectations.\nIf its 2026 earnings beat the consensus estimate by 22% like they have so far in 2025, then its stock could be poised for a 35% gain next year instead. That would catapult its market value to a whopping $3.35 trillion.\n\nHowever, even an earnings beat of just 9% next year would be enough to see Amazon join the $3 trillion club. Given the incredible momentum across its e-commerce business and AWS, I think that's an achievable target.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?

      "Content": "Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nEllie Diamond\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:45 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: FIG\n\nSTLA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAAPL\n\nThere are countless articles and profiles of entrepreneurs who dropped out of college. Fortune magazine recently featured several, including Figma CEO Dylan Field and Scale founder Lucy Guo, the world’s youngest self-made billionaire woman, who built her own fortune.\nInnovators like these young people make the news because they’re inspiring, intelligent and innovative. They’re also exceptional. which can make them unrealistic role models, according to Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon. He advises aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from experience before striking out on their own.\n\nThe Exception, Not the Rule In October 2025, two entrepreneurs took the stage at Italian Tech Week in Turin. One was John Elkann, the chair and executive director of automaking giant Stellantis [ 3 ]. During his interview with Bezos, Elkann asked what he thought of the ideal of the prodigy entrepreneur.\nThese are personalities such as Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Steve Jobs. Each became hugely successful after rejecting the conventional pathway to success: a college education and years of climbing the ladder .\n\nElkann didn’t take this route, and neither did Bezos. They have great respect for those who did, but Bezos is quick to point out that it shouldn’t be an expectation.\n“It is possible to be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college and be a great entrepreneur ,” he said. “We have famous examples of that. But these people are the exception.”\nThe numbers back him up. A Clifford-Lewis Private Wealth study found that among the top 0.1% of rapidly growing new businesses, the founder’s average age was 45 at startup. Based on its data, Clifford-Lewis estimates that entrepreneurs have a much higher chance of success at 30 than at 20.\nSee Next: I Asked ChatGPT How To Build Wealth for the Rest of Trump’s Term: Here’s Its Plan\nTrending Now: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires — and How You Can, Too\n\nThe Value of Professional Experience Bezos started Amazon at age 30. He had graduated from Princeton University in 1986 and worked at several Wall Street companies, including Fitel and Bankers Trust. In 1990, he became the youngest-ever vice president of hedge fund D.E. Shaw. He opened Amazon in July 1995 at age 31.\nBezos said these 10 years of working for others improved Amazon’s chances of success . He gained hands-on experience leading a growing company, and these skills helped him guide Amazon through its early days of explosive growth. In only two years, he took the company public, with an initial public offering price of $18 per share.\n\nStory Continues\nBezos now counsels young aspiring entrepreneurs to follow a similar path. As he said in Turin:\n“I always advise young people, go work at a best-practices company where you can learn a lot of basic, fundamental things: how to hire really well, how to interview, etc. There’s a lot of stuff you would learn in a great company, and there’s still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it”.\n\nBezos believes that these early career lessons do what pure inspiration and talent cannot: They teach young entrepreneurs how to do things right from day one. This knowledge supports better decision-making, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on growth.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThe Best $25 To Spend at Dollar Tree in Winter 2025\n5 Most Valuable American Coins Still in Circulation\n5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up to $1K Per Month From Home\n9 Low-Effort Ways to Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : Jeff Bezos Warns: Do This Before Starting a Company in Your 20s\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Could These 3 \"Recession-Proof\" Dividend Stocks Surge 100% by 2031?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 8:43 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nKO\n\nJNJ\n\nKey Points Microsoft is a terrific growth stock with an excellent dividend program.\nJohnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola are both outstanding dividend payers.\nHowever, neither has the high-growth outlook that Microsoft sees ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nFears of a recession did not materialize this year. However, it's always worth it for investors to buy shares of companies that can perform well during economic downturns. Solid dividend stocks that routinely increase their payouts are especially attractive in that regard, since they tend to have businesses equipped to withstand challenging times.\n\nLet's discuss three stocks to buy to prepare your portfolio for any recession that may lay ahead: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) , and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) . Two of them are Dividend Kings , corporations that have achieved at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. All three are solid dividend payers.\nBut could they rise by 100% in the next five years? Let's find out.\n1. Microsoft Microsoft has moved sideways for the past six months. With a market cap of $3.5 trillion, some might argue that its high-growth days are behind it. But Microsoft still has plenty to offer growth-oriented investors and, in my view, is well-equipped to register the 14.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) necessary over the next five years to double in value.\n\nThe company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) looks especially promising. Microsoft's revenue from its cloud division, Azure, is growing rapidly, as is its contracted backlog, which is a strong indication that demand for the services Microsoft provides remains high.\nOne of the company's most notable partners is OpenAI, from which it recently secured a $250 billion Azure commitment. Through 2032, Microsoft will have intellectual property rights to OpenAI's models (still among the market leaders) and products.\nBeing able to offer OpenAI's models to its customers through Azure is a significant selling point for Microsoft, and it is likely one of the reasons it has been gaining ground on Amazon , the leader in cloud computing. From the looks of it, this tailwind will remain intact through the next few years.\n\nMicrosoft remains a terrific growth stock, and the dividend is almost a bonus. The company has increased its payouts by 152.8% in the past decade.\n2. Johnson & Johnson Several things make Johnson & Johnson an excellent \"recession-proof\" stock.\nFirst, since it sells healthcare products, including pharmaceutical drugs that remain in high demand regardless of economic conditions, it tends to generate consistent revenue and profits, even during economic downturns. Patients won't want to cut down on lifesaving drugs, and it also helps that third-party payers foot a lot of the bill.\n\nStory Continues\nSecond, Johnson & Johnson also has a rock-solid balance sheet with a credit rating above that of the U.S. government .\nThird, there is the dividend. J&J is on a streak of 63 consecutive payout increases. It is likely one of the safest dividend programs on the planet. All these factors make the healthcare leader a top pick for low-risk, dividend-seeking investors, but could it achieve the 14.9% CAGR necessary to double over the next five years? In my view, it is unlikely to do so.\n\nJohnson & Johnson faces several headwinds that could hinder its ability to deliver such outstanding returns. One of the most important is drug price negotiations in the U.S., with several of its medicines having already been targeted -- which will lead to lower prices for these products.\nTrue, Johnson & Johnson also has some potential growth avenues. It is working on a promising robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) system, the Ottava, that will help it join this underpenetrated market. However, it will take some time for this to have a meaningful effect on its results. None of that means Johnson & Johnson isn't a buy, though. It just means that the stock probably won't double in five years.\n3. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola is a leading consumer staples company -- an industry that is also famously resilient. Even when the economy isn't doing well, the beverage maker attracts a decent amount of business thanks to its famous brand name (and many other smaller brands, some of which dominate their niches), and a large portfolio of products across most drink categories.\n\nThis is also an innovative company that routinely launches new products, or just repackages old ones in ways to make them more attractive in current market conditions. That includes catering to price-sensitive consumers. People can cut down on beverages during recessions more easily than they cut down on medications.\nHowever, Coca-Cola's strategy can somewhat limit (though not eliminate) the effect of this threat. It has, after all, allowed the company to perform well over the past few decades and maintain a strong dividend program throughout. With a streak of 63 consecutive dividend increases, it is also a Dividend King.\nCoca-Cola is highly unlikely to double in the next five years. It will face stiff competition and macroeconomic headwinds (including inflation and tariffs), coupled with relatively slow volume and revenue growth, which hardly fit the profile of a high-growth stock capable of doubling in five years. These challenges won't break Coca-Cola's business, but they also limit its upside.\n\nThe stock remains a reliable and steady choice for income investors. But seekers of high growth should look elsewhere.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now?

The company's Dynamics 365 revenues surged 21% in constant currency during the first quarter of fiscal 2026, outpacing broader cloud services growth and signaling strong enterprise adoption.\n\nThe platform's success stems from its comprehensive integration of customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning capabilities, enhanced by artificial intelligence features through Copilot. Organizations are increasingly adopting Dynamics 365 to streamline operations, with the solution processing more than 10 billion customer interactions monthly across its ecosystem. The business applications segment now serves more than 46,000 organizations globally, reflecting expanding market penetration.\n\nMicrosoft's strategic investments in AI-powered automation within Dynamics 365 are differentiating the platform from competitors. Features like Copilot for Sales and Customer Service are reducing manual workflows while improving decision-making accuracy. The company reported that organizations using AI-enhanced Dynamics applications achieved 30% faster case resolution times, driving measurable productivity gains.\n\nThe commercial cloud infrastructure supporting Dynamics 365 provides additional upside potential. As enterprises expand their digital transformation initiatives, the platform benefits from network effects and increasing customer lifetime value. With Dynamics 365's growth trajectory exceeding overall commercial cloud expansion and strong renewal rates indicating customer satisfaction, the business applications segment represents a compelling catalyst for Microsoft's stock appreciation. The combination of market share gains, AI integration, and operational leverage positions Dynamics 365 as a sustained revenue growth engine through fiscal 2026.\n\nCompetitive Landscape: Oracle and Salesforce Performance Oracle ORCL and Salesforce CRM remain formidable competitors in the business applications space. Oracle reported that its Fusion Cloud Applications revenues grew 17% in constant currency during its recent quarter, with Oracle's cloud ERP and HCM solutions gaining traction among large enterprises. Salesforce delivered 8% revenue growth in its latest quarter, though Salesforce's core CRM platform faces pricing pressures. Oracle continues investing heavily in AI capabilities across its applications suite, while Salesforce has integrated Einstein AI features throughout its Service Cloud and Sales Cloud offerings. Both Oracle and Salesforce maintain substantial installed bases, though growth rates vary across their respective product portfolios as market competition intensifies.\n\nStory Continues\nMSFT’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates MSFT shares have lost 5.8% in the past three-month period, underperforming the Zacks Computer – Software industry's decline of 8.3% and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector's return of 5.5%.\nMSFT’s 3-Month Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFrom a valuation standpoint, MSFT stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio of 10.4X compared with the industry’s 7.57X.

Do they waste a whole day trying to find the next big play in AI or do they just say, you know what? Nvidia's going to win this whole damn thing? I'm just going to bet on them again next year.\n00:15 Adam\nYeah, I definitely wouldn't uh just bet on Nvidia. I I think you do need to do your homework if you want to buy specific names. I think probably the general investor is probably better finding some sort of basket to kind of play the overall space. Uh but we're very early innings in this and\n00:41 Adam\nobviously Nvidia is the winner right now, but uh to say, you know, in five years that we look back that they're going to be the dominant player still, very, very unlikely. Like I said, this is really an evolving space. So I I would be careful with something that's so specific as Nvidia. Uh we kind of like to barbell this with, you know, something like the the big hyperscaler like a like an Alphabet Google, uh because that's really the type of name that uh you could probably have a little bit more comfort in because they just\n01:14 Adam\noverall, the AI story is just benefiting an already existing business model that was doing well. So, I think you would just want to be careful with what we're calling kind of the one trick ponies, like a Nvidia, uh a Core Weve or a Patier right now.\n01:31 Speaker A\nUh, Brooke, let me get over to you because I think what you're seeing in industrial metals and some of the things that Adam's talking about fits nicely with what we heard from Ed Yardini this morning that he might see it is likely to see we are likely to see a broadening out in this rally. Investors doing their homework, trying to get outside of the tried and true Mag 7.\n01:53 Brooke\nYeah, Brian, what we did hear from Ed Danny over the weekend was really ongoing momentum in this market in 2026. He maintained that year end target for the S&P 500 of 7,700 and he said largely it won't be really led by uh the Mag 7, but also what he called the impressive 493 of the S&P 500 as really this broadening out, this boost in productivity growth really leads to overall returns for the\n02:26 Brooke\nS&P 500 in 2026. Specifically, you know, he went on to say that that is really where exactly investors should be thinking about this mindset. You know, not really overweight technology, but more so thinking about the other users of AI as opposed to just the producers of AI. And so certainly he's not alone in this uh momentum that he thinks will exist within 2026 ongoing from what we've seen so far in the returns in 2025.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

March E-mini S&P futures (ESH26) are down -0.28%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH26) are down -0.27%.\n\nStock indexes are moving lower today, led by losses in megacap technology stocks. Also, today's plunge in metals prices is weighing on mining stocks. Lower bond yields are supportive of stocks, with the 10-year T-note yield falling to a 1-week low of 4.10% today.\nMore News from Barchart Santa Claus Rally, Fed Minutes and Other Can't Miss Items this Week\nMicron Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 197% in this Down Move\nMP Materials Gained 230% in 2025.

The recent surge in both metals has taken prices to overbought levels, sparking technical selling. Also, the CME today raised margin levels for precious metals trading, which has sparked some long liquidation pressure.\nCrude oil prices are up by more than +2% today, lifting energy producers and limiting losses in the broader market, as advanced peace talks over the weekend to end the Ukraine-Russian war failed to yield a breakthrough. Geopolitical tensions from Venezuela to Nigeria are also supporting crude prices. In addition, crude prices rose after China's Ministry of Finance on Sunday pledged to broaden its fiscal spending base next year, signaling government support to drive economic growth.\n\nSeasonal factors are bullish for stocks. According to data from Citadel Securities, since 1928, the S&P 500 has risen 75% of the time in the last two weeks of December, climbing 1.3% on average.\nMarket attention this holiday-shortened week will focus on US economic news. Later today, Nov pending home sales are expected to climb +1.0% m/m. On Tuesday, the Dec MNI Chicago PMI is expected to rise by +3.5 points to 39.8. Also, the minutes of the December 9-10 FOMC meeting will be released. On Wednesday, initial weekly unemployment claims are expected to increase by 1,000 to 215,000. On Friday, the Dec S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unrevised at 51.8.\n\nStory Continues\nThe markets are discounting the odds at 19% for a -25 bp rate cut at the FOMC's next meeting on January 27-28.\nOverseas stock markets are mixed today. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.17%. China's Shanghai Composite climbed to a 6-week high and closed up +0.04% for the ninth consecutive daily gain. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.44%.\n\nInterest Rates\nMarch 10-year T-notes (ZNH6) today are up by +4 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is down -1.6 bp to 4.112%. Mar T-notes rose to a 1-week high today, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1-week low of 4.102%. Today's stock market weakness is boosting safe-haven demand for T-notes. Also, geopolitical risks in Venezuela and Nigeria have added to the safe-haven appeal of T-notes.\nEuropean government bond yields are moving lower today. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.836% and is down -1.4 bp at 2.848%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 1-week low of 4.459% and is down -0.7 bp to 4.500%.\nSwaps are discounting a 2% chance of a +25 bp rate hike by the ECB at its next policy meeting on February 5.\n\nUS Stock Movers\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are mostly lower today, pressuring the broader market.

      "Content": "Quantum computing works — now investors will see if the stocks do too\n\nCharlie Garcia\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:50 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: IBM\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nIONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nEditor’s note: Columnist Charlie Garcia shares select emails and online comments from his virtual mailbag each week.\nDear Charlie, I see three investment lanes for quantum computing : pure plays like IonQ IONQ and Rigetti RGTI; the “Magnificent Seven” giants with quantum divisions; and infrastructure picks-and-shovels.\nMost Read from MarketWatch I make more than my wife. Can she claim Social Security at 62 and later switch to spousal benefits?\n‘Is it a case of them or us?’ We’re in our 40s. Do we retire early in our 50s — or save for our kids’ education?\nLogan Paul’s $5.3 million Pokémon bet raises a bigger question: Do collectibles belong in your portfolio?\nThe hot AI trade faces a 1980s style trap and these risks, says this market bull\n\nWhich lane has the best risk-reward?\nMason\nDear Mason, All three lanes lead somewhere. The question is which one fits your risk tolerance.\nPure plays like IonQ, Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum QBTS are lottery tickets with better odds. They’re not competing with the Magnificent Seven; they’re auditioning to be acquired by them. If one of these companies cracks a genuine commercial advantage, it becomes a buyout target overnight. High risk; asymmetric upside.\n\nThe Mag Seven are already in: Alphabet GOOGL GOOG, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon.com AMZN have billion-dollar quantum programs. So does IBM IBM. You’re not betting on whether they’ll participate. You’re betting on whether quantum becomes material to their earnings this decade. Safer, but the quantum upside is diluted by everything else in the stock.\nInfrastructure is where the near-term money lives. Post-quantum cryptography is already a compliance issue. NIST standardized new algorithms in 2024, and every government contractor, bank and defense company needs to upgrade. That’s not speculative. That’s a budget line-item.\nThe picks-and-shovels play isn’t qubits. It’s the classical-quantum interface: cryogenic systems, control electronics, error-correction software. Less sexy than “we built a quantum computer” — and more likely to generate revenue this decade.\n\nMy bias? I own positions across all three lanes, but I’m most interested in security infrastructure. That’s the toll road everyone has to drive on.\nDiversified but opinionated,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best investors in the mobile revolution didn’t bet on which phone would win. They bet on Qualcomm’s QCOM chips inside all of them.\nDear Charlie, Quantum computing is just another fantasy — like AI was for decades. Error correction is still unsolved.\nThis is vaporware.\nNancy\nDear Nancy, Error correction was unsolved. Past tense.\n\nLa historia continúa\nIn December 2024, Google’s Willow chip became the first quantum processor to demonstrate “below threshold” error correction. That’s the holy grail physicists have chased for 30 years. The chip showed that scaling up qubit arrays, from 3×3 to 5×5 to 7×7, reduced error rates instead of compounding them. That’s never happened before.\n\nThree weeks later, Microsoft announced a breakthrough in topological qubits. Amazon’s Ocelot chip cut error-correction costs by 90%. IBM confirmed it’s on track for a 100,000-qubit system by 2029. A University of Chicago professor called it “escape velocity.”\nYou’re right that quantum computing was vaporware for decades. So was AI. In 2020, experts said artificial general intelligence was 50 years away. In 2024, AI writes code, passes the bar exam and diagnoses cancer better than radiologists.\nThe difference between “decades away” and “here” is usually about 18 months of denial.\nStill skeptical after all these years,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best time to invest in a technology is when smart people still think it’s a fantasy.\nDear Charlie, North Korea stole $2 billion in crypto in 2024. When quantum computing matures, all encryption is at risk. What makes you think bitcoin BTCUSD survives?\nAlex\nDear Alex, You’re conflating two different problems: hackers and hardware.\nNorth Korea didn’t crack bitcoin’s cryptography. It compromised employees. The Bybit heist, around $1.5 billion, came from social engineering and insider access, not supercomputers. That’s not a quantum threat. That’s a human one.\nNow, the real question: What happens when quantum computers can break elliptic curve cryptography?\n\nAnswer: Everything breaks. Not just bitcoin. Google, Microsoft, the U.S. Federal Reserve, every bank, every military system, every government database on earth. If quantum computing cracks bitcoin, it’s already cracked the entire digital infrastructure of modern civilization. Bitcoin isn’t the first domino. It’s somewhere around the 40th.\nBut here’s what the doomsayers miss: bitcoin upgrades. The U.S. government’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) — the same agency that sets the standards for everything from weights and measures to cybersecurity — standardized quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms in 2024.\nThe bitcoin network can migrate to post-quantum signatures. Active coins move to new addresses with new encryption.\n\nLost bitcoins, including founder Satoshi’s, stay frozen in old addresses. That’s roughly 4 million coins in vulnerable P2PK addresses that become unspendable. Security goes up. Circulating supply goes down. That’s not a death sentence for bitcoin. That’s a supply shock.\nTimeline? Nvidia NVDA CEO Jensen Huang says 15 to 30 years before quantum computers can break current encryption. Bitcoin security expert Jameson Lopp estimates bitcoin needs five to 10 years to complete a migration. The math works.\nQuantum computing is a threat to everything. That’s exactly why it isn’t a special threat to bitcoin.\nWatching the sausage get made,\nCharlie\nP.S. North Korea’s hackers don’t need quantum physics. They just need your password.\nDear Charlie, Horizon scanning is no longer optional. First movers will be those who translate technical complexity into business strategy.\nDon’t you agree?\nSarah\nDear Sarah, Exactly right. The companies that win won’t be the ones with the most qubits. They’ll be the ones who figure out what to do with them first.\nQubits are a vanity metric. Error-corrected, commercially viable quantum systems are the real race. The winners will be the ones that turn physics experiments into recurring revenue.\n\nYou’re right that horizon scanning is no longer optional. The companies that spot quantum’s commercial applications first will own the decade. The ones still waiting for proof of concept will be writing case studies about what they missed.\nEyes on the horizon,\nCharlie\nP.S. The best business strategies are written by people who understand what the technology can’t do yet.\nDear Charlie, You’re right that “wafer-scale cryogenic integration” makes investment decisions difficult. But when the railroad was hard to explain, the travelers were few.\nWhen it worked, they were 100 times more numerous. I’m buying the complexity.\nPierre\nDear Pierre, You understand something most investors don’t: The more revolutionary the technology, the harder it is to evaluate. “Wafer-scale cryogenic integration” doesn’t fit in a spreadsheet.\nNeither did “horseless carriage” in 1905.\nThe best investors in transformational technologies aren’t the ones who understand physics. They’re the ones who understand the implications.\n\nYou’re buying the complexity. I’m right there with you.\nFellow traveler,\nCharlie\nP.S. Nobody who bought Standard Oil stock could explain fractional distillation either.\nHe has no position in any of the companies or investments mentioned in this article.\n\nMore from Charlie Garcia:\nQuantum computing is the stock market’s next big tech play — and these stocks are still cheap\nChina is quietly destroying the dollar — and that’ll cost you.

      "Content": "Americans have more cash in stocks than ever, a ‘red flag’ for equities. Where to shift your money instead for 2026\n\nJing Pan\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 6:03 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: GC=F\n\n^GSPC\n\nBRK.A\n\n^IXIC\n\nKR\n\nMoneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nThe U.S. stock market has surged to new highs recently — good news for investors, at least on the surface. But with Americans now holding more of their wealth in stocks than ever before, some economists warn that what comes next may be far less rosy.\n\nJohn Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, says Americans’ stock ownership has even surpassed levels seen in the late 1990s — right before the dot-com boom went bust (1).\nMust Read Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“That should ring alarm bells, even if the buoyant stock market keeps rising for a while amid enthusiasm for AI,” Higgins wrote in a note to clients, adding that “the current very high share of equities is a red flag to watch closely.”\nAccording to Federal Reserve data cited by CNN, 45% of Americans’ household financial assets are now in stocks — an all-time high. That includes direct shareholdings as well as mutual funds and retirement accounts.\nEven with periodic sell-offs — such as the sharp plunge in 2020 when the pandemic hit — the broader trend has been a powerful climb. Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has returned more than 230% (2), while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has soared about 430% as of December 2025 (3).\nStill, Rob Anderson, U.S. sector strategist at Ned Davis Research, points out that record levels of stock ownership have historically coincided with increased risk of a downturn.\n\n“Investors shouldn’t expect the same magnitude of returns that we’ve seen during the last decade to repeat. Going forward, over the next 10 years, there’s probably going to be a downshift in returns,” Anderson cautioned.\nAnd economists aren’t the only ones worried. A recent Bank of America survey found that 91% of fund managers believe U.S. stocks are overvalued — the highest reading in data going back to 2001 (4).\nEven veteran investors are taking cover. Legendary investor Jim Rogers recently revealed that he’s sold all his U.S. stocks, warning he’s “seen this party before” (5). And Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has been making other investors nervous since 2024 by selling off large quantities of stock each quarter (6).\n\nStory Continues\nAnd that’s not getting into the “Buffett Indicator,” which tracks stock market performance relative to GDP. The idea goes that when the stock market overperforms compared to the economy, it can indicate an overvaluation of market capital. The indicator sat at 230% of GDP in September 2025 (7).\nIf you’re concerned about where markets might head, here are four ways to help protect your wealth.\n\nA golden hedge for ‘bad times’ When investors start worrying about dark clouds over the market or slowing returns, gold often shines brightest.\nThe precious metal’s appeal is simple: Unlike paper money, gold can’t be printed at will by central banks. And because its value isn’t tied to any one country, currency or economy, it’s long been viewed as a safe haven — especially when markets lose their footing.\n\nRay Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, recently highlighted gold’s importance in a resilient portfolio.\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” Dalio told CNBC. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier.” Dalio has advocated for up to 15% of a portfolio’s value to include gold.\nThe precious yellow metal has also been on a historic run this year, driven partly by shaky investor confidence in the stock market. Gold is up 60% year over year, and is on track to see even more growth in 2026. After a November slump, the spot price rallied yet again and hit a new record-breaking high of over $4,500 per ounce (8).\nOne method that some people use to invest in gold is a self-directed gold IRA .\n\nA gold IRA allows you to invest in gold and other precious metals in physical forms while also providing the significant tax advantages of an IRA.\nIf you’re not sure where to start, you can check out some of Moneywise’s top picks for gold IRAs to compare your options for free. Just keep in mind that gold is often best used as one part of a well-diversified portfolio.",

He said cloud unit growth increases Amazon's earnings forecast.\nBeyond AWS, Evercore listed Amazon's grocery operations, Trainium chips, Project Kuiper's satellite program, Amazon Pharmacy, better Alexa interaction, Zoox's robotaxi startup, and renewed Amazon focus as 2026 catalysts.\nThe business called Amazon a \"high-quality compounder,\" predicting a 25% annual rise in profits per share, double digit sales growth, higher operational margins, and more free cash flow over the next two years.\nMost gurus on Wall Street say to buy Amazon. The quantitative study from Seeking Alpha is careful, which suggests that there are worries about the value.\nShares of Amazon are gained 6% this year, which is less than the U.S. market. Investors may look to profitability and AWS demand to confirm 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet\n\nZacks Equity Research\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 3:33 AM PST 9 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nFor Immediate Release Chicago, IL &ndash; December 29, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:\n3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. , Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\n\nAmazon.com Inc.\nGlobal e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN&rsquo;s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon&rsquo;s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is &ldquo;Growing at a pace we haven&rsquo;t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we&rsquo;ve been focused on accelerating capacity &mdash; adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.&rdquo;\nExtensive AI Applications\n\nAmazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called &ldquo;Project Rainier.&rdquo; This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers&rsquo; queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\n\nStory Continues\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\nAMZN&rsquo;s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance\nAmazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\nMicrosoft Corp.\nMicrosoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT&rsquo;s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company&rsquo;s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT&rsquo;s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength\nMicrosoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN&rsquo;s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT&rsquo;s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nAlphabet Inc.\nThe undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company&rsquo;s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\n\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business\nGoogle Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon&rsquo;s AWS and Microsoft&rsquo;s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\n\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions\nZacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year&rsquo;s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500&rsquo;s growth rate of 15.9%.\nFree: Instant Access to Zacks' Market-Crushing Strategies\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

What should they be doing right now with these gains?\n00:14 George\nGood morning, Brian. Can you imagine being a short seller in this market and trying to bet against the the Mag 7 or the AI trade or anything. I mean, you get carried out. Short selling's been like the worst uh possible thesis on the market you could have the last 15 years other than maybe going long oil and gas stocks. So I I I would not bet against any of any of these complexes, any of these movements. You want to talk about earnings growth, this market's got it. A lot of the other developed countries really don't. So betting against the US has been a fool's game and I'm certainly not going to be doing it in 2026. I'm going not I'm be going to not try to time the market. I'm going to try to stay in there, stay positions as is and just trim and reallocate as as wisdom would would dictate.\n01:05 Brian\nGeorge, I just had a a guest on uh I'm doing double duty here. I was in the 9:00 a.m. hour and they were making the case for healthcare. If you had to stack up these two sectors side by side, you got uh AI plays, you got the Mac 7, healthcare. What excites you more and why?\n01:22 George\nYeah, I don't really like any of those the best. I think healthcare's seen a significant rally in the closing parts of 2025. If you look at Johnson and Johnson, which basically just lagged in the 140s to 170s, uh kind of era era for a long time and now it's well over 200. You've already seen somewhat of a healthcare rally. If I was going to move chips around the table, I would stay focused on small caps and international. And believe it or not, even though I just ridiculed them, I'd I'd look at oil and gas stocks. They're incredibly cheap, they're incredibly out of favor and the risk reward of that is is pretty compelling from a one to two-year perspective in my view.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Investors know about the AI bubble. They're buying AI stock anyway.\n\nDaniel de Visé, USA TODAY\nMon, December 29, 2025 at 1:59 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nIf one theme has suffused the stock market in 2025, it might be this paradox: Investors know all about the AI bubble, but they’re buying AI stocks anyway.\nIn a new survey by The Motley Fool, 93% of investors with AI stocks said they plan to hold or expand those investments over the next year. Only 7% plan to decrease their AI holdings.\n\n“I think most investors view AI as transformative technology, game-changing technology,” said Asit Sharma , a senior investment analyst at Motley Fool.\nBut talk of the AI bubble is everywhere .\nThe stock prices of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) grew by 698% between 2015 and 2024, compared with a 178% return for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to Motley Fool . Some market observers warn that outsized expectations about artificial intelligence have driven those gains.\nA new balancing act: Here's why an investment giant wants to turn the 60/40 rule on its ear\nAI stocks are overpriced. Investors don't care. Largely because of the Magnificent Seven’s stupendous growth, the stock market is historically overvalued. In consumer terms, stocks are overpriced.\nHow big is the bubble? Consider a metric called the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It measures whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued. As of Dec. 23, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 40.59 .\n\nHistorically, the only time the ratio ranged higher was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, in 1999-2000. That bubble eventually burst.\nDespite the bubble talk, AI stocks have continued their ascent in 2025. Nvidia was up about 36% through Dec. 23. Alphabet was up about 66%.\nInvestors keep buying AI stocks even though many believe the stocks are historically overpriced.\nIn the Motley Fool survey, published Dec. 15, two-fifths of investors said they believe AI stock prices reflect a “speculative bubble,” rather than a “sustainable trend.” The survey reached 2,600 adults.\nIn another survey, the financial journalism site Investopedia found that two in three of its readers believe AI-related stocks are overvalued. That December survey reached 815 investors.\n\nWhen Investopedia asked readers to pick one stock to own for the next decade, most of them named companies in the Magnificent Seven.\n“Most of our readers in our survey feel like AI stocks and AI-related stocks are in a bubble,” said Caleb Silver , editor in chief of Investopedia. “But when we ask them what’s in their portfolio, it’s those same stocks.”\nInvestors are torn on AI stocks The AI paradox has investors torn. Some have sat on the sidelines, avoiding AI stocks for fear of a bubble, only to watch them soar. Others have invested heavily in AI, and now they’re looking to bail out.\n“There are certainly people on both ends of the spectrum,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. “On one side, you have performance-chasers that will look at their year-end statements and want to own more of the things that did the best. On the other, you will have people that are scared about the next crash and want to reduce exposure to the names that have had the most success.”\n\nRunaway AI stock values presume that artificial intelligence will eventually generate prodigious revenue for the companies investing in the technology.\nNaysayers contend that, to date, the payoff has yet to arrive. One influential 2025 report from MIT found that, for all the billions of dollars invested in Generative AI, 95% of the organizations involved “are getting zero return.”\nMeanwhile, analysts predict AI companies will take on more than $1 trillion in cumulative debt to fund AI projects, money borrowed on the promise of speculative returns.\nArguments against an AI bubble focus on the robust revenue of tech giants. Nvidia, for example, reported record revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nSupporters of the Magnificent Seven note that their operations range far beyond AI. Amazon, for example, operates a vast online marketplace, among many other interests, in addition to its AI pursuits. Alphabet runs Google.\n“If all of the AI momentum suddenly came to a stop in their businesses, they wouldn’t go anywhere,” Sharma said.\nWhat happens if the AI bubble bursts? Analysts warn that ongoing AI jitters will seed volatility in AI stocks, bubble or not. Nvidia’s stock price has seesawed over the course of 2025.\nIf an AI bubble bursts in 2026 or beyond, investors can expect a big drop in some or all of their tech stocks.\nWhen the dot-com bubble burst, in 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ultimately lost more than three quarters of its value. Many dot-com companies went bust. Many big players survived, and their stocks eventually recovered.\nThe same scenario could play out with AI. The key, stock analysts say, is being ready to ride out a bubble.\n“Investors, after being aware of this risk, are deciding to invest for the long term,” Sharma said. “They’re confident that the technology itself is going to produce value.”\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Most investors don't care about the AI bubble\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Should You Buy the Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock of 2025?\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 9:04 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points After a tough start to the year, Alphabet shares rebounded and have outperformed those of its large tech peers.\nThe company's financial results and a favorable outcome to a legal battle had a lot to do with that.\nAlphabet's work in cloud computing and AI should help power strong growth in the next few years.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nThis year wasn't the best for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech -- or tech-adjacent -- companies that are among the largest on the market. The grouping includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) , Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) .\nOnly three of them managed to beat the S&P 500 this year, while the remaining four are below the index year to date. There is one member of this group that left all the others in the dust: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent company are up 63% as I write this, far above the second-best, Nvidia, at 37%. Are Alphabet's shares still attractive heading into 2026?\nWhy Alphabet performed well this year Alphabet actually didn't start the year strong. However, at least two things happened that helped it reverse course. First, Alphabet posted excellent financial results. The company's work in cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) has been tremendously helpful. The tech leader is showing that, despite competition from AI chatbots, it remains the leader in search, while providing in-demand AI services through the cloud.\n\nSecond, Alphabet had a major legal win, or at least, a loss that felt like a win. The tech giant was awaiting a decision from a judge on an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Alphabet was accused of holding a monopoly in internet search, but the company managed to avoid the worst-case scenario of having to divest its Google Chrome browser, an important cog in its advertising machine. With that significant threat out of the way, Alphabet looks unstoppable.\nWhat the future might hold One more reason why Alphabet outperformed its Magnificent Seven peers was that it looked more reasonably valued, at least when considering traditional valuation metrics. That remains the case (check out the charts below), and that's a good reason to be optimistic about the company's medium-term prospects.\nAnd one of Alphabet's most important growth drivers over the next five years will continue to be AI. It isn't just the products it offers through the cloud, or the Gemini 3 subscription available to individuals. Alphabet has implemented AI tools across its business to increase its profitability. For instance, it has improved its search algorithms using AI, as well as added AI mode and AI overviews. These initiatives lead to better results, more search volume, and higher revenue from ads. Alphabet has also used AI to help companies automate ad campaigns, making the process far easier and more productive. This also adds up to more ad revenue for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nOn the other side of the equation, the company uses AI-powered algorithms on platforms like YouTube to recommend content to users, resulting in increased engagement. Beyond AI, Alphabet's Google Cloud division should drive significant revenue growth in the next few years. It's a lower-margin business than advertising, but it is growing much faster right now -- and it likely won't stop anytime soon. As Alphabet stated during its third-quarter earnings conference call, Google Cloud backlog reached $155 billion, representing a 46% increase compared to the second quarter.\n\nAlphabet also pointed out that Cloud operating margins are expanding while the company is signing new customers at a faster rate. And it is doing all this despite stiff competition from two of its Magnificent Seven peers -- Amazon and Microsoft -- both of which have a higher market share.\nIn my view, given the strength of its advertising and cloud computing businesses, Alphabet's shares still look deeply undervalued, especially when considering other growth avenues, such as its growing number of subscriptions, which create a recurring source of revenue. Alphabet still looks attractive heading into the new year. It may or may not be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock of 2026, but it appears likely to outperform the market over the next five years.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?

      "Content": "4 Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 2:43 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nIREN\n\nCRDO\n\nNVDA\n\nBTC-USD\n\nKey Points Palantir and Nvidia are large companies at the forefront of the AI revolution.\nIren Limited is a Bitcoin miner, but it just inked a huge deal with Microsoft to supply cloud computing capacity.\nCredo Technology's wiring solutions may not be sexy, but they help data centers function better.\n10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies ›\n\nOne of the greatest appeals of cryptocurrencies is their massive potential. That market can be very challenging, and investors are often swept away by some of the sudden, huge gains they read about each year. There are dozens of cryptocurrencies with more than a 100% gain in the last seven days.\nHowever, chasing these kinds of gains can be frustrating, as for every success story, there are digital coins that fade away just as quickly, leaving investors with a proverbial pile of dust. It's impossible to predict which cryptocurrencies will be the next big winners and which will vanish into obscurity.\nHowever, you don't need to chase crypto to build wealth. You can find some great companies in the stock market that will give you outsize gains and make crypto investors green with envy. Tech stocks have been some of the best investments you can make in the last year, and I'm expecting that to continue in 2026.\nIf you want explosive growth potential, I'd wager that these four tech stocks are great possibilities -- and all of them have a compelling growth story that makes them superior to cryptocurrencies.\n1. Palantir Technologies It's true that Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) isn't a perfect company. Its valuation is a major concern, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 267 and a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 104 at the time of this writing. Those numbers indicate that for a typical company, these shares are extraordinarily expensive and the stock could be ripe for a correction.\n\nBut Palantir isn't a typical company. The data analytics company is growing fast thanks to its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which allows users to access Palantir's powerful network with minimal training. Palantir saw 63% revenue growth in the third quarter as it closed 204 deals valued at more than $1 million each. It's in high demand among both military and commercial clients.\nPalantir stock is up 155% so far this year -- the third-best performance in the Nasdaq-100 -- and that follows gains of 167% in 2023 and 340% in 2024.\nI would be shocked if Palantir stock doesn't grow another 100% or more in 2026.\n2. Nvidia Semiconductor maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been slowing down as of late -- but who can really expect the stock price to maintain its torrid pace? Nvidia shares rose 819% from 2023 to 2024, and followed that up with a 37% gain in 2025.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are bundled by the thousands in data centers to train and run high-level artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning programs. Nvidia holds a substantial lead in the data center chip market, with estimates ranging from 86% to 92% of its market share. Its huge advantage stems from chip superiority as well as its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) parallel computing architecture that allows developers to write and develop code on Nvidia GPUs.\n\nNvidia reported in its last quarter that it sold out of data center GPUs, and its Blackwell line is flying off the proverbial shelves. When Nvidia rolls out its next-generation architecture Rubin line in 2026, I'm expecting equally strong demand.\n3. Iren Limited We're seeing incredible growth in data centers, and that's going to continue through 2026 and beyond. As more companies develop AI products to help manage their businesses or draw in new customers, there's an increasing demand for data centers to cluster GPUs and run AI programs. Researchers at BloombergNEF estimate that at least 150 data center projects have been announced in the U.S. over the last year, and data center power demand in the U.S. is expected to grow from 25 gigawatts to 106 gigawatts by 2035.\n\nIren Limited (NASDAQ: IREN) has six data centers in Texas and Canada with 2.9 GW of capacity. And it has a new $9.7 billion deal with Microsoft to provide cloud computing capacity using Nvidia GPUs.\nBuilding data centers is really expensive, but Iren has an advantage because it makes most of its money from Bitcoin mining, which allows it to operate at a profit while other data center companies are operating in the red. It made $232.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 from Bitcoin mining, accounting for nearly all of its $240.3 million of total revenue.\nIren gives you the advantage of Bitcoin -- the most stable cryptocurrency -- without holding the coins yourself. And you also get to invest in a tech stock that has its fingers in data center expansion.\n\n4. Credo Technology This one may sound a little out of left field, as Credo Technology (NASDAQ: CRDO) is down 21% since Dec. 22. But I'm confident that this is just temporary weakness, as Credo is an indispensable company for the data center expansion already discussed.\nCredo makes the wiring that links GPUs together in data centers. Instead of traditional wiring, Credo's active electrical cables (AECs) include signal processors that help the data move faster and more efficiently. Management says they are 1,000 times more reliable and consume half the power as optical wiring.\n\nCredo's revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending Nov. 1, 2025) was $268 million, up 272% from a year ago. Income of $82.6 million resulted in earnings of $0.44 per share.\nDespite the recent pullback, Credo stock is up 121% this year and has a strong runway ahead of it.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now? Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

On December 22, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities appeared on a CNBC Television interview to talk about his bull case for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). He says that investors are underestimating Microsoft and Azure growth. ​\n\nIves highlighted that during the last month, the company witnessed a 20% to 25% acceleration in deals, as a result of AI use cases finally exploding. He added that with the company expected to release earnings in January, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a table pounder, and 2026 is its call year. Ives also believes that among hyperscalers, Microsoft has been the most overlooked and least respected.​\nRegarding valuation concerns of the AI hyperscalers and whether Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is immune to these valuation threats, Ives noted that investors are still underestimating the growth numbers. He elaborated that the demand-to-supply ratio stands at 12 to 1, suggesting huge room for growth. Ives believes that the Street is underestimating Microsoft’s 2026 growth figures by at least 15% to 20%. ​\n\nThat said, Dan Ives maintained an Overweight rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a $625 price target, suggesting more than 28% upside from the current level.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

He was 83.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nLondon’s Love of Wood-Burning Stoves Sparks a Pollution Debate\nIBM chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna announced Gerstner’s death in an email sent Sunday to its employees, but didn’t provide a cause of death.\n\nGerstner’s nine-year tenure as chairman and CEO of the company known as “Big Blue” is often used as a case study in corporate leadership.\nOn April Fool’s Day, 1993, he became the first outsider to run IBM, which was facing a choice of bankruptcy or dismemberment after a period when it had been the undisputed leader in personal computers and mainframes. He pivoted the Armonk, New York-based company toward business services and away from hardware production, reversing a move to break up the company into a dozen or more semi-autonomous units — “Baby Blues” — in pursuit of greater profits.\nGerstner slashed costs and sold off unproductive assets, including real estate and IBM’s collection of fine art. He fired 35,000 of the 300,000 employees, who had become accustomed to a culture of lifetime tenure based on principles established by former CEO Thomas Watson Sr. in the early 20th century.\n\nHe stressed company-wide teamwork to replace the tradition of loyalty to various divisions, and he pegged compensation to corporate performance rather than individual results. To meet performance goals, he emphasized regular accountability rather than waiting for yearly performance reviews.\n“People do what you inspect, not what you expect,” he said.\nGerstner’s key change was to scrap IBM’s culture of selling bundled products that only worked with other IBM goods, from PCs to operating systems to software. Products he considered losers were jettisoned. He pulled the plug on OS/2, an operating system intended to challenge Microsoft’s Windows that hadn’t proved popular with customers.\n“His leadership during that period reshaped the company,” Krishna wrote. “Not by looking backward, but by focusing relentlessly on what our clients would need next.”\n\nFocus on Middleware\nIBM put its focus on so-called middleware — software for databases, systems management and transaction management. The company became the impartial integrator for companies’ networks and systems, happy to help whether the hardware used had the IBM name on it or not.\nGerstner made an early bet on the internet and e-business, which he guessed correctly would put less emphasis on personal computers and more on servers, routers and other more sophisticated equipment that would benefit from IBM’s service know-how and involve buyers familiar to IBM’s sales force, such as chief technology officers.\n\nStory Continues\nLater in his tenure, he also made some strategic acquisitions such as the $2.2 billion paid for Lotus Development Corp., whose Notes product was vital for helping IBM customers collaborate on an enterprise-wide basis.\nThe switch in focus from hardware to services resulted in an increase in services revenue from $7.4 billion in 1992 to $30 billion in 2001. IBM’s share price went from $13 to $80 in his nine years as CEO, adjusted for splits,.and IBM’s market value rose from $29 billion to about $168 billion in that period.\n\n“If I had a vote, the most significant legacy of my tenure at IBM would be the truly integrated entity that has been created,” he wrote in (2002). “It certainly was the most difficult and risky change I made.”\nLouis Vincent Gerstner Jr. was born on March 1, 1941, in Mineola, New York, to Louis Gerstner Sr., a milk truck driver, and Marjorie Rutan, a secretary and college administrator. He was one of four brothers.\nHe graduated from Mineola’s Chaminade High School, a competitive Catholic institution. He got an engineering degree from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Harvard University.\nMcKinsey Partner\nAfter Harvard he joined McKinsey & Co. as a consultant. He made partner in four years and spent 12 years there before taking a job with American Express.\n\nHe worked for the credit-card division there, then took over travel-related services. Under his leadership, Amex, which offered primarily a travel card at that point, increased its presence in retail stores and created premium cards that permitted customers to carry unpaid balances.\nWith his way to the top of management at Amex blocked by CEO James D. Robinson III, Gerstner agreed to run RJR Nabisco Inc., where he stayed four years before joining IBM. His primary focus at RJR Nabisco was to reduce the $25 billion in debt produced by the leveraged buyout that created the tobacco and consumer products firm.\nIBM’s board began its search for a new CEO after it forced out John Akers in January 1993, just as the company was reporting its largest annual loss. In selecting Gerstner, the board chose managerial experience over computer expertise. (Gerstner’s brother Richard had worked for IBM for 30 years and headed the division that included personal computers.)\nFrom Gerstner’s first day in April 1993 until the January 2002 announcement that he was stepping down, IBM’s shares rose ninefold while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 154%. Sam Palmisano succeeded him, first as CEO, then as chairman when Gerstner retired at the end of 2002.\nIn 2003, Gerstner became chairman of the Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private-equity firm. He oversaw the firm’s expansion into Asia and Latin America and early preparations for going public, which it did in 2012. He retired in 2008, remaining as a senior adviser.\nWith his wife, Robin, he had two children. Their son, Louis III, died in 2013 after a choking accident in a restaurant.\n\nThrough Gerstner Philanthropies, the family has supported biomedical research, environmental and education programs, and social services in New York City, Boston and Florida’s Palm Beach County. The family has been a longtime supporter of the Mayo Clinic.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nErasing the Verdict: The Ongoing Shock of Trump’s Cocaine Kingpin Pardon\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nThe United States of Klarna\nThat Time I Tried to Buy OpenAI\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Ahead of 2026, According to Wall Street Analysts (Hint: Not Palantir)\n\nTrevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool\nSun, December 28, 2025 at 1:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: PLTR\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Morningstar analysts recently ranked Nvidia and Microsoft as the two best artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now.\nBrian Colello at Morningstar says Nvidia has an economic moat due to its leadership in GPUs, networking, and software tools needed for artificial intelligence.\nDan Romanoff at Morningstar says Microsoft’s cloud computing unit has emerged as a leader in artificial intelligence due to investments in OpenAI.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nPalantir Technologies has been one of the best-performing artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in recent years. Shares have advanced 1,000% since January 2024, but many analysts worry about its valuation. That may explain why Palantir did not appear on Morningstar 's recent list detailing the best AI stocks to buy now.\nInstead, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) took the top two spots, followed by Amazon , Broadcom , and Meta Platforms . But optimism concerning Nvidia and Microsoft is not limited to Morningstar. Most Wall Street analysts believe the stocks are undervalued.\nAmong 69 analysts, Nvidia has a median target price of $250 per share. That implies 31% upside from its current share price of $190.\nAmong 63 analysts, Microsoft has a median target price of $631 per share. That implies 29% upside from its current share price of $488.\nHere's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft.\n1. Nvidia Morningstar analyst Brian Colello writes:\nTo summarize, Nvidia has an important competitive advantage in its full-stack strategy. The company is best known for its GPUs, chips that accelerate demanding data center workloads like AI training and AI inference. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it pairs best-in-class GPUs with CPUs, high-speed interconnects, and networking platforms, such that the company essentially builds entire data centers.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has spent the better part of two decades creating its CUDA software platform, which comprises an unparalleled number of code libraries, pretrained models, and application frameworks that assist developers. While custom AI chips developed by Broadcom may be cheaper, the total cost of ownership is often higher because they lack pre-built software tools.\n\nStory continues\nNvidia has over 90% market share in data center GPUs, a market where sales are projected to grow at 36% annually through 2033, and the company is likely to maintain its dominant position due to its full-stack strategy. Wall Street estimates Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 48% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2028. That makes the current valuation of 47 times earnings look cheap.\n\n2. Microsoft Microsoft is the largest enterprise software company in the world. While best known for Microsoft 365 (a suite that includes office applications like Excel, PowerPoint, and Word), the company also has a strong position in other software verticals, including business intelligence, cybersecurity, and enterprise resource planning.\n\nMicrosoft has added generative AI copilots to several software products and monthly active users surpassed 150 million in the September quarter, up from 100 million in the June quarter. And CEO Satya Nadella told analysts, \"Customers continue to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot faster than any other Microsoft 365 suite. All up, more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.\"\nMeanwhile, Microsoft Azure is the second-largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services sales. \"Azure has several distinct advantages, including that it offers customers a painless way to experiment and move select workloads to the cloud,\" according to Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff. \"Based on its investment in OpenAI, the company has also emerged as a leader in AI.\"\n\nMicrosoft owns a 27% equity stake in OpenAI and it has exclusive rights to the AI start-up's most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 and GPT-5). Also, The Information reports that OpenAI shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft under the agreement. Those payments will top $1 billion this year, up from about $500 million last year, according to TechCrunch.\nWall Street estimates Microsoft's adjusted earnings will increase at 16% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027. That makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look somewhat expensive. But Microsoft topped the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 8% during the last four quarters, which makes the current valuation look more reasonable. Nvidia is still the more attractive option, but I think patient investors should consider buying a small position in both stocks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Watch: DebitMyData Human Energy Grid .\nThe Crisis: Billions Spent, Projects Stalled\nSince 2022, the world’s largest AI companies have pledged more than $200 billion to build data centers powering generative intelligence. Yet projects remain paralyzed across multiple jurisdictions — halted by community opposition, regulatory confusion, and growing fears that “AI progress” benefits only corporations, not citizens.\n\nDebitMyData’s solution reframes the equation.\nBy valuing human participation in data exchange, energy contribution, and consent verification, the Human Energy Grid introduces an economic model where infrastructure growth yields tangible local and individual benefits — aligning corporate expansion with community trust.\n“Before the Genesis Order, we already understood the next frontier,” said Preska Thomas,, Founder and CEO of DebitMyData, Inc. “The challenge isn’t building more compute — it’s building more trust. Without societal consent and economic inclusion, the AI revolution can’t scale sustainably.”\nPhase One: Building the Workforce Trust Layer\nDebitMyData.com serves as the activation point. Through it, the company is organizing and credentialing a next-generation digital workforce — those displaced or at risk from AI automation — into the coming grid economy.\n\nParticipants gain:\nVerified Digital Identities (DID): Anchored in secure, LLM-backed protocols enabling individuals to control, monetize, and consent to their data usage. Watch: DebitMyData Custom Logo and Facial Recognition .\nCreator Economy Readiness:Training and compensation models that align with the future AI-driven labor ecosystem.\n\nStory Continues\nCollective Grid Participation: Future integration into the Human Energy Grid, where digital identity links directly to energy, compute, and compensation systems.\nThis workforce mobilization positions DebitMyData as not just a technology platform, but a human readiness layer—the connective tissue between displaced labor and infrastructure modernization.\n\nPhase Two: Partnering for Ethical Infrastructure\nAs DebitMyData expands the DID and labor participation network, the company is laying the groundwork for the Human Energy Grid, a compliance-ready trust layer for data centers and AI infrastructure providers.\nFor technology giants and developers facing mounting public resistance, Human Energy Grid provides the missing compliance bridge:\nCommunity Consent Intelligence: Blockchain-backed verification that satisfies local governance and environmental mandates.\nPublic Benefit Integration: Energy, water, and data transparency mechanisms that turn traditional opposition into shared prosperity.\nRapid Onboarding:\nDebitMyData’s API and DID infrastructure retrofit easily with existing energy, cloud, and AI systems—no rip-and-replace required.\n\nWe’re creating the social infrastructure that lets hyperscalers build compliantly, governments verify trust transparently, and citizens profit directly from the AI age,” said Founder Preska Thomas. This isn’t just technology—it’s economic realignment.”\nThe Path Forward\nDebitMyData is not waiting for AI to displace millions before responding. It is architecting the response mechanism itself: a data economy that rewards human contribution as much as computational horsepower.\nFor workers,it’s a new revenue channel and pathway back into participation.\nFor governments,it’s a verifiable consent framework.\nFor investors, it’s the foundation of the world’s most scalable ethical infrastructure.\nFor hyperscalers, it’s the bridge from resistance to readiness.\n\nAbout DebitMyData, Inc.\nDebitMyData, Inc. is a U.S.-based technology company building the intersection of AI, energy, and human participation. Its ecosystem—anchored by DebitMyData.com and the forthcoming Human Energy Grid —creates a blueprint for ethical AI expansion, enabling communities, companies, and governments to scale intelligence with trust.\nRegistered with the U.S. government’s SAM system and assigned an official CAGE number, DebitMyData is eligible for federal infrastructure, cybersecurity, and AI trust contracts under the Genesis initiative.\nPress & Partnerships :\nMedia Direct Line: +1-754-315-2420\nEmail press@debitmydata.com\nWebsite: www.debitmydata.com\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/14664b9f-4b0e-40e2-9430-7ff648c8e588\nVideos accompanying this announcement are available at:\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5445850e-9a29-4229-a358-bf2f77778292\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/30effb7b-3512-4ef7-844e-caa2cf59b075\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Prediction: 1 Artificial Intelligence Stock Will Lead the Next Bull Market\n\nMarc Guberti, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IREN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points AI chips are required to power AI tools, but those chips are useless without energy.\nAI data center provider IREN is one of the leaders that recently signed a lucrative deal with Microsoft.\nIREN's AI cloud revenue projections suggest that the company's revenue can surge in the years ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Iren ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the best investing opportunities in recent decades. It combines the excitement of the dot-com bubble with real revenue growth. AI models showed investors how quickly people would adopt AI products and services that could compete with established options like search engines. Now, with humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, and other innovations on the horizon, AI stocks look poised for another rally.\nSemiconductor stocks were the defining group of investments during the first stage of the AI boom, but another group of stocks will be the next winners. Energy is at a premium for AI workloads, and few companies look as compelling as IREN (NASDAQ: IREN) as the next AI rally takes shape.\nEnergy is the new bottleneck Solving any AI bottleneck can result in billions of dollars in annual revenue with skyrocketing prospects. Nvidia continues to prove this truth with impressive revenue growth while becoming the first company to reach a $5 trillion valuation.\nNvidia's AI chips solved a critical part of the AI bottleneck, and energy is next. Nvidia and other tech companies are actively seeking solutions to the power supply gap. Since AI apps require significant energy, there's an energy shortage that few companies can solve. Traditional data centers don't even get the job done, since their infrastructure isn't set up to handle the complex workload of AI software.\n\nThat's why tech giants have turned to AI data center providers that have sufficient energy to meet the demands of AI tools. Some tech leaders are acquiring AI data companies before their value is fully realized. For instance, Alphabet just bought AI data center company Intersect for $4.75 billion. The acquisition demonstrates how much capital Alphabet and its competitors are willing to put into AI data centers like IREN.\nEach contract offers annual recurring revenue IREN's biggest contract came in November, when Microsoft received 200 megawatts of critical IT load. It's a five-year deal that comes to $9.7 billion, or almost $2 billion in annual recurring revenue. IREN also received a 20% prepayment, which will help it fund additional AI data centers.\nIREN has a multi-gigawatt pipeline that can support additional deals. It's reasonable to assume that IREN will secure additional gigawatts in 2026 and build additional sites. IREN co-CEO Dan Roberts said in September that IREN can't meet demand fast enough, which suggests that more sites will be announced in the future.\n\nStory Continues\nEach AI data center can provide multiple deals like the Microsoft one. Billions of dollars in annual recurring revenue make it easier for the company to scale its revenue growth, especially as AI demand continues to grow. IREN can announce another contract like the Microsoft deal and immediately see its annual revenue go up by more than $1 billion per year. Few companies have that type of opportunity to scale quickly.\n\nAI cloud annualized revenue growth is astronomical IREN still makes most of its revenue from crypto mining, but AI infrastructure is the future. That future is coming quite soon, based on IREN's goal of reaching $3.4 billion in AI cloud annualized run-rate revenue by the end of 2026.\nThat's a sizable jump, since AI cloud revenue only came to $16.4 million in fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30. IREN also reported $7.5 million in AI cloud revenue in first-quarter fiscal year 2026, which ended on Sept. 30. A jump to more than $3 billion in annual recurring revenue by the end of 2026 is a massive jump that suggests a high growth rate is still possible in 2027 and beyond.\n\nIREN has a lot of room to expand its annual recurring revenue based on its multi-gigawatt pipeline. The company's ability to build AI data centers on time without missing deadlines will help the company scale its services into additional locations. Chips were the major bottleneck a few years ago, and they're still doing well. Some investors are starting to realize that energy is the new bottleneck, and stocks like IREN can take off as more people recognize that fact.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Iren right now?

      "Content": "4 Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nRachel Warren, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 4:33 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MELI\n\nMSFT\n\nTSM\n\nGOOG\n\nKey Points MercadoLibre is a leader in e-commerce and fintech.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are making waves with their respective AI innovations.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the top chip manufacturer in the world.\n10 stocks we like better than MercadoLibre ›\nInvesting for the long term requires a disciplined and resilient mindset to navigate the inherent volatility of the stock market. Managing the psychology behind your investment decisions is as crucial as selecting the right investments.\n\nThe market price of a stock is often driven by short-term emotions and news, while its true value is tied to the underlying company's long-term earning power and assets. A strong mindset allows you to view temporary price drops as potential buying opportunities for quality assets, not reasons to panic.\nLikewise, if you're focused on the long-term picture, you can select quality businesses with robust fundamentals that make sense as part of your portfolio without being swayed by short-term market volatility. If you have cash to invest in the stock market right now, here are four stocks to consider buying and holding for at least five years.\n1. MercadoLibre MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is the clear e-commerce leader across over a dozen countries in Latin America, including major markets like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. It has a significant competitive advantage over global players like Amazon due to its established presence, brand recognition, and deep understanding of local market needs.\n\nThe company operates a vast tech ecosystem, including its e-commerce marketplace connecting buyers and sellers, which is powered by its integrated fintech arm Mercado Pago, its robust logistics business Mercado Envíos, and advertising services. It's worth noting that Mercado Pago has grown into a full digital financial services platform (e.g., payments, credit, savings, investments) that serves the region's large unbanked population and has created a sticky user base with high monetization potential.\nThe company is consistently profitable and boasts impressive growth metrics. In Q3 2025, it reported a 39% year-over-year revenue increase. Total net revenue reached $7.4 billion. Total payment volume reached $71 billion, up 41% year over year, and gross merchandise volume rose to $16.5 billion, a 28% year-over-year spike.\n\nRobust e-commerce performance in core markets like Brazil and Mexico bolstered MercadoLibre's quarterly performance. And, the number of successful items sold grew by 39% year over year to 635 million. If you want to invest in an e-commerce and fintech giant operating outside the U.S., MercadoLibre is a profitable and compelling leader to consider.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) managed to effectively monetize generative AI faster than most peers by integrating it across its entire tech stack. AI services accounted for roughly 15 percentage points of the total Azure revenue growth in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026. Over 70% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot, which has created a high-margin recurring revenue stream.\n\nThe company is investing heavily in AI capacity, and its capital expenditures have exceeded $30 billion per quarter to meet surging demand. Azure remains a primary catalyst for the business's long-term value and consistently delivers high growth even on a massive revenue base. For the full fiscal year 2025, Microsoft's annual revenue surpassed $281 billion, growing by 15% from the prior year. Azure revenue was more than $75 billion, a 34% increase year over year. Azure holds approximately 20% of the global cloud market.\nMicrosoft maintains one of the strongest balance sheets in the corporate world, which supports its consistent returns to investors. It's one of only two U.S. companies with a perfect AAA credit rating (that's higher than the U.S. government). The company generated over $100 billion in net income in fiscal 2025, so it continues to have massive flexibility for R&D and acquisitions.\n\nMicrosoft has raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years and regularly repurchases billions in stock (it returned almost $11 billion to shareholders in the most recent quarter alone through dividends and share repurchases). Management and analysts have set ambitious targets for the next five years. CEO Satya Nadella aims to exceed $500 billion in annual revenue by 2030, nearly double its current scale.\n3. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is deeply integrating powerful AI models like Gemini across its massive ecosystem (e.g, Search, YouTube, Cloud). AI improves its search relevance, makes YouTube more engaging, and personalizes user experiences, which in turn can drive better engagement and more ad dollars. Instead of cannibalizing search, Alphabet's new tools like AI summaries are increasing ad impressions and conversions, and expanding its commercial pathways in search.\n\nAlphabet is also leveraging its custom TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) semiconductor chips to compete in cloud infrastructure. While historically the company had reserved most TPUs for in-house use and cloud services, it has recently begun selling some directly to third parties in specific bilateral deals. These include major AI clients like Anthropic as Alphabet creates a new high-margin revenue stream.\nAlphabet's TPUs are revolutionary, particularly because they are application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) purpose-built for the core mathematical operations of deep learning applications. This specialized design provides significant advantages in performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness at scale compared to the more general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs). Revenue from TPUs is a key driver of the overall Google Cloud segment's growth, which generated robust Q3 2025 revenue of $15.2 billion, a 34% year-over-year increase.\n\nAnalysts from firms like Morgan Stanley project that expanded external sales could add billions in new revenue to Alphabet's top line in the coming years (an estimated $13 billion for every 500,000 units sold by 2027). AI could also unlock opportunities in robotics (Waymo), healthcare, and enterprise solutions outside of Alphabet's traditional advertising and cloud businesses. Alphabet's strong balance sheet with substantial cash and low debt, and a generous history of providing enviable returns to shareholders, are icing on the cake for long-term investors in this storied business.\n4. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) or TSMC is the undisputed leader in semiconductor manufacturing and controls roughly 70% of the global foundry market. Unlike investing in a single chip designer, holding TSMC can allow investors to profit regardless of who wins the AI race. And the reality is that there will likely be many winners as the AI revolution heats up.\n\nThe demand for AI computing power is soaring, and only a few companies possess the capabilities to design the required chips. All major AI players -- including Nvidia , Apple , and Broadcom -- rely on TSMC to build their most advanced chips. The company produces at least 90% of the world's most advanced chips, which has created a massive technological moat that competitors like Intel and Samsung are currently struggling to bridge.\nManagement expects AI-related revenue to grow at a more than 40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. TSMC had a very strong Q3 2025 financially and beat expectations with both record profits and revenue. Substantial and growing demand for AI chips and high-performance computing (HPC) drove revenue up over 30% year over year. Net income surged 40% year over year, and TSMC's gross margin improved to 59.5%.\n\nTSMC is aggressively expanding its manufacturing footprint outside of Taiwan. The company has committed $165 billion to build six advanced fabs in Arizona, with the first already being in volume production. Additional major investments are underway in Japan and Germany, and management aims to have 30% of its most advanced capacity located outside Taiwan by 2028. Shares are up about 40% year to date, and it may be wise to scoop some up before the business soars higher.\nShould you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?

      "Content": "Billionaire Chase Coleman Has Formed His Own \"Magnificent Seven\" and It's Even Better Than the Original\n\nKeithen Drury, The Motley Fool\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 9:57 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nTSLA\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Apple and Tesla are excluded from the new grouping.\nBroadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor are key additions.\nProspects for Coleman's new grouping look promising.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is a common grouping of stocks used to describe some of the largest and most influential stocks in the market today. The Magnificent Seven consists of these familiar names:\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\nHowever, billionaire hedge fund manager Chase Coleman has created an alternative Magnificent Seven, and I think it's even better than the original. Which companies were cut and which ones were added? Let's take a look.\nAI is the theme in the new Magnificent Seven Investors have access to what hedge fund managers own. This is thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement that managers with $100 million or more in assets must disclose their end-of-quarter holdings to the public 45 days after the quarter ends in a Form 13F . While this isn't up-to-date information, it's better than nothing.\n\nIn Tiger Global Management's third-quarter portfolio, we can see that Chase Coleman has heavily positioned his portfolio to take advantage of the massive artificial intelligence buildout. Some of his major holdings are:\nMicrosoft (10.5% of portfolio)\nAlphabet (8% of portfolio)\nAmazon (7.5% of portfolio)\nNvidia (6.8% of portfolio)\nMeta Platforms (6.4% of portfolio)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (4% of portfolio)\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) (3% of portfolio)\nAltogether, these stocks make up 46.2% of Coleman's portfolio, which is a massive concentration. However, the track record of each company speaks for itself, and all of these have been great investments over the past few years.\nWhat's notable is that Apple and Tesla aren't included. I think there are a few reasons why, and I like the inclusion of Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom over these two in the new Magnificent Seven.\n\nApple lacks an AI focus, and Tesla's business model took a hit this year Apple has been a notable AI laggard in recent years. Its AI technology is really non-existent, and many of the features Apple promised users years ago still haven't been released. The only step left is for Apple to become a client of one of the major generative AI providers, which doesn't bode well for the future.\nFurthermore, Apple is surviving on past innovations, and hasn't released anything groundbreaking in the past few years. All the companies on this list have had incredible results, leaving Apple in the dust in terms of growth.\n\nStory Continues\nTesla is a bit different. It has an AI strategy for implementing self-driving capabilities in its cars. It also has a close partnership with xAI, another one of Elon Musk's companies. I think it shouldn't be excluded from the new Magnificent Seven based on AI alone.\nYet, it's impossible to ignore the shifting landscape in Tesla's primary market. Electric vehicles aren't as hot as they used to be, and with U.S. government subsidies ending, they aren't as attractive to consumers. This isn't to say the EV market is dead, but growth will be more difficult to come by in the future.\n\nAn investment in Tesla is a bet that its various aspirations, like robotaxis and humanoid robots, will be successful. These are far from surefire bets, unlike the other seven companies that are making money right now.\nTaiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom are great inclusions, as they are each thriving in the AI market. They are also large businesses, with Broadcom and Tesla often swapping places as the seventh and eighth largest companies, while Taiwan Semiconductor is the 10th largest in the world at a $1.5 trillion market cap.\nBroadcom is competing in the AI race with its custom AI accelerator chips, which are starting to grow in popularity as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Taiwan Semiconductor is a key provider of chips to nearly every company on this list. As long as more data centers keep being built, Taiwan Semiconductor will be an excellent stock pick.\n\nI'm confident that Chase Coleman's new Magnificent Seven will outperform the old Magnificent Seven in 2026. I think investors should consider moving on from Apple and Tesla and into Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor, as they are better positioned for the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,470 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,167,988 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 991 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 196% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "I pioneered machine teaching at Microsoft. Building AI agents is like building a basketball team, not drafting a player\n\nKence Anderson\nSat, December 27, 2025 at 6:05 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nCRM\n\nSalesforce&#8217;s latest agent testing/builder too l and Jeff Bezos’s new AI venture focused on practical industrial applications of AI show that enterprises are inching towards autonomous systems. It&#8217;s meaningful progress because robust guardrails, testing and evaluation are the foundation of agentic AI. But the next step that’s largely missing right now is practice, giving teams of agents repeated, structured experience. As the pioneer of Machine Teaching, a methodology for training autonomous systems that has been deployed across several Fortune 500 companies, I’ve experienced the impact of agent practice while building and deploying over 200 autonomous multi-agent systems at Microsoft and now at AMESA for enterprises around the globe.\n\nEvery CEO investing in AI faces the same problem: spending billions on pilots that may or may not deliver real autonomy. Agents seem to excel in demos but stall when real-world complexity hits. As a result, business leaders do not trust AI to act independently on billion-dollar machinery or workflows. Leaders are searching for the next phase of AI’s capability: true enterprise expertise. We shouldn’t ask how much knowledge an agent can retain, but rather if it has had the opportunity to develop expertise by practicing as humans do.\nThe Testing Illusion Just as human teams develop expertise through repetition, feedback and clear roles, AI agents must develop skills inside realistic practice environments with structured orchestration. Practice is what turns intelligence into reliable, autonomous performance.\nMany enterprise leaders still assume that a few major LLM companies will develop powerful enough models and massive data sets to manage complex enterprise operations end-to-end via “Artificial General Intelligence.”\n\nBut that isn’t how enterprises work.\nNo critical process, whether it be supply chain planning or energy optimization, is run by one person with one skill set. Think of a basketball team. Each player needs to work on their skills, whether it be dribbling or jump shot, but each player also has a role on the team. A center’s purpose is different from a point guard&#8217;s. Teams succeed with defined roles, expertise and responsibilities. AI needs that same structure.\nEven if you did create the perfect model or reach AGI, I’d predict the agents would still fail in production because they never encountered variability, drift, anomalies, or the subtle signals that humans navigate every day. They haven’t differentiated their skill sets or learned when to act or pause. They also haven’t been exposed to expert feedback loops that shape real judgment.\n\nStory continues\nHow Machine Teaching Creates Practice Machine Teaching provides the structure that modern agentic systems need. It guides agents to:\nPerceive the environment correctly.\nMaster basic skills that mirror human operators.\nLearn higher-level strategies that reflect expert judgment.\nCoordinate under a supervisor agent that selects the right strategy at the right time.\n\nTake one Fortune 500 company I worked with that was improving a nitrogen manufacturing process. Our agents practiced inside the AMESA Agent Cloud, improving through experimentation and feedback. In less than one day, the agent teams outperformed a custom-built industrial control system that other automation tools and single-agent AI applications could not match.\nThis resulted in an estimated $1.2 million in annual efficiency gains , and more importantly, gave leadership the confidence to deploy autonomy at scale because the system behaved like their best operators.\nWhy CEOs and Leaders Need Practiced AI Practice is what drives true autonomy in agents. I invite every leader to begin reframing a few assumptions:\nStop thinking in terms of models and think in terms of teams. Every day interactions with systems like ChatGPT or Claude are powerful, but they reinforce a misconception that large language models are the path to enterprise autonomy. Autonomy emerges from specialized agents that take on perception, control, planning and supervisory roles through a wide variety of technologies.\nIdentify where expertise is disappearing and preserve it within agents. Many essential operations rely on experts who are nearing retirement. CEOs should ask which processes would be most vulnerable if these experts left tomorrow. Those areas are the ideal starting point for a Machine Teaching approach. Let your top operators teach a team of agents in a safe practice environment so that their expertise becomes scalable and permanent.\nRecognize that you already have the infrastructure for autonomy. Years of investment in sensors, MES and SCADA systems, ERP integrations and IoT telemetry already form your organization’s backbone of digital twins and high-fidelity simulations. Success requires orchestration, structure, and leveraging the data foundation you already built.\n\nThe Payoff of Practice When enterprises give agents room to practice before deployment, several things happen:\nHuman teams begin to trust the AI and understand its boundaries.\nLeaders can calculate true ROI rather than speculative projections.\nAgents become safer, more consistent and aligned with expert judgment.\nHuman teams are elevated rather than replaced because AI now understands their workflows and supports them.\nAgents won’t truly perform without experience, and experience only comes from practice. The companies that invest in and embrace this framing will be the ones to break out of pilot purgatory and see real impact.\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune .\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

But Baird Tech Strategist Ted Mortonson is warning that a \"tremendous amount of volatility\" could be coming to the AI trade next year. He also explains why some portfolio managers may have to sell shares of some tech companies if AI giants like Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) go public in 2026 .\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Ted\nRight now, I think if you look at 26, we're going to have a tremendous amount of volatility. The AI trade is very well understood, at least through my client base with\n00:20 Ted\nthe you look at the infrastructure build really outpacing enterprise uh adoption. And that's the issue. Uh we're going to spend at a 40% clip here for the next couple years. Uh the Sox is up, the semiconductor index is up uh almost 48% year to date. And if you look at the IGV or the software index that's been the big laggard, only up 7.8%. So all I think of this is understood. As we uh as we look into 26, there's there's three issues that I'm uh looking at very, very closely and we can go in that if you'd like to.\n00:54 Speaker B\nYeah, I'd like to go into that. And maybe Ted, on that on that point you just brought up, I just want to drill into that. This this mismatch as you say between the the data center build out and the the real enterprise AI adoption. When would you expect Ted then to see that enterprise AI adoption story play out? Is is is that a 2026 story, Ted? Is it 2027? What do you think?\n01:21 Ted\nRight now, that's a it's hard to nail down, but I don't think it's 26. The enterprise, there's only roughly 30% of the Global 2000 that's ready to move to Gen AI. 70% is still going through data cloud migration and uh data cleansing to get into an LLM. So, we've got, you know, enterprise it always takes so much longer than the street is looking at. That mismatch probably goes into 27, 28 is my guess.\n01:54 Speaker B\nAnd and how what are the signs and signals Ted as investors I would be looking for to say, okay, now we're really saying seeing AI monetization, not just AI marketing. I mean, am I looking at software spend? Am I watching the cloud businesses? Like what should I be looking for, Ted?\n02:22 Ted\nI think I think it's it's well understood that the cloud Titans are going to see it in token growth as well as just their their overall cloud growth. Where I think it's really instrumental to see enterprise adoption is uh via your last few guests, is in the software area. Specifically on the agentic plays, whether it be, you know, a CRM, a ServiceNow, a hubspot, um, you know, and then the whole security sector is moving to AI. I think if you see robust, um, uh net new ARR, that's that's going to be a very good indication of enterprise uh adoption.\n03:22 Speaker B\nYou you another theme Ted, I want your take on which you wrote about was obviously, you know, the massive uh CAPEX by tech giants. But of course we've seen these concerns creeping up at least with some names Ted, financial stress, you know, debt loads, and I'm just curious how you're thinking through that dynamic.\n03:52 Ted\nWell, my clients do not want to play names that are negative free cash flow. Uh this is one of these cycles because of this mismatch in infrastructure, it's very capital intensive on this infrastructure build. So the only real names that really have the the the businesses behind it to really uh fund the capX is Microsoft and Google and that you know, Google's up 87% uh year to date. Um so with with that, um I I think uh there's a propensity to just watch and have some dry powder. Um I don't have a lot of interest in some of the negative free cash flow names at this point. And it's obvious I think as we go forward that you're getting indications that whether it be Anthropic or whether it be Open AI or SpaceX, that the debt market is tapped and the it's not big enough quite frankly to fund the infrastructure build. So all of these next generation companies are going to have to tap the equity market. And my worry there is very simple after doing this for a few decades is when you have four or five major tech companies that have to raise just a boatload of capital. Open AI has been rumored a hundred billion dollars. My worry is that we get some time in the in in 26 where all these guys come public at the same time and we drain quote unquote the equity liquidity lake, if you will. And my PMs are going to be forced to sell some of their winners to to fund some of these uh positions in these new companies.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Don't Buy Lumen Technologies Stock Until Reality Backs Up the Hype\n\nStefon Walters, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 11:07 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: LUMN\n\nMSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Lumen is pivoting from a telecom company to an artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure provider.\nA heavy debt load is restricting Lumen's ability to invest in other business areas.\nThe company doesn't expect to grow its top line again until 2028.\n10 stocks we like better than Lumen Technologies ›\n\nFormerly known as telecom company CenturyLink, Lumen Technologies (NYSE: LUMN) has been in the midst of a rebrand and pivot since 2020 amid the artificial intelligence (AI) boom . Like many AI stocks this year, Lumen has put up market-beating returns: It's up 38% through Dec. 22, compared to the S&P 500 's gain of 17%.\nDespite the stock's recent success, let me be the first to say this to prospective investors: Wait until reality matches the hype before putting money into Lumen.\nThe hype surrounding Lumen Technologies A lot of the hype surrounding Lumen revolves around the deals it has struck with companies like Microsoft and Alphabet . The terms of these deals make Lumen a major provider of networking capabilities for these companies. On the surface, they look like significant wins for the business -- especially as AI infrastructure spending increases.\n\nAccording to Lumen CEO Kate Johnson, the company is \"building the backbone of the AI economy.\"\nThe reality of Lumen Technologies' business But when you pull back the curtain on the headlines and look into Lumen's finances, there are causes for pause. To begin with, Lumen has over $17.5 billion in long-term debt, which is more than double its nearly $8 billion market cap at the time of this writing. It was able to refinance $2.4 billion of that debt, saving it $135 million in annual interest, but it still expects to pay over $1 billion in interest this year alone.\nTake into account Lumen's debt, interest obligations, and the fact that it lost $621 million in the third quarter on $3.08 billion in revenue, and it's clear that it's burning through cash faster than its AI ambitions are paying off.\nLumen's losses are expected to continue. On the company's latest earnings call, management said it didn't expect to get back to revenue growth until 2028. And operating at a loss isn't always a red flag because many growth stocks follow that model for a time as they prioritize expanding their top lines before shifting focus to profits.\nHowever, in Lumen's case, it's not a new start-up building from scratch. It's a company that has been around since 1968, trying to pivot from a struggling legacy business into a high-growth industry while accumulating a lot of debt along the way.\n\nStory Continues\nSure, aiming to be the \"backbone of the AI economy\" sounds enticing, but investors shouldn't take those words to heart until Lumen shows it can sustain profitability and chip away at the massive debt load that's holding it back from making key investments in other areas.\nShould you buy stock in Lumen Technologies right now? Before you buy stock in Lumen Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lumen Technologies wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "Amazon vs. Microsoft: Which Stock Is a Better Buy for 2026 and Beyond?\n\nDaniel Sparks, The Motley Fool\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 2:26 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Amazon and Microsoft have both seen their cloud revenue growth accelerate recently.\nBoth companies are spending massive sums of money to capture soaring demand for AI computing.\nOne stock's valuation arguably looks more attractive.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) enter 2026 with the same headline tailwind: enterprises are rebuilding their tech stacks around cloud computing and generative AI (artificial intelligence) . Even more, they have similar headwinds: the capital-intensive nature of building out AI infrastructure -- and more AI demand than they can handle (or is that a tailwind?).\nRegardless, these are two great companies with stocks likely to perform well over the long haul, but one looks slightly more attractive than the other.\nAmazon: More than an e-commerce business If you think Amazon is primarily an e-commerce business, think again.\nThe company's third-quarter net sales rose 13% year over year to $180.2 billion, while operating income came in at $17.4 billion -- and AWS (Amazon's cloud business, called Amazon Web Services) alone produced $11.4 billion of that operating income.\n\nEven more, this lucrative cloud business is seeing accelerating growth. AWS revenue increased 20% year over year to $33.0 billion in the third quarter. That is a clear step up from the 17.5% AWS growth Amazon posted in the second quarter.\nAnd it gets better. Amazon has another fast-growing profit lever beyond e-commerce: advertising. The company's third-quarter advertising services revenue rose 24% year over year in Q3.\nBut free cash flow is moving in the wrong direction. Amazon's trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased to $130.7 billion in Q3, yet free cash flow fell from $47.7 billion to $14.8 billion as capital spending rose.\nMicrosoft: a fast-growing software giant In a win for Microsoft over Amazon, its overall business is growing faster. The software giant's revenue grew 18% year over year to $77.7 billion, and operating income rose 24% to $38.0 billion.\nLike Amazon, Microsoft's cloud business is the primary driver behind the tech company's growth. Microsoft cloud revenue, for instance, grew 26% year over year to $49.1 billion. With that said, Microsoft's cloud business includes more than cloud computing. It's made up of Microsoft 365, Commercial Cloud, Azure, Dynamics 365, commercial revenue from LinkedIn, and more. Still, Azure (Microsoft's could computing business) is a key driver for Microsoft's overall cloud revenue. The company's \"Azure and other cloud services\" revenue increased 40% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.\n\nStory Continues\nIt's not surprising that, like Amazon, Microsoft is investing heavily in AI-capable cloud computing. The company is not only seeing growing demand from Azure customers looking for AI computing, but it is also integrating AI across its products and services.\n\"Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high-value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings release. \"It's why we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.\"\n\nThe tiebreaker So, Microsoft may be growing faster than Amazon. However, Amazon's AWS is the leading cloud infrastructure platform -- a position that may make its recent aggressive investments less of a gamble for its shareholders. Whatever the case, both companies notably have diversified businesses and have enough excess capital to invest heavily in the AI boom to capture any opportunities.\n\nThe tiebreaker probably ultimately boils down to valuation. Amazon's forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 28 is slightly below Microsoft's of about 31, giving it the edge (albeit a small one) in a head-to-head comparison.\nSo, if I had to choose a winner here, I'd choose Amazon. That's arguably the better of the two stocks for 2026 and beyond.\nOf course, there are risks for both stocks. The main one is that both companies' huge spending on AI computing doesn't pay off in the revenue and profits that management anticipates. Investors should keep a close eye on these evolving risks; if the AI boom fizzles out, investors may have to reassess whether these stocks deserve the premium valuations they currently have. But, ultimately, these are two stocks I believe will do well over the long haul.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that these stocks will almost certainly trade with meaningful volatility, given the constantly changing nature of their industries and their stocks' premium valuations. Investors who think Amazon or Microsoft look attractive today, therefore, should consider keeping any position in these stocks small, given the risks.

      "Content": "NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal Is a Warning Shot to AI Rivals\n\nJeffrey Neal Johnson, MarketBeat\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 12:12 PM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nAMD\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points NVIDIA has solidified its leadership position by securing the industry's fastest inference technology to power real-time artificial intelligence applications.\nThe company used its substantial free cash flow to fund this strategic expansion while also returning capital to investors through a cash dividend.\nThis strategic move effectively neutralizes potential competition by integrating top engineering talent and proprietary technology into the NVIDIA ecosystem.\nInterested in NVIDIA Corporation? Here are five stocks we like better.\n\nWhile the markets were quiet for the post-Christmas trading session, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) made a noise that will echo for years. The company announced a definitive agreement to pay approximately $20 billion in cash to license the technology and hire the core engineering team of AI chip startup Groq.\nThe timing of this announcement is poetic. On the very day NVIDIA is distributing its quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share to loyal shareholders, it is aggressively reinvesting its massive cash pile to secure its future dominance. The market reaction has been swift and bullish. NVIDIA shares climbed roughly 1.5% following the news, trading in the $188 to $191 range. This move pushes the company’s market capitalization firmly past the $4.6 trillion milestone.\n\n→ Why Kratos and AeroVironment Are Suddenly Moving Like Tech Stocks\nWall Street’s reaction reflects a clear consensus: this is not just a purchase; it is a fortification. By securing the fastest chip technology in the market, NVIDIA is widening its competitive moat against rivals like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD). This deal helps ensure that NVIDIA remains the only game in town for the next phase of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\nHow Groq Solves NVIDIA’s Speed Limit To understand why NVIDIA would spend $20 billion on a startup, investors must first understand how the AI market changed in 2025. For the last three years, the industry focused on Training. This is the process of teaching an AI model, which requires massive amounts of raw computing power to crunch data. NVIDIA’s Blackwell and Hopper GPUs were perfect for this heavy lifting.\n\n→ These 3 Household Names Are Flashing Rare Oversold Signals\nHowever, late in 2025, the market reached a tipping point known as the Inference Flip. Global revenue from using AI models (Inference) officially surpassed the revenue from building them (Training). While training is a one-time event, inference is a continuous, 24/7 utility, much like electricity. Every time a user asks a chatbot a question or a robot moves, that is an inference event.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Speed Problem As AI moves into real-time applications like voice assistants and humanoid robotics, speed becomes the critical metric. This created a vulnerability for NVIDIA because its chips were designed for size rather than speed.\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 12/22 - 12/26\nThe Freight Train: NVIDIA’s GPUs are like massive freight trains. They have an incredible capacity to haul data, but they take time to get up to speed. They are optimized for throughput (volume), not instant speed.\nThe Formula 1 Car: Groq’s technology, known as the Language Processing Unit (LPU), is built differently. It is like a Formula 1 car, lightweight and capable of instant acceleration.\n\nThe Benchmark Gap Data shows that Groq’s LPUs can process between 300 and 500 tokens per second on standard models like Llama 2. In comparison, a standard GPU setup typically manages around 100 tokens per second. By absorbing this technology, NVIDIA ensures it owns the fastest solution for the fastest-growing segment of the market. This also addresses a total cost of ownership risk; because Groq chips are faster, they use less energy per task, which appeals to cost-conscious data centers.\n\nThe Smartest Deal in Tech: How NVIDIA Avoided the FTC In today's strict regulatory environment, a standard merger between a $4.6 trillion giant and a rising competitor would likely be blocked by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Regulators are wary of monopolies buying up their rivals. NVIDIA’s management navigated this risk by structuring the deal as a reverse acqui-hire and a non-exclusive licensing agreement rather than a traditional corporate acquisition.\n\nHow the Deal Works: Licensing: NVIDIA pays for the right to use Groq’s intellectual property in perpetuity, but Groq retains theoretical ownership.\nHiring: NVIDIA hires the majority of Groq’s engineering staff and leadership.\nIndependence: The Groq corporate entity technically remains independent, avoiding the mandatory antitrust waiting periods required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act.\n\nThis structure mirrors successful strategies recently employed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). It allows NVIDIA to integrate the technology immediately without getting bogged down in 18 to 24 months of litigation. This speed of execution is a major bullish signal for the stock, as it prevents competitors from catching up while the deal is stuck in court.\nA Blow to Rivals Perhaps the most valuable asset in this deal is the human capital. NVIDIA has hired Jonathan Ross, the founder of Groq. Before starting Groq, Ross invented the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) at Google. By bringing Ross into the fold, NVIDIA has effectively neutralized a key competitor and deprived Google, its biggest rival in custom silicon, of the talent that built its foundation.\n\nThe Buy vs. Build Calculation: Why This Deal Was Cheap A $20 billion price tag is massive for most companies, but for NVIDIA, it represents a highly efficient use of capital. Investors should view this through the lens of buy vs. build. Could NVIDIA have built this technology itself? Likely yes. But it would have taken three to four years of research and development. In the fast-moving world of AI, three years is an eternity. By spending cash now, NVIDIA buys time.\n\nBy the Numbers: Free Cash Flow: In the third quarter alone, NVIDIA generated $22.1 billion in free cash flow. Effectively, the company paid for this entire strategic expansion with just three months of cash generation.\nShareholder Rewards: As a testament to this financial strength, NVIDIA is paying out its quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share today , Dec. 26. This proves that the company can fund massive growth while rewarding shareholders simultaneously.\n\nValuation Perspective Despite the stock trading near all-time highs, analysts argue that the valuation is reasonable given the growth potential. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of approximately 23x. This is significantly lower than its trailing P/E of around 52x, suggesting that earnings are growing fast enough to justify NVIDIA’s current stock price. By securing the Groq technology, NVIDIA protects these future earnings from competitive erosion.\n\nNVIDIA’s Evolution Into the OS of AI This transaction serves as a powerful reminder that NVIDIA is evolving. It is no longer just a hardware vendor; it is becoming the inevitable operating system for the entire AI economy.\nLooking ahead, investors can expect NVIDIA to integrate Groq’s low-latency technology into its upcoming Rubin architecture and its robotics initiative, Project GR00T . With fourth-quarter r evenue guidance projected at $65 billion , the company’s fundamentals remain flawless. This deal silences the bear case that competitors would eventually catch up in speed. For investors, the thesis remains intact: NVIDIA is building the foundation for the future of artificial intelligence.\nThe article \" NVIDIA’s $20B Groq Deal Is a Warning Shot to AI Rivals \" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Things have only gone downhill for the stock as Wall Street began doubting the story.\nORCL stock has plummeted by over 40% from its peak after Q2 earnings. FY 2026 earnings disappointed investors. Analysts began piling concerns about how overextended data center spending was and whether it was even sustainable for Oracle to fund the growth. Investors baked in a valuation that would only make sense if Oracle managed to grow at a blistering pace for years with ever-growing margins.\nBut now that ORCL stock is down from its peak, should you buy the dip or jump ship? Let's first take a look at what's wrong here.\n\nWhy investors are dumping ORCL stock Investors' pet peeve with Oracle is that the funding is proving to be quite unreliable. News came out that Blue Owl Capital was withdrawing from its funding commitments, meaning that Oracle's $10 billion Michigan data center was in jeopardy. Oracle denied this and said that the news reports were \"incorrect\". Oracle's Partner, Related Digital, said that Blue Owl did not withdraw unequivocally and that the company still had others willing to fund the project.\n\nIn any case, this has thrown sand into the gears. Q2 FY 2026 didn't help, either.\nIt invited a fresh wave of criticism after Oracle reported $16.06 billion in revenue, up 14.22% year-over-year. This missed the estimates by $134.2 million. EPS did beat estimates by a wide margin, but this was due to a one-time boost from Oracle selling its Ampere stake.\nThe Wall Street Journal pointed to another \"squishy number\" that investors are paying more attention to as Oracle's story looks more brittle. Remaining performance obligations (RPOs) have surged to $523 billion. What are these RPOs? Sales that management believes are probable. Half a trillion dollars of \"probable\" sales looked more or less guaranteed a few months back. But with that Blue Owl debacle and the AI buildout catching more flak, Wall Street is less willing to price that in.\n\nStory Continues\nTime to go bottom fishing with ORCL stock? If those RPOs do convert to sales, the picture looks rosier than ever, but it's still worth keeping in mind how quickly things can go wrong. For example, Oracle has a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, set to begin in 2027.\nIf the AI train continues full steam ahead, maybe it's possible that OpenAI will be able to spend $300 billion on Oracle cloud compute resources over five years, as per the agreement. I don't believe that \"maybe\" will translate into reality, as OpenAI does not have $300 billion.\n\nPer Oracle, they expect to grow Cloud Infrastructure revenue \"...77% to $18 billion this fiscal year—and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years.\" The majority of Oracle's promised revenue generation over the coming fiscal years is expected to be from OpenAI.\nFor this to happen, we need to assume that OpenAI has the money ready and that Oracle can finish its data centers in time. The first one is unthinkable, since OpenAI is falling behind other AI competitors and expects to be deep in the red until at least 2029. The latter argument is already crumbling, with Oracle delaying \"some\" data center projects for OpenAI to 2028.\nWhat you're actually betting on, and why I wouldn't take the bet Buying Oracle stock is now essentially a bet on OpenAI and its commitments. I do not believe that OpenAI will be able to buy $300 billion worth of compute over the agreement period. OpenAI won't be on the hook and can cancel or downsize the agreement, with Oracle's shareholders taking most of the blow.\n\nWeather, extreme demand, and finicky data center funding will inevitably push deadlines, too.\nIf you do want to bet on AI and data centers, you're better off buying Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , or Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) instead. They aren't as dependent on RPO figures from one startup.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Adobe Stock Rides on Expanding Partner Base: Is There More Upside?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:40 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: ADBE\n\nGOOGL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAdobe ’s ADBE prospects are expected to benefit from an expanding partner base that includes the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Copilot, Google Gemini, HUMAIN, OpenAI and others. ADBE’s Firefly, Express and Creative Cloud applications currently integrate models from partners, including Google, OpenAI, Black Forest Labs, Luma, Runway, Topaz Labs and Eleven Labs.\n\nAdobe’s launch of Premiere Mobile in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 strengthened its footprint as a leading provider of next-generation AI video editing. The company announced a partnership with Google and YouTube, which is helping creators receive Adobe Premiere’s video editing tools in a new content creation space called Create for YouTube Shorts at the Premiere mobile app. Expansion of ad network partnerships with Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Snap and TikTok is a key catalyst for Adobe.\n\nThe company has recently entered into a strategic partnership with Runaway, where ADBE will utilize Runaway’s video technology, along with its own creative tools, to develop the next generation of video workflows. Adobe will be Runaway’s preferred API creativity partner, which will help ADBE’s customers get access to Runaway’s latest models. Its latest models, including Runaway’s new GEN-4.5, which are available only in Adobe Firefly, will be available to all ADBE’s clients.\n\nApart from an expanding partner base, Adobe’s strategy of infusing AI into its portfolio is driving growth, as reflected by the fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results. Adobe exited the year with annual recurring revenues (ARR) of $25.2 billion, indicating 11.5% year-over-year growth, and management expects it to continue to rise to $25.6 at the end of fiscal 2026. The Semrush acquisition is expected to further boost Adobe’s ARR growth.\n\nAdobe Faces Tough Competition in the AI Domain ADBE’s AI business is minuscule compared with Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenues are benefiting from growth in Azure AI services and a rise in the AI Copilot business. Microsoft now has 900 million monthly active users of AI features across its products, with over 150 million monthly active users of first-party Copilots. More than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, with major customers deploying tens of thousands of seats.\n\nAlphabet’s focus on leveraging AI to drive growth is a key catalyst. AI is infused heavily across its offerings, including Search and Google Cloud. AI Overviews and AI Mode are driving overall queries and commercial queries. AI Mode is now available in more than 40 languages globally and has more than 75 million daily active users.

The stock market was driven higher by the strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI), which led tech stocks to new highs. While the year was beneficial for investors who held tech stocks, 2026 may not be a repeat. There are terrific tech companies, but there’s no guarantee that the sector will continue to thrive next year. This is where exchange-traded funds come into play.\nIf you do not want to risk owning specific tech stocks, you can consider investing in tech ETFs that give you the best of the industry. These ETFs are heavily tech-focused, have a low expense ratio, and hold companies that are backed by healthy fundamentals. iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ( IGV ), Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF ( NYSE: VGT ), and Invesco QQQ Trust ( NASDAQ:QQQ ) are 3 ETFs to load up on before 2026.\n\niShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF tracks the performance of the index composed of North American equities in the software industry. The fund invests in a lot of high-quality companies that have shown strong revenue growth and solid margins.\nThe fund holds 115 stocks and has an expense ratio of 0.39%. While it is slightly on the higher side, IGV has a portfolio of the biggest tech giants. Its top 10 holdings include Microsoft Corporation, Palantir Technologies, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce, AppLovin, ServiceNow, and Adobe. It has the highest allocation in Palantir Technologies and Microsoft Corporation.\n\nThe top 10 holdings form 62% of the fund. Sector-wise, the fund invests heavily in application software (62.78%), followed by systems software (33.45%) and interactive home (2.82%).\nIGV is an investment in enterprise automation, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and AI productivity tools. With this ETF, you’re investing in the software segment of the industry. The fund has generated a total return of 28.64% in one year and 31.95% in 3 years. IGV gained 8.17% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $108.07. The software industry has lagged in 2025, and we could see a significant improvement in the coming year. IGV is an excellent way to buy the dip in the software industry.\n\nStory Continues\nVanguard Information Technology ETF If you think that the U.S. economy will continue to be driven by the tech sector, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF could be an ideal bet. It is exactly what a growth investor is looking for. The fund focuses on a little over 300 companies and includes all the mega-cap names. VGT is focused on top-quality mega-cap tech giants that have shown impressive growth in 2025.\n\nIt has the highest allocation to the semiconductor industry at 32.10%, followed by systems software at 18.20% and hardware storage at 17.70%. The top 10 holdings of the fund include Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Palantir Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices, Oracle, and Broadcom. It has the highest allocation of 16.61% in Nvidia, followed by 15.31% in Apple. The fund has $130.0 billion in assets under management.\nVGT has an expense ratio of 0.09% and a yield of 0.38%. Since tech-focused ETFs are focused on a specific industry, they carry higher risk but also a high payoff. Looking at the tech sector today, VGT has a high return potential. The fund has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 120.57% and a 5-year return of 132.26%.\nThe fund has gained 23.13% so far in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $765.03.\n\nInvesco QQQ Trust While the Invesco QQQ isn’t a pure-play tech ETF, it continues to remain tech heavy with over 64% allocation to the sector. It is a less risky alternative as compared to the other two funds mentioned here. The fund has $408 billion in assets under management. It has generated a cumulative 5-year return of 113% and a 10-year return of 486%. This is an unbelievable result and shows a double-digit return throughout the decade. QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index and holds 101 stocks.\n\nBesides the allocation in the tech sector, QQQ allocates 18.29% to the consumer discretionary segment, followed by 4.21% to the healthcare segment. Its top 10 holdings constitute about 50% of the fund and include Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft Corporation, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. It has an expense ratio of 0.18%.\nThe ETF has gained 21.93% so far in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $622.11. This ETF is home to some of the biggest and the best U.S. tech companies. Its top 10 holdings are all AI plays, and the fund has generated impressive returns this year. Since it holds 100 of the best tech stocks, there’s less diversification than the S&P 500, and it has outperformed the S&P 500.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "IREN's AI Client Base Expands: Is Growth Becoming More Durable?\n\nSubhasish Mukherjee\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 8:23 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: IREN\n\nMSFT\n\nIREN Limited ’s IREN expanding AI client base is increasingly pointing to a more durable growth profile, reducing reliance on any single anchor client. Beyond the highly visible $9.7 billion Microsoft AI cloud agreement, the company has added several multi-year AI cloud customers, including Together AI, Fluidstack and Fireworks AI. These wins are expected to contribute more than $500 million in AI Cloud ARR by early fiscal 2026, even before Microsoft-related revenues scale materially.\n\nThe impact of diversification is now evident in IREN’s operating metrics. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the company posted a fifth straight quarter of record revenue, reaching $240 million, suggesting growth is becoming more consistent rather than event-driven. Management also pointed to pre-contracted GPU deployments at its Canadian facilities, a clear indicator of forward demand and improved revenue predictability across its AI customer base.\n\nIndustry dynamics are increasingly supportive of IREN’s positioning. AI compute demand is surging across hyperscalers, AI-native labs and enterprise users, while supply remains bottlenecked by limited power availability and data center readiness. In this situation, IREN’s vertically integrated platform, which controls power, land, data centers and GPU infrastructure, provides a clear edge, enabling faster customer onboarding and enhanced pricing leverage.\n\nLooking ahead, IREN’s roadmap to 140,000 GPUs by the end of 2026 underscores the depth of its long-term growth runway. This capacity positions IREN to pursue approximately $3.4 billion in total AI Cloud ARR by year-end 2026, spanning the Microsoft agreement, existing GPU capacity and new AI customer wins.\n\nHow IREN’s Rivals Are Broadening Their AI Client Base CoreWeave CRWV is one of the most aggressive AI cloud players, specializing in purpose-built GPU infrastructure for hyperscalers and AI labs. CoreWeave reported a $55.6 billion revenue backlog in the third quarter of 2025, up 271% year over year, driven by expanded contracts with customers such as OpenAI, Meta and multiple hyperscalers. Importantly, CoreWeave noted that nine of its ten largest customers now have multiple contracts, indicating the growing expansion and depth of the AI client base despite the risk of chronic concentration.\n\nTeraWulf WULF is expanding its AI footprint through a long-term joint venture with Fluidstack, positioning TeraWulf as a power- and infrastructure-focused HPC provider. The partnership targets high-density compute demand under long-duration contracts, with the JV valued at roughly $9.5 billion over 25 years. However, most of TeraWulf’s planned capacity additions of 250 to 500 MW annually are unlikely to be fully operational before 2026, which will limit near-term AI revenue growth compared to IREN's rapid ramp.\n\nStory Continues\nIREN’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Shares of IREN have soared 292% in the past year, outperforming the broader Zacks Finance sector’s return of 18.2% and the Zacks Financial Miscellaneous Services industry’s decline of 6.2%.\nIREN’s One-Year Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIREN shares are overvalued, as suggested by the Value Score of D. In terms of forward price/sales, IREN is trading at 6.18X compared with the industry’s 3.36X.\nIREN’s Valuation\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for IREN’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at 79 cents per share, marking a sharp year-over-year improvement from just 4 cents. However, the fiscal 2027 earnings estimate of $1.00 per share indicates year-over-year growth of 27.63%. Remarkably, consensus estimates for fiscal 2026 have remained stable over the past 30 days, while projections for fiscal 2027 have surged nearly threefold during the same period.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIREN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The standout performers have been companies aggressively pivoting to AI.\n\nIREN (IREN) led with a massive +300% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled by major GPU cloud deals and Microsoft&#x27;s backing .\nCipher Mining (CIFR) followed strongly at +230%, expanding AI hosting partnerships specifically with Fluidstack .\nHut 8 (HUT) also soared, up around +139%, capped by its recent AI announcement : a $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease for 245 MW at its River Bend site in Louisiana.\nIn contrast, three of the four largest bitcoin holders among public miners underperformed the AI/HPC miners.\nMarathon Digital (MARA), the top BTC hodler among miners with 53,250 BTC, dropped -44% YTD. CleanSpark (CLSK) (13,011 BTC) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) (19,324 BTC) saw modest gains of 16% and 32% respectively, without aggressive AI diversification until much later in the year.\n\nCore Scientific (CORZ) stayed independent after shareholders rejected a $9 billion all-stock takeover bid from CoreWeave in October, betting on higher standalone value amid AI demand. Its shares are up just 9% year-to-date.\nBitdeer Technologies (BTDR), the biggest underperforming mining company in the sector, is down around 50%. The bulk of the losses came after its Q3 earnings announcement, when the company reported a larger-than-anticipated net loss and disclosed a delay to its ASIC chip, adding uncertainty around its AI expansion plans.\nThis year underscored a clear trend: miners repurposing sites for AI data centers which outperformed pure-play bitcoin operators.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Those shares are now worth almost $700M.\nAST SpaceMobile successfully deployed BlueBird 6 on Wednesday. It is the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit.\nPlanet Labs ( PL ) reported record revenue of $81.3M in fiscal Q3. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672M.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAlphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG )( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) dominates the search engine market with over 90% share and powers billions of daily queries through Google Search. Its Google Cloud division has gained market share from leaders Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ).\nA lesser-known aspect is Alphabet also directly invests in public companies through its venture arms GV and CapitalG. This portfolio held 38 stocks at the end of the third quarter with assets under management of about $2.5 billion and spanning sectors like healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI), and technology.\nYet there is one sector where Alphabet has placed its biggest bets: space. According to McKinsey, the space sector is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, so it's not surprising Alphabet is attempting to cash in on the explosive growth expected. What's notable about Alphabet's space investments is that it has concentrated its focus on just two stocks, which comprise 45% of the portfolio's AUM at current valuations.\n\nAST SpaceMobile ( NASDAQ:ASTS ) and Planet Labs ( NYSE:PL ) stand out as the largest positions in the portfolio, so let's see whether they warrant an investment from you, too.\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) AST SpaceMobile builds a space-based cellular broadband network accessible directly by standard smartphones. Alphabet participated in a $155 million strategic investment round in early 2024 alongside AT&T ( NYSE:T ) and Vodafone ( NASDAQ:VOD ), supporting the company's satellite constellation development.\n\nGoogle collaborates on product development, testing, and implementation for network connectivity on Android devices. In the first quarter of 2025, Alphabet added 8.9 million shares valued at approximately $203 million. Today, those shares are worth almost $700 million and represent the portfolio's largest holding, or 23.3% of the total.\nAST achieved a key milestone on Wednesday with the successful launch and orbital deployment of BlueBird 6, the largest commercial communications array in low Earth orbit. This validates its technology for direct-to-device connectivity.\n\nStory Continues\nThe satellite stock's shares have surged 270% year-to-date as it advances its launch schedule and partnerships with over 50 mobile network operators serving billions of subscribers. The stock has been volatile, but has gained significant ground as it attained new milestones.\nAST SpaceMobile's focus on eliminating connectivity gaps aligns with the growth in satellite broadband, but analysts still give it mixed reviews. Some rate it a Buy for its long-term potential, while others are concerned about execution risks, limited revenue, and ongoing losses. Weiss Ratings , for example, just reiterated its Sell rating on the stock while Barclays downgraded it in October from Overweight to Underweight.\n\nAST SpaceMobile is probably best suited for risk-tolerant investors who may see an opportunity in it capturing even a slice of the projected $100 billion satellite broadband market.\nPlanet Labs (PL) Planet Labs operates a fleet of over 200 satellites providing daily global imagery and geospatial data for sectors including agriculture, defense, finance, and climate monitoring. Alphabet holds a roughly 10% stake, with data integrations supporting Google Earth and AI models for environmental analytics.\n\nAlphabet's position in Planet Labs is currently valued at approximately $650 million after the stock jumped following its fiscal year 2026 Q3 earnings report, making it the portfolio's second-largest holding. The valuation is 56% above where it stood on the date of Alphabet's 13F-HR filing.\nPlanet Labs reported record quarterly revenue of $81.3 million, up 33% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations grew 361% to $672 million, driven by defense and intelligence contracts.\nThe space stock's shares have rocketed over 400% in 2025 following hefty earnings beats and analyst upgrades. Morgan Stanley hiked its price target from $4.50 to $20 per share, which suggests Planet Labs is fairly priced, but the consensus has a sub-$15 target, which is why the stock has a Hold rating overall.\n\nIn the expanding $1.8 trillion space economy by 2035, Planet Labs benefits from geospatial AI applications that should contribute to revenue growth outpacing the sector. Aggressive investors may view it as a thematic play, but most investors should probably wait for a more attractive entry point following its huge run-up.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Analysts See Triple-Digit Revenue Growth in 2026 for These 3 AI Infrastructure Stocks\n\nRich Duprey\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:43 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nCRWV\n\nIREN\n\nMSFT\n\nQuick Read Nebius Group ( NBIS ) targets $7B to $9B in annualized revenue by end of 2026. This implies potential growth of 521% to 900%.\nIren ( IREN ) landed a five-year $9.7B contract with Microsoft for GPU cloud services at 85% EBITDA margins.\nCoreWeave (CRWV) has secured long-term contracts with major hyperscalers, but is dogged by concerns over its ballooning debt.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nArtificial intelligence is driving explosive demand for computing power as companies invest heavily to develop and deploy AI models. This has created opportunities in AI infrastructure, including specialized cloud platforms and data centers.\nWall Street forecasts three stocks in particular are uniquely positioned to significantly benefit from benefit the massive expansion and adoption of AI: Nebius Group ( NASDAQ:NBIS ), IREN ( NASDAQ:IREN ) and CoreWeave ( NASDAQ:CRWV ) are projected to witness revenue growth rates for 2026 ranging from over 135% to 521%, a torrid pace of growth.\nAs stock prices tend to follow earnings growth based on increased sales, even if analysts are only partially right, investors in these three companies could see a substantially higher repricing of their stocks.\n\nNebius Group (NBIS) Nebius Group provides full-stack AI infrastructure, including large-scale GPU clusters and cloud platforms for AI developers. The company has set ambitious targets, aiming for annualized run rate (ARR) in revenue of $900 million to $1.1 billion by the end of 2025 and $7 billion to $9 billion by the end of 2026. This implies potential revenue growth of as much as 1,600%.\n\nWall Street views this growth as driven by strong demand for AI compute, with Nebius securing major contracts, including a multi-year deal with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) valued at over $19 billion and a $3 billion partnership with Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) over five years. The company is expanding capacity to 800 megawatts (MW) to 1 gigawatt (GW) of connected power by the end of 2026, with contracted power reaching 2.5 GW.\nThe likelihood of achieving the upper end depends on the timely execution of capacity buildouts during a period of supply constraints in power and hardware. Delays could push revenue recognition, but sold-out capacity and hyperscaler backing provide Nebius with significant visibility. If it meets its targets, this could drive substantial stock appreciation, given its current $23 billion market cap and high-growth multiple in AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\nIREN (IREN) Iris Energy owns and operates renewable-powered data centers, originally focused on Bitcoin mining but rapidly expanding into AI cloud services and high-performance computing. The company has secured a five-year, $9.7 billion contract with Microsoft for GPU cloud services, announced in November 2025, expected to generate approximately $1.94 billion in annual recurring revenue at 85% EBITDA margins once fully deployed.\n\nManagement targets $3.4 billion in annualized run-rate revenue from AI cloud services by the end of 2026 -- a greater-than 500% increase -- supported by plans to scale its GPU fleet from approximately 23,000 units to 140,000 units.\nWall Street analysts, however, while maintaining a generally positive outlook with a consensus \"Moderate Buy\" rating and average price targets around $70 to $85, see revenue growing more conservatively, projecting rates in the range of 100% 200% from 2025. Achieving the full run-rate depends on timely GPU procurement, data center buildouts, and sustained demand, while overcoming risks including high capital expenditure needs and potential deployment delays.\nIf IREN realizes revenue closer to guidance, this could lead to upward revisions in estimates and a significant stock revaluation toward higher infrastructure multiples.\n\nCoreWeave (CRWV) CoreWeave offers a purpose-built cloud platform for AI workloads, with GPU compute and managed services. The company reported strong demand, with a revenue backlog exceeding $55 billion. Guidance for 2025 revenue is $5.05 billion to $5.15 billion, while analysts project average 2026 revenue of $12.01 billion, representing growth of around 134% to 138%.\n\nThe growth projections are supported by long-term contracts with customers like OpenAI , Microsoft, and Meta, including expansions worth billions. Capacity is expanding rapidly, though recent delays from third-party partners shifted some 2025 revenue into 2026.\nWall Street rates it positively overall, citing ties to Nvidia 's ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) ecosystem and high margins, but more recently, CoreWeave's heavy debt and execution on massive capex (expected to more than double in 2026) have weighed on the stock.\nIf demand is able to sustain the projected levels and buildouts proceed as planned, the backlog supports CoreWeave's accelerated growth, potentially leading to stock gains as multiples compress on higher revenue. Investors, though, should proceed cautiously and wait for a better buy-in price.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "MSFT vs. ORCL: Which Enterprise Cloud & AI Stock Has Better Upside?\n\nVasundhara Sawalka\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 7:27 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nORCL\n\nMicrosoft MSFT and Oracle ORCL have emerged as two dominant players capitalizing on the enterprise cloud and artificial intelligence revolution. Both companies are investing billions in AI infrastructure to meet unprecedented demand from hyperscalers and enterprise clients. Microsoft, with its Azure cloud platform and OpenAI partnership, has transformed into an AI-first enterprise software giant. Oracle has pivoted from its database legacy to become a formidable cloud infrastructure provider, securing massive multi-year contracts with AI pioneers.\n\nBoth technology titans reported strong fiscal results in their latest quarters, with Microsoft delivering 18% revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 and Oracle posting 14% revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2026. The companies share similar growth drivers — surging cloud adoption, AI workload expansion, and massive capital expenditure programs to build datacenter capacity. Yet their financial profiles, strategic positioning, and execution risks differ significantly.\n\nLet's delve deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.\n\nThe Case for MSFT Stock Microsoft's diversified AI ecosystem positions the company for sustained growth across multiple revenue streams. The company's first-quarter fiscal 2026 results demonstrated robust momentum with Microsoft Cloud revenues surpassing $49 billion, up 26% year over year. Azure and other cloud services grew approximately 40%, driven by both traditional cloud migrations and expanding AI workloads. The company's commercial remaining performance obligations reached nearly $400 billion, up more than 50%, providing exceptional revenue visibility.\n\nIn December 2025, Microsoft announced $23 billion in new AI investments, including $17.5 billion in India — its largest investment in Asia — and $5.4 billion in Canada over the next few years. These geographic expansions demonstrate Microsoft's commitment to building sovereign cloud capacity and meeting global AI demand. The company also launched Microsoft 365 Copilot Business at $21 per user per month for small and mid-sized businesses, broadening AI adoption beyond Fortune 500 enterprises.\n\nMicrosoft's partnership with Cognizant, announced in December, extends its healthcare, retail, financial services, and manufacturing AI capabilities through agentic AI and Copilot integration. The company also announced Microsoft 365 pricing increases effective July 2026, reflecting pricing power and confidence in its value proposition. With operating income up 22% in the first quarter and adjusted earnings per share reaching $4.13, Microsoft maintains strong profitability despite heavy AI infrastructure investments.\n\nManagement's second-quarter fiscal 2026 guidance projects Intelligent Cloud revenues of $32.25 billion to $32.55 billion with 26-27% growth. While Microsoft acknowledged capacity constraints through at least fiscal year-end 2026, the company's $34.9 billion in first-quarter capital expenditures addresses this challenge. The diversified business model spanning productivity software, cloud infrastructure, gaming, and LinkedIn provides multiple growth engines and cushions against any single segment weakness.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $15.61 per share, up 0.1% over the past 30 days. The estimate indicates 14.44% year-over-year growth.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus Microsoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\nThe Case for ORCL Stock Oracle delivered impressive cloud infrastructure growth of 68% in second-quarter fiscal 2026, with total cloud revenues reaching $8 billion, up 34% year over year. The company's remaining performance obligations surged to $523 billion, up 438% year over year, driven by massive contracts from Meta, NVIDIA, and OpenAI. This unprecedented backlog provides multi-year revenue visibility, with management projecting an additional $4 billion in fiscal 2027 revenues from faster RPO conversion.\n\nOracle's multicloud strategy gained traction in December 2025 with expanded Oracle Database@Google Cloud availability in India and other regions. The company has built more than 211 live and planned cloud regions globally and is halfway through embedding 72 Oracle Multicloud datacenters within Amazon, Google, and Microsoft clouds. The multicloud database business surged 817% in the second quarter, representing Oracle's fastest-growing segment.\n\nDecember brought significant strategic developments, including Michigan regulators approving Oracle's 1-gigawatt data center with OpenAI, and the company securing a controlling interest in TikTok's U.S. operations through a joint venture. These wins position Oracle as a critical cloud and security infrastructure provider for major platforms. However, financing challenges emerged when Blue Owl Capital withdrew from backing the $10 billion Michigan project, forcing Oracle to explore alternative funding structures.\n\nOracle's elevated capital expenditure trajectory raises concerns. The company now expects approximately $50 billion in fiscal 2026 capex, up from $35 billion projected in September. Free cash flow turned negative $10 billion in the second quarter as infrastructure spending accelerated. Management maintains commitment to investment-grade debt ratings but acknowledged exploring customer-funded equipment purchases and supplier chip leasing to reduce financing needs. Software revenues declined 3%, highlighting Oracle's transition challenges from legacy licensing to cloud subscriptions. For third-quarter fiscal 2026, Oracle guided to 16-18% total revenue growth and 12-14% non-GAAP EPS growth, solid but moderating from recent quarters.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL’s fiscal 2026 earnings is pegged at $7.33 per share, marking an upward revision of 7.6% over the past 30 days. The earnings figure suggests 21.56% growth over the figure reported in fiscal 2025.\n\nOracle Corporation Price and Consensus Oracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation Quote\nValuation and Price Performance Comparison Microsoft trades at 28.8x forward earnings while Oracle trades at 25.38x forward earnings. Both stocks command premium valuations reflecting AI growth expectations. Microsoft's price-to-earnings ratio, while elevated, is supported by consistent double-digit revenue growth, expanding operating margins, and a multi-year AI monetization runway across productivity, infrastructure, and applications. Oracle's lower multiple reflects execution uncertainty around converting its massive backlog into profitable revenues while managing unprecedented capex without compromising financial flexibility.\n\nMSFT vs. ORCL: P/E F12M Ratio\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft's shares lost 5.2% in the past three-month period, outperforming Oracle, which has experienced significant volatility, plunging 30.2% in the same time frame due to financing concerns.\nMSFT Outperforms ORCL in 3 Months\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion Microsoft emerges as the superior choice for investors seeking enterprise cloud and AI exposure. The company's diversified business model reduces concentration risk while its Azure platform benefits from both cloud migration and AI workload expansion. Microsoft's proven ability to monetize AI through Copilot adoption, strong pricing power evidenced by upcoming Microsoft 365 increases, and geographic expansion in India and Canada position it for sustained growth. While Oracle offers compelling cloud infrastructure growth, the company faces significant challenges around financing $50 billion in capex, converting its massive backlog efficiently, and managing customer concentration risks with OpenAI. Investors should watch Microsoft stock for attractive entry points given its 14% pullback from highs, while holding Oracle stock or waiting for better entry points until the company demonstrates improved capital efficiency and reduced financing uncertainty.

      "Content": "3 Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Before 2026 as Digital Demand Soars\n\nNalak Das\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 5:38 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) saga, supported by the massive growth of cloud computing and data centers, is yet to fully unfold. This space remains rock solid supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. The demand for data center capacity has surged to manage and store the vast amount of cloud computing-based data.\n\nIn order to reap the benefits of this enormous opportunity, we recommend investors buy three cloud computing behemoths at this stage and hold them for the long term. These stocks are set to immensely benefit in 2026 from an AI-induced cloud boom. These are: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\nThe chart below shows the price performance of the three above-mentioned stocks year to date.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon.com Inc. Global e-commerce giant Amazon reported strong third-quarter 2025 results in which both the top and the bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. AMZN’s top line has been benefiting from steady momentum in Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIn the third quarter, Amazon’s cloud service has performed impressively with AWS contributing $33.01 billion, up 20.2% year over year. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is “Growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022. We continue to see strong demand in artificial intelligence AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months.”\n\nExtensive AI Applications Amazon is using the Claude chatbot of privately held Anthropic for AI exposure. The Trainium2 AI chip has become a lucrative opportunity for the company. In the reported quarter, this business jumped 150% sequentially. AMZN has invested $8 billion in this AI startup.\nAnthropic has agreed to use 1 million custom Trainium2 chips from AMZN to run its AI applications by the end of 2025. On Oct. 29, AMZN unveiled its $11 billion AI data center called “Project Rainier.” This will run on Anthropic chatbot using 500,000 Trainium2 AI chips.\n\nIn February 2025, AMZN introduced Rufus, a shopping chatbot that can answer and suggest products as per customers’ queries. Management said more than 250 million individuals have already used this product. The e-commerce behemoth has also unveiled Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers.\nAmazon is extensively using generative AI applications in its retail, cloud, devices and advertisement businesses. Management raised its 2025 capex to $125 billion from $118 billion reported earlier. CFO Brian Olsavsky said capex is likely to increase next year.\n\nStory Continues\nAMZN’s AI is reshaping customer experiences across shopping and media. The company expanded Alexa+ Early Access to millions, and its AI shopping agent is used by millions of customers. AMZN rolled out features that turn product summaries and reviews into audio clips and launched tools to help sellers enhance listings. Amazon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\n\nStrong Guidance Amazon estimated that its fourth-quarter 2025 sales will be in the range of $206-213 billion (mid-point $209.5 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of fourth-quarter EPS (earnings per share) is $1.91, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year. AMZN has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20.3%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\nAMZN has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft Corp. Microsoft reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. MSFT’s intelligent cloud business generated $30.9 billion in revenues, up 28.3% year over year. The company’s flagship Azure product, which is part of this business, witnessed 40% year-over-year growth in revenues.\n\nMSFT has been capitalizing on AI business momentum and Copilot adoption alongside accelerating Azure cloud infrastructure expansion, demonstrating its dominant position in the rapidly expanding cloud and AI markets. These robust results underscore Microsoft's successful execution of its cloud-first, AI-powered strategy and present a compelling investment opportunity for 2026.\nConsequently, MSFT’s capex in the first quarter was $34.9 billion, a large part of which was invested in AI-powered data center infrastructure developments. Management said its capex growth rate for fiscal 2026 will exceed that of fiscal 2025.\nAI and Cloud Strength Microsoft's Azure platform maintains a commanding position in the enterprise cloud market, capturing approximately 25% market share behind only AMZN’s AWS. The company's comprehensive cloud ecosystem benefits from deep integration with existing Microsoft enterprise products, creating substantial switching costs and customer stickiness.\n\nMSFT has strategically embedded AI capabilities throughout its entire product ecosystem, from Azure AI services to Copilot features in Office 365 and Dynamics applications. MSFT’s substantial investment in OpenAI provides exclusive access to leading-edge language models, creating a significant competitive moat in enterprise AI adoption. Unlike competitors developing standalone AI products, MSFT monetizes AI through existing customer relationships, thus reducing customer acquisition costs while expanding revenue per user.\nEarly enterprise adoption metrics suggest a strong willingness to pay premium pricing for AI-enhanced productivity tools. The company's vast computing infrastructure and data resources create sustainable advantages in training and deploying AI models at scale, positioning Microsoft to capture substantial value as businesses increasingly prioritize AI implementation.\n\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) MSFT closed a new definitive agreement with OpenAI, securing exclusive rights for Azure until AGI achievement through 2030, and extended model and product IP rights through 2032. OpenAI has contracted an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, not reflected in the last results, representing a substantial revenue opportunity.\nSolid Outlook For the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft expects total company revenues between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, representing growth of 14% to 16%. Operating margins are expected to be relatively flat year over year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality, while the effective tax rate should be approximately 19%.\n\nMSFT has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.4% and 14.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year’s earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.8%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Inc. The undisputed global leader of Internet search engines and AI-powered cloud giant Alphabet came up with impressive third-quarter 2025 results wherein both the top and the bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\nThis impressive performance was primarily attributed to excellent momentum in its AI-powered cloud businesses. As a result, GOOGL raised its 2025 capex for the second time in the range of $91-93 billion.\n\nEarlier, capex for 2025 was raised to $85 billion from $75 billion estimated for the first time. Moreover, management said that its planned capital expenditure for an AI-powered data center in 2026 will see a significant increase year over year.\nAI-powered cloud revenues increased 32% year over year to $15.16 billion. Alphabet ended the third quarter with a massive cloud-computing backlog of $155 billion. The company’s flagship AI app Gemini 2.5 had more than 650 million monthly active users at the end of the reported quarter compared with 450 million users in the prior quarter.\nSolid AI-Powered Cloud Computing Business Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure.\nGOOGL is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Google Bard and Search Generative Experience are powered by Gemini Pro to deliver an enhanced user experience. Google Cloud offers Duet AI, which provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers in writing, testing, documenting and operating software.\n\nGOOGL launched Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models that can run on a single GPU or Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). At its Cloud Next 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Alphabet unveiled Ironwood, its seventh-generation TPU, expected to be available later this year.\nGoogle Cloud unveiled its Cloud Wide Area Network, giving enterprises access to its private global fiber network. Alphabet also showcased Willow, its new quantum chip while on the AI model front, Alphabet launched Gemini 2.5, its most advanced reasoning model, alongside Gemini 2.5 Flash, a low-latency, cost-efficient version tailored for developers.\nImpressive Estimate Revisions Zacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 4.3%, respectively, for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year’s earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days. GOOGL has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 16.4%, higher than the S&P 500’s growth rate of 15.9%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year\n\nJoel South\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nORCL\n\nKey Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms.\nMicrosoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) gained 1.96% over the past five trading sessions after losing 0.03% the five prior. That brings MSFT's year-to-date gain to 16.59%, including a nearly 38% gain since its year-to-date low on April 8.\nWhen the Magnificent Seven member reported FY 2026 Q1 earnings on Oct. 29, 2025, shares fell despite beating on EPS and revenue. The company announced earnings of $3.72 per share versus analysts' expectations of $3.67, and quarterly revenue of $77.67 billion versus analysts' expectations of $75.33 billion.\nOn Oct. 1, 2025, the company announced that it was increasing its Xbox Game Pass subscription by 50%. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft saw more than 8% of revenue derived from its gaming segment, which now boasts 50 million monthly active subscribers and nearly $5 billion in YoY revenue.\n\nMicrosoft's decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth.\nWhy Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) AWS.\nIn June, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 39% in FY25 Q4, driven by AI services.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect the company's capex to remain elevated to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth.\n\nTariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year.\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft's AI and cloud momentum.\n\nMicrosoft As a Stock Broadly, 34 Wall Street analysts' remain bullish, with 32 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a \"Buy\" rating, two assigning it a \"Hold\" rating and none assigning it a \"Sell\" rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating. Wall Street's price targets cover a significant range, spanning $500 per share on the low end to $700 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $631.36, which represents 29.37% potential upside from today's share price.\nInstitutional ownership currently stands at 73.74%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\n%Change From Current Price\nLow\n$500\n2.45%\nMedian\n$631.36\n29.37%\nHigh\n$700\n43.43%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s strong Azure revenue growth positions it for cloud and AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger.\n\n24/7 Wall St. ’s year-end price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying upside potential of 15.49% from the stock's current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and FY26 Q1 revenue guidance, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "From Gates to Musk: Net Worth of Richest American from 1995 to 2025\n\nTravis Woods\nFri, December 26, 2025 at 4:10 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nMSFT\n\nRecently, Tesla CEO and entrepreneur Elon Musk became the first person to gain a net worth over $400 billion, having added $184 billion to his preexisting wealth thanks to a 56% boost in Tesla stock. That extraordinary leap in wealth has also made Musk the wealthiest American citizen (in addition to the richest person on Earth) for the fourth year in a row.\n\nWhile Musk’s total net worth of over $750 billion certainly makes him the richest American, there was a time when a mere $15 billion would have been the highest net worth in the country. Specifically, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates’ net worth of $15 billion made him wealthiest American back in 1995. That stunning disparity between 1995 and 2025 highlights the massive consolidation of wealth that has occurred at society’s highest levels, in which the 20 richest Americans have collectively amassed $3 trillion.\nBy tracing the arc of the richest Americans over the last 30 years, you can watch as the country’s wealth accumulates and increases around a very small group of individuals — three tech-driven entrepreneurs whose companies have helped reshape American society just as they have collected most of the country’s wealth. Those three men are, per Forbes : Gates, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk. Their accretion of wealth has leapt from $15 billion to a shocking $751.9 billion (as of Dec. 24), and that number is only expected to increase as Musk is on track to becoming America’s — and the world’s — first trillionaire .\n1995: Bill Gates Net worth : $15 billion\nFind Out: If the Top 10 Billionaires’ Wealth Was Distributed Equally in America, How Much Money Would Each Person Get?\nRead Next: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n1996: Bill Gates Net worth : $18.5 billion\nFor You: 6 Money Moves Wealthy People Always Make Before New Year’s\n1997: Bill Gates Net worth : $40 billion\n1998: Bill Gates Net worth : $58 billion\n1999: Bill Gates Net worth : $85 billion\n2000: Bill Gates Net worth : $63 billion\nCheck Out: 5 Key Mindset Shifts To Financially Become the Top 1%, According to Humphrey Yang\n2001: Bill Gates Net worth : $54 billion\n2002: Bill Gates Net worth : $43 billion\n2003: Bill Gates Net worth : $46 billion\n2004: Bill Gates Net worth : $48 billion\nDiscover More: If Mark Zuckerberg’s Wealth Were Evenly Distributed Across America, How Much Money Would Every Person Get?\n2005: Bill Gates Net worth : $51 billion\n2006: Bill Gates Net worth : $56 billion\n2007: Bill Gates Net worth : $59 billion\n2008: Bill Gates Net worth : $57 billion\nBe Aware: What Class Do You Actually Belong To?

      "Content": "What Is the Smartest Quantum Computing Stock to Buy in 2026?\n\nAdam Spatacco, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 10:20 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nRGTI\n\nQBTS\n\nNVDA\n\n^GSPC\n\nKey Points Pure-play developers like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum are the hottest quantum computing stocks right now.\nBig tech giants are also exploring quantum computing in addition to their established generative artificial intelligence (AI) products.\nNvidia is quietly building a quantum AI ecosystem that stands to benefit, no matter which systems succeed in the long run.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nOne of the hottest pockets of the artificial intelligence (AI) realm in 2025 was quantum computing. Shares of pure-play quantum developers such as IonQ , Rigetti Computing , and D-Wave Quantum each handily trounced the S&P 500 this year.\nWhat many investors might not fully realize is that several members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" are also exploring quantum computing technology alongside their existing generative AI efforts. While Alphabet , Amazon , and Microsoft have received some notoriety around their custom quantum processors, I think there's a more lucrative opportunity hiding in plain sight.\nI'll detail how Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is quietly building a full-spectrum quantum computing suite, and explain why this could be a major catalyst for the company as the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure era begins.\nNvidia is laying the foundation between quantum and accelerated computing At the moment, quantum computing is an exploratory pursuit. While some businesses are assessing how the technology may be integrated within their existing AI framework, quantum technology has little use at the enterprise level today.\nAgainst this backdrop, pure-play developers are primarily focused on research and development right now. IonQ and Rigetti specialize in gate-based approaches leveraging trapped ions and superconducting techniques. D-Wave, for its part, is more niche -- focusing on quantum annealing processes for optimization tasks.\n\nThe main takeaway is that quantum pure plays are currently engaged with the actual physics behind the creation and configuration of quantum bits -- known as qubits -- within new computing architectures.\nAs mentioned, the big three cloud providers have each designed their own quantum processors -- dubbed Willow (Alphabet), Ocelot (Amazon), and Majorana (Microsoft). While quantum computing is not a meaningful contributor to their respective businesses at this time, it's clear that big tech is fascinated by how this emerging technology may eventually impact the broader AI opportunity.\nNvidia's approach is entirely different from that of its megacap counterparts, as well as the pure plays. Instead of building its own quantum computers, Nvidia is seeking to become a bridge between the software and hardware investments necessary to build these systems.\n\nStory continues\nNvidia offers a software platform called CUDA-Q, within which developers can write applications that work across a network of CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs (quantum processing units). On the hardware side, Nvidia has built a high-speed interconnect called NVQLink. NVQLink represents a pathway for QPUs and GPUs to seamlessly communicate without straining latency and bandwidth.\n\nEssentially, Nvidia's decision to provide a software and hardware ecosystem allows programmers to easily test their AI workloads across a hybrid quantum-classical computing environment. This is a particularly smart move because it positions Nvidia to be a beneficiary regardless of which quantum processor designs or qubit architecture emerges as the market standard down the road.\nWill 2026 be a big year for Nvidia? Nvidia's growth trajectory is directly tied to the budgets of big tech. As the slope of the lines in the chart illustrate, AI hyperscalers are accelerating their capital expenditures (capex) -- suggesting that data center buildouts, networking equipment, and chip procurement remain high priorities.\nResearch from Goldman Sachs suggests that the hyperscalers alone will contribute nearly half a trillion dollars to AI infrastructure in 2026. While this is great news for Nvidia in the short term, AI infrastructure is expected to become a nearly $7 trillion opportunity by the end of the decade, according to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nI bring this up to drive home a couple of key ideas. First, Nvidia appears well-positioned to benefit from rising data center spend going into next year. More importantly, however, AI infrastructure is shaping up to be a longer-term secular opportunity.\nGiven these dynamics, Nvidia could continue receiving outsized demand for its products as quantum computing becomes a more meaningful contributor to the broader AI narrative over the next several years. So while CUDA-Q and NVQLink may not yet be major contributors to Nvidia's business today relative to its core compute and networking services, I'm encouraged by the company's pursuit of quantum computing and see these products eventually becoming an important storyline in its evolution throughout the AI infrastructure chapter.\n\nIs Nvidia stock still a good buy? As of this writing (Dec. 22), Nvidia trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 24. Considering Nvidia's current growth in combination with Wall Street's outlook, the stock is valued quite reasonably.\nIn my eyes, quantum computing represents just another pillar supporting Nvidia's growth arc as AI continues to dominate the market. For these reasons, I think Nvidia is headed for further valuation expansion heading into 2026 and well beyond -- making it a compelling buy-and-hold opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Does That Make MSFT Stock a Buy Here?\n\nSubhasree Kar\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 7:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nIn a bold move that is reshaping the future of one of the world’s most valuable companies, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella is doubling down on artificial intelligence (AI), betting that the next era of tech dominance will be won by those who build the platforms, infrastructure, and cloud services that power AI at scale. From investing tens of billions of dollars in hyperscale AI data centers and strategic partnerships to embedding AI across core products, Nadella has signaled that AI is no longer just one of Microsoft’s growth vectors; it’s the company’s central strategic thrust.\n\nSatya Nadella has become deeply hands-on with the company’s AI push, actively engaging with top engineers and closely reviewing product performance. He now runs intensive weekly meetings, issues direct product mandates, and has shifted focus away from other executive duties to act as Microsoft’s most influential product leader.\nMore News from Barchart Super Micro Computer Stock Tumbles, But Investors are Piling into Its Call Options - Time to Buy SMCI?\nA $61 Billion Reason to Buy Amazon Stock for 2026\nRKLB Stock Bullish Diagonal Trade Targets a Price of $85 by January 16th\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nAmid rising competitive and financial pressure in AI, Nadella is also accelerating talent recruitment, personally courting elite researchers from OpenAI and Google DeepMind, signaling that he views this moment as pivotal for Microsoft’s long-term success.\nWhile MSFT is trading near record valuations, does Nadella’s AI bet make Microsoft stock a buy today?\nAbout Microsoft Stock Headquartered in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft Corporation is a global technology leader known for its expansive portfolio that spans software, cloud computing, AI, gaming, and enterprise solutions. Microsoft has evolved from a dominant operating system provider into a powerhouse across multiple tech verticals. The company boasts a market cap of approximately $3.6 trillion, reflecting its heavyweight status.\n\nMicrosoft’s stock price performance over the recent period reflects both the company’s underlying growth momentum and broader market dynamics. Owing to robust cloud revenue and early leadership in AI, MSFT shares climbed to record levels in 2025, hitting a 52-week high of $555.45, reached on July 31, underscoring robust investor confidence in its strategic direction.\nHowever, Microsoft’s performance has not been a straight line upward. Periods of consolidation and pullbacks have emerged as investors reacted to shifts in macroeconomic conditions, and the broad technology sector, which has periodically weighed on high-growth names. The stock is down 13.8% from the high reached in July.\n\nStory Continues\nDespite the pullback, the stock has delivered returns of 15.8% year-to-date (YTD) and 11% over the past year. The overall optimism stems from expectations that the company’s massive investments in cloud capacity and AI tools like Copilot and Azure AI will translate into accelerated revenue growth in future periods.\nMicrosoft’s valuation has commanded a premium, with analyst price targets pointing to continued optimism about future earnings power. It is currently trading at 30.58 times forward earnings, higher than many of its industry peers.\nSolid Q1 Performance Microsoft reported its fiscal first quarter 2026 results on Oct. 29, after the market closed. In this quarter, the company delivered $77.7 billion in revenue, representing an 18% year-over-year (YOY) increase, comfortably above analysts’ expectations.\nTotal operating income also showed robust growth, climbing 24% YOY, while non-GAAP EPS rose 23% to $4.13, underscoring continued margin strength even as Microsoft scales its AI and cloud infrastructure and beating the consensus estimate.\n\nCloud revenue played a leading role, with the Microsoft Cloud segment up 26% YOY to $49.1 billion, and Azure and other cloud services growing an impressive 40%, highlighting strong ongoing demand for AI-enabled enterprise services. Commercial remaining performance obligations jumped 51% to $392 billion, signaling heightened multi-year customer commitments.\nHowever, investors were reminded that substantial capital expenditures of $34.9 billion in Q1 are being deployed to expand AI capacity and data-center footprint, a factor that tempered the stock’s immediate reaction despite the earnings beat. The stock declined 2.9% on Oct. 30.\nManagement outlined expectations for second quarter FY2026 revenue of between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion, implying continued double-digit growth, and maintained that demand for cloud and AI products would remain solid.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic as they predict EPS to be around $15.86 for fiscal 2026, up 16.3% YOY, and surge another 15.6% annually to $18.33 in fiscal 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Microsoft Stock? On Dec. 22, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reaffirmed his “Outperform” rating on Microsoft and maintained his $625 price target, signaling continued confidence in the stock’s upside and long-term growth outlook.\nAlso, DA Davidson reaffirmed a “Buy” rating on Microsoft with a $650 price target. The firm continues to view Microsoft as its top mega-cap pick, citing durable financial strength, and confidence in its long-term AI positioning.\n\nOverall, MSFT has a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, 39 advise a “Strong Buy,” five suggest a “Moderate Buy,” and the remaining four analysts are on the sidelines, giving it a “Hold” rating.\nThe average analyst price target for MSFT is $629.23, indicating a potential upside of 29.1%. Meanwhile, the street-high target price of $700 suggests that the stock could rally as much as 43.4%.\nOn the date of publication, Subhasree Kar did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nJordan Rosenfeld\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 6:57 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nMSFT\n\nGOOG\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is not just infiltrating everyday lives; it has been the driving force behind stock market gains for the past two years. From chipmakers to software, anything tied to AI has surged. But investors are starting to wonder what happens if the momentum slows and the market decides AI valuations have gone too far. While no one can predict the future, I asked ChatGPT to look more deeply into the history of stock market bubbles and what might happen if the AI bubble were to burst.\n\nHere are its predictions.\nA Sharp Repricing of AI Stocks A correction in AI stocks would not just be another bad day for tech, ChatGPT warned. Because a handful of companies, including Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta, now make up such a large percentage of the S&P 500, their movements shape the entire market.\nIf the market decides these large AI players are overvalued, those big company stocks will be the first to see a rapid decline as well as any company heavily tied to AI infrastructure, ChatGPT said.\n\nBecause these companies now make up a huge share of the market, a correction in even a handful of them could lead to a fall in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. This could lead to an environment similar to the dot-com bubble burst of the early 2000s.\nLearn More: I Asked ChatGPT What Would Happen If Billionaires Paid Taxes at the Same Rate as the Middle Class\nRead Next: 9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\nA Broader Market Correction If the AI market trend reverses, the entire stock market index would likely follow, ChatGPT said. We could be looking at a broad correction of 10% to 20% if sentiment turns and investors begin to question AI revenue projections.\nNot all sectors would be hit equally, however. What tends to happen during sector slowdowns is that investors rotate their money into other areas like utilities, healthcare and consumer staples, ChatGPT noted. That means companies with steady earnings and predictable cash flows tend to look attractive. Thus, investors with diversified portfolios would be less affected than those concentrated in a single theme.\n\nStartup Valuations Could Cool Fast The ripple effects of an AI market correction would also have an impact on startups. Venture funding has been pouring into AI startups with the assumption that adoption will keep accelerating, ChatGPT said. If the market “gets skittish,” these valuations could fall as quickly as public tech stocks. That means less hiring, more consolidation and a good chance that many AI startups might fail.\n\nStory Continues\nLarger companies with strong balance sheets would likely scoop up talent or intellectual property, however, again similar to what happened after the dot-com bust. For workers and entrepreneurs, this could hit hard.\nWill an Economic Crisis Be Coming? The good news for investors is that a complete collapse similar to 2000 or 2008 is much less likely. Many AI companies today generate revenue that’s grounded in other profitable business products or services outside of AI. Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon have the funds and the services to withstand a downturn . In the dot-com era, many companies going public had no profits or even customers. ChatGPT said “the fundamentals today are stronger.”\n\nHow Likely Is an AI Bubble To Burst? While an economic crisis is not likely coming, a sharp correction in AI stocks is more likely than not, ChatGPT said. It pointed out that “high-growth sectors tend to overshoot,” and the enthusiasm around AI has created valuations that may be more speculative than accurate in certain areas. A moderate pullback of 15% to 30% in leading AI names would not be surprising.\n\nIt did say that a complete bubble collapse is less likely, however. AI already has real commercial value, and early gains are showing up across industries. Just like the early days of the smartphone, there may be volatility, but the long-term trajectory remains positive.\nWhat Investors Should Focus On Now Everyday investors should expect volatility. The smartest bet is to keep a diversified portfolio , balanced allocation and long-term time horizon to have the best protections.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n10 Kirkland Products Costco Quietly Raised Prices on -- and Where To Buy Instead\n5 Reliable Cars That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Winter 2025\n9 Low-Effort Ways To Make Passive Income (You Can Start This Week)\n6 Safe Accounts Proven to Grow Your Money Up to 13x Faster\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com : I Asked ChatGPT What Will Happen To the Stock Market If the AI Bubble Bursts\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Dan Ives Loves This Under-the-Radar AI Stock for 2026\n\nNauman Khan\nThu, December 25, 2025 at 4:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nWhen investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, individuals tend to focus on the large, mega-cap stocks that are all the rage, yet the next wave of AI may more comfortably benefit smaller infrastructure businesses. As capital shifts from model development to deployment, people are demanding more cloud capacity, superior compute power, and AI-ready data centers, making the demand hot.\n\nOne quietly notable name that has been catching Wall Street's eye is Nebius (NBIS). Wedbush analyst Dan Ives just listed NBIS as his top AI infrastructure pick for 2026, arguing the company’s positioning and tech make it a likely acquisition target for a hyperscaler such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), or Amazon (AMZN).\nMore News from Barchart Super Micro Computer Stock Tumbles, But Investors are Piling into Its Call Options - Time to Buy SMCI?\nA $61 Billion Reason to Buy Amazon Stock for 2026\nRKLB Stock Bullish Diagonal Trade Targets a Price of $85 by January 16th\nStop Missing Market Moves: Get the FREE Barchart Brief – your midday dose of stock movers, trending sectors, and actionable trade ideas, delivered right to your inbox. Sign Up Now!\n\nFor investors looking beyond the obvious AI leaders, here’s a closer look at why NBIS is drawing bullish attention heading into 2026.\nAbout NBIS Stock Based in Amsterdam, Nebius provides full-stack cloud and GPU-accelerated AI infrastructure across Europe and North America. It builds sustainable data centers and rents AI‑optimized compute clusters with liquid cooling and high‑power GPUs to hyperscalers and enterprises. The company emerged from a restructuring of the former Yandex infrastructure business and now combines its core AI cloud service with subsidiaries in autonomous vehicles and education technology.\n\nValued at around $23 billion by market cap, NBIS stock has been stellar this year. After languishing post-restructuring, the shares rallied over the summer, in part when Nvidia (NVDA) disclosed a stake in the company, peaking above $140 by October. A surge in new contracts with tech giants, such as Microsoft and Meta (META), further fueled investor enthusiasm. Until now, Nebius has gained roughly 225% year-to-date (YTD), despite a pullback from the recent high.\nThat performance comes with clear trade-offs. Nebius now trades at valuation levels that leave little room for error. Its trailing price-to-sales multiple sits in the mid-50s, far above the sector median, which trades closer to 4x, and its own 5-year historical average, which sits at 24x.\nIn short, the market is pricing Nebius as a future cornerstone of AI infrastructure. That may prove correct, but it also means any slowdown in contract growth, pricing pressure, or capital-spending misstep could weigh heavily on the stock. At today’s levels, execution matters as much as vision.\n\nStory Continues\nImpact of Ives’ Acquisition Thesis Dan Ives’s endorsement, calling Nebius “ripe” for a 2026 acquisition by a hyperscaler, gave the stock a short-term boost. The day his comments were publicized, NBIS spiked about 14% following the news. Investors interpreted it as validation of Nebius’s strategic value. Ives specifically noted that among AI “neocloud” firms, Nebius is the most likely buyout candidate, which fueled positive sentiment.\n\nFor the company, this means fresh investor interest and higher trading volume, though it’s too early to say if any deal is imminent. In the near term, the news underscores Nebius’s industry stature; if true, a 2026 deal could be transformative. But even absent an actual acquisition, the hype helps spotlight Nebius’s core business and contracts, potentially improving access to capital.\nNebius Delivered Solid Revenue Yet Widened Losses Nebius delivered a strong quarter in Q3 2025, posting revenue of $146.1 million, up 355% year-over-year (YoY), as demand for AI infrastructure surged and large new contracts came online. This growth was largely driven by strong uptake across its core AI infrastructure business, which now accounts for the vast majority of results.\n\nProfitability, however, remains a work in progress. Nebius reported a GAAP net loss of $119.6 million, wider than a year earlier, reflecting aggressive expansion and rising depreciation tied to new data center capacity. But there was a bright spot below the surface. Adjusted EBITDA loss narrowed sharply to $5.2 million, a significant improvement from nearly $46 million last year, as higher revenue began to offset operating expenses.\nOn the other side, spending ramped up sharply as the company accelerated its buildout. Operating cash burn rose to $80.6 million, while capital expenditures jumped to nearly $1.0 billion in the quarter, underscoring how capital-intensive AI infrastructure has become. Even so, Nebius ended the period with a formidable $4.8 billion cash balance, supported by recent equity and debt raises, giving it ample firepower to execute its growth plans.\n\nLooking ahead, management remains aggressive. Nebius is targeting an annualized revenue run rate of $750 million to $1 billion by the end of 2025 and plans to scale connected power capacity to 800 to 1,000 megawatts by 2026, with even more capacity already under contract.\nCEO Arkady Volozh has said the company has effectively sold out its existing capacity, with future capacity already pre-committed. While losses are expected to persist in the near term, the strategy is clear: scale first, optimize later.\nRecent Developments Since the quarter's close, Nebius has continued to make headlines. On Dec. 17, it launched Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 featuring Nvidia’s new Blackwell ultra-power GPUs. The company said it is now “ the first cloud in Europe to operate ” these cutting-edge Nvidia GB300 and HGX B300 systems in production, a technical milestone for customers.\n\nNebius also highlighted its $3 billion AI infrastructure agreement with Meta (announced in September) as a revenue backlog boost. These announcements were viewed positively as further proof of Nebius’s scale and partnerships.\nAnalyst's Perspective on NBIS Stock Wall Street remains broadly positive on NBIS stock, though analysts are clear about the risks. Goldman Sachs reiterated a “Buy” rating in November 2025 and raised its 12-month price target to $155, citing accelerating demand for AI infrastructure and improving visibility on large-scale contracts.\nSimilarly, D.A. Davidson also maintained a “Buy” with a $150 target, while CICC initiated coverage at $143, pointing to Nebius’ growing role in global AI compute buildouts.\n\nTaken together, on average, the rating given by analysts is “Moderate Buy,” and the broader consensus sits at about $150, which implies roughly 70% upside potential, which shows analysts' confidence in Nebius’ growth trajectory rather than near-term profitability.\nHowever, that optimism comes with caveats. Analysts consistently highlight Nebius’ rapid revenue growth and ability to secure large enterprise deals, but many also flag valuation as demanding. The investment case assumes smooth execution, disciplined capital spending, and sustained customer demand. Any stumble could weigh heavily on NBIS stock.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

      "Content": "Nebius Group (NBIS) Is Up 20.8% After Blackwell AI Cloud Deal Wins With Microsoft And Meta – Has The Bull Case Changed?\n\nSimply Wall St\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 9:10 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\nNVDA\n\nEarlier this month, Nebius Group launched Nebius AI Cloud 3.1, rolling out NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra-based infrastructure, real-time capacity tools, and stricter security and governance features for its full-stack AI cloud platform.\nThese upgrades, combined with very large multi-year AI infrastructure agreements with Microsoft and Meta, deepen Nebius’s role as an AI infrastructure provider while heightening execution and funding demands.\nWith Nebius now deploying Blackwell Ultra systems in production, we’ll explore how this changes the company’s investment narrative and risk profile.\n\nThe end of cancer? These 29 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early identification of life changing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.\nNebius Group Investment Narrative Recap To own Nebius, you have to believe that demand for high performance AI infrastructure will stay strong enough for the company to scale capacity, execute its mega-deals with Microsoft and Meta, and move toward sustainable profitability despite heavy capital needs and stock volatility. The Nebius AI Cloud 3.1 launch reinforces that core thesis by putting Blackwell Ultra into production, but it does not materially change the key near term catalyst of capacity build-out and delivery against those contracts, or the biggest risk around funding and execution.\n\nAmong recent announcements, the multi year Microsoft AI infrastructure agreement, valued at over US$19 billion, is the most relevant context for Nebius AI Cloud 3.1. The new Blackwell Ultra based platform and real time capacity tools are what Nebius must lean on to reliably serve that take or pay style contract, which in turn underpins expectations for rapid revenue growth and heightens the importance of managing capital intensity and customer concentration.\nBut while the growth story is appealing, investors should also be aware that customer concentration and funding needs could...\nRead the full narrative on Nebius Group (it's free!)\nNebius Group's narrative projects $3.2 billion revenue and $428.7 million earnings by 2028.\nUncover how Nebius Group's forecasts yield a $159.29 fair value , a 75% upside to its current price.\n\nExploring Other Perspectives Thirty one members of the Simply Wall St Community currently see Nebius’s fair value anywhere between US$15.07 and US$159.29, reflecting sharply different expectations.

      "Content": "This Dividend-Yielding Tech Stock Looks a ‘Compelling Buy’ for 2026 After 2 Years of Underperformance\n\nMohit Oberoi\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 4:30 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nWith year-to-date (YTD) gains of just about 15%, Microsoft (MSFT) is underperforming both the broad-based S&P 500 Index ($SPX) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX). The Satya Nadella-led company underperformed last year as well, and its gains of 12% in 2024 paled in comparison to its tech peers as well as the broader markets.\nIncidentally, the “Magnificent 7,” which led the market rally from the front in 2023 and 2024, did not have the best of years, and none of them made it to the list of top 20 gainers in the S&P 500 Index in 2025. The group’s collective price action has been below par, and only Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are outperforming their average S&P 500 Index peer by a noticeable margin. Meanwhile, after the 2025 underperformance, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities—a known perma tech bull—sees MSFT stock rising to $625 next year and termed it a “compelling buy.” Notably, while tech stocks aren’t really known for their dividends and many don’t pay one in the first place, Microsoft’s dividend yield of 0.75% is the highest among Magnificent 7 stocks. It is on the verge of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat.\n\nMore News from Barchart 2 Dividend Kings Quietly Beating the Market This Year\nThis Dividend Stock Just Scored an FDA Win.

Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nWhy Did Microsoft Underperform in 2025? Microsoft’s 2025 underperformance has largely been due to concerns over its burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) capex. The company, which previously said that its capex growth would fall in the fiscal year 2026, now sees it going up instead. The Windows parent splurged almost $35 billion towards capex in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, which ended in September, a record for the company.\n\nTo be sure, rising AI capex is not a Microsoft thing, and Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet have also bumped up spending amid the AI arms race. Barring Alphabet, which entered 2025 with tepid expectations and ended up impressing with its financial performance, the other three are underperforming this year. I find an Alphabet connection to Microsoft’s underperformance. While Gemini gaining ground at OpenAI’s cost helped propel GOOG stock higher, it put pressure on Microsoft, which is OpenAI’s biggest investor and a proxy play on the world’s most valuable unlisted startup.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft Stock's 2026 Forecast Despite the 2025 underperformance, the analyst community is not giving up on Microsoft, and it has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” from the 48 analysts polled by Barchart . MSFT stock trades even below the Street-low target price of $490, while the mean target price of $629.23 is almost 30% higher than current price levels.\n\nNotably, Ives’ target price of $625 is similar to the consensus price target and the same as Wolfe Research, which lowered MSFT’s target price by $50 earlier this month. Looking at the recent action, DA Davidson and Jefferies maintained their bullish bets on Microsoft this month while maintaining their respective target prices of $675 and $650.\nIs MSFT Stock a Buy for 2026? I remain constructive on MSFT stock heading into 2026. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30.6x, which I find balanced. The P/E-to-growth (PEG) multiples do look a bit ugly at 1.82x, but that’s got to do with AI capex hitting the company’s profits in the form of higher capex. “Big Short” Michael Burry’s controversial views on tech companies’ inflating the useful life of AI chips notwithstanding, companies like Microsoft are set to face higher depreciation expenses over the next couple of years.\n\nThere is a lot to like about Microsoft at these levels, though. The stock is a defensive play with a well-diversified business. The company’s Windows and Office business would continue to benefit from the uptick in PC sales, led by an aging base of installed devices and the advent of AI PCs. The ending of Windows 10 support would also help keep that segment buoyed, as more users would feel urged to upgrade to Windows 11.\nMoreover, AI is fueling demand for subscriptions, which would add to Microsoft’s topline. The cloud business is particularly growing at a brisk pace, and Microsoft is closing the gap with market leader Amazon. Specifically, during their recent earnings call, Microsoft said that its commercial cloud remaining performance obligations (RPO) soared 50% to $400 billion at the end of September, with a weighted average duration of just two years.\nOverall, while I haven’t been a permabull on MSFT, I have used the dips to add to my positions, something I repeated this time around as well. At these levels, I find MSFT stock a decent buy and see it delivering double-digit returns next year.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: MSFT, GOOG, NVDA, AMZN, META.

Here's My No. 4\n\nPatrick Sanders, The Motley Fool\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nKey Points Microsoft's suite of productivity software is a must-have tool in any business setting.\nRevenue from its Intelligent Cloud sector may soon surpass that of its business software segment.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft ›\nWhen you think about computer software, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is certainly one of the first companies that comes to mind. Microsoft has made a fortune from its Microsoft 365 suite of applications, which includes programs such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams -- all of which are important for any business setting.\n\nMicrosoft has become a computing powerhouse that also sells personal computers, operating systems, tablets, and gaming consoles, as well as the LinkedIn social media platform, the Edge browser and the Bing search web engine. Through its early investment in OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, it's working closely in the field of artificial intelligence, bringing the revolutionary technology to bear to help users boost productivity and automate tasks. And it's a major hyperscaler through its Microsoft Azure cloud computing division, which is addressing a growing need for data center capacity as companies seek to leverage AI applications in their operations.\nThis is the fourth in a series of articles in which I'm ranking the best \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks to buy for 2026, in reverse order. In previous installments, I unveiled Apple as my No. 7 choice , Amazon in the No. 6 spot, and Tesla as the fifth-ranked stock.\nHere's why I'm ranking Microsoft, which has a market capitalization of $3.6 trillion, as the No. 4 Magnificent Seven stock to buy for 2026.\nAbout Microsoft stock Microsoft, headquartered in Redmond, Washington, has become a leading AI stock. In addition to its cloud computing services, Microsoft was an early adopter in incorporating generative AI into its search engine. It also rolled out Microsoft Copilot as a generative AI tool for its Microsoft 365 products.\n\n\"Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high-value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,\" CEO Satya Nadella said. \"It's why we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.\"\nThe company operates in three primary business segments: Productivity and Office Processes, which includes Microsoft 365 suite and LinkedIn; Intelligent Cloud, which includes Azure and cloud services; and More Personal Computing, which includes Windows, Bing, Surface devices, and Xbox gaming consoles.\n\nStory Continues\nThat combination has led to rapid growth for Microsoft over the last decade, with revenue increasing by more than 230% during that period. Earnings per share and net income are both up more than 500%.\nIn 2025, shares are up 15%, which roughly equals the growth of the S&P 500 index. Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended Sept. 30, 2025) showed revenue of $77.7 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Net income was $27.7 billion, up 12%, and earnings per share of $3.72 was up 13% from the previous year.\nSegment\nQ1 2026 Revenue\n% Revenue Change from Q1 2025\nQ1 2026 Operating Income\n% Operating Income Change from Q1 2025\nProductivity and Business Processes\n$33.02 billion\n16.6%\n$20.41 billion\n23.5%\nIntelligent Cloud\n$30.89 billion\n28.2%\n$13.39 billion\n27.5%\nMore Personal Computing\n$13.75 billion\n4.4%\n$4.16 billion\n17.8%\n\nSource: Microsoft\nThe lucrative Intelligent Cloud segment is growing rapidly, and if it maintains this growth trajectory, it will surpass Microsoft's signature productivity software tools as its most lucrative segment.\nWhy Microsoft deserves the No. 4 spot All of the Magnificent Seven stocks are excellent companies, and each is a worthy addition to any portfolio. But when you're looking at the seven companies as a grouping, Microsoft is squarely in the middle of the pack.\nI believe it has a stronger growth engine than Apple, a more effective business model (with higher profit margins) than Amazon's massive e-commerce division, and is less volatile than Tesla. But at the same time, the remaining companies on this list ( Nvidia , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms ) have what I see as more dynamic opportunities to grow in 2026. That's why I'm putting Microsoft in the No. 4 spot.\n\nIf you're looking for a solid, reliable, but not explosive Magnificent Seven stock for 2026, Microsoft is a good bet.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

I I would argue we might be seeing the signs of a a broader stock market bubble. and I'm saying I'm not saying I'm right. It's hard to predict these things. Maybe I have don't have any clue what I'm talking about. But do you see signs that investors are too just uh anxious to own stocks here?\n00:29 George\nOh, yeah. And you've got the percentage of American households that own stocks being at all-time highs right now as well. So, are we rich? Are we in something of a bubble? Yes, I would agree with that. But I would say that the the fad trades, whether it's AI or space or defense tech or things like that are in much more of a bubble than for instance, healthcare, which you brought up earlier. It's it's a market of stocks, it's not a stock market. So you go look at stocks that have a bright future and are going to do well and that aren't so overvalued that your margin of safety is is low. But you don't say, oh, I'm not going to own any AI. I'm not going to own Google and Amazon because it's it's they're spending too much and it's not real. You you own you you're balanced, you're diversified. You've got exposure to everything. You just may wait something a little higher that's much more attractive. And one other comment about small caps is the Fed is still cutting interest rates and small caps have a lot more debt than some of these mega cap stocks. So they they get a bump on their earnings just by uh re re uh redoing their debt and getting lower interest rates on their debt or having less debt to pay or paying it down. So they've got a a lot of wins at their back right now.\n01:54 Speaker A\nSam, you are a master of all things data. You've seen a lot of cycles. Do you see irrational exuberance in markets?\n02:04 Sam\nWell, as George had mentioned, uh yeah, I guess though in terms of valuations by by the end of October of this year, we were trading at two standard deviations above the mean uh for the S&P 500's PE ratio. You're looking at the uh Buffet indicator, which is the market cap of the S&P 500 divided by the uh nominal GDP and normally we would get nervous between 100 and 120% as we did before the uh tech bubble bursting in 2000, financial crisis in 07 and then uh the Covid uh bear market of 2020. Uh, but today we're at about 190%. Um, so I would tend to say that yes, valuations are elevated, um, but they could last a bit longer. Uh some has there has to be some sort of a trigger uh and right now we haven't found it yet.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Trump’s $100,000 H-1B Visa Application Fee Upheld by Judge\n\nMadlin Mekelburg\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 8:18 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nTCS.BO\n\nMSFT\n\nMETA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge said the Trump administration can move ahead with a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, providing a setback for US technology companies that rely on hiring skilled foreign workers.\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell said in a ruling Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s effort to radically increase the cost of the popular visa is lawful. The decision gives a boost to the administration’s campaign to restrict immigration and push demand for US workers. The US Chamber of Commerce, which sued to block the proposal, can appeal.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNew York's Congestion Pricing Is Working. Five Charts Show How\nAs Zipcar Leaves London, Car-Share Boosters Are Looking for a New Ride\nWhen It Comes to US Transportation, 2025 Had Some Wins, Too\nHowell rejected the Chamber’s argument that Trump doesn’t have the power to impose the fee, finding that his proclamation was issued under “an express statutory grant of authority to the President.”\nCongress has given the president broad authority that he used to address “in the manner he sees fit, a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security,” she wrote.\nDaryl Joseffer, the Chamber’s executive vice president, said in a statement the $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive.\n“We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations,” Joseffer said.\n\nThe Chamber, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, argued in its October lawsuit that raising the fee is unlawful because it overrides federal immigration law and exceeds the fee-setting authority afforded by Congress.\nA group of 19 state attorneys general also is challenging Trump’s proclamation. Their lawsuit focuses on the projected impact to the public sector, particularly in the fields of health care and education, that also rely on the H-1B visa program. A separate suit was filed by a global nurse-staffing agency.\nThe ruling Tuesday, a so-called summary judgment that doesn’t require a trial, doesn’t have an impact on the other lawsuits, meaning another judge could still block the new visa fee in the months to come. The other cases include a suit filed in Massachusetts earlier this month by more than a dozen mostly Democratic-led states, as well as a suit filed in October in California by a global nurse-staffing agency and several unions.\nBoth of the other cases are also being handled by Obama appointees, and neither judge has yet ruled on any requests for injunctions against the rule. A hearing in the California case is set for Feb. 12 in Oakland. The dispute is likely to ultimately be resolved by the US Supreme Court.\n\nStory Continues\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of employment-based immigration, allowing companies in the US to hire college-educated foreign workers for specialized occupations. In September, Trump signed a proclamation to increase the application fee to discourage companies from abusing a program that he claimed displaces US workers.\n\nIt’s a stark shift from America’s historical stance toward immigration. Since its founding, the US has welcomed people from diverse countries and economic backgrounds who come to the US in search of a better life and more freedom.\nYet while Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have mused about the prospects of a windfall for the US Treasury that could total $100 billion or more, immigration attorneys have cautioned that an increase in cost of this magnitude would cause major disruptions that would be likely very expensive to the US economy.\n“This puts a chilling effect on America’s employers,” said Michael Wildes, a managing partner at the New York-based immigration law firm Wildes and Weinberg PC. “How can you make America great by taking away the talent pool?” Wildes noted that “it’s a limiting law in that America will skip a beat. There will be a generation of talent out there in the world that will go to other countries. We will be missing an opportunity and that is foolhardy.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the US Department of Homeland Security said it will replace the lottery for choosing H-1B visa applicants with a weighted selection to overcome wage arbitrage and incentivize American employers “to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers.” There are also proposals being considered to impose a wage floor.\nH-1B visas are awarded based on a lottery system, but are used primarily in the tech industry. Amazon, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. are among the companies with the greatest number of H-1B visas, according to the US government.\nThe visa fees will shape hiring efforts, but affect some jobs and companies more than others, said Alexis DuFresne, founder of recruiting firm Archer Search Partners, which specializes in recruitment for alternative financial asset managers.\n\nFor “superstars” in highly-paid, specialized roles, or for jobs that generate a lot of revenue, organizations will be willing to pay the $100,000 fee, she said.\nBut the high cost will change how people making hiring decisions approach looking for employees in more run-of-the-mill jobs, DuFresne said. “If you’re going to search, you’re going to tell the search people ‘Don’t look globally for me. Look domestically for me,’” she said of such common jobs.\nLikewise, organizations with offices around the world will be able to respond to the recruitment costs by shifting where they hire, according to DuFresne. “The firms that it’s going to affect the most are the smaller firms,” she said.\nThe tech industry has been adapting to changes in US immigration rules for a while now as political currents shift.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s Google is taking steps to help move employees off of H-1B visas and onto more permanent status. The company recently told staff it will be “ramping up” PERM applications next year for eligible employees, Business Insider reported, taking a crucial step to securing a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\nBeyond the US tech companies, the action also hits India hard, as Indians have been the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In addition to the extra costs that Indian IT companies will bear for thousands of employees on such visas, the ongoing unpredictability has unnerved many Indian professionals working in US tech, finance, health care and other industries, especially after the recent mass postponement of work-visa appointments.\n\nThe case is Chamber of Commerce vs. US Department of Homeland Security, 25-cv-03675, US District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).\n--With assistance from Jake Bleiberg, Erik Larson and Patrick Howell O'Neill.\n(Updates with expert comments in 14th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nChina’s EV Battery Giant Is Trying to Find a New Road\nTariffs Unravel India’s Dream of Challenging China in Toymaking\nThe United States of Klarna\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "AI & Security Push Aids Google Cloud: What's Ahead for GOOGL Stock?\n\nAniruddha Ganguly\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 7:49 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nGOOGL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nAlphabet GOOGL is riding on a strong Google Cloud prospect, which accounts for more than 14% of GOOGL’s revenues. In the trailing nine-month period ended Sept. 30, Google Cloud revenues jumped 31.2% over the same year-ago time frame to $41.04 billion. The top line benefited from growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across core products, AI Infrastructure and generative AI (Gen AI) Solutions. Cloud backlog jumped 46% sequentially to $155 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2025. The AI and security push is expected to boost Google Cloud’s prospects in the near term.\n\nAlphabet’s expanding AI infrastructure is helping Alphabet win enterprise clients. GCP’s prospects remain robust, driven by strong demand for enterprise AI infrastructure, including TPUs (led by seventh-generation Ironwood) and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for the latest Gemini and other AI models, and other services, including cybersecurity and data analytics. Google Cloud is also benefiting from strong Gen AI adoption due to leading models, including Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Chirp and Lyria. In the third quarter of 2025, revenues from products developed on Google’s Gen AI models surged more than 200% year over year.\n\nSecurity push is expected to drive Google Cloud’s top-line growth further. The addition of Wiz (acquisition pending, expected to complete in 2026) to Google Cloud will boost competitive prowess against the likes of Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT in the cloud computing space. The latest collaboration between Google Cloud and Palo Alto Networks combines Google Cloud’s AI and infrastructure capabilities with Prisma AIRS, the latter’s comprehensive AI security platform. Accelerating investments bodes well for GOOGL’s prospects. Alphabet expects capital expenditure between $91 billion and $93 billion for 2025, which is anticipated to increase further in 2026.\n\nGOOGL Faces Tough Competition in Cloud Domain Per Synergy Research Group data, Amazon’s share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 29% in the third quarter of 2025, ahead of Microsoft’s Azure platform at 20% and Google Cloud at 13%.\n\nAmazon is spending heavily on fortifying its Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure that supports AI workloads and expanded data center capacity. Amazon committed $125 billion in capital expenditure for 2025, with the vast majority directed toward AWS infrastructure. The third quarter alone saw $34.2 billion in cash capex, while the company added 3.8 gigawatts of power capacity over 12 months, the largest expansion in cloud history.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Microsoft Azure and other cloud services revenues accelerated 40% in constant currency (cc), with management attributing significant contributions to AI-related demand. Microsoft Cloud revenues reached $49.1 billion, increasing 25% in cc and reflecting strong enterprise adoption of cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities. Spending is expected to accelerate throughout fiscal 2026, with roughly half to be spent on GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand and AI workload expansion.\n\nStory Continues\nGOOGL’s Share Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates Alphabet shares have appreciated 60.5% in the trailing 12 months, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s return of 21.6%.\nGOOGL Stock Outperforms Sector\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe GOOGL stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 9.67X compared with the broader sector’s 6.55X.

Based on comments he has made, a tech stock he would've liked to have bought is Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) -- and there's a surprising reason why he didn't.\nWhy Warren Buffett never invested in Microsoft Microsoft has been one of the largest companies in the world for decades. At Berkshire's 2018 annual meeting, an audience member asked Buffett why he never bought shares, especially considering Berkshire's investments in Apple .\nHe answered that in the earlier years, he simply missed out (in his own words, \"the answer's stupidity\"). Buffett's investment strategy is to only invest in what you understand, and he has been selective with tech businesses.\n\nHowever, Buffett also explained that \"it would just be a mistake for Berkshire to buy Microsoft\" because of his friendship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who also served on Berkshire's board of directors. If Berkshire invested in Microsoft before a better-than-expected earnings report or any other positive news, outside observers might speculate that Gates had shared information with Buffett.\nMicrosoft would've been a great stock for Berkshire's portfolio, as it's up 798% over the last 10 years (as of Dec. 18). The S&P 500 has appreciated 241% over the same time period. Along with outperforming the market, Microsoft has also delivered six consecutive quarters of revenue growth, in part because of its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.\n\nFor Buffett, it was more important to avoid the appearance of impropriety than to invest in Microsoft. Even without Microsoft, Berkshire's portfolio includes numerous strong businesses across various market sectors.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now? Before you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

He also leads a weekly meeting where he pushes teams hard on execution.

      "Content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year (Dec 24)\n\nJoel South\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 5:15 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nTSM\n\nTSMWF\n\nMSFT\n\nTM\n\nShares of Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) have popped 5.2% in the past week, after it announced it would begin shipping H200 chips to China in February and that it would invest $1.5 billion on a server farm in Israel. Nvidia’s stock is 30.2% higher than six months ago, outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in that time.\n\n24/7 Wall St. Key Points U.S.-China trade relations have presented headwinds, but Nvidia Corp. ( NASDAQ: NVDA ) is also the dominant AI chipmaker in the market, and the company’s profitability remains strong.\nHere is a look at where Nvidia stock could be headed for the rest of this year and into the next.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nNote that gains for the chipmaker in that time have helped wipe away the steep drop the stock suffered early in 2025, after it reported it would take a $5.5 billion charge tied to the H20 chip export restrictions to China. While some analysts have raised price targets, others caution about ongoing headwinds due to uncertainty surrounding future U.S.-China trade relations and the potential for stricter regulations. The third-quarter report was stellar on the top and bottom lines due to strong growth in the data center segment.\nDespite its challenges, the company's pivot to U.S. AI infrastructure investments signals resilience. With analysts eyeing robust data center demand, 24/7 Wall St. here explores whether Nvidia can sustain its recovery and drive further growth.\n\nWhy Invest in Nvidia? Nvidia faces significant hurdles as it navigates U.S.-China trade restrictions and intense market expectations. In the first quarter, export controls on its H20 AI chip—which had been designed specifically to circumvent export restrictions on advanced technology to China—led to the substantial write-down noted above. Analysts believed the ban could result in a $9 billion revenue hit. Some $700 million would affect fiscal first-quarter results, with the remaining $8 billion spread across the second and third quarters.\n\nU.S. tariffs and China’s retaliatory measures also threatened supply chain costs, particularly for components sourced globally, while competition from Huawei’s Ascend chips grows. These factors had analysts warning of margin pressure. Yet, Nvidia's profitability remains robust. The company has reportedly raised prices 10% to 15% on some of its most popular GPUs as a result of the tariffs. Gaming processor prices jumped 5% to 10%, while it hiked high-end AI GPUs as much as 15% to account for surging manufacturing costs and to keep its earnings stable.\n\nStory Continues\nYet investments in U.S. AI infrastructure, supported by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's $165 billion Arizona fab expansion, bolster Nvidia's supply chains and are backed by its $37.6 billion cash reserve.\nCEO Huang announced during his recent trip to South Korea that Nvidia will supply more than 260,000 advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) to South Korean firms, including Samsung and Hyundai Motor. He believes AI has reached a \"virtuous cycle\" where improvements in the models lead to more investment, which in turn leads to further improvement and investment. He also expressed hope that trade talks between the U.S. and China might lead to a change in policy that allows Nvidia to resume sales of state-of-the-art chips in China. As mentioned, the U.S. president has now allowed the company to sell its advanced H200 AI chips to China.\n\nThe AI market is projected to grow at a 37% CAGR through 2030, according to Grand View Research. This supports Nvidia’s $170 billion fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, a 30% increase over the $130.5 billion it generated in 2025.\nNvidia as a Company In its third-quarter earnings report, Nvidia revenue totaled a record $57.01 billion, including $51.2 billion from its data center division. The total was up 66% year over year, largely fueled by the voracious demand for its AI chips.\nThe chipmaker invested $3.2 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, expanding Blackwell accelerator production and AI infrastructure. The company's capex has spiked over 200% this year to more than $3 billion to meet hyperscaler demand.\n\nU.S.-China trade restrictions still pose risks, even with the seeming thaw, tariffs could raise costs, which would explain the price hikes reportedly implemented. A 36% operating expense increase to $5.8 billion for R&D offset Nvidia's adjusted operating income of $37.8 billion.\nYet, Nvidia's growth is not solely tied to data centers. The company expanded its automotive segment, with a 32% year-over-year increase to $592 million, driven by partnerships with Toyota and Aurora Innovation for autonomous vehicles. This diversifies Nvidia's portfolio amid tariff uncertainties.\nNvidia has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of $65 billion, plus or minus 2%. This outlook exceeded analysts' consensus projection.\nNvidia as a Stock This has been a rollercoaster year for Nvidia shareholders. The stock dropped to a 52-week low of $86.62 in April. After an announced pause in U.S.-China tariffs and the first-quarter results, the share price recovered. It hit an all-time high of $212.19 in October, which had the company's market cap briefly over $5 trillion.\n\nWhile some insiders have been selling shares, analyst sentiment remains bullish. Of 64 analysts who cover the stock, 60 recommend buying shares, 11 of them with Strong Buy ratings. Their consensus one-year price target is $253.02, which signals over 38% upside potential from its current price. Targets range from $140 to $352 per share.\nCitigroup, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and others recently maintained their Buy-equivalent ratings. Evercore ISI has the street-high target price. It cited accelerating revenue growth, strong demand for Blackwell chips, an improving supply chain, and a significant pipeline. Yet, renowned investor Michael Burry is bearish on Nvidia.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\nChange From Current Price\nLow\n$140.00\n−23.5%\nMedian\n$253.02\n38.3%\nHigh\n$352.00\n92.4%\n\nNvidia's AI dominance, 93% data center growth, and automotive partnerships with Toyota positioned the company for gains in 2025. However, tariff risks and DeepSeek’s competitive AI models require caution. The AI market's growth and the chipmaker's $47 billion second-quarter revenue position Nvidia to achieve its $170 billion full-year revenue target, while its cash buffer and Stargate Project role offer stability. Still, valuation concerns linger. Nvidia is a buy for growth-oriented investors, but others should use caution.\n\n24/7 Wall St.'s 2026 year-end price target for Nvidia is $300.14 per share, which would be a 640.% gain. That estimate accounts for tariff risks, competition from DeepSeek, and potential Blackwell supply constraints. It also reflects Nvidia's AI dominance and second-quarter 2026 revenue guidance.\nTime to Sell Nvidia Stock as Michael Burry Takes Aim?\n\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

      "Content": "The 20-Year Signal: Preparing for the Predicted Reversal of AI-Fueled Stock Market Gains\n\nDavid Beren\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:45 AM PST 8 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nThere is no question that artificial intelligence has transformed the stock market as we know it over the past three years, all but single-handedly driving the S&P 500 to record after record. Companies that are sitting at the forefront of this technology, like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), Google ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), have delivered returns that seemed impossible just a few years ago.\n\nQuick Read The Shiller CAPE ratio sits above 35, a level seen only twice before: the Great Depression and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\nThe S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022. The Mag 7 tech stocks now represent 30% of total S&P 500 market value.\nAfter the 2000 peak at similar CAPE levels, the S&P 500 fell 49% over 2.5 years and took 7 years to recover.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMost importantly, the AI technology is real, and so far, the enthusiasm for this technology has been mostly justified, all while the long-term potential (and dangers) seems incredible. For investors who have stayed the course, portfolios have grown in a massive way over the last 36 months. But, and there is always a but, beneath this celebratory growth, there is a warning signal that has emerged.\nThis indicator, which looks at the close relationships between stock prices and underlying economics, hasn't flashed at current levels in over 20 years, not since the dot-com bubble that burst in the early 2000s. The last time this signal appeared, it was followed by a multi-year bear market that erased roughly half of the market's overall value. While history doesn't always repeat itself, it does at least suggest that we need to look at these readings and consider, as investors, what the next smart move really is.\n\nAI Mania Drives Stocks to Historic, Record Highs The artificial intelligence revolution has, without question, captivated investors in a way that almost no other technology has. The belief that AI is going to and has already started to automate work, revolutionize manufacturing, and create entirely new industries is just scratching the surface of what investors are thinking about.\n\nFor companies that are in the AI world, all of this speculation and promise has led to explosive revenue growth. For example, NVIDIA's data center business has become one of the fastest-growing divisions in corporate America, and Microsoft's AI integration across basically its entire product lineup is driving enterprise adoption. In other words, this technology is actually driving real revenue.\n\nStory Continues\nThis technological transformation has driven stock prices to levels that would have seemed absurd three years ago. The S&P 500 has surged almost 80% since late 2022, and NVIDIA has seen its market cap grow by trillions. The Mag 7's technology stocks represent a whopping 30% of the entire S&P 500 market value, a level not seen since the 1990s. Valuations have also exploded as the forward P/E of the S&P 500 now hovers around 21 to 22, 40% above historical averages.\n\nThe optimism that is driving these valuation numbers is assuming that AI will continue to deliver double-digit earnings growth for years to come. More importantly, it also assumes that AI adoption won't have any obstacles to adoption in the coming years and that companies building AI infrastructure will continue generating returns to justify their current high stock prices and valuations.\nThis pattern of pricing in future success isn't new, as the late 1990s boom also seemed a trajectory where investors were basically paying today for profits they expected companies to deliver in the next five years. However, as the world knows, the technology of the internet boom from the 1990s succeeded, it's how you're reading this today, but many of the stocks crashed because valuations got too far ahead of any financial reality.\n\nA Rare Signal Not Seen in Two Decades: What the Indicator Means The warning signal that is flashing today is the Shiller CAPE ratio, a number that is an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio that measures stock prices relative to average inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This metric attempts to smooth out short-term earnings volatility and give a longer-lens look at valuation extremes. As of December 2025, the Shiller CAPE sits above 35, a level that has only been seen twice in modern history: the Great Depression market crash and the 1999-2000 tech bubble peak.\n\nThe last time the US saw the CAPE ratio reach these current levels was in early 2000, right before the stock-market crash. At that peak, investors were paying extreme premiums for stocks based on the expectation (think hope) that internet companies would continue to just deliver on their unprecedented growth. History reminds us that the reality of what took place was that these companies did not enjoy unstoppable growth and that the market declined 49% over a 2.5-year period, the NASDAQ fell 78%, and it took 7 years to recover.\nThe CAPE ratio's predictive power comes from understanding long-term perspectives, and unlike traditional P/E ratios that can be distorted by temporary earnings spikes or collapses, the CAPE ratio looks with a wide lens at a full decade of earnings. When this ratio does hit 30, it can be a historical signal that stocks are priced for perfection and have almost no room for disappointment.\n\nWhat makes the current signal particularly troubling is that it isn't just existing in a silo. Instead, it's appearing alongside three other late-cycle indicators like three consecutive years of double-digit S&P 500 gains, forward P/E ratios at 40-year highs, extreme concentration in a handful of mega-cap stocks, and retail investor enthusiasm that feels eerily like the dot-com bubble. While no single indicator is going to be definitive, the combination of all three suggests that a major reversal could be on the horizon, and an entire generation of investors has never experienced what happens when valuations are this stretched.\nHistory's Verdict: A Reversal is Coming - How Smart Investors Respond History is pretty unambiguous about what can happen when an extreme CAPE reading is taking place. For one, you might be in a position that creates a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity. At the 1929 stock peak, stocks fell 89% over three years, and again in 2000, you had the 49% S&P 500 drop over 2.5 years. What a drop might look like in the near future is unknown, but the pattern that occurred during these two previous instances of extreme valuations resolving through major corrections seems to be all too familiar to what we're going through now with AI.\n\nFor investors, this could be the strategic opportunity they have been waiting for rather than a situation full of panic. The mistake during previous bubbles wasn't recognizing that stocks were not expensive, but it was remaining fully invested at those prices and then panic-selling at the bottom. The smart approach today is about recognizing that current valuations create a situation where the downside potential far exceeds any upside of staying fully invested.\nBuilding a cash reserve now so investors can \"buy the dip,\" as the saying goes, is arguably the best move, to the tune of upward of 30% of a portfolio being liquidated for cash or put into short-term bonds. If the market does decline by 40-50% from current levels, this cash can be invested into companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA at valuations these companies haven't experienced in years. This could give investors a chance to double their position size.\n\nThe key here is going to be the right amount of discipline, as history shows that bear market pain isn't the actual decline itself, it's the psychology of trying to understand how to buy at the bottom. If the market falls 30%, there might be a voice going on that says it's going to 50% and if it falls 50%, total economic collapse might be the voice on the news. In other words, investors should have capital reserved for buying during these panics so they can ignore the noise and acquire quality companies at steep discounts and prepare for the next decade's best returns.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "How a Silicon Valley dealmaker charmed Trump and gave Intel a lifeline\n\nMax A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:05 AM PST 11 min read\n\nIn this article: INTC\n\nNVDA\n\nAMD\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAMZN\n\nBy Max A. Cherney and Jeffrey Dastin\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - It was a Thursday before dawn in Silicon Valley when Intel ( INTC ) CEO Lip-Bu Tan found himself under attack by the president of the United States.\n“The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at 4:39 AM Pacific Time on August 7. Before he was Intel CEO, Tan had been a prolific investor in companies in China.\n\nTrump and Tan had not met. While technology leaders from Nvidia , AMD, OpenAI , Amazon, Google and Palantir had all recently traveled to see Trump, the head of America’s most storied chipmaker had not spent time with the president since joining Intel in March.\nPolitics was not Tan’s top priority. It had been more than 20 years since Tan, 66, had donated to a presidential election campaign. Though ​he spoke with a handful of U.S. government leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in April, the Intel CEO did not fill the company’s top policy job in Washington for months after its prior holder, a Democrat, resigned.\n\nAlmost immediately after Trump’s attack, Intel scrambled to lock down time with the president, two people with knowledge of the situation said. That culminated in the most pivotal, roughly 40-minute meeting of Tan’s decades-long career.\nPreviously unreported details about Tan and Intel show ‌how a man Trump had accused of supporting China’s interests came away from the meeting with a commitment from the U.S. government to invest billions of dollars for a nearly 10% stake in the company.\n\nThe deal gave Intel a too-strategic-to-fail aura and opened doors to potential partners who might want to win the president’s favor. It also may pave the way for the government to take more equity stakes in businesses the administration deems strategic, in what some investors previously described to Reuters as ushering in a new era of U.S. industrial policy.\nIntel’s share price has risen around 80% since Tan’s appointment, outpacing the percentage gains of the ‌S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ) in that time.\nReuters spoke with around 20 people who are current and former Intel employees, government advisers, and Tan’s industry contacts. Some of them questioned whether Tan has the technical acumen to restore Intel’s lead in chip manufacturing and find a winning artificial intelligence strategy, even as his skills as a dealmaker served him well in the Oval Office and elsewhere.\nThough Intel’s chips powered some of the first mass-produced PCs, years of dysfunction had allowed foreign competitors such as TSMC to eclipse Intel in high-end chip production.\n\nStory Continues\nIn statements, an Intel spokesperson said Tan needed no persuading to engage with the Trump administration. Early on, he elevated government affairs, among other functions, to report to him. Intel announced in December that a Trump economic adviser would helm the unit.\n“Lip-Bu Tan has a long, and well-established history of engagement in Washington, both before and after joining Intel,” the spokesperson said. Intel declined to make Tan available for an interview.\n\nA White House spokesperson said President Trump was using his executive power to get “the best bargain for the American taxpayer” and safeguard U.S. security.\n“The Administration’s historic deal with Intel is one of many initiatives to reshore semiconductor and other critical manufacturing back to the United States,” the White House spokesperson said.\n40 MINUTES IN THE OVAL OFFICE Before heading into the White House, Tan called on his own allies who had forged relationships with the president, including Microsoft ( MSFT ) CEO Satya Nadella and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, to vouch for him, said two people familiar with the discussions.\nTan “spoke, as he does often, with confidantes who would have relevant insight and perspective ahead of his meeting with President Trump,” the Intel spokesperson said. Nvidia and Microsoft did ⁠not comment for this story.\n\nPrior to the meeting, Tan strategized with his advisors on how to convince Trump he was an American patriot by discussing his personal story and his ‌commitment to the United States, the two people said. He also prepared to discuss his China holdings, the people said.\nTan has made some 600 investments in China, some linked to the country’s military, according to Reuters reporting. Those connections to China are what ultimately landed him in the crosshairs of the president. Two of Tan's investment firms — Walden International and Walden Catalyst — did not answer requests for comment. A third, Celesta Capital, said it had made one China investment that it exited in 2020.\nHis dealmaking acumen, Celesta Capital said, is a key reason Tan “is so well suited to lead Intel’s current moment.”\n\nJust two cabinet members joined the meeting between Trump and Tan in the Oval Office: Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, one of the people said. Trump questioned the Intel CEO about how he planned to ‍turn the company around, the person said.\nTan had already told Lutnick in a prior meeting that he did not want billions in handouts that the U.S. owed Intel as part of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Secretary said in a video on X in August. Neither Lutnick nor Tan said why. The grant money had been offered to companies under the 2022 CHIPS Act in exchange for reviving domestic manufacturing so the U.S. could reduce its reliance on foreign semiconductor production.\nThe administration of former President Joe Biden had announced dozens of these awards to various chip-related companies.\n\nSo when Trump proposed that the U.S. receive equity in exchange for giving Intel more CHIPS Act money - an idea that two sources said Lutnick had talked about for weeks with government staff - Tan struck a deal. Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the private conversation, but Lutnick later said in the video that equity made the exchange “fair.”\nThe deal gave Intel a $5.7 billion cash infusion and set up the U.S. government to be its largest shareholder. After the initial meeting, Tan pledged to “make Intel great again” in the video that Lutnick posted on social media, with the caption, “The Art ​of the Deal: Intel.”\nWithin weeks of his White House coup, Tan finalized a partnership with Nvidia, securing $5 billion from its CEO Huang who called Tan his “long-time friend.” Unlike Intel, known for manufacturing chips called central processing units, Nvidia designs the world’s top chips for AI.\n\nTrump celebrated the deal on social media, posting an AI-generated image of himself staring at a chart of Intel’s stock and showing how the value of the U.S. stake had risen by 50% after Nvidia’s investment.\nINTEL’S VENTURE CAPITALIST CEO Born in Malaysia ‌to a Chinese-language journalist and a teacher, Tan started out in the hard sciences and had plans to become a nuclear engineer, but he ultimately went to business school and in or around 1983 got his first job in venture capital in California.\nDuring his career, Tan established himself as a man with a golden touch with startups that successfully were sold to other companies or went public. He amassed an estimated personal fortune well above $500 million.\n\nTan’s dealmaking savvy is helping Intel only to a point, three people with knowledge of the company said. For instance, Tan’s bid to buy SambaNova was the subject of internal debate given how the startup makes application-specific AI chips while the market favored general-purpose ones.\nAdditionally, these people said, chipmaking requires more engineering expertise than a typical tech business. Factories that make advanced chips rely on tools so precise they could pinpoint a U.S. quarter-dollar coin as far away as the moon. Some of its most successful executives, like Nvidia’s Huang, are electrical engineers by training.\nStill, some Wall Street analysts say Tan is an excellent choice for Intel CEO, with decades of chip-industry experience and a track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\n\n“Lip-Bu is deeply involved in technical decisions, including product roadmaps,” the Intel spokesperson said. “These are technical, hands-on changes that highlight the depth of his technical leadership.”\nTan was also “keenly aware” of Intel’s challenges when he took the CEO job, the Intel spokesperson said, because he had served on its board from 2022 until 2024.\nBut once inside Intel – which had around 100,000 staff when he joined - the complexity of the chip manufacturer was unlike anything Tan had faced as a CEO before, said two of the sources, who worked at Intel.\nThe company was bleeding cash to build factories for chip manufacturing, an effort begun under his predecessor Pat Gelsinger, and it needed an estimated $20 billion or more to have a shot at winning customers.\n\nTan called on top executives in his network and asked how they did things, one of the sources said. He likewise called on big customers – cloud providers like Amazon and Google – and asked what they wanted, said two people familiar ⁠with the matter.\nTan shook up Intel’s management team, similar to when he led the chip design company Cadence. There, he had worked with a deputy to draft a list of executives to fire, a person familiar with his Cadence days said. Cadence declined to comment.\nTan is cutting deeper still: ​laying off around 15% of Intel employees per securities filings, many of them managers.\nHe bypassed middle managers to have technical talent brief him directly, two of the people said. Tan named Intel engineering veteran Pushkar Ranade as his chief of staff and in December elevated him to interim chief technology officer.\n\nDespite the ​intensity of his task at Intel, Tan has split his time with his myriad other commitments, which include his investment firms. When evaluating potential deals for Intel’s venture arm, Tan would also ask his investment firms for their opinion, one of the former Intel employees said.\nAn alleged conflict of interest with his venture portfolio prompted Intel’s board to push back on Tan over an acquisition this year, Reuters reported this month.\nHis Intel employment requires that he spend “such time as is necessary” to perform his duties as CEO, a change from the prior Intel chief’s contract that had required “full business efforts and time to Intel.”\nCelesta Capital said Tan's time commitment to the firm is now minimal, and its team has received no request to review deals for Intel Capital. Walden International and Walden Catalyst did not answer requests for comment.\n\nIntel said Tan ‍is working daily on transforming the company and “acted decisively” to flatten its structure, adding he is a “highly engaged CEO” who is “helping to restore ⁠speed, accountability, and create an engineering-centric, customer-focused culture.”\nA ‘LIFELINE’ FOR INTEL So far, the U.S. investment has been a catalyst for Intel. Its Corporate Vice President John Pitzer said in a September interview that President Trump had just hosted top technology CEOs for dinner to discuss AI, and that their companies were potential Intel customers.\nThe deal was a “lifeline” for Intel, said technology lobbyist and Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. Without it, Intel could have been out a CEO if it had succumbed to Trump’s pressure, he said.\n\nThe same week as the White House deal, Intel announced a $2 billion investment from Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank, where Tan once was a board member.\nLutnick, who previously had no vested interest in phone calls to his office from business or government leaders about Intel’s manufacturing, now has an incentive to jump at them, said one of the sources, who is familiar with the administration. Lutnick has indicated that Americans have skin in the game for Intel ⁠to land a foundry deal that could bolster U.S. chip production, the person said.\nForeign chip manufacturers operating in the U.S. are concerned that government officials will tip the scales for customers to manufacture with Intel instead of with them, according to two sources familiar with these worries.\n\nA Commerce Department official said the U.S. stake gives Intel a shot at success but not a leg up, and Intel is not “too strategic to fail.” The official said further that Secretary Lutnick talks to all parties rather than prioritizing calls for Intel’s sake.\nWhile Intel is picking up steam on the deals front, its manufacturing unit has struggled to produce ‌quality in-house chips.\nNvidia recently tested out whether it would manufacture its chips using Intel’s production process known as 18A but stopped moving forward, two people familiar with the matter said. Nvidia did not answer a request for comment.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSubscribe\nAn Intel spokesperson said the company’s 18A manufacturing technologies that make advanced chips are “progressing well,” and it “continues to see strong interest” for its next-generation production process, called 14A, which is expected to produce chips that are more ‌powerful and efficient.\nNvidia made no commitment to manufacture with Intel in September when investing $5 billion in the chipmaker. “Right now we are focused on collaborations,” Tan told reporters while announcing the deal with Nvidia’s Huang.\n(Reporting by Max A.

      "Content": "Vanguard flips the script on 60/40 investment strategy Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a \"medium-term\" outlook, and it stems from growing fears about an AI bubble.\n\nKerry Hannon · Senior Columnist\nWed, December 24, 2025 at 3:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nVanguard is singing a new tune for investors in 2026.\nIt goes like this: Out with the standard portfolio mix of 60% equity and 40% fixed income. In with the opposite — a 40% equity share (20% US stocks and 20% international stocks) and 60% fixed income.\n“This is a significant shift,” Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction and chief economist for the Americas, told me. “It's almost like a tectonic shift.”\n\nHere’s what’s behind it.\nVanguard expects investors in the short term to realize returns from high-quality (both taxable and municipal) US and foreign bonds similar to the performance they would see from US equities — about 4% to 5% — but with lower risk.\nAliaga-Diaz also expects non-US equities to outperform US stocks over the next decade. Vanguard’s outlook for international stocks is 5.1% to 7.1% per year over the next 10 years, higher than US stocks.\n“This is a position we suggest investors consider for the next three to five years, but it depends on risk tolerance and time horizon,” Aliaga-Diaz said.\nHedging against a tech bubble Vanguard’s new advice is for investors with a “medium-term” outlook, and it stems from growing fears — at Vanguard and elsewhere — about an AI bubble.\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" — Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL , GOOG ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Meta ( META ), Tesla ( TSLA ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ) — are the linchpin for the S&P 500's growth these days. The S&P 500 index rose about 17% for the year, after a 23% gain in 2024. But analysts are increasingly concerned that they're overvalued.\n\n“We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity,” Aliaga-Diaz said. “Importantly, US fixed income should also provide diversification if AI disappoints and fails to usher in higher economic growth—a scenario with odds that we calculate to be 25%–30%.”\nInvesting for longer-term goals Many retirement savers, however, may be saving for longer — say, to retire in two decades or more.\nHow does Vanguard’s new formula apply to them?\nI talked to several retirement experts about whether it’s a good idea to change course.\n\"Given today’s high equity valuations and higher bond yields, I certainly think it’s reasonable that a more conservative portfolio may have a better risk-return profile for the coming decade than in years’ past,\" Tyson Sprick, a certified financial planner with Caliber Wealth Management in Overland Park, Kan., told me.\n\"Overall, I think this reinforces the value of diversification and should serve as a warning to investors having FOMO with regards to this year’s AI-driven returns,\" he said.\n\nStory continues\n\"The end of a big year in the market is a perfect time to step back and ask, 'What am I trying to accomplish? Do I need to reach for returns to support my desired lifestyle?' Remember, a rate of return is not a financial goal,\" Sprick added.\nFor retirees, the playing field can be nuanced, according to Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of The Real Wealth Coterie .\n\n“If you’re a retiree, you may not be where you need exceptional growth and want to protect some of the recent gains by making that shift to 40/60, and it'll be comfortable for you throughout your retirement,” she said. “It's not about chasing returns. If you've done the right calculations, with a rate of return that feels good for you to solve your goals about having income now and not outliving your money, then a 40/60 could absolutely be totally fine for you.”\nLots of financial planners, however, told me “nope”— shifting to 40/60 is not what they will advise retirement savers. They universally pointed out that the 60/40 portfolio is built around balance to go the distance and achieve long-term growth in equities and stability with bonds.\n\nIt’s normal to pull back on equity holdings as retirement nears, meaning a 40/60 strategy is not out of the ordinary for this cohort. If you’re retiring within three to five years, then, generally speaking, you might want to shift to a portfolio with less risk by diversifying out of equities and more into fixed income holdings.\nTarget date funds are designed to do just that, and they are now the investment of choice for many retirement savers.\nHave a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related?

Every market has trailed the United States almost without exception.”\n\nAdded Aliaga-Diaz: “The bottom line is we don't get better returns from the 40/60 — we get the same return as the 60/40, but with much less risk,” he said. “That's really the point.”\nKerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

      "Content": "Is It Too Late to Buy Alphabet Stock in 2026? The Answer May Surprise You.\n\nBrett Schafer, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:20 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Alphabet stock is the best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stock in 2025.\nThe company is gaining market share in artificial intelligence (AI) and has many other drivers of growth.\nMargin expansion and share buybacks will help earnings per share keep compounding.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\n\nA surprise candidate has come from behind and turned into the top-performing \" Magnificent Seven\" stock of 2025. The company's name is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . Owner of Google and various other technology platforms, Alphabet's stock was a laggard versus the likes of Microsoft earlier this year, but has come roaring back to produce a total return of 57% so far in 2025.\nThe stock once again has one of the largest market caps in the world, and now trades at a much higher price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). Does that mean it is too late to buy Alphabet stock for your portfolio? The answer may surprise you.\nSteady market share gains in AI usage First, we need to take a look at Alphabet's position within the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Current earnings for the business may be derived from Google Search, but future revenue will come from its Gemini AI model being deployed across its namesake app, Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud (among other Alphabet products).\nGemini began its growth much more slowly than the disruptive chatbots ChatGPT and Claude, both heavily funded AI start-ups. However, 2025 has been the year of market share gains for Gemini, which came from close to no usage to a 13% share of the AI market. It is still well behind ChatGPT, but growing quickly, and with a huge distribution advantage with the billions of users of Google products, it can be easily marketed.\n\nAlphabet also has a cost advantage due to using its own data center infrastructure and computer chips to run Gemini, making it more profitable than both OpenAI (owner of ChatGPT) and Anthropic (owner of Claude), which are burning a boatload of cash right now.\nEven though Alphabet is spending close to $25 billion a quarter on capital expenditures, it is still generating positive free cash flow and self-funding its AI expansion. No direct competitor can say the same.\nLong-term earnings power growth AI should be a steady growth driver for Alphabet, especially if Gemini can keep gaining market share.\nThat is not the entire Alphabet business. Well, a lot of the business is now utilizing Gemini's AI capabilities, but it is far from the only moneymaking product under its umbrella. For example, there is YouTube, with over $10 billion in quarterly advertising revenue. Or there's Google Cloud, which is growing 34% year over year at over $15 billion in quarterly revenue. Not to forget Google Search, the main profit driver (still) for Alphabet, with $50 billion in quarterly sales.\n\nStory Continues\nThe list could go on. We even have self-driving division Waymo that is scaling up rapidly in cities around the country.\nAlphabet's revenue is growing by 15% year over year right now, even at such an immense scale. With so many growth engines over the next five years, this megacap company should be able to keep compounding its revenue higher for a long while.\nIs Alphabet stock still a buy? Alphabet's earnings power certainly did not grow as fast as its stock price in 2025. The stock now has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 30 compared to close to 15 earlier this year. That puts high expectations on the business going forward.\nEven with this high P/E ratio, I still think Alphabet will do well for investors who buy today and hold for many years. As mentioned, sales are growing quickly, but earnings per share (EPS) are growing even faster with margin expansion and steady share repurchases. A fast-growing EPS will bring down Alphabet's P/E ratio quickly and deliver strong stock returns over the next decade.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "2 Monster Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years\n\nJohn Ballard, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 3:44 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Alphabet's Google continues to gain share in the cloud computing market.\nMicrosoft has over 900 million people using AI features in its products.\n10 stocks we like better than Alphabet ›\nInvestors looking for solid stocks to buy for the next five years shouldn't overthink it. Sticking with established tech giants is one of the best ways to ride the current trends in technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) .\nThese are some of the most profitable companies in the world, and they have the resources to invest in cutting-edge technologies, delivering returns for their investors. Here are two that would make solid buy-and-hold investments for the next five years.\n1. Alphabet (Google) Over the last five years, shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have more than tripled in value, and tailwinds are moving in its favor to drive more market-beating returns through the end of the decade. Google's recent financial results demonstrate that it is a significant force in AI.\n\nGoogle's services revenue, including Search, reached $87 billion in the third quarter, a 14% year-over-year increase. Search processes billions of daily queries. Google is seeing higher user engagement, driven by new AI features, including Overviews and AI Mode. AI Mode alone has reached 75 million daily active users, doubling the number of searches since the second quarter. The growth in Google's Search business demonstrates how it ultimately benefits from a massive data advantage, enabling it to train its Gemini AI model and deliver better services to users.\nGemini also powers enterprise tools across Google Cloud, which continues to gain share in the $390 billion cloud computing market, according to Synergy Research. Businesses are increasingly relying on cloud services for storage and software development, positioning Google for significant growth. The cloud segment posted a healthy 34% year-over-year revenue increase last quarter. The growth in the cloud is a prime example of Alphabet's competitive position in the AI market.\n\nDespite the stock's surge this year, it still trades at a reasonable forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 27 based on 2026 earnings estimates. This is attractive considering analysts expect earnings per share to grow at an annualized rate of 15% in the next several years. Assuming the stock maintains its current forward P/E in 2030, the share price could reach $600 based on these earnings growth estimates.\n2. Microsoft Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a ubiquitous brand in computing, and that works to its advantage in the age of AI. Millions of people use Office and other Windows-based software products, providing a large installed base of users to monetize its AI investments. The stock has more than doubled since 2020, and the growing demand it is seeing in AI services could be enough to double the stock again.\n\nStory Continues\nMicrosoft's cloud infrastructure not only powers its enterprise cloud services but also its consumer-facing services. It has over 900 million monthly active users using AI features across its products. Microsoft 365, which includes Office, has over 400 million paid subscribers. New AI features drive healthy demand for these software products, with Microsoft 365 consumer cloud revenue up 26% year over year in the last quarter.\n\nAcross the business, Microsoft enjoys strong momentum. Its recent quarterly revenue of $77.7 billion increased by 18% year over year. The company's remaining performance obligations (representing long-term commitments from enterprises) reached $392 billion in the recent quarter. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of 51%.\nMicrosoft is playing a crucial role in one of the most significant transformations of the economy since the advent of the internet. The stock is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 30. This is reasonable for a leading cloud services provider experiencing robust revenue growth. Analysts currently project 13% annualized earnings growth over the next several years. This should fuel solid returns for Microsoft investors through at least 2030.\n\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now? Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

The transaction value, based on average quarterly pricing, was $3,554,882. The fund now reports no position in the company, following normal trading activity for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.\n\nWhat else to know Evolutionary Tree Capital Management, LLC fully divested from monday.com, which now represents 0% of its 13F reportable assets under management.\nTop holdings after the filing:\nNASDAQ: MSFT: $8.85 million (9.7% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: AMZN: $8.10 million (8.8% of AUM)\nNYSE: NOW: $4.90 million (5.3% of AUM)\nNYSE: RBLX: $4.74 million (5.2% of AUM)\nNASDAQ: NFLX: $4.55 million (5.0% of AUM)\n\nAs of November 12, 2025, shares of monday.com were priced at $159.11, down 38.94% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 by 56.34 percentage points.\nCompany Overview Metric\nValue\nPrice (as of market close November 12, 2025)\n$159.11\nMarket Capitalization\n$8.21 billion\nRevenue (TTM)\n$1.16 billion\nNet Income (TTM)\n$65.05 million\n\nCompany Snapshot Offers a cloud-based Work OS platform enabling organizations to build custom workflow and project management applications; product suite includes solutions for marketing, CRM, software development, and operational management.\nGenerates revenue primarily through subscription-based licensing of its SaaS platform, with additional income from value-added services such as onboarding and customer support.\nServes a global customer base spanning enterprises, SMBs, government, and educational institutions across the United States, EMEA, and other international markets.\n\nmonday.com operates at scale as a leading provider of flexible work management software, supporting over 2,500 employees and a diversified international client base.

However, monday.com experienced its first significant pullback in years over the summer.\nEvolutionary Tree invests primarily in tech stocks. Although Microsoft and Amazon are its largest positions, most of its positions are tech growth stocks like monday.com.\n\nWith this stock, the timing is interesting since Evolutionary Tree began accumulating its Monday.com shares in 2023. It appears to have begun buying shares close to the price where it unloaded its entire position in the third quarter of 2025. It also continued adding shares over the years, implying that it likely lost money on this stock.\nUltimately, we do not know why the fund exited its monday position. Still, given the recent revenue slowdown and what looks like a lack of gains over the last two years, Evolutionary Tree seems to feel like sometimes it is best to admit a mistake and move on, which is often a wise decision when specific positions do not work out as planned.\nGlossary 13F AUM: Assets under management reported by institutional investment managers in quarterly SEC Form 13F filings.\nDivested: Sold off or disposed of an asset or investment, fully or partially, from a portfolio.\nStake: The ownership interest or share held in a company by an investor or fund.\nTrailing twelve months (TTM): The 12-month period ending with the most recent quarterly report.\nCAGR: Compound Annual Growth Rate; the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period, assuming compounding.\nWork OS: A cloud-based platform enabling users to build custom workflow and project management applications.\nSaaS: Software as a Service; software delivered online via subscription rather than installed locally.\nValue-added services: Additional services provided beyond the core product, such as onboarding or customer support, often for extra fees.\nCloud-native: Software designed specifically to run and scale efficiently in cloud computing environments.\nDigital transformation: The integration of digital technology into all areas of a business to improve operations and value delivery.\nModular platform: A system built from separate components that can be independently developed, replaced, or upgraded.\nUnified system: A single platform that integrates multiple business functions or processes for streamlined management.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

      "Content": "Apple spent 2025 setting itself up for the future — and its biggest moves weren't about AI\n\nDaniel Howley · Technology Editor\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:15 PM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: AAPL\n\nNVDA\n\nMETA\n\nGOOG\n\nSSNLF\n\nIt’s been quite a year for Apple ( AAPL ). The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia ( NVDA ) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google ( GOOGL , GOOG ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ).\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta ( META ) Reality Labs' new design studio .\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times , Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman , meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\nCook is steering a $4 trillion behemoth Cook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nStory Continues\nCook's decisions drove Apple's stock price ever higher. As a result, the company's market cap has increased from $1 trillion in 2018 to a whopping $4 trillion in 2025.\nRevenue has also continued its steady upward pace, with Apple reporting $416 billion in total sales for its fiscal 2025, up from $391 billion in the prior year.\nApple is also reportedly preparing some of the biggest changes in years to its iPhone lineup in 2026. According to Gurman , the company will roll out a foldable iPhone, a first for Apple, in the latter half of the year.\n\nThat could help further goose already record iPhone sales. Apple is also reportedly preparing a new low-cost MacBook model, which would open up the company to a broader customer segment.\nAnd while it may not have the same margins as a high-powered MacBook Pro, a lower-cost MacBook could still help draw more customers to Apple's services, driving increased revenue over the long run.\n\nNew challenges ahead If Ternus is chosen to succeed Cook, he'll inherit an Apple at the peak of its power. While smartphone sales have slowed over time, the company is reaping the benefits of its massive install base, which still upgrades devices every few years and increasingly subscribes to Apple's various services.\n\nBut he'll also have to navigate his share of headaches. Wall Street is eagerly awaiting some kind of movement on Apple's AI strategy. And though the company is making progress on its AI rollout, it still needs to showcase its next-generation version of Siri.\nHe'll also have to prepare to take on the likes of Meta, Google, and Samsung ( 005930.KS ) in the smart glasses space. Meta already has two smart glasses on the market, and Google and Samsung are each working on their own intelligent eyewear.\nFor now, though, Cook is still Apple's CEO. We'll just have to see if that changes in 2026.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

      "Content": "Will Google Pass Nvidia in 2026 as the World’s Biggest Company?\n\nOmor Ibne Ehsan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 10:25 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nNVDA\n\nOPAI.PVT\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nQuick Read Google (GOOG) now leads AI software after overtaking Microsoft. Google is less than $200B away from surpassing Apple as the world’s second-largest company.\nGoogle holds four of the top 10 AI models on LLMArena. OpenAI’s best model ranks eighth.\nMeta is negotiating billions in purchases of Google’s TPUs. Anthropic already bought 1 million TPUs from Google instead of buying from Nvidia (NVDA).\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nThe stock market is quickly waking up to the fact that Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOG , NASDAQ:GOOGL ) is the leading AI software company today. It has overtaken Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) and is less than $200 billion away from overtaking Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) as the world's second-largest company. Overtaking the AI hardware leader, Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) will take a bit more work, as it has a $755 billion lead over Google. Fortuitously for Google, that number is a drop in the bucket these days for Wall Street.\nThere are still some bears who believe that Google will lose out in the end due to AI \"replacing\" the search engine business, but a lot is going wrong with that argument. Even Nvidia may get competition from Google, as the company has begun breaking into the AI hardware industry and is landing deals.\n\nLet's take a look at whether or not all this momentum will translate into Alphabet becoming the biggest company in 2026.\nGoogle is firing on all cylinders Google was supposed to \"die\" after Microsoft integrated its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. The issue was that people never ended up ditching Google. ChatGPT was never a 1:1 replacement for what Google offered, and AI could never provide the same reliability that a direct search can.\nThen, Alphaebt began to beat both OpenAI and Microsoft at their own game. Its initial AI \"Bard\" rollout was rushed and disappointing, but Google has made outstanding progress since. OpenAI is now in \"code red\" mode after the Gemini 3 Pro was released and promptly took over the leaderboards.\n\nIf you look at the top 10 AI models on LLMArena, four are from Google. No other company matches that. OpenAI's sole top 10 model is eighth, with xAI and Anthropic having two models each.\nIf you move past text AI models, Google does even better. Its latest Nano Banana Pro image model puts OpenAI's GPT image to shame. The company even leads when it comes to text-to-video models.\n\nStory Continues\nAlphabet is doing all that while keeping costs under control. It hasn't spent excessively on AI, and cash on the balance sheet increased from $19.96 billion in Q3 2024 to $23.09 billion in Q3 2025. AI rivals like Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) have gone into net debt.\nWhy Google's search business will never be replaced If Google's rivals somehow find their bearings and win the AI race, the core search engine business, the cloud business, and other businesses like YouTube will remain insulated.\nAs for search, consumers have shown no desire to stick with an alternative. This is mainly because Google owns the search bar and provides all they need. Going to another AI website, searching, and waiting for it to provide an answer is an extra level of inconvenience that very few people are willing to put up with.\n\nIn contrast, you can just use your search bar. Google itself will give you an AI answer, with all the regular results below it.\nNvidia's AI GPUs at risk? Software isn't Alphabet's only strong suit. Google has aggressively expanded into custom silicon with its TPUs and Axion CPUs. It could shatter Nvidia's near-monopoly if the company can execute well, since the hardware is much cheaper and more energy-efficient.\nMeta is in discussions with Google to buy TPUs worth \"billions of dollars,\" with AI company Anthropic already buying 1 million of them. This is money that would have otherwise gone into Nvidia's coffers instead.\n\nThe threat Nvidia faces from Google is very underestimated today. However, this could just be a repeat of how Google's AI was shrugged off, only to end up dominating.\nCould Google become the biggest company in 2026? I do believe Alphabet is set to become the world's largest company, either in 2026 or sometime in this decade. EPS is expected to jump from an estimated $10.56 in 2025 to over $26 in 2031. Some analysts expect EPS to be over $30.7 by then. Revenue is also expected to keep growing at a very healthy clip and possibly double from 2025 to 2030.\n\nNvidia will be growing at an even faster clip, but all its eggs are in one basket. That basket is being threatened by Google.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

Microsoft, Snowflake ( NYSE:SNOW ), and Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) remain top picks, supported by steady AI spending from hyperscalers.

Analysts said it checks many boxes of a washed-out software name, with improving momentum tied to its AI push and the potential for revenue growth to re-accelerate. Its relatively low free cash flow multiple was seen as making the risk-reward more attractive.\nElsewhere, Evercore likes Intuit ( NASDAQ:INTU ) as small businesses adopt AI, Samsara ( NYSE:IOT ) as a smaller-cap standout, and Palo Alto Networks ( NASDAQ:PANW ) as its top cybersecurity pick as recent acquisitions begin to show results. Evercore's picks suggest AI is moving from hype to durable fundamentals as investors look toward 2026.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Alphabet Agrees to Buy Intersect Power in $4.75 Billion Clean Energy Deal\n\nKhac Phu Nguyen\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 9:07 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nAlphabet Inc. ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) has agreed to acquire clean energy developer Intersect Power LLC for $4.75 billion in cash plus existing debt, a deal that could expand Google's access to electricity as it scales data centers tied to artificial intelligence. The acquisition, announced Monday, follows Google's minority investment in Intersect last year and comes as US power grids face rising strain from renewed demand growth. Alphabet said the transaction is intended to give Google greater flexibility to develop new power generation alongside expanding data center capacity, which has increasingly become a limiting factor for AI deployment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nIs AMZN fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThe deal arrives as the AI buildout drives consolidation across data centers and energy infrastructure. Google, along with Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and Microsoft Corp. ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), has been managing the tension between rising electricity needs and long-term climate goals, after the company disclosed in 2024 that its carbon emissions increased 48% over the past five years due largely to data center operations. Intersect, backed by private equity firm TPG Inc., has focused on solar and battery storage projects designed to power large-scale data centers, particularly in Texas, a region its CEO Sheldon Kimber has described as attractive due to abundant wind and solar resources. The company has about 7.5 gigawatts of solar and storage in operation and another eight gigawatts in development, with much of that capacity tied to data-center-heavy markets.\n\nAs part of the transaction, Alphabet will acquire Intersect's power development platform, team, and in-development assets already contracted by Google, while Intersect will retain its brand and continue under Kimber's leadership. Grid assets contracted to other customers in Texas and California will remain outside the purchase, with TPG Rise Climate retaining a stake in those projects. Industry analysts have suggested the structure could reduce regulatory risk for Google, as owning power generation assets may provide more flexibility in how and where new data centers are built, rather than relying solely on third-party power arrangements as AI infrastructure continues to scale.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "The Bill Gates Portfolio: 3 Of His Ancor Holdings Every Investor Should Consider\n\nChris MacDonald\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 8:40 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nDHR\n\nMCD\n\nDE\n\nMicrosoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) founder Bill gates is best-known for his founding of the most valuable company in the world (on multiple occasions, just not now). And rightfully so.\nThat said, over the years, Bill Gates has adjusted his portfolio holdings, choosing to divest in a range of companies via his own personal portfolio but also via his charitable organizations and other investment funds. One could argue that he would have been much better off just staying highly concentrated in Microsoft stock, and those who'd make that argument would have been 100% correct. But that's not to say diversification isn't generally a good thing - it is.\n\nHere are three of Bill Gates' portfolio positions, and why I think these companies are worth considering (they're not his largest positions, but have some of the best upside among those reported on his recent 13-F filing).\nDeere (DE) Agricultural equipment giant Deere ( NYSE:DE ) has carved out a near-monopoly on the production of many of the most popular models of tractors, mowers, and other equipment used for both commercial and residential use. The company's ability to provide farmers and those who have a real penchant for mowing their lawns like pros with precision technology has created a relatively high-margin business out of a rather boring sector many wouldn't think to look at.\n\nProviding investors with a small but reasonable dividend yield of 1.4% and solid fundamentals overall, Deere remains a juggernaut in this space and is every investor's long-term dream stock. Over the past five years alone, Deere has produced capital appreciation of 74%, making its chart look more like a well-oiled tech stock than an industrial play.\nMuch of this is due to the company's strong recent results, in which Deere brought in revenue of $12 billion and EPS of $4.76. The company's revenues were down year-over-year, but resilient earnings numbers highlight the company's robust margins and ability to growth through difficult periods.\nFor those expecting some recessionary headwinds to form in the coming year, owning a piece of the agricultural sector (which is very stable on a relative basis) may be a good move, and Deere is the preeminent name in this space.\n\nDanaher (DHR) A company I don't cover much, but probably should, is Danaher ( NYSE:DHR ). The life sciences and diagnostics company has seen impressive margins, driven by a productivity-first growth model. Supported by strong acquisitions in recent years (with many analysts and investors hoping for more down the road), the company has seen robust revenue and growth in recent years.\n\nStory Continues\nNow, Danaher's revenue did slide similar to Deere, but only by 1% year-over-year. The company more than made up for this decline via strong free cash flow generation of $1.4 billion and robust operating margins of more than 25%. On that note, the company also reiterated its forward guidance, suggesting to investors that this past quarter was a blip.\n\nI'd tend to agree, considering the company's ability to continue to expand its margin as it acquires companies that don't have the same sort of fundamentals. With a goal of creating monopoly-like franchises, this is a stock I think can continue to outperform in a market environment where investors are reaching for safety.\nMcDonald's (MCD) Last, but certainly not least on this list of top Bill Gates holdings I think investors should consider is McDonald's ( NYSE:MCD ).\nShares of the fast food giant have been volatile in the past, but are starting to move in the right direction. On a year-to-date basis, MCD stock is up more than 9% as investors clearly begin to take a harder look at companies in more defensive sectors. As the leading fast food giant globally, when times are tough, consumers looking to dine away from home tend to trade down toward the lowest-cost value out there. It's hard to argue McDonald's isn't this pick for millions around the world.\n\nWith incredibly resilient and robust cash flow generation, and operating margins near 45%, this is a top stock I think long-term investors can buy and sit on for decades. Whether or not you visit one of the company's more than 40,000 locations around the world, plenty of regular traffic and a resurgence of interest around the company's value meals, could drive incredible upside in the years to come.\nThat thesis is doubly true for those who think tough times may be ahead.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Ray Dalio’s Top Holdings Revealed: Two ETFs and Two Tech Titans\n\nVandita Jadeja\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 7:52 AM PST 6 min read\n\nIn this article: SPY\n\nIVV\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nRay Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the top hedge funds today. It has over $100 billion in assets, and the fund has made solid moves despite market uncertainties. Following the steps of billionaires can help you build a portfolio that stands the test of time. However, due diligence is very important.\n\nBridgewater Associates has made several transactions in the third quarter, and it is reflected in the 13F reports. However, the billionaire has played safe with his investments. His top holdings include two tech titans and two ETFs. Here’s why I’d recommend them too.\nQuick Read Bridgewater increased its iShares Core S&P 500 ETF position by 4.83% in Q3. The fund now represents 10.62% of the portfolio.\nAlphabet reported revenue of $102.3B (up 16% year over year) and cloud revenue of $15.2B (up 34%).\nMicrosoft’s cloud segment grew 28% to $30.9B in revenue. Azure demand has outpaced supply.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF Bridgewater Associates has the highest allocation in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF ( NYSEARCA:IVV ), comprising 10.62% of the portfolio. The hedge fund increased its position by 4.83% in the third quarter. Bridgewater owns more than 1 million shares of the ETF and started investing in IVV in 2010. IVV has $733 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe ETF provides exposure to large-cap companies in the U.S. and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index. IVV invests in the 500 top U.S. companies based on their market capitalization. This means its top holdings include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon.\nThe fund has a yield of 1.04% and pays quarterly dividends. Its highest allocation lies in the technology sector at 34.36%, followed by financials (13.38%) and consumer discretionary (10.56%). IVV has a low expense ratio of 0.03% and has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 94.83% and a 5-year return of 114.12%.\nIVV has gained 17.09% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $687.83. The fund has the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming years. With more than two decades of history, the fund has established itself as a strong player offering broad U.S. equity exposure.\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust Bridgewater has the second-highest position in State Street’s S&P 500 ETF ( NYSE: SPY ), which makes up 6.69% of the total portfolio. The fund also tracks the performance of the S&P 500 and is the first exchange-traded fund listed in the United States.\n\nStory Continues\nSPY is a low-risk investment that ensures steady capital appreciation. It has gained 17.41% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $684.83. The fund holds 503 stocks and has an expense ratio of 0.09%. It has a yield of 1.04% and has the highest allocation in the information technology sector (34.08%), followed by financials (13.55%) and consumer discretionary (10.62%).\n\nSimilar to IVV, its top 10 holdings include industry stalwarts such as Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. Despite making several buy and sell transactions, Dalio prefers to stick to some ETFs, and SPY is one of them. It can help build a strong foundation for your portfolio. The fund has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 20.43% and a 5-year return of 15.12%.\nWith SPY, you get to own the biggest companies across industries. IVV and SPY are virtually identical in many ways. Both track the S&P 500 index and have generated similar returns over time.\nAlphabet Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) forms 2.53% of Bridgewater’s portfolio and holds more than 3 million shares. While the hedge fund has trimmed its position over time, it still remains one of the top holdings. Looking at Dalio’s holdings, it shows that he’s bullish on the tech sector.\nAlphabet has gained 61.89% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $308.61. It has a comprehensive AI ecosystem that ensures steady revenue growth. While the company is known for the dominating Google search engine, it has a massive empire that continues to grow. Its search engine continues to lead the industry, while YouTube has become the largest streaming platform today.\n\nIts numbers are impressive. It reported a revenue of $102.3 billion, up 16% year over year, while the net income jumped 33%. Its cloud revenue soared 34% to $15.2 billion, and Google Services revenue jumped 14% to $87.1 billion. Its cloud division has gained a multi-year deal worth $10 billion with Palo Alto Networks, aimed at expanding the AI-driven security infrastructure.\nThere’s plenty of growth still to come. Wall Street remains bullish on the stock as its core business continues to thrive. A Wedbush analyst has an Outperform rating for the stock with a price target of $350.\nMicrosoft Corporation Tech dinosaur Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) forms 2.23% of Dalio’s portfolio. While he has trimmed his stake in the company during the third quarter, Microsoft continues to remain one of the top five holdings. The tech giant has seen a steady climb and continued optimism by Wall Street experts. AI will accelerate Microsoft’s growth, and the demand for Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure has outpaced supply.\n\nThere’s a lot of talk about Microsoft’s AI rollout across its entire product stack and the expansion of CoPilot in Windows. In the recently announced results, the company beat earnings and revenue expectations. It reported a revenue of $77.67 billion, up 18% year over year, and an EPS of $4.13. Its cloud segment recorded a growth of 28% with a revenue of $30.9 billion, being one of the biggest growth drivers for the business.\nMSFT stock has gained 15.80% year to date and is exchanging hands for $484.72. It has a dividend yield of 0.75% and has raised dividends every year since 2010. Despite the low yield, it is an excellent dividend stock to own. The company has increased its dividend by 250% in the past decade. However, the stock price has gone up; hence, the yield has dropped.\n\nDespite trimming his stake, Dalio believes in the future of Microsoft and has held the stock since 2005.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong.

But the Magnificent Seven remain mainstays in many portfolios. They are Alphabet ( NASDAQ:GOOGL ) , Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) , Meta Platforms ( NASDAQ:META ) , Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) and Tesla ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) .\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with TGT.\nIs GOOGL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nHere are several perspectives on these key stocks. Think of them as a series of medical tests X-rays, blood tests, magnetic-resonance imaging and the like.\nPerformance The best stock-market performer among the Magnificent Seven this year by far is Alphabet, up 63% through Dec. 19.\nNone of the seven are down, but Amazon is a laggard, up 4%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index has climbed more than 17%.\nPrice/Earnings There are no cheap stocks among the Magnificent Seven.\nIf we compare each company's stock price to its earnings, Meta Platforms looks best, selling for 29 times earnings. The most expensive by a mile is Tesla, at more than 300 times earnings.\nTesla's peak profit year was 2022, and its earnings have declined three years in a row.\nPrice/Sales The Magnificent Seven companies generally boast high profits as a percentage of sales. That's part of what makes them magnificent. Consequently, they sell at above-average multiples of sales.\nThe most expensive on this score is Nvidia , at 24 times sales .\nThe cheapest is Amazon , at 3.6 times sales though cheap is relative. I generally look for price/sales ratios of 2.0 or less.\nPrice/Book Book value equals a company's assets minus its liabilities. Stocks that are cheap compared to book value may be bargains.\nNone of the Magnificent Seven are cheap by this metric. The average stock today sells for about 2.8 times book value, well above the historical norm.\nThe least expensive among the group is Amazon at 6.6 times book. The most costly is Apple, at 54 times book.\nEarnings Growth The Magnificent Seven are famous for rapid revenue and earnings growth.\nOver the past decade, the most impressive growth rate belongs to Nvidia, at 47% per year. Nvidia also boasts:\nthe best five-year growth rate at 74% annually\nthe best one-year earnings growth, at 54%\nThe only negative figure in the group is Tesla's earnings growth over the past year, which is down 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nBalance Sheet Strength predominates here as well. Most of the Magnificent Seven carry relatively little debt.\nAn exception is Apple, with debt equal to 134% of stockholders' equity.\nThe cleanest balance sheets belong to Alphabet and Nvidia, each with debt equal to only 9% of equity.\nProfitability A common measure of profitability is return on equity profits as a percentage of a company's net worth.\nApple leads on this measure at 169% , followed by Nvidia at 111% . Tesla trails at roughly 7% .\nAnother useful measure is net margin (profits as a percentage of sales). Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft all exceed 30% , which is outstanding. Nvidia stands at an almost absurd 53% . Tesla lags again, at just over 5% .\nPEG Ratio For growth stocks, the PEG ratio (price/earnings divided by growth rate) is particularly informative.\nFor example, Microsoft trades at a P/E of 34, divided by its growth rate of 19.9, yielding a PEG of 1.7, fairly typical for this group.\nInvestors usually get excited when PEG ratios fall below 1.0. Only Nvidia achieves that distinction, with a PEG of 0.6.\nAnalysts' View Finally, I looked at analyst recommendations as a percentage of total coverage.\nAmazon leads with nearly 96% positive ratings, followed by Microsoft at almost 94%.\nThe only stock below the 50% line is Tesla, at 44%.\nMy View My favorite in this exalted group is Alphabet, which I regard as perhaps the most innovative company in the U.S.\nIt owns not only the Google search engine, but also YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars, and the DeepMind artificial-intelligence lab.\nI'm neutral on five of the remaining six stocks and would shy away from Tesla , which faces increasing competition from both U.S. and Chinese automakers.\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments in Boston.

      "Content": "The S&P 500’s Rare 40-Year Valuation Warning: Economic Slowdown Is Confirmed by Federal Reserve\n\nDavid Beren\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 5:55 AM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nThe S&P 500 has delivered what can only be described as a strong year to date, extending a rally that has rewarded investors for staying the course through inflation, rate hikes, and geopolitical uncertainty. On the surface, by all accounts, the market looks healthy as stocks continue climbing and corporate earnings remain strong. Similarly, optimism around artificial intelligence and an easier monetary policy has kept an appetite for the stock market intact.\n\nQuick Read The S&P 500 now trades at 22.4x forward earnings. This valuation has only occurred twice in the past 40 years.\nFederal Reserve research shows tariff policies will reduce annual GDP growth by 0.3% to 0.5% over the next two years.\nProfit margins are near historical highs with limited expansion room while earnings forecasts for 2026 remain modest.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nUnderneath all of this performance, however, there is something of a growing concern as the same market producing double-digit gains is now trading at approximately 22.4 times forward earnings, a valuation number the country has only seen twice in the last 40 years. At the same time, you have new Federal Reserve research indicating that tariff policies will slow economic growth in a fairly substantial way over the next two years.\nWhen these extremes collide, it's cause for concern, but when combined with weakening fundamentals, history suggests that investors need to pay closer attention, even if the market appears to be mostly calm.\nThe Market Paradox: High Gains Amidst Tariff Uncertainty As you look at the 16% S&P 500 gain year to date, it not only reflects a level of continued optimism but also highlights that there are several key areas worth watching. At the top of any list has to be artificial intelligence, which continues to drive a ton of enthusiasm for technology stocks, particularly for names like NVIDIA ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ), and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ).\n\nAdditionally, you have the Federal Reserve and its efforts to shift from rate hikes to rate cuts, which is helping to improve the situation for equity investments by making future earnings more valuable and reducing the competition from stocks and bonds, where people shifted money when interest rates were high.\nIf you have invested in the market, so far, so good, as you have been able to enjoy the financial benefits of a 16% market increase. The market has, as it often does, rewarded those who go full force ahead, all while punishing those who were too cautious and missed out on these returns.\n\nStory Continues\nStill, you can't ignore that the Federal Reserve's recent indicators around the impact of tariffs are going to give a whole lot of investors a reality check in the not-too-distant future. The Fed's analysis indicates that tariff policies could reduce annual GDP growth from anywhere between 0.3% and 0.5% over the next two years. On paper, this might sound small, but the resulting loss in growth is substantial. What's worse is that this isn't a speculative conclusion. It's based entirely on comprehensive economic modeling according to the Fed, so it's going to happen, it's just a matter of when.\n\nOnly Seen Twice: The 22.4x Forward Earnings Warning Unsurprisingly, the S&P 500's current forward P/E ratio of 22.4 as a red flag puts the market in the uncomfortable spot of being among the most expensive valuations in the last four decades. Considering that the historical average sits between 15 and 16, this current number is 40% higher, which leads to investors having to pay more for the same dollar of earnings than they have in the past.\n\nMore notable is that this scenario has only played out twice in the last 40 years, during the late 1990s tech boom and the 2021 pandemic stimulus period. If you are a student of financial history, you know that neither instance ended well for investors who bought at peak valuations, as the tech bubble crashed 49% between 2000 and 2002, while the 2021 pandemic peak was followed by a 25% decrease.\nWhile there is cause for concern, it's also necessary to highlight that high valuations do not automatically mean that economic conditions are not strong. If earnings are growing rapidly, which they are, and business conditions are improving, investors can make a justification for paying a premium for future growth. The flag here is that none of these conditions exist right now, including profit margins expanding, so earnings forecasts for 2026 are pretty modest. Profit margins, in particular, are close to historical highs, so there isn't a lot of room for expansion, and according to the Fed, business conditions are about to get worse.\n\nThe 22.4 forward P/E reflects an optimism for investors that doesn't really align with any reality the Fed is describing. It assumes continued strong earnings growth and stable margins, and when those assumptions break or uncertainty increases, valuations are going to reset lower as investors decide they no longer want to pay premiums for companies that have falling fundamentals.\nTariff Impact: Fed Study Predicts Slowed Growth and Market Headwinds The Fed's research on tariff impacts is likely to be the clearest warning sign about what could potentially happen next year with the economy. From its study, we learned that both the direct and indirect effects of tariffs across multiple sectors are going to slow US economic growth in a measurable and meaningful way in the next 24 months.\n\nAs data and detail-heavy as this all is, the math is pretty clear as tariffs increase input costs for manufacturers and force companies to either absorb the cost, impacting margins, or pass the expense onto consumers, which reduces overall demand. It won't surprise anyone to consider that both scenarios likely result in economic compression. If there is a higher input cost, there is less capital for companies to expand, hire, etc., and higher consumer prices reduce overall purchasing power, especially for middle and lower-income households that spend a lot of money on the exact kinds of goods that tariffs will hit hardest.\nThe research also highlighted the uncertainty that is going to impact overall business planning, even before tariffs have been fully implemented. Companies are undoubtedly going to keep delaying capital expenditures if there is even a hint of concern over clarity as to what trade rules could look like in six months. What's worse is that supply chain managers can't commit to long-term contracts when tariff policy shifts weekly. All of this comes together as slowed investment for companies as hiring plans are put on hold and any expansion projects get delayed, perhaps indefinitely.\n\nFor the stock market, any instance of slower economic growth is going to translate into weaker earnings. Corporate revenue is tied directly to economic activity, and even if GDP growth falls from 2% to 1.5%, which may not sound like a lot, it has a big impact. When sales fall, so too do profits, and when profits start to disappoint, stock prices are going to directly reflect investor concerns. Arguably, the biggest takeaway for investors is that the Fed's research all but confirms that the economics surrounding stock prices is about to weaken, perhaps significantly. This is going to translate to the kind of headwind that even the momentum of a few large-cap names can't overcome.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news?

      "Content": "Bull of the Day: MongoDB (MDB)\n\nAndrew Rocco\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 1:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MDB\n\nMDB Company Overview and Bull Case Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock MongoDB ( MDB ) is a leading database software company. Think of a traditional database (like a spreadsheet or filing cabinet) as being very rigid: you have to decide exactly how many columns your data will have before you put anything in it. If you want to add new information later, you must stop everything and restructure the entire cabinet. Conversely, MDB technology stores data in self-contained folders that can hold anything – text, photos, video links, or lists – all in one place. Additionally, MDB’s product is unique because:\n\n· There are No Rigid Rules (Flexible Schema): You don't have to define a strict structure upfront. If you have 100 customer folders, and you decide you want to track a new \"loyalty points\" field, you just add it to the following folder you create. The other 99 folders don't need to change. This is called a flexible schema.\n· It is Built for Speed and Scale: Because modern applications (like a popular social media app or an e-commerce site) serve millions of users and ingest new data every minute, MongoDB is designed to scale easily and handle massive amounts of data very quickly. It can simply add more \"cabinets\" (servers) to store data horizontally.\n\n· The Main Product: Atlas: The company's main business is MongoDB Atlas, which is like an easy button for this robust database. It's a cloud service that lets developers use the MongoDB database without worrying about setting up or maintaining the servers. They just pay to use the database as a service.\nMicrosoft Partnership Helps MDB Break Into AI MDB has a partnership with tech giant Microsoft ( MSFT ) that enables Atlas to be deeply integrated into Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. Clients can now plug Atlas into Microsoft Azure to utilize its AI tools. The Microsoft partnership is critical for helping MDB gain a share of the rapidly growing AI market. The good news for MDB investors is that MongoDB was named the 2025 ‘Microsoft United States Partner of the Year.’\n\nMDB: A Consistent EPS Outperformer Wall Street is a game of expectations, and MDB has illustrated that it’s capable of delivering. Over the past four quarters, it has surpassed Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates by a juicy 69.30%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMDB Reports Stellar EPS Earlier this month, MongoDB delivered strong third-quarter results that exceeded the high end of their guidance, driven by continued strength in Atlas, which saw growth accelerate 30% year-over-year. Meanwhile, total revenue and subscription revenue grew 19% year-over-year as margins expanded. Finally, MDB raised its guidance. The company now expects EPS growth of ~30% and revenue growth of 20%.\n\nStory Continues\nMDB Technical View: An EPS-Induced Breakaway Gap Following the early December earnings release, MDB shares spiked 22% as trading volume swelled to more than 4x the norm – a sign of heavy demand. Despite the large upside move, the stock has traded sideways since EPS, indicating that although investors have large profits in the stock, they are unwilling to part with their shares.\n\nImage Source: TradingView\nBottom Line\nMongoDB’s flexible architecture, cloud-first Atlas platform, and strategic partnership with Microsoft give the company a powerful runway for AI-driven growth. With a track record of earnings outperformance and fresh momentum following EPS, MDB shares are a buy.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "Content": "My Top 3 Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy in December\n\nKeith Speights, The Motley Fool\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:15 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: GOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nAMZN\n\nKey Points Alphabet's Google Quantum AI is addressing nearly every aspect of superconducting quantum computing.\nAmazon's Ocelet chip holds the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of quantum error correction.\nMicrosoft's topoconductors could represent a giant leap forward in building large-scale quantum computers.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\n\"Plastics.\"\nThat's the one-word advice that Mr. McGuire (played by Walter Brooke) gave to Dustin Hoffman's character, Benjamin Braddock, in the classic 1967 movie The Graduate . If the movie were remade today, though, McGuire might have to use two words in his investing recommendation to young Braddock – quantum computing .\nQuantum computing is poised to profoundly reshape the technological landscape over the next few years. Importantly, it presents tremendous opportunities for investors today. I think that some opportunities stand out above others, though. Here are my top three quantum computing stocks to buy in December.\n1. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is best known as the parent company of Google. And Google, of course, is best known for its ubiquitous search engine. However, Google is also working to advance quantum computing.\nGoogle Quantum AI officially began operating in 2012. Its mission, then and now, is to 'build quantum computing for otherwise unsolvable problems.\"\n\nTo achieve this lofty goal, Google Quantum AI covers nearly every aspect of superconducting quantum computing . Its staff work on both hardware (including quantum processors and cooling systems called cryostats) and software (including operating systems and user applications).\nThus far, Google Quantum AI has completed two of the six milestones on its roadmap to build a practical, large-scale quantum computer. In 2019, Google Quantum AI announced that its technology achieved quantum supremacy (a term used to describe where a quantum computer solves a problem that would take classical supercomputers a significantly long time to handle). In 2023, its team unveiled the first logical qubit prototype that demonstrated quantum error correction.\n2. Amazon You may have also heard about my second quantum computing stock. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reigns as the 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce and cloud services. The company is also an important player in quantum computing.\nIn one sense, Amazon is a \"picks-and-shovels\" play in quantum computing. Amazon Braket is a quantum cloud computing service that's available on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It supports researchers in developing quantum computing algorithms, testing quantum hardware, and creating quantum software.\n\nStory Continues\nHowever, Amazon isn't just operating on the sidelines in the quantum computing arena. The company is also busy developing its own quantum technology. In February 2025, Amazon announced a new quantum computing chip called Ocelet.\nOcelet could be a key breakthrough in the goal to build large-scale quantum computers. The chip can reduce the costs of quantum error correction by up to 90% versus current approaches. It uses \"cat-qubits\" (named after physicist Erwin Schrödinger's famous quantum thought experiment, which featured a cat) that can suppress some types of quantum computing errors.\n\n3. Microsoft My third pick is also a household name. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a technology giant with products including the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office 365 productivity software, and Xbox gaming systems. Like Alphabet and Amazon, Microsoft is also investing heavily in quantum computing.\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform offers a \"Quantum Ready\" program. This program helps leaders develop strategies to mitigate the potential negative impact of quantum computing on their organizations while leveraging the opportunities that quantum computing presents.\n\nArguably, the most crucial quantum computing initiative for Microsoft is its topological core architecture. This architecture utilizes topological superconductors, also known as topoconductors, which are a special type of matter that falls neither into the solid, liquid, nor gas states.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft announced the first quantum computing chip that uses topoconductors – Majorana 1. Microsoft believes the technology used in Majorana 1 presents a key step toward fitting 1 million or more qubits on a single chip.\nCommon denominators You may have noticed several commonalities among my top three quantum computing stocks to buy in December. They're all so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. They all operate widely used cloud platforms. All three companies are leaders in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlso, none of them are pure-play quantum computing companies. I think that's critical. No one knows for sure which quantum technologies will emerge as the biggest winners. Investing in a single pure-play quantum computing stock could be a highly risky proposition.\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft have ample financial flexibility to acquire smaller rivals that show exceptional promise. If you want to profit from quantum computing but not take on a significant amount of risk, these megacap stocks are the way to go, in my opinion.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now? Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $509,039 !* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,109,506 !*\n\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 972 % — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 193% for the S&P 500.

      "Content": "BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 IBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\n\nAmin Ayan\nTue, December 23, 2025 at 12:00 AM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: BTC-USD\n\nIBIT\n\nBLK\n\nAAPL\n\nMETA\n\nBlackRock has placed its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund among its three biggest investment themes for 2025, ranking the product alongside Treasury bills and US mega-cap technology stocks.\nKey Takeaways:\nBlackRock named its spot Bitcoin ETF a top 2025 investment theme alongside Treasurys and big tech.\nIBIT attracted over $25 billion in inflows this year despite Bitcoin’s price decline.\nThe fund now leads rivals by a wide margin, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios.\n\nThe world’s largest asset manager said its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) together with an ETF tracking short-term Treasurys and another linked to the so-called “Magnificent 7” group of US tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla.\nBlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Pulls $25B in Inflows Despite Bitcoin’s 2025 Pullback IBIT has drawn more than $25 billion in net inflows so far this year, according to market data, ranking sixth among all ETFs by inflows despite posting a negative return in 2025.\nThe performance comes as Bitcoin has slid roughly 30% from its October peak, a drawdown that has not deterred investor demand.\n\nNate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, said BlackRock’s decision to spotlight IBIT shows the firm remains comfortable backing Bitcoin through market cycles.\nBloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed that view, noting that if the fund can attract $25 billion in a weaker year, the upside during a stronger market could be significantly larger.\nThe latest inflows add to the roughly $37 billion IBIT attracted in 2024, bringing total net inflows since launch to about $62.5 billion, according to Farside Investors.\nThat figure puts IBIT well ahead of competitors, with flows more than five times larger than those of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, its closest rival.\nBlackRock has continued to build out its crypto-linked ETF lineup beyond spot Bitcoin exposure. In September, the firm filed to register a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF , designed to generate yield by selling covered call options on Bitcoin futures.\n\nThe strategy would mark a shift toward income-focused products tied to digital assets.\nIBIT has also emerged as a notable outlier on the 2025 ETF flow leaderboard, ranking sixth by year-to-date inflows despite posting a negative return for the year.\nIBIT is the only ETF among the top flow leaders showing a year-to-date loss, with returns down roughly 9.6%. Yet the fund has still attracted approximately $25.4 billion in net inflows.\nBlackRock’s Ethereum ETF Draws $9B as Firm Expands Crypto Offerings The asset manager has also seen strong demand for its Ethereum offerings. Its iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) has attracted more than $9.1 billion in inflows this year, pushing total inflows close to $12.7 billion.\n\nStory Continues\nIn November, BlackRock filed to launch an iShares Staked Ethereum ETF, following regulatory changes that have given issuers more flexibility to incorporate staking features.\nDespite its expanding crypto footprint, BlackRock has so far stayed on the sidelines of the recent wave of altcoin ETFs tied to assets such as Solana, XRP and Litecoin.\nRead original story BlackRock Names Spot Bitcoin ETF Among Its Top Investment Themes of 2025 by Amin Ayan at Cryptonews.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "1 Stock I'd Buy Before Tesla in 2026\n\nDaniel Foelber, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: TSLA\n\nNVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points Tesla is hovering around an all-time high despite its core automotive business posting poor results.\nNvidia’s high margins enable it to invest aggressively in research and development without draining its cash flows.\nNvidia is a far better value than Tesla.\n10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has been on a tear -- hitting an all-time high on Dec. 15 . Tesla is now within striking distance of surpassing Meta Platforms and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) in market capitalization to become the sixth-most-valuable U.S. company, behind only Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) , Apple , Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Microsoft , and Amazon .\n\nTesla is surging due to investor excitement over the company's robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- particularly its autonomous driving technology through its expanding robotaxi project. Investors are betting that Tesla's future will depend less on selling electric vehicles (EVs) to households and more on self-driving cars, Optimus robots, etc.\nBut to fund these efforts, Tesla relies on cash flows from its automotive and energy generation and storage segments. Tesla's profitability has taken a massive hit, as growth is slowing and its costs are rising. Its operating margins in the third quarter of 2025 were just 5.8% compared to 10.8% in the same quarter of 2024.\nTesla is being valued for what it could earn in the future rather than what it is earning today. Even if Tesla delivers exceptional results, it could still be a poorly performing stock over the next three to five years because so much optimism is already being factored into the valuation. A much better opportunity for 2026 and beyond is a company with plenty of growth potential but a much more realistic valuation -- Nvidia.\nNvidia's cash flows fuel its innovation Unlike Tesla, Nvidia is already capitalizing on a massive opportunity in AI by selling graphics processing units (GPUs) and associated software and hardware to data centers -- a significant change from Nvidia's previous key end markets in gaming, professional visualization, and automotive.\nNvidia has been in the spotlight lately due to mounting competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Broadcom works with hyperscalers like Alphabet to develop custom AI chips. Broadcom and Alphabet have been collaborating for several years, but the relationship has entered a new gear as Alphabet uses these custom chips to train AI models. Alphabet is considering selling its custom chips, called tensor processing units, to other hyperscalers like Meta Platforms. If Alphabet can rival Nvidia with a customer-built full-stack solution that doesn't depend on its GPUs, it could erode Nvidia's margins. That threat has been reflected in the stock prices of both companies -- Nvidia is up just a couple of percentage points over the last three months, compared to a 21% gain for Alphabet.\n\nStory Continues\nNvidia's margins could fall, and it could still become the most profitable company (in addition to being the most valuable) in the world in the coming years. Nvidia has an exceptional balance sheet and generates tons of free cash flow that it can use to invest in long-term projects and ramp up research and development (R&D) spending.\n\nNvidia's cash-supported R&D gives it a rapidly evolving product pipeline. It could have easily rested on its laurels after developing its Blackwell architecture. Instead, Nvidia plans to release its new class of GPUs, called Rubin, which are specifically engineered for AI systems. Rubin will use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing 's highly advanced 3-nanometer process, which packs more transistors into each microchip to increase performance.\nNvidia's valuation is reasonable, while Tesla's is built on speculation With Tesla's EV business under pressure, the company needs to begin generating positive cash flow from its other efforts to support long-term growth projects. Nvidia, on the other hand, is already a high-margin cash cow that is well-positioned to address mounting competition.\nAdditionally, Nvidia trades at a much more reasonable 37.2 times forward earnings. Tesla's is a mind-numbing 292.9.\n\nNvidia and Tesla have both delivered impeccable returns for long-term investors. But for 2026, Nvidia has a far better profile of risk to potential reward than Tesla, which has a mountain to climb just to meet investor expectations and could get punished for even minor missteps.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

      "Content": "This Nuclear Stock Could Turn $1,000 Into $100,000\n\nSteven Porrello, The Motley Fool\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 7:25 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: OKLO\n\n^GSPC\n\nNVDA\n\nMSFT\n\nPLTR\n\nKey Points Oklo is a pre-revenue nuclear start-up that needs a NRC license to turn its idea into profits.\nThe company's microreactors could be a billion dollar idea if data center demand stays hot.\nTo grow one-hundred-fold, Oklo would have to become a trillion dollar company, which would likely only happen over a long period.\n10 stocks we like better than Oklo ›\n\nEarly investors in Oklo (NYSE: OKLO) who held on to their shares through the flat and rocky months of 2024 have seen a triple-digit gain since last year.\nIndeed, after losing more than 50% on its first day of trading (May 10, 2024), Oklo stock has rebounded more than tenfold, beating heavyweight AI favorites, like Nvidia , Palantir , Alphabet , and Microsoft , plus the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) over the same period.\nPut differently: If you had invested $10,000 in Oklo near the end of its May 10 debut, you would have about $100,000 right now. At one point in October, that same holdings would have been worth well over $200,000.\nWith a 280% gain on the year, Oklo may seem like old news. And yet if you believe in the future of artificial intelligence (AI), this stock's incredible run may only be the beginning.\nCan Oklo turn $1,000 into $100,000? Oklo isn't your average nuclear company.\nThe Sam Altman-backed start-up is designing a microreactor (\"Aurora powerhouse\") that can supply on-site power to remote areas.\nUnlike traditional nuclear power plants, which are expensive and can take a decade to finish building, Oklo's Auroras are factory-built and can be deployed faster than large reactors. That makes them ideal for data center operators, who often build in rural areas where grid power would be severely strained by their electricity needs.\n\nBut here's something to consider: If Oklo turns $1,000 into $100,000, it would join the trillion-dollar club. That's a pretty tall order for any start-up, let alone one that will operate in the utilities sector.\nWhile a one-hundred-fold gain isn't impossible, it would likely take years, if not decades, to happen. Meanwhile, the utilities sector is expected to grow only about 5% annually. Even if Oklo can turn on its first plants, it would need to scale beyond that utility sector growth.\nAt this point, I'd size an Oklo position small; if its reactors work, it could matter over the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oklo right now? Before you buy stock in Oklo, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oklo wasn’t one of them.

That is\n00:47 Eric\nas concentrated uh as we've ever been.\n00:52 Eric\nAnd we actually know from history, if you go back to 1970, once we get over 30% in those top 10, going out the next five years, there's a 95% chance\n01:06 Eric\nthat the other 490 are going to outperform those top 10.\n01:12 Eric\nUm so I'm concerned about concentration. And then of course with AI, look, AI is real. This is a game changer. It's going to change the world.\n01:20 Eric\nBut a lot of this is definitely focused on Open AI. Open AI is is right out there saying, hey guys, we're going to be losing money for a long time. We might be profitable\n01:30 Eric\n2030.\n01:32 Eric\nIs the market going to be patient and wait while all this capX happens and money's being invested and we're not seeing that ROI yet.\n01:43 Eric\nIs the market going to be patient with that? You know, I'm not sure. I think there's going to be a lot of volatility.\n01:49 Speaker A\nIn terms of that AI trade, Eric, looking ahead in 2026, do you think about, listen, I'll I'll just, I'll stick with the Mag 7 as a basket or do you feel like no, I'm going to have to be more discerning next year. It's going to get tougher. Maybe it's the mag 3 or four.\n02:04 Eric\nUh it's a great question. I mean, look, we're not stock pickers at the Wealth Alliance, we're more asset allocators.\n02:10 Eric\nI think if you own the Mag 7, I think you're going to be okay. Let's not forget, the Mag 7 the last decade has grown its earnings 20-fold.\n02:19 Eric\nThat is a 35% compounded versus about 8% for the S&P.\n02:25 Eric\nI think it's okay to have Mag 7 exposure and you should. My concern is when I see a lot of new clients are coming into the firm, they're just loaded up in tech.\n02:34 Eric\nAnd they're not diversified. And I'm I just hit my 40th anniversary doing this. and I remember 1999 and 2000, seeing the same thing. People just loaded up in the same stocks. That was just gets me all nervous. Stay diversified. Look at this year, international emerging markets handily beating the US.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Is Microsoft Undervalued by Investors? These Tech Stock Experts Think So.\n\nAaron McDade\nMon, December 22, 2025 at 12:34 PM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nKey Takeaways Wedbush analysts wrote Monday that Microsoft stock has room to run in 2026 after it has recently pulled back from October's record highs.\nInvestors are still \"underestimating\" how much value Microsoft's Azure cloud computing services could add as the AI industry continues to grow, the analysts said.\n\nMicrosoft ( MSFT ) stock has set a number of records this year, and analysts think that trend can continue well into 2026.\nWedbush analysts led by Dan Ives, who is particularly bullish on the artificial intelligence trade , wrote Monday that Microsoft remains undervalued as the new year approaches. The analysts reiterated their \"outperform\" rating and $625 price target, upside of nearly 30% from the stock's Monday levels.\nThe analysts wrote that investors are still \"underestimating\" how much Microsoft's Azure cloud computing service could grow if the AI industry continues expanding as Wedbush expects. The analysts project that Azure and Microsoft's Copilot AI assistant could add $25 billion in sales to Microsoft's results through fiscal 2026.\n\nWhy This Matter to Investors Despite a recent pullback in tech stocks , some analysts are still saying that the AI trade should be able to continue providing growth next year as the biggest tech companies keep spending tens of billions on the infrastructure behind AI.\n\"We believe Microsoft is set to have a massive 2026 and the stock is a compelling buy at these levels,\" the analysts wrote, as they expect Microsoft to play a \"foundational role\" in the next stages of AI development.\n\nWedbush analysts aren't alone, as all but one of the 13 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rate Microsoft a \"buy,\" with the other calling it a \"hold.\" The average price target among those analysts is $635, even higher than Wedbush's target, indicating the expectation that Microsoft stock will rise well above the records it set earlier this year.\nThe AI trade has had a rocky last several weeks as investors and analysts have raised an increasing number of questions over whether the circular nature of funding in the AI industry is sustainable, and when tech companies could potentially see a return on the billions they have invested in the tech.\nMicrosoft shares were little changed in late-afternoon trading Monday. They have gained about 15% since the start of the year, but are roughly 10% below their most recent record closing high , set just before the company's last earnings report in October.\nRead the original article on Investopedia\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
