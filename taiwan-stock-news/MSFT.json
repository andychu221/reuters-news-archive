      "Content": "Meta (META)’s Data Center is a “Big, Hard Thing to Do,” Says Jim Cramer\n\nRamish Cheema\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:49 AM PST 2 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nGOOG\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nWe recently published 12 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar . Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAs is the case with other technology giants, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has positioned itself to be a key player in the AI race. The firm differs from players such as Google and Amazon through the fact that it does not operate a cloud computing business. Yet, while Google, Amazon, and Microsoft spend on AI data centers to bolster their cloud computing capabilities, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) continues to spend just as much despite not being a major player in the industry. The spending has also seen the focus of analysts, with TD Cowen commenting on December 4th that the firm’s decision to cut back its metaverse spending could counter the increased spending on AI infrastructure. TD Cowen kept a Buy rating and an $810 share price target for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s shares.\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\nThe firm’s infrastructure spending includes a major data center it is building in Louisiana. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced on December 4th, 2024, that it was building a $10 billion data center in the state, and recent media reports have suggested that costs have ballooned to $27 billion. During this episode, Cramer and his co-hosts discussed reports of CoreWeave’s Texas data center project struggling, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) factored into the discussion:\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a key player in the AI industry due to several factors. These include the firm’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business and its in-house Trainium AI chips. The highly competitive cloud computing industry, which sees investors demand high growth rates, has also affected Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in 2025. As an example, the shares dipped in August after the firm’s second-quarter earnings saw AWS post a 17.5% revenue growth, which was slower than Microsoft and Google’s cloud growth rates of 39% and 32%, respectively.\nZapp2Photo/Shutterstock.com\nAWS has also been the focus of recent analyst coverage for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s shares. For instance, Guggenheim initiated coverage on December 10th as it set a Buy rating and a $300 share price target. The research firm cited AWS as the reason behind its coverage and shared that the business’s 3.8-year backlog had touched $200 billion in Q2. Cramer also discussed the AWS business. He insisted that the cloud business will drive the narrative, and commented on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) after BMO Capital raised the share price target to $304 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating, and raised the Q1 2026 AWS cloud growth estimate to 24% from an earlier 23%. Cramer’s optimism is met by hedge fund sentiment as well, with 332 of the 978 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey’s database having disclosed a stake to make Amazon.com, Inc.

Ltd.\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: META\n\nSSNLF\n\nMSFT\n\nDelray Beach, FL, Dec. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The immersive VR market is projected to grow from USD 10.1 billion in 2024 to USD 34.9 billion by 2029, registering a CAGR of 28 percent.\nThis rapid expansion is driven by continuous technological innovation that enables VR hardware to deliver full immersion with fewer components and improved efficiency. The increasing ease of content creation for immersive environments and the rising adoption of digital training and simulation methods across manufacturing, aerospace and defense sectors further support market growth. As enterprises invest in advanced visualization tools, immersive VR is becoming an essential technology for enhancing productivity, skill development and operational performance.\n\nDownload PDF Sample for More Insights:\nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=201528031\nMajor Top Key Players included:\nMeta,\nSony Group Corporation,\nSamsung Electronics,\nMicrosoft and\nApple\nSoftware Segment to Register the Fastest Growth\nThe software segment is projected to expand at the highest CAGR between 2024 and 2029 due to the rising demand for engaging and diverse VR content. As VR hardware becomes more accessible and powerful, the need for high quality software that delivers meaningful and interactive experiences is increasing rapidly. Software developers are creating immersive applications across entertainment, education, healthcare and industrial training, enabling users to benefit from realistic and dynamic virtual environments. The continued evolution of VR content and its compatibility with existing devices are expected to accelerate the growth of immersive VR software throughout the forecast period.\n\nConsumer Applications Leading Market Share\nConsumer applications are expected to capture the largest share of the immersive VR market from 2024 to 2029. Advancements in VR headsets have significantly improved user experience by making devices more comfortable, robust and affordable. Gaming remains the primary driver of consumer adoption, offering deeply engaging experiences that cannot be replicated by traditional platforms. Beyond gaming, the consumer market is expanding rapidly with the rise of social VR platforms, virtual recreation and immersive digital travel. These developments are reshaping digital engagement and broadening the appeal of immersive VR across diverse user groups.\nAsia Pacific to Record the Highest Regional Growth\nAsia Pacific is forecast to witness the highest CAGR in the immersive VR market between 2024 and 2029. The region’s strong entertainment, gaming and training ecosystems are contributing to widespread adoption of VR technologies. Countries such as China and South Korea have large and active gaming communities that are embracing immersive VR for enhanced interactive experiences. Additionally, the region is investing heavily in education and industrial training, recognizing the role of immersive content in improving learning efficiency and workforce capabilities. The increasing integration of VR in academic institutions and corporate training centers is expected to further accelerate market growth in the region.\n\nStory Continues\nAsk for Sample Report to Get More Information:\nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=201528031\nOpportunity: Continuous developments in 5G technology\nImmersive VR market is becoming increasingly popular for both personal and business use. It is anticipated that the introduction of 5G technology will solve certain issues by enabling the most efficient deployment of processing power. 5 G's improved performance enhances the VR application user experience through reliable and faster connections. Virtual reality experiences can become more responsive with reduced latency and increased data transmission rates, while graphics can also allow for real-time streaming of complex 3D images and better-quality data.\n\nChallenge: High energy consumption and latency issues\nThe effectiveness of VR devices is influenced by a few technological factors that need to be carefully considered. The two most significant factors are energy consumption and display latency. Latency, or the interval of time between a user's action in a virtual reality environment and its visual display, influences the user's sense of immersion with these technologies. The slightest delays could result in uneasiness, perplexity, or a sense of being cut off from the virtual world.\nSubmit an Inquiry:\nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=201528031\nSee More Latest Semiconductor Reports:\nAugmented and Virtual Reality Market by Enterprise, Technology (Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality), Offering (Hardware, Software), Device Type (HMDs, HUDs, Gesture Tracking Devices), Application and Region - Global Forecast to 2029\n\nDownload PDF Sample: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=1185\nVirtual Reality (VR) Market Size, Share & Industry Growth Analysis Report by Technology (Non-immersive, Semi & Fully Immersive), Offering, Device Type (Head-mounted Devices, Gesture Tracking Devices, Projectors & Display Walls), Application and Region - Global Forecast to 2029\nDownload PDF Sample: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=458\nCONTACT: About MarketsandMarkets™: MarketsandMarkets™ has been recognized as one of America's Best Management Consulting Firms by Forbes, as per their recent report.

Alphabet: Which Could Be The World's Biggest Company By End-2026?\n\nPiero Cingari\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 6:01 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: NVDA\n\nGOOG\n\nAAPL\n\nAMZN\n\nMSFT\n\nNvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) have quietly become the two most dominant forces inside the Magnificent Seven, riding different paths to the same destination: artificial intelligence supremacy.\nNvidia's GPUs remain the backbone of the global AI buildout, powering everything from data centers to cutting-edge model training.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is pushing its own vertically integrated AI stack — from custom TPUs to Gemini — embedding intelligence directly across Search, Cloud and consumer products.\nThe market thus far has rewarded both approaches. Nvidia is up 33% year-to-date through Dec. 17, while Alphabet has surged 62%.\nDon't Miss:\nMissed Nvidia and Tesla? RAD Intel Could Be the Next AI Powerhouse — Just $0.85 a Share\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace— Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\nZooming out further tells an even more dramatic story: since early 2023, Alphabet shares are up roughly 250%, while Nvidia has delivered a staggering 1,120% return.\nThat explosive run has made Nvidia the world's biggest company today, with a market capitalization of about $4.318 trillion — even briefly touching $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet ranks third at approximately $3.7 trillion, behind Apple's $4.05 trillion valuation.\n\nYet traders see a far closer race ahead.\nOn Polymarket, both Nvidia and Alphabet are assigned a 35% probability of being the world's most valuable company by the end of 2026.\nA $100 bet on Alphabet overtaking Nvidia to become the world's biggest company by the end of next year would pay out $265 if it happens — with nearly identical returns available for those wagering that Nvidia holds onto the crown.\nTrending: Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) trails with a 14% chance, followed by Microsoft Corp. (NYSE: MSFT ) at 9%.\nTesla Inc . (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) sit further back, at 4% and 3%, respectively.\n\nHow Could Alphabet Overtake Nvidia As World’s Biggest Company? For Alphabet to dethrone Nvidia as world’s biggest company, it needs to outperform by a meaningful margin.\nThe current valuation gap between the two companies is about $600 billion.\nIf Nvidia's market cap were to grow 10% in 2026, it would climb from roughly $4.3 trillion to about $4.75 trillion. For Alphabet to leapfrog Nvidia in that scenario, its shares would need to outperform Nvidia by roughly 19 percentage points.\n\nStory Continues\nIn practical terms, that would mean Alphabet gaining about 29% in a year where Nvidia rises 10%, lifting Google's valuation to around $4.77 trillion.\nAny performance gap of 19 percentage points in Alphabet's favor could hand it the crown — assuming today's market caps as the starting line.\n\nThe bet, then, is whether Alphabet's AI monetization, advertising leverage and cloud growth can accelerate faster than Nvidia's already-dominant chip business.\nSee Also: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\nWall Street Still Backs Nvidia Where traders see a coin flip, Wall Street analysts remain more decisive.\nBased on median 12-month price targets, analysts expect Nvidia's reign to continue. Consensus estimates point to Nvidia shares reaching about $250 over the next year, or roughly 40% upside from the current price near $177.\nAlphabet's outlook is far more muted by comparison. Analysts see a median 12-month target of $330, implying just 6% upside from its current level around $306.\n\nThat gap underscores the tension at the core of the debate: prediction markets see a neck-and-neck race for the world's largest company, while Wall Street analysts continue to model an extended run of Nvidia's dominance.\nBy the end of 2026, the outcome may hinge on a single question: will the AI arms race ultimately reward the company supplying the picks and shovels, or the one embedding intelligence into every layer of the digital economy?\nRead Next: $100k+ in investable assets?

DOE officials say that could dramatically shorten the time it takes for researchers to move from ideas to real world breakthroughs.\nAlongside the major cloud providers, the group includes Nvidia ( NASDAQ:NVDA ), AMD ( NASDAQ:AMD ), Intel ( NASDAQ:INTC ), OpenAI (OPENAI), Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ), Palantir ( NASDAQ:PLTR ), Dell ( NYSE:DELL ), and IBM (IBM), many of which already work closely with U.S. national labs. White House officials described the partnerships as just the beginning of a broader national AI platform for research.\nFor investors, this is not about near term sales. It is about positioning.

The Information first reported news of the deal, though it said the fundraise would land OpenAI a $750 billion price tag.\n\nThe funding would come as OpenAI commits to spend trillions of dollars and strikes deals around the world as the company tries to stay ahead in the race to develop AI technology. The cash injection would also help the company with its spending on inferencing, which seems to be funded more by cash than cloud credits , suggesting the company’s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\nAnd, as competition intensifies from rivals like Anthropic and Google , OpenAI has had to step on the gas to release new models and expand its presence in the developer and tooling ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, broader sentiment around AI has recently cooled as investors start doubting whether the pace of debt-fueled investment by giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and OpenAI itself can be maintained in the long run. It also doesn’t help that the production of chips is being constrained by shortages in the supply of memory chips, which threatens to affect the broader tech sector.\n\nOpenAI has also been rumored to be working on an IPO as a way to raise tens of billions and fund its development efforts, which are currently said to be generating annual run-rate revenue of about $20 billion. There are also rumors that the company is courting Amazon for a $10 billion investment that would also give the AI lab access to the tech giant’s new AI computing chips.\nIf the fundraise happens, it would add a substantial amount to OpenAI’s coffers, which currently have more than $64 billion, according to PitchBook data. The company was most recently valued at about $500 billion in a secondary transaction .\nOpenAI did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

The accord addresses U.S. national security concerns and prevents a social media app ban. Oracle and its partners would hold over 80% of a new TikTok U.S. corporation by late January. The deal might boost Oracle's cloud business by making TikTok a long-term client, analysts said. This would secure TikTok as a key customer for OCI and could drive meaningful upside for non-AI parts of the business via durable, higher-margin workloads, Mizuho analyst Siti Panigrahi said. The Information said that Microsoft-backed OpenAI is in talks to raise up to $100 billion at a $750 billion value, boosting the stock. The prospective funding shows investor interest in artificial intelligence, which is linked to Oracle's cloud infrastructure relationships. Oracle shares were under pressure due to OpenAI cloud collaboration expenditure fears.

The company is exploring a new funding round that could raise as much as $100 billion and push its valuation to around $830 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nIs ORCL fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nThat would be a massive jump from the roughly $500 billion valuation reported earlier and even above the $750 billion figure mentioned in recent reports. Nothing is final yet. The talks are still in the early stages, and OpenAI is hoping to complete the round by the end of Q1 at the earliest. Whether there is enough investor demand remains an open question, especially as scrutiny around AI spending has increased.\nThe reason for the raise is straightforward. Building and running cutting edge AI models is incredibly expensive. OpenAI is projected to burn more than $200 billion in cash through 2030 as it scales infrastructure and computing power. Some partners, including Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) and CoreWeave ( NASDAQ:CRWV ), have already felt investor pressure tied to data center expansion.\nFor investors, this funding round is a real stress test. If OpenAI pulls it off, it reinforces its position at the center of the AI boom. If not, it could mark a turning point in how the market views big ticket AI spending.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

We we heard from Gil Luria recently, smart, smart analyst, thoughtful guy.\n00:05 Speaker B\nLove Gil.\n00:06 Speaker A\nWe love Gil. Uh and we wanted his take. Now Gil is, you know, not a fan of Oracle. He's neutral. He tells his clients, stay on the sidelines. Take a listen to what he had to say and then we'll get your response.\n00:19 Gil Luria\nMicrosoft is front of the line. Microsoft who owns the biggest part of OpenAI is front of the line. They'll get paid first. If there's something left over, I'd argue that Amazon is probably next. Maybe after that is Oracle, which is to say the 300 billion isn't going to materialize.\n00:39 Speaker A\nSo 300 billion not going to materialize. What do you think, Corey?\n00:44 Corey\nWell, I mean, you know, they've got contracts with with their customers. They've clearly vetted the customers that they want and not had the customers that they don't. Um but again, this is why your choice of OpenAI is so important. Is OpenAI really going to stiff and not be able to pay their bills? It's it's a question. It's a reasonable question, but it's not just OpenAI. Their customers are companies like Nvidia, their customers are companies like like, you know, Milwaukee Best tools. I mean, they have so many varied customers that have deep pockets, uh that, you know, I would expect them to get paid in almost every occasion and that the risk does not entirely sit with OpenAI. But yeah, if OpenAI goes belly up and can't pay its bills, Microsoft's going to be in trouble, too.\n01:31 Speaker A\nLet me ask you, this broader AI boom bubble debate, when you hear of more companies and they're tapping the debt markets now to finance these AI ambitions,\n01:43 Corey\nYes.\n01:44 Speaker A\nDoes that cause you to reconsider that debate at all, broadly?\n01:49 Corey\nYou know, debt debt works both ways, leverage book works both ways, right? It works to help you do great things, greater, and it can work to blow things up when things go bad. So, I think you do have to look sort of case by case at what's going on here. But when I look at a company like Oracle, if Oracle can call, you know, give him a 12% return on invested capital, which is what they've averaged the last five years or so. If you could tell them if you spend $100 billion, you can make $12 billion in profits, Larry Ellison and the management of of Oracle is right to say, well, I'll give you 200 billion, give me 24 billion in revenues. You know, or in returns and in ultimate returns here. So I think that, you know, if their cost of capital is 3%, if their return on invested capital is 12%, why wouldn't they take bigger bets to get that done? Yeah, you got to be smart, you got to pick the right customers. Well, who's smarter than than the folks at Oracle uh at managing this and taking advantage of this business opportunity? They have captured the biggest contracts out there. They have so far done a good job of executing those contracts. They're financing that using debt at a low cost of capital. That's business. It's smart business.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Six Charts That Show How Stock Markets Got Reshaped in 2025\n\nMichael Msika and Jan-Patrick Barnert\nFri, December 19, 2025 at 2:00 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\nDX-Y.NYB\n\nGOOG\n\n^VIX\n\nNVDA\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Stock investors can’t claim that this year has lacked market drama.\nIt didn’t always look likely, but equities have managed strong returns in 2025, weathering shocks like DeepSeek of China’s challenge to US artificial intelligence and the tariff storm unleashed by the Trump administration in April.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHudson Tunnel Digging Work to Start as Boring Machines Ready\nNYC High Line-Area Building Floats $53 Million Bankruptcy Sale\nHow This Chameleon UK Location Became a Little-Known Hollywood Backdrop\nICE Plans Detention Expansion With Deal to Design 'Mega Centers'\nNew York Says Cab, Rideshare Insurance Rates to Rise 25%\nDips were bought at record pace and a fear of missing out on the rally dominated sentiment. In the background, a powerful wave of diversification swept through the market as investors responded to the cracks appearing in so-called US exceptionalism by buying up European, Asian and emerging-market stocks.\nHere are six charts that capture some of the key episodes that reshaped equity markets in 2025:\n\nThe year started with investors maxed-out on American exposure and convinced US dominance was here to stay. But DeepSeek shook the status quo in the AI world, while President Donald Trump’s April tariff salvo all but spelled the end of the bull market that began in 2022. Still, as Trump dialed back his trade war, interest rates fell and the global economy showed resilience, investor confidence returned.\nThat didn’t spare US stocks from bearing the brunt of the selloff. And they never fully caught up with the rest of the world, held back by a weakening dollar. The greenback hasn’t clawed back its 13% slump in the first half, while a growing chorus of strategists has recommended international equities over their US peers.\nMSCI Inc.’s gauge of global stocks excluding the US is tracking its strongest outperformance over the S&P 500 since 2009.\nThe US flagship index is missing from the ranks of best-performing benchmarks, but it did still achieve decent enough gains of 14%. The nagging worry for investors has been the concentrated nature of those returns. “Bubble in the making” became a key concern this year, with some data echoing the early stages of excessive internet over-valuations. The tech sector’s weighting in the S&P 500 reached a record 36%, breaching the previous peak of 2000 leading into the dotcom crash, before retreating below 35%.\n\nA closer examination of this year’s trading reveals unprecedented levels of concentration behind the gains on Wall Street. Tech megacaps powered the rally all year long, with just five stocks accounting for nearly 45% of the benchmark’s returns: Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nStory Continues\nWhile excitement around AI has driven returns in the US and Asia, the story has been very different in Europe, a market crucially lacking tech stocks. Here, other thematics stepped to the fore. Banks led Europe’s rally, surging on the way to their strongest year since 1997, while governments’ defense, energy and infrastructure spending commitments lifted the names set to benefit from these outlays.\nThe upshot of all this is the widest dislocation in market leadership between the US and Europe ever seen. Value stocks inspired the advance in Europe, while growth equities led it in the US. This pushed investors into unchartered territory, as equity factors typically move in similar fashion.\nInvestors buffeted by April’s extreme turbulence could hardly have anticipated the relatively smooth ride they had the remaining three-quarters of the year. No drawdown exceeded 5% until November, with each dip enthusiastically snapped up at a rapid clip. The AI narrative, solid earnings and the leftovers from April’s sudden positioning washout encouraged investors to chase stocks steadily higher. The impressive rally stalled only as exuberance over AI was questioned in the final stretch of the year.\nStrong appetite for stocks has been accompanied by the destruction of volatility this year. Considering historical reset patterns for the VIX Index, it’s surprising how often the gauge managed to retrace a spike of 40% or more within a 10-day trading period. This didn’t happen at all before 2011, but has already occurred several times in topsy-turvy 2025.\nStock investors embraced the notion that volatility spikes have become increasingly short-lived. A new market logic appears to have taken hold: stocks panic, volatility gets bid, the risk event is resolved, gamma supply takes over and volatility quickly retreats.\nUS option volumes marked fresh highs, with two daily prints exceeding 100 million turnover this year for the first time. To emphasise the increased demand, trading volume was above 60 million daily contracts on 117 days compared to only 12 days in 2024.\nWhile hedging demand played a role in April and November, most of the time it was calls dominating the tape. With investors chasing the right tail as well as volatility sellers using ultra short-term contracts to earn income, the options market remains a key factor for stocks, contributing to the swift resets in volatility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUniqlo Founder and Japan’s Richest Man Loves a $32 Pair of Slacks\nPrivate Equity Is Ruining a Beloved Fly-Fishing Brand, Retailers Say\nThe Cracks in Crumbl’s Cookie Empire Are Showing\nDonald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure\nOracle’s $300 Billion AI Bet Has Fast Become a Bubble Barometer\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

However, their sheer size makes it more challenging to maintain high growth rates as they’ve already captured significant portions of their markets.\nThese trade-offs can cause headaches for even the most seasoned professionals, which is why we started StockStory - to help you find high-quality companies that can grow their earnings no matter what. Keeping that in mind, here is one large-cap stock that still has big upside potential and two that could be stalling.\n\nTwo Large-Cap Stocks to Sell: Expedia (EXPE) Market Cap: $34.65 billion\nOriginally founded as a part of Microsoft, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is one of the world’s leading online travel agencies.\nWhy Does EXPE Worry Us?\nLarge revenue base makes it harder to increase sales quickly, and its annual revenue growth of 8.3% over the last three years was below our standards for the consumer internet sector\nPreference for prioritizing user growth over monetization has led to 1.7% annual drops in its average revenue per booking\nHighly competitive market means it’s on the never-ending treadmill of sales and marketing spend\n\nAt $285.52 per share, Expedia trades at 10.2x forward EV/EBITDA. Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including EXPE in your portfolio, it’s free for active Edge members .\nHoneywell (HON) Market Cap: $126.9 billion\nOriginally founded in 1906 as a thermostat company, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) is a multinational conglomerate known for its aerospace systems, building technologies, performance materials, and safety and productivity solutions.\nWhy Are We Hesitant About HON?\nAbsence of organic revenue growth over the past two years suggests it may have to lean into acquisitions to drive its expansion\nProjected sales decline of 3.3% for the next 12 months points to a tough demand environment ahead\nShrinking returns on capital suggest that increasing competition is eating into the company’s profitability\n\nHoneywell is trading at $197.56 per share, or 19.5x forward P/E. Dive into our free research report to see why there are better opportunities than HON .\nOne Large-Cap Stock to Watch: Wabtec (WAB) Market Cap: $36.53 billion\nAlso known as Wabtec, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (NYSE:WAB) provides equipment, systems, and related software for the railway industry.\nWhy Does WAB Stand Out?\nOperating profits and efficiency rose over the last five years as it benefited from some fixed cost leverage\nPerformance over the past two years was turbocharged by share buybacks, which enabled its earnings per share to grow faster than its revenue\nRobust free cash flow margin of 11.6% gives it many options for capital deployment\n\nStory Continues\nWabtec’s stock price of $213.41 implies a valuation ratio of 21.6x forward P/E. Is now the time to initiate a position? Find out in our full research report, it’s free for active Edge members .\nStocks We Like Even More The market’s up big this year - but there’s a catch. Just 4 stocks account for half the S&P 500’s entire gain. That kind of concentration makes investors nervous, and for good reason. While everyone piles into the same crowded names, smart investors are hunting quality where no one’s looking - and paying a fraction of the price. Check out the high-quality names we’ve flagged in our Top 6 Stocks for this week . This is a curated list of our High Quality stocks that have generated a market-beating return of 244% over the last five years (as of June 30, 2025).\nStocks that made our list in 2020 include now familiar names such as Nvidia (+1,326% between June 2020 and June 2025) as well as under-the-radar businesses like the once-small-cap company Exlservice (+354% five-year return).

      "Content": "Billionaire Bill Gates Has 60% of His Foundation's $37 Billion Portfolio Invested in Noticeably Non-Tech Stocks Heading Into 2026\n\nAdam Levy, The Motley Fool\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 6:50 PM PST 7 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nKey Points Warren Buffett is one of the biggest donors to the Gates Foundation, and his influence is noticeable.\nThe foundation's trust invests primarily in slow-growing value stocks with wide moats.\nThese three companies are trading around fair value, with predictable growth ahead.\n10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\n\nBill Gates built his fortune through Microsoft , one of the world's largest tech companies . He and co-founder Paul Allen got in on the ground floor of the personal computing revolution and amassed fortunes as their company's value rose in tandem with the boom in PCs in the 1980s and 1990s. Gates became the world's first centibillionaire (a net worth of $100 billion) in 1999, nearly two decades before anyone else would reach that level of wealth.\nToday, Gates is still worth about $100 billion, despite Microsoft's value skyrocketing about sixfold from its peak in 1999. That's because he's turned his attention to his foundation, where he plans to give away 99% of his remaining wealth over the next 20 years.\nGates has historically donated his Microsoft shares to the foundation, but the foundation trust's portfolio has sold off those shares while remaining heavily invested in some noticeably non-tech names. In fact, about 60% of the trust's portfolio is invested in three mostly low-tech companies, following the investment managers' sale of about two-thirds of its Microsoft shares last quarter. Here's where the Gates Foundation is investing today.\n1. Berkshire Hathaway (29.3% of portfolio value) Berkshire Hathaway 's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is a longtime donor to the Gates Foundation. Every year, he donates Class B shares of the stock to the foundation, along with several other charitable organizations. This year, he gave just over 9.4 million shares of the stock to the foundation at the end of June.\n\nBerkshire has produced solid results from its insurance business in 2025, despite setbacks from the California wildfires at the start of the year. Third-quarter results were particularly impressive, with underwriting earnings rising to $3.2 billion from $1 billion in Q3 2024. That more than offset the drop in earnings through the first half of the year.\nMeanwhile, Berkshire's massive investment portfolio continues to produce gains. However, Buffett and his investment team have struggled to find significant opportunities to invest Berkshire's growing cash pile . That pile's made bigger as Berkshire sells more equities than it buys every quarter.\n\nStory Continues\nShares of the conglomerate now trade for about 1.55 times book value. While that's above the stock's historic average, it's down from the high price investors were paying early in 2025. With Buffett's retirement announcement taking some air out of the stock, it's now trading closer to fair value at today's price, based on the assets held in its portfolio and its core operating results from insurance.\n\n2. Waste Management (17.1%) Waste Management (NYSE: WM) is one of the longest-held securities in the Gates Foundation trust. There's a good reason for that. It's a recession-resistant business with a huge competitive advantage.\nWaste Management's main waste-hauling business benefits from its scale and its dominant landfill ownership position. With its scale, the company is able to build a more efficient network of collection routes and transfer stations, benefiting its operating margin. Meanwhile, Waste Management's 262 active landfills put it in an enviable position among other waste haulers, as regulations make it extremely costly to obtain approval and build new landfills. As a result, the company has been able to raise prices every year due to the growing scarcity of landfills, while charging third-party waste haulers fees to use its facilities.\n\nThe business generated a 32% adjusted operating margin last quarter, continuing to demonstrate room for improvement as it exercises pricing power and scales.\nAdditionally, Waste Management now operates a medical waste disposal business following its acquisition of Stericycle, which it rebranded as WM Health Solutions. Management sees room for synergies to cut costs for the business, but it expects the market for Health Solutions to climb quickly over the next decade due to the aging U.S. population. For now, the business accounts for less than 10% of revenue.\nIt's no wonder that the trust has rarely sold shares of the stock, which has grown considerably over the last 25 years. Even with the company trading at an enterprise value of around 15 times its expected EBITDA over the next 12 months, it appears to be a good value. Strong earnings improvements for Health Solutions, combined with steady growth for the main waste-hauling business, should enable the stock to keep climbing from here.\n\n3. Canadian National Railway (13.6%) Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI) (TSX: CNR) connects Canada's east and west coasts with the Midwest United States and the Gulf Coast. Railroads remain an important method of hauling freight across dry land as massive scale drives overall costs lower. Better fuel efficiency than trucks, and the ability of trains to haul massive amounts, make them more economical for long-hauling. That said, it's a very slow-growing industry.\n\nOn the plus side, there are significant barriers to entry. It's practically impossible for a new company to compete with the big ones, as it takes thousands of freight contracts to generate the scale needed to operate profitably. Instead, the industry has consolidated over the years, as businesses look to take advantage of the benefits of scale. To that end, Canadian National has been able to raise prices steadily while growing contract volume. That's pushed its operating margin higher. It reached 38.6% last quarter.\nMany feared that tariffs would negatively affect the railroad's international freight business from Canada through the middle of the U.S. While management has seen a drop in volume for metals, minerals, and forest products due to the tariffs, it has seen increases in petroleum and chemicals, grain, coal, and fertilizers.\n\nDespite slow revenue growth, management has been able to increase its operating results while reducing its capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow growth climbed 14% through the first nine months of the year. Management expects further improvements in free cash flow in 2026, driven by additional reductions in capital expenditures. It returns that excess cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, the latter supporting mid-single-digit earnings-per-share growth.\nWith the company's enterprise value roughly 12 times analysts' EBITDA expectations, it appears to be a great value relative to its peers, trading closer to a 14-times multiple. Considering the barriers protecting the business, it's not surprising that the Gates Foundation continues to hold a massive position in the railroad.\n\nShould you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

(NYSE: NOW ) is included among the 12 Best Long Term US Stocks to Buy Now .\nPhoto by Viacheslav Bublyk on Unsplash\nOn December 17, BTIG initiated coverage of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with a Buy rating and a $1,000 price target.\nThe firm points to how far the platform has come since the launch of Now Assist two years ago. What started as an AI feature has grown into a broader system where humans and AI agents work side by side. ServiceNow now offers an AI Control Tower to handle oversight and governance, and it is working closely with Microsoft to run agent-based AI workflows across the entire enterprise. BTIG’s upside case assumes ServiceNow keeps operating above the Rule of 50. That includes revenue growth in the high teens and free cash flow growth in the mid-20% range.\n\nIn other news, Bloomberg reported that ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is in advanced discussions to acquire cybersecurity startup Armis. The company was last valued at $6.1 billion, and the deal could reach around $7 billion, which would make it ServiceNow’s largest acquisition to date. The report cited people familiar with the talks, who said the discussions are private. The transaction could be announced as soon as this week, though it is not guaranteed to close. Neither Armis nor ServiceNow responded to a request for comment from CNBC.\nArmis focuses on securing and managing internet-connected devices, helping organizations protect against cyber risks. Just over a month ago, the company raised $435 million in new funding and said it plans to pursue an IPO over time.\n\nServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides a cloud-based platform that helps organizations automate and manage digital workflows across IT, HR, customer service, and other business functions.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

      "Content": "Microsoft (MSFT) Outpaces Stock Market Gains: What You Should Know\n\nZacks Equity Research\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 2:45 PM PST 3 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\n^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) closed the most recent trading day at $483.84, moving +1.62% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.79%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.38%.\nThe stock of software maker has fallen by 2.26% in the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.85% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Microsoft in its upcoming release. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $3.86, marking a 19.5% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $80.16 billion, up 15.12% from the year-ago period.\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $15.59 per share and a revenue of $325.15 billion, representing changes of +14.3% and +15.42%, respectively, from the prior year.\nAdditionally, investors should keep an eye on any recent revisions to analyst forecasts for Microsoft. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the business outlook.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.19% higher. Microsoft currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn terms of valuation, Microsoft is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 30.55. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 23.55 for its industry.\n\nWe can additionally observe that MSFT currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.81. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Computer - Software industry held an average PEG ratio of 1.82.\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 74, putting it in the top 30% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory Continues\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

Um, November trading volumes are they're interesting, uh, Steve for you all. It looks like equity and options volumes if I'm reading this right, they were up year-over-year but they were down month-over month. Then it looks like crypto, Steve, uh, it looks down both ways. How how should we be interpreting this?\n00:26 Speaker B\nUm, I would I would look at it in the context of the whole year. If you look at in the whole in the context of the whole year, um, the months pre prior to that were the some of the all all-time high months um in in our history. So, I wouldn't look at it as a a real slowdown. I would look at it as more what I'd call a little bit more of a return to norm even from this year. But even what we're seeing today and and by the way, I I think there's a lot of hope that this is the start of the Santa Claus rally which typically happens mid mid December. Um we've been four days down, so I think people have been waiting for this. Um, I think you're seeing people that are still pretty engaged. You know, they're wrapping up the year and kind of rounding out the portfolio and making sure that everything is in order um before the new year.\n01:12 Speaker A\nIn terms of of of uh specific names, Steve, always curious to hear. what are what are you seeing? What are some of the more popular commonly held stocks?\n01:21 Speaker B\nYou know, it's funny, they there's a lot of rotation that happens. People are their own uh portfolio managers. Um but what we've seen recently is they've rolled out of names that have had some appreciation like Rivian and rolled into back to the mag seven, which, you know, for a while kind of fell out of favor but now they're it's back in favor. So, you know, this rotation is is something that's really fun to watch. And as we we watch customers typically take gains and sort of rotate into ones that they think have opportunities for appreciation.\n01:54 Speaker A\nAnother another stat that jumped out Steve, margin balances. I see here they're up about 150% year-over-year. What do you make of that? Is that to you Steve, do you see that, okay, that's a sign of is that a sign of confidence, risk appetite? What's your read?\n02:09 Speaker B\nUh I think it's a it's uh it's it's a it's really a factor of two things. Number one, we've been growing our margin business. So a lot of that is just net growth of that business, attracting new customers who are utilizing margin. And then the second component of it is again with elevated trading and elevated interest in the market, you're naturally going to see those margin balances go up. But you're right, the um the the um increase has been pretty extreme.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Jefferies Says IonQ Stock Can Double Over the Next 12 Months. Should You Buy It Here?\n\nAditya Raghunath\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 11:22 AM PST 4 min read\n\nIn this article: IONQ\n\nAMZN\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nJefferies just launched coverage of the quantum computing sector with a bullish call, sending IonQ (IONQ) shares surging. The firm slapped a $100 price target on IONQ stock, implying roughly 110% upside from current levels, while initiating with a “Buy” rating.\nIonQ develops trapped-ion quantum computers designed to solve complex problems across business, society, and scientific research. Founded on 25 years of academic research, the company uses ionized atoms to perform longer, more sophisticated calculations with fewer errors than competing quantum systems.\n\nMore News from Barchart Cathie Wood Keeps Buying the Dip in CoreWeave Stock. Should You?\nIs Cathie Wood Jumping Ship on Tesla Stock?\nBroadcom Stock Is Up 120% in the Past Year. This Analyst Thinks It Is One of the Highest-Quality Stocks to Buy for the Next Year Too.\nMarkets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nIonQ is the first quantum hardware provider integrated with all major cloud platforms, offering accessible quantum computing through partnerships with Amazon's (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, and Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Google Cloud for applications in chemistry, medicine, finance, and logistics optimization.\nAnalyst Kevin Garrigan expects IonQ to benefit from powerful ecosystem tailwinds driving quantum computing adoption. The company's trapped-ion architecture differentiates in coherence, fidelity, and native all-to-all connectivity, technical advantages that matter as the technology matures.\nIonQ's roadmap targets fault-tolerant quantum computing with integrated 256 qubits by 2026, scaling to 10,000 physical qubits and 800 logical qubits in 2027, and ultimately 2 million physical qubits with 80,000 logical qubits by 2030.\n\nIs IONQ Stock a Good Buy Right Now? IonQ delivered a stunning third quarter, solidifying its position as the dominant force in quantum computing. It reported revenue of almost $40 million, beating its guidance by 37% and growing 222% year-over-year (YoY).\nThe Q3 results showcased IonQ's expanding quantum platform strategy, encompassing computing, networking, sensing, and cybersecurity capabilities that no competitor can match.\n\nIonQ's fifth-generation Tempo system achieved an algorithmic qubit score of 64, creating a computational space 36 quadrillion times larger than IBM's (IBM) leading commercial system. More significantly, the company demonstrated a world-record 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity, meaning IonQ has hit every key technical milestone needed for full fault tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\nIonQ's acquisition spree is proving transformative. The Oxford Ionics deal closed during the quarter, bringing Electronic Qubit Control technology that leverages standard semiconductor fabrication.\nThis matters enormously because IonQ can now manufacture quantum chips using mature 128-nanometer nodes at existing foundries rather than building custom infrastructure that would cost billions. The bill of materials for a 2-million-qubit machine comes in at under $30 million, much lower than competitors.\n\nVector Atomic's addition expands IonQ's total addressable market into quantum sensing for positioning, navigation, and timing applications critical to defense customers. With quantum key distribution capabilities from the ID Quantique acquisition, IonQ can now bid on massive Golden Dome-style infrastructure projects that require integrated quantum solutions.\nThe business is rapidly globalizing, with international revenue accounting for 30% of total sales, up from nearly zero a year ago. Government and enterprise partnerships validate commercial viability, while the company expands beyond pure compute into quantum networking and sensing applications.\nWhat Is the IONQ Stock Price Target? Guidance for full-year 2025 revenue increased to $106 million to $110 million, breaking historical seasonality patterns as fourth-quarter revenue is expected to exceed the third quarter.\nThe company's 256-qubit system launches in 2026, followed by a roadmap that reaches 80,000 logical qubits by 2030, compared with IBM's stated target of just 2,000 logical qubits by 2033.\n\nAnalysts tracking the quantum computing stock forecast revenue to increase from $108.5 million in 2025 to $746 million in 2029. Despite this significant top-line growth, IONQ is expected to remain unprofitable. Over the next four years, its free cash outflow is projected to surpass $1.2 billion.\nIonQ raised $2 billion in October at $93 per share, bringing the pro forma cash balance to $3.5 billion with zero debt. This war chest positions the company to continue aggressive investment in maintaining what management describes as a five-year technical lead over competitors.\nIONQ stock has been volatile, down about 40% from October highs alongside the broader quantum computing selloff. Yet Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish, with 75% of analysts recommending IonQ.\nOut of the 13 analysts covering IONQ stock, eight recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” and four recommend “Hold.” The average IONQ stock price target is $75.50, above the current price of $47.\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

A $750 billion valuation would represent about a 50% increase from its reported $500 billion valuation in October.\nSeparate reports suggest OpenAI is also broadening its partnerships. The ChatGPT maker is said to be raising at least $10 billion from Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) and exploring the use of Amazon's AI chips, signaling diversification beyond its close relationship with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ).\nThe push for fresh capital comes as AI infrastructure costs keep rising, even as OpenAI generates billions in revenue.

According to purchase orders reviewed by Bloomberg, the company has sold more than 700,000 ChatGPT licenses to around 35 public universities, giving students and faculty broad access to the tool. Usage data from 20 campuses shows ChatGPT was called more than 14 million times in September, with average users turning to it 176 times that month for writing, research, and data analysis. While private university data is not publicly disclosed, OpenAI says it has sold well over one million licenses globally to colleges, suggesting overall penetration could be meaningfully higher.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with ARES.\nIs NFLX fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nPricing dynamics appear to be central to this momentum, especially when compared with Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ). Universities reviewed by Bloomberg are paying a few dollars per user per month for bulk ChatGPT access, a sharp discount to the $20 per month typically charged to smaller educational users and far below corporate pricing. By contrast, Microsoft's Copilot has often been quoted at around $30 per user per month at many campuses, prompting some schools to limit licenses largely to faculty, though Microsoft has since announced a reduced academic price of about $18 per month. At California State University, administrators evaluated multiple tools and selected ChatGPT as the cheapest and most familiar option, agreeing to pay OpenAI $15 million per year to cover roughly 500,000 students and staff. Even at schools deeply embedded in Microsoft software, internal documents suggest ChatGPT usage can exceed Copilot, with Google's Gemini sometimes also seeing stronger engagement.\n\nCompetition for the education market remains active and unsettled. Google is offering its Gemini Pro assistant free for a year to college students and has promoted adoption across universities and large school districts, while Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) continues to use education discounts to cultivate long-term loyalty. Policymakers are also stepping in, with the Trump administration recently announcing new federal grant priorities, including a $50 million pool aimed at expanding AI access in higher education. At the same time, concerns about educational impact persist. Netflix ( NASDAQ:NFLX ) Chairman Reed Hastings has donated $50 million to Bowdoin College to study how AI affects teaching and learning, reflecting unease that institutions may be moving quickly to adopt AI tools without clear evidence of improved outcomes. How OpenAI's early campus lead ultimately translates into durable preference among future workers may depend on how rivals adjust pricing, access, and integration in the years ahead.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Infrastructure builders, enterprise software creators, application developers, and cloud providers all play an integral part to the ecosystem. AI is far more than just semiconductor manufacturers.\nThat's why when it comes to investing in AI, it may be better to just buy the theme instead of trying to pick individual winners. Some of the biggest returns so far have been delivered by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. But stretched valuations, evidence of slowing momentum, and questions surrounding whether all the AI development spending will be worth it are beginning to plague some companies.\nAn ETF that can maintain exposure to some of those megacap names but look beyond them for additional opportunities may be the way to play it in 2026. Here are the three artificial intelligence ETFs that I'm favoring as we head into the new year.\n1. Defiance Quantum ETF If you're interested in true futuristic tech, quantum computing is probably for you. If artificial intelligence is the next revolution, quantum is the rocket that could really propel it to the next level.\nQuantum computing involves developing the technology for processing and calculating at speeds far beyond what traditional computers can do today. It has potential applications in technology, medicine, energy, finance, scientific discovery, and more.\n\nThe Defiance Quantum ETF (NASDAQ: QTUM) invests in companies at the forefront of quantum development. Top holdings right now include Tower Semiconductor , Rigetti Computing , Teradyne , Coherent , and Micron Technology .\nThe only Magnificent Seven name among the top 10 holdings is Alphabet, and it only comes in at No. 10, with a weight of 1.8%. So there's good diversification here relative to the broader tech sector and the equity market in general.\nQuantum is a little more niche and a lot more appropriate for a long-term holding than traditional AI stocks. It may be years before quantum becomes anything close to having mainstream applications, so it should be considered an investment in potential more than concrete current results.\n\nStory Continues\n2. Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF The Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ: AIQ) looks more like a traditional big tech ETF, but it's careful to include companies of all sizes and from all around the world. In that way, it's designed to be a more inclusive and comprehensive take on AI investing.\nThe fund's index starts by grouping companies in two categories:\n\nAI developers: Includes product and services developers and users, as well as companies that offer AI solutions as a service to customers.\nAI and big data analytics: Semiconductor, storage, and/or hardware manufacturers, as well as quantum computing developers.\nA minimum \"exposure score\" is required for inclusion. Qualifying components are weighted by market cap.\nAIQ is a nice middle ground between big and small companies, although it definitely tilts toward large caps. The AI exposure requirement is a nice way to build the portfolio and ensure that the fund is more of a pure AI play than just a generic megacap tech fund.\n3. Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF The Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT) describes itself as the world's first generative AI ETF. It's unique in that it's the only actively managed fund among the three, which is advantageous in such a rapidly evolving space. But it also leans more toward the megacap names.\n\nTop holdings currently include Alphabet, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms , and Palantir . Amazon , Broadcom , and Advanced Micro Devices also reside in the top 10, so there's very much a Nasdaq-100 index feel to this fund.\nIf you're looking for a straightforward, more \"conservative\" way to invest in AI, CHAT might not be a bad choice. You get the heavy large-cap exposure without a lot of the risk that comes from investing in newer or emerging names.\nShould you buy stock in Defiance Quantum ETF right now?

With the addition of support for VMware ESXi hypervisors, Windows, Linux and macOS environments, Arms Cyber becomes the first software vendor to offer a unified ransomware defense from a single platform.\n\nThe launch of Arms Cyber’s cross-hypervisor capabilities comes as ransomware operators increasingly target virtualization infrastructure to maximize impact. According to Microsoft, incidents targeting ESXi hypervisors have more than doubled over the past three years, with threat actors recognizing that a single compromised hypervisor can encrypt dozens of virtual machines simultaneously, paralyzing entire enterprises with devastating efficiency. For example, in April, the DragonForce ransomware attack targeting major UK retailers encrypted VMware ESXi hypervisors at Marks & Spencer, halting online sales for over 46 days and resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in profit losses and market value.\nRansomware Meets Its Match with Cross-Hypervisor Support\n\nArms Cyber takes a unique approach to solving this problem. Upon initial access, attackers using LOTL techniques establish patterns that deviate from normal operating procedures. Arms Cyber’s zero trust policies build off these deviation requirements to reinforce more effective prevention. Intruders also rely on reliable information about their target, and static environments offer an ideal landscape for gathering such data. Integrating Arms Cyber’s anti-ransomware platform at various layers introduces a level of diversity and dynamism, making it nearly impossible for attackers to gain the actionable intelligence they need about their target.\nWith the addition of support for VMware, Windows, Linux and macOS environments, Arms Cyber is securing the virtualization layer where attacks often hide. The new release hardens remote access with multi-factor authentication, blocks malicious executables with application filtering and process controls, and enforces network and file access lockdowns across the hypervisor environment. Decoy files provide early detection, while AI-powered response halts attacks with over 98% efficacy, automates file rollback, and removes attacker persistence. The platform deploys easily on VMware ESXi, Nutanix, XenServer, Citrix Hypervisor, Proxmox, RHEV, and KVM, requires no kernel modifications, and runs with a minimal footprint and performance impact.\n\nStory Continues\nAbout Arms Cyber\nArms Cyber delivers a revolutionary approach to defeat attacks others miss through a three-part strategy: Conceal, Deceive, and Restore — powered by stealth. By adding stealth to an organization’s existing security posture, we keep critical data invisible to attackers, detect threats before they cause serious damage, and enable rapid recovery without compromise. The outcome: no ransom payouts, no public breaches, no costly downtime.\nCONTACT: Kevin Wolf TGPR kevin@tgprllc.com\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

(NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO, Elon Musk , once again reignited the debate surrounding Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT ) co-founder, Bill Gates ‘ massive wealth, and what it could have been, had he not conformed to conventional wealth planning norms.\nBill Gates Could Have Been ‘World’s First Trillionaire’ On Wednesday, in a post on X, investor Michael Arouet highlighted the current top 10 richest people in the world, a list that no longer includes the Microsoft co-founder but does feature former CEO Steve Ballmer at No. 8, with an estimated net worth of $166 billion.\nThis comes after being ranked as the world’s wealthiest person by Forbes magazine for 18 of the 24 years between 1995 and 2017.\n\nDon't Miss:\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n$100k+ in investable assets?

(NYSE: BRK ) (NYSE: BRK ) CEO, Warren Buffett , who asked him to diversify his holdings.\nAccording to Arouet, if Gates hadn’t listened to Buffett, he would now be “the world's first trillionaire, worth twice as much as Elon.”\nAs Microsoft shares continue to soar, and its market capitalization is now at $3.6 trillion, Gates’ net worth would have stood at a staggering $1.5 trillion if he had retained all of his shares in the company and hadn’t embarked on the massive philanthropic journey with his ex-wife, Melinda Gates .\nTo be fair, it's difficult to fault Buffett for that advice.

      "Content": "How will the stock market perform in 2026? Wall Street pros weigh in.\n\nMary Cunningham\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 8:07 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: ^GSPC\n\n^DJI\n\n^IXIC\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.\nThe S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17— a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.\nThe key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an AI bubble percolate?\n\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"\nOther forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.\nWhat will drive stocks in 2026?\nSeveral catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.\n\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"\nThe AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.\nAnother area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers .\n\nStory Continues\nGrowth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.\n\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.\n\nAdam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.\nAnother tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.\nStill, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.\n\nIs my money safe?\nThe biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.\nAI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with earnings growth from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.\n\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.\nAmid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.\n\nIn its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.\nCrisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped . The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.\n\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"\nStill, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.\n\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.\nWhat to expect from Trump's address to the nation\nMore details emerge about Rob Reiner and wife Michele's killings\nNew surveillance video shows Nick Reiner before his arrest\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Microsoft Looks Like a “Table Pounder” After Dipping on AI Worries\n\nJoey Frenette\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 7:10 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: MSFT\n\nQuick Read Microsoft stock is down over 12% from recent highs amid AI spending concerns and competition from Google’s Gemini 3.0.\nThe company denied reports of reduced AI sales quotas following an article from The Information.\nMicrosoft has its own AI team led by Mustafa Suleyman and can reduce OpenAI dependence through Azure and its MAI model.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nIf you've been waiting for an opportunity to pick up shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on the cheap amid broad AI and tech jitters, here's your chance. The stock has been beaten down in recent months, now off more than 12% from its recent all-time highs. And while the still seemingly frothy 33.89 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple doesn't seem to suggest Microsoft shares are a \"table pounder,\" I do think that the premier hyperscaler remains one of the best bets of the Magnificent Seven.\nOf course, its close ties to OpenAI used to be a positive. Nowadays, it's a negative, with ChatGPT losing a bit of ground in the AI race to the likes of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), which has seemingly caught up with the release of its well-received Gemini 3.0 model.\n\nBut just because Google Gemini and the hardware running behind the scenes (Google TPUs) are having their moment, it does not mean we should start treating OpenAI as a laggard. Is the AI innovator behind ChatGPT a bit heavy on the debt, with more than a handful of circular deals?\nAI spending fears are weighing on the hyperscalers, Microsoft included Sure, but just because we've got reminders of the internet bubble and dot-com bust does not mean we're in for an exact repeat. Of course, heavy debt loads and extreme spending might be a concern for many. And circular dealmaking in the AI scene makes things a tad trickier and perhaps scarier for those with AI bubble fears.\n\nHowever, I think the big question is whether or not the AI efforts are going to pay off. If they do, leverage might work out heavily in the AI titan's favor in a big-time way. Of course, it's hard to tell how the AI frenzy ends, when it will end, and if the pain will be as bad as the dot-com bust. Either way, I think investors might wish to treat Microsoft as more than just an OpenAI proxy.\nAt the end of the day, Microsoft has been making its own investments to lessen its dependence on ChatGPT. Even if a worst-case scenario happens and OpenAI runs into a bit of financial trouble at some point down the road while giving up more ground to rival AI models, Microsoft can go its own way.\n\nStory Continues\nOpenAI aside, Microsoft has plenty of its own AI firepower Azure is the star of the show, and Microsoft can swap out the model running behind the scenes with another one, including its own (think the MAI model). With a powerful, arguably one of the most powerful, AI teams in the world, headed by a genius in Mustafa Suleyman, I'd argue that Microsoft's own AI dream team is worth the premium price tag.\n\nEither way, Microsoft has more than one racer in the AI race, and that improves the enterprise software behemoth's chances of having a winner on the road to AGI (artificial general intelligence).\nEither way, I think far too many investors are doubting OpenAI. But with the release of GPT-5.2, it's clear that OpenAI is a hungry company that's willing to do whatever it takes to keep that AI ball rolling. If anything, I'd argue that Gemini 3.0 and the \"code red\" it gave OpenAI is a good thing. It might be the nudge the firm needs to sprint that much faster.\nIn any case, I continue to view OpenAI as a massive positive for Microsoft that the market will appreciate again, perhaps in due time, or after the release of GPT-6, which one has to think will be smoother and far more impressive than the launch of GPT-5.\n\nWhat about jitters over that report on lower AI sales quotas? Finally, there's renewed anxiety that Microsoft's AI sales will miss the mark following a report from The Information that some divisions reduced their sales growth quotas.\nThe company has since denied the report, but, nevertheless, it seems like the investor unease has stuck around. If a future quarter proves sales jitters are unwarranted, perhaps Microsoft stock is unfairly sold off right here. In any case, I think 2026 could be a huge year for AI monetization, and few firms, I think, are better prepared than Microsoft.\n\nWhether we're talking about the OpenAI worries, broad bubble fears, or The Information report, I think there's too much negativity in Microsoft stock right here. And that might make its stock one of the bigger \"table pounders\" for the new year.\nThe New Report Shaking Up Retirement Plans You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you’d be wrong. Even great investments can be a liability in retirement. It’s a simple difference between accumulating vs distributing, and it makes all the difference.\nThe good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are reworking their portfolios and finding they can retire earlier than expected.

      "Content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year\n\nJoel South\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 5:30 AM PST 5 min read\n\nIn this article: AMZN\n\nORCL\n\nMSFT\n\nKey Points in This Article: Microsoft is dedicating significant capex to AI and cloud infrastructure in order to compete with other tech firms.\nMicrosoft’s gaming segment grew 44% last year, providing significant revenue to complement its software, cloud and AI business lines.\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nShares of Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) lost 0.03% over the past five trading sessions after losing 0.27% the five prior. That brings MSFT's year-to-date gain to 13.75%, including a more than 3r4% gain since its year-to-date low on April 8.\nWhen the Magnificent Seven member reported FY 2026 Q1 earnings on Oct. 29, shares fell despite beating on EPS and revenue. The company announced earnings of $3.72 per share versus analysts' expectations of $3.67, and quarterly revenue of $77.67 billion versus analysts' expectations of $75.33 billion.\nOn Oct. 1, the company announced that it was increasing its Xbox Game Pass subscription by 50%. In its last fiscal year, Microsoft saw more than 8% of revenue derived from its gaming segment, which now boasts 50 million monthly active subscribers and nearly $5 billion in YoY revenue.\n\nMicrosoft's decision in May fire 6,000 employees — or 3% of its workforce — signals the tech giant is serious about cost discipline amid economic uncertainty. With analysts eyeing sustained cloud demand, 24/7 Wall St. conducted analysis to explore whether Microsoft can maintain its upward trajectory and drive long-term growth.\nWhy Invest in Microsoft Microsoft navigates challenges, but remains a prime investment due to its AI and cloud dominance. Third-quarter earnings showcased robust demand for its Intelligent Cloud segment, though tariff risks linger. Microsoft’s $80 billion cash reserve fuels its $80 billion investments in cloud and AI infrastructure, with over half in the U.S.\n\nIts Microsoft 365 Copilot, adopted by over 70% of Fortune 500 firms, drives productivity revenue, positioning Microsoft to capture the AI market’s 37% compounded annual growth predicted through 2030. Similarly, partnerships with Oracle ( NYSE:ORCL ) for multi-cloud solutions bolster its competitiveness against Amazon 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) AWS.\nIn June, it was reported that the company will be expanding its AI and cloud investments in Switzerland, committing $400 million to expand its data center infrastructure in the European nation. The additional capacity is expected to support more than 50,000 current customers and expand the availability of AI services for more sectors, including health care, finance government. Microsoft is capitalizing on its Azure platform’s momentum as revenue jumped 39% in FY25 Q4, driven by AI services.\n\nStory Continues\nWhen Microsoft last reported earnings, EPS beat by 7.40% and revenue beat by 2.37%. The EPS beat marked the 15th time in the past 16 quarters that the company surpassed estimates, with EPS coming in at $3.46 versus the consensus forecast of $3.20.\nMicrosoft (MSFT) As a Company Microsoft reported a gross profit of $49.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with gross margins at 68%, driven by strong cloud and AI demand. The company committed to continuing spending on capital expenditures, focusing on AI data center expansion to meet enterprise needs. Analysts expect the company's capex to remain elevated to support Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure growth.\n\nTariff uncertainties do pose risks, even with the pause on China, as supply chain cost pressures for server hardware are not eliminated. Microsoft’s operating income of $32 billion was tempered by a 5% rise in operating expenses, reflecting heavy AI R&D investments. Despite no revenue from its $13 billion OpenAI stake, Microsoft reported $42.4 billion in Microsoft Cloud revenue, up 20% year-over-year.\nBeyond cloud, Microsoft’s gaming segment grew 44% with 43 points of the gain coming from its acquisition of Activision, but bolstered by Xbox content and Bethesda’s Starfield expansion. A partnership with Oracle for multicloud solutions strengthens its enterprise offerings, further diversifying its revenue. Wall Street projects Q4 revenue of $73.8 billion, up 14%, driven by Microsoft's AI and cloud momentum.\n\nMicrosoft As a Stock Broadly, 34 Wall Street analysts' remain bullish, with 32 analysts covering MSFT assigning it a \"Buy\" rating, two assigning it a \"Hold\" rating and none assigning it a \"Sell\" rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating. Wall Street's price targets cover a significant range, spanning $500 per share on the low end to $700 per share on the high end. The median one-year price target for MSFT is $632.22, which represents 32.78% potential upside from today's share price.\nInstitutional ownership currently stands at 73.74%, with three of the four largest buy-side firms — Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — holding a collective 1.570 billion shares of Microsoft.\nEstimate\nPrice Target\n%Change From Current Price\nLow\n$500\n5.01%\nMedian\n$632.22\n32.17%\nHigh\n$700\n47.02%\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock Prediction in 2025 Microsoft’s strong Azure revenue growth positions it for cloud and AI market gains. However, $20 billion quarterly capex and tariff risks require caution. Its $80 billion cash reserve and Oracle partnership offer stability, making MSFT stock a buy for growth investors, even as valuation concerns linger.\n\n24/7 Wall St. ’s year-end price target for Microsoft is $563.64, implying upside potential of 18.38% from the stock's current price. This cautious target reflects Azure’s strength and FY26 Q1 revenue guidance, balanced against the need for higher capex spending and potential supply chain disruptions, positioning it at a realistic estimate of its leading presence in the space.\nData Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.\nAnd no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that. Frankly, it’s shocking more people don’t adopt the habit given how easy it is .\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

Oracle is also on track to double its data center capex this year as it expands capacity for the Stargate project,\" said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell'Oro Group. \"What is notable this cycle is not just the pace of spending, but the expanding scope of investment, as cloud providers simultaneously scale accelerated compute, general-purpose servers, and the supporting infrastructure required to deploy AI at production scale. Accelerated server spending surged in the quarter, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, along with custom accelerator platforms across US hyperscalers, neo cloud providers, and sovereign AI deployments. At the same time, cloud service providers are increasing emphasis on greater capex discipline by optimizing asset depreciation and lifecycles to ensure healthy cash flow,\" explained Fung.\n\nAdditional highlights from the 3Q 2025 Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report:\nThe global data center capex growth outlook was raised through 2026, reflecting sustained hyperscale investment and continued prioritization of AI infrastructure.\nDemand for general-purpose servers strengthened as cloud providers expanded compute and storage capacity to support growing cloud services and inference-heavy AI workloads.\nDell led all server OEMs in revenue, followed by HPE and Lenovo, gaining share on strong NVIDIA Blackwell shipments and a refreshed x86 portfolio, while white-box vendors captured the majority of server shipments, supported by hyperscale AI deployments and elevated general-purpose server demand.\nAbout the Report\nDell'Oro Group's Data Center IT Capex Quarterly Report details the data center infrastructure capital expenditures of each of the ten largest Cloud service providers, as well as the Rest-of-Cloud, Telco, and Enterprise customer segments. Allocation of the data center infrastructure capex for general-purpose and accelerated servers, storage systems, and other auxiliary data center equipment is provided.

      "Content": "Nebius Shares Plunge Despite Launch of AI Cloud 3.1 with NVIDIA Tech\n\nNauman Khan\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:01 AM PST 1 min read\n\nIn this article: NBIS\n\nMSFT\n\nNVDA\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus .\nNebius ( NASDAQ:NBIS ) shares plunged about 6% Wednesday after the company unveiled Nebius AI Cloud 3.1, platform upgrade featuring NVIDIA (NVDA)'s Blackwell Ultra compute and new operational tools.\nThe Amsterdam-based cloud provider said 3.1 adds Capacity Blocks, a real-time Capacity Dashboard, project-level quotas and Microsoft Entra ID integration to help enterprises scale GPU workloads. Nebius also noted it operates GB300 NVL72 and HGX B300 systems and claims production runs on NVL72 with 800 Gbps Quantum-X800 InfiniBand.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NBIS.\nIs NBIS fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.\nDespite the product news, investors sold the stock. Traders flagged concerns over the company's lofty valuation and profitability trajectory: Nebius has surged more than 175% over the past year while trading on a P/E around 165 and remains unprofitable this year.\nThe market-observers indicated that the technological upgrade could push up the long-term demand, but have no significant effect on the near-term margins or cash burn.\nNebius is experiencing a terrible top line increase - the revenue increased substantially in the last quarter, but some investors seek evidence that the profitability can be maintained, and that the customers are committed to multi-year contracts before they will begin to offer to buy the shares at a premium.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",

      "Content": "Amazon, Apple, Google, etc.: Why the Mag 7 needs to 'recalibrate'\n\nYahoo Finance Video and Brian Sozzi\nThu, December 18, 2025 at 4:00 AM PST\n\nIn this video: TSLA\n\n^GSPC\n\nAAPL\n\nGOOG\n\nMSFT\n\nThe S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) is concentrated primarily in the top ten technology stocks, according to Barclays.\nPNC Asset Management Group chief investment officer Amanda Agati, Yahoo Finance Senior Business Reporter Ines Ferré , and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss the market's concentration in tech and whether it's time for investors to start selling the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid .\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\nWhat I mentioned at the top about how much concentration risk there is in the S&P 500. What does that mean exactly for investors as we gear up for next year?\n00:10 Amanda\nWell, it's a great question and it's great to be with all of you again.\n00:15 Amanda\nIt's tough out there. Uh certainly for active managers to try and own enough of those top seven or top 10 names to really make a difference in terms of trying to keep up with, let alone outperform the S&P 500.\n00:30 Amanda\nSo for multi- asset investors, it's I think it's just going to continue to be a challenging environment to keep up with the S&P 500. It's hard to bet against them though.\n00:43 Amanda\nBut I think for 2026, it's going to be less about valuation multiple expansion and much more about what happens to the bottom 490 or 493, however you want to calculate it. I think that market breadth story, it was a little bit elusive this year, but I think it's going to come to the forefront next year and make a difference for multi- asset investor positioning.\n01:00 Speaker A\nAmanda, that's good points. Uh is the sell-offs we're seeing in Oracle and CoreWeave over the past few weeks, is that the signal Amanda to investors to start lightning the load on the Mag 7?\n01:11 Amanda\nI don't know that it's necessarily a signal to start selling. Again, we're not trying to bet against that story. It's it's very secular, thematic, long runway, still very much early innings. So we're all in on it. I think just the reality of where valuations have moved to is a little bit, I don't want to say nonsensical, but I just said nonsensical.\n01:28 Amanda\nIt feel it feels like we need to recalibrate a little bit. And so I think what's happening here is some seasonality, selling some of those winners and hoping that we get another crack at it, maybe early in the new year.\n01:40 Speaker A\nInez, this is all one big fat bubble, right?\n01:44 Ines\nLook, uh Sozzi, uh like Amanda was saying, I mean, yes, there is this concentration uh and also Goldman Sachs uh just recently put out a note as well talking about that concentration for earnings growth for next year and concentrated in the largest uh S&P 500, the largest seven stocks of the S&P 500.\n02:05 Ines\nHowever, like what Amanda was just saying, there is this expectation that for the other 493, that you will see a bit of an acceleration of earnings growth for those companies as well. So there may be a little tiny bit of broadening out when it comes to that.\n02:22 Ines\nBut a lot of this of course is the AI theme that we've been talking about and this is what Wall Street has been bullish on, is this AI theme that AI uh driven productivity will also be supporting earnings.\n02:37 Speaker A\nUh important point here Brooke is that within these 10 stocks that have uh essentially taken over the S&P 500 and taken over the minds of investors. These companies have earnings, the earnings are good and they're still accelerating. So I guess to Amanda's point, it's going to be hard to bet against these names next year.\n02:53 Brooke\nBrian, but I think what the key point here that investors have really weighed in on is the future outlook of these companies, the guidance that they're putting out.\n03:02 Brooke\nAnd I think that's why we're seeing investors fall disappointed based upon what these companies say will be the end results or what exactly the end result could potentially be for revenue when it comes to all the AI investments that they're currently making, the spending that they're currently doing.\n03:20 Brooke\nAnd and that's why sometimes we're not seeing the same return that we see from other uh stocks, other investments because of the fact that these these uh guidance, these outlook that these companies put out just doesn't meet the very high bar that these investors have set for these sort of companies.\n03:42 Brooke\nAnd also, we are seeing a bit of a different fold. Over the past three months, we've seen Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet outperform the broader uh Mag 7.\n03:51 Brooke\nAnd that's largely because of the fact that investors seem to be liking the way in which these companies are now pursuing AI. And so we're seeing this bit of a uh a differ, you know, a difference in what we're seeing in these latter parts of the month than maybe earlier this year when we really saw Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as Meta really lead the way within this AI tech rally, especially over the summer months.\n\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nCA Privacy Notice\nYour Privacy Choices\nOpted out of sale / share\nMore Info",
